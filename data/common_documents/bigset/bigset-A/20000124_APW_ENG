<HEADLINE> Discontent among workers heats up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A so-called wildcat strike by more than 300 Long
Island Department of Transportation workers last week has brought to the surface
hard feelings that accumulated over the nine months their parent union has been
without a contract.
<P>
	   Union higher-ups called the strike stupid and irresponsible, and said it was
definitely not condoned.
</P>
<P>
	   Public sector employees are not allowed to strike under a 1967 statute known
as the Taylor Law.
</P>
<P>
	   However, more than 300 Department of Transportation workers called in sick
Thursday morning, potentially leaving snow to pile up on busy roadways. And
though union officials say most went to work on their own accord after being
urged to do so by shop stewards, Gov. George E. Pataki has come down hard.
</P>
<P>
	   A fuming Pataki declared a state of emergency, called in the National Guard
and sent dozens of investigators to Long Island, where they have been pulling
workers' files and conducting individual interviews to prove they, in fact,
engaged in an illegal job action.
</P>
<P>
	   And when word reached the governor that DOT workers in Westchester and
Putnam counties were considering a copycat strike over the weekend, Pataki
obtained a court order mandating that workers in both counties be notified of
$1,000-a-day fines and other penalties for not showing up to work.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will not tolerate this outrageous and cowardly strike by workers whose
first obligation is to protect public safety," Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Civil Service Employees Association bristled, characterizing the
administration's reaction as tyrannical.
</P>
<P>
	   "CSEA is standing up to the governor in a state contract fight and the
governor's now trying to slap us around," CSEA President Danny Donohue said.
"The governor needs to consider how seriously he is alienating the people who
work for him."
</P>
<P>
	   Kate Bronfen-Brenner, a Cornell University labor relations professor, said
she wasn't surprised by the Pataki-CSEA conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   "Workers in this country are fired up," she said. "The sense is there's an
economic boom and they're not benefitting."
</P>
<P>
	   What makes the situation in New York particularly acute, she said, is the
Taylor Law, which allows public-sector employees to bargain collectively but
precludes them from striking.
</P>
<P>
	   That's left the unions leaders, who have not yet reached a new contract with
the state, to protest.
</P>
<P>
	   During the governor's Jan. 6 State of the State address, several thousand
union members demonstrated outside the Capitol. There have also been several
smaller protests, including one by hundreds of workers at the State Fair in
Syracuse last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the sick-out is the only action by state employees to actually
threaten services.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think those guys down there figured it's up to them to do it themselves,"
said Patrick Ellis, who along with Bill Walsh is challenging Donohue for the
presidency of the CSEA.
</P>
<P>
	   Ballots have gone out to CSEA's 265,000 members, including 77,000 state
workers, in the race for the union's presidency. The votes will be counted
starting early next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Ellis said the snow-plowers' action is a symptom of a rift between union
leadership and the rank-and-file that has been widening since April. That's when
members, pointing to a 38 percent raise for legislators and the governor and a
state budget surplus of at least $2 billion, voted down a tentative four-year
contract worked out by CSEA negotiators calling for an overall 11 percent pay
increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, there has been more rhetoric than negotiating. The Public
Employees Federation, which, with 54,000 members is the second-largest state
employee union, has also been without a contract since April 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, who was elected governor on a platform of controlling the cost of
government, has made it a point of pride to say he has saved taxpayers $700
million a year by reducing the state workforce by 21,000 positions, mostly by
attrition. Allowing private companies to bid on contracts to perform some public
services is another part of his effort to rein in government spending.
</P>
<P>
	   In general, taxpayers expect state government to run as leanly as a
private-sector corporation, Cornell's Bronfen-Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we have here are public-sector employers acting like the private
sector and yet workers in the public sector don't have the right to take this (a
strike) on," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Wesolowski, owner of RBR Snow Contractors and Melville Snow, among Long
Island's largest commercial snow removal companies, said a private company could
likely keep roads cleared more cheaply than the state in the wake of last week's
strike.
</P>
<P>
	   Wesolowski hires freelancers, who can make $50 an hour. But there are no
medical benefits, pensions, and job security as offered by the state to
CSEA-represented plowers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here a guy may work straight through 30 or 40 hours and make nice money,"
Wesolowski said, "But we still can't compete."

<HEADLINE> McCall: I'd like to run for governor; and Lundine is backing me  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY. N.Y. (AP) - Stating that he would like to run for governor in
2002, state Comptroller H. Carl McCall says "if we can put things in place over
the next several months, then that will decide it."
<P>
	   "It all seems to be lining up that way," the New York Democrat said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall, the only black ever elected to statewide office in New York, also
said his possible bid for governor has picked up the backing of the man who was
Mario Cuomo's lieutenant governor, Stan Lundine.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm delighted to have him," McCall said. "I think given his experience in
state government, given his contacts, particularly in upstate New York, I think
he would be a valuable ally."
</P>
<P>
	   While McCall is from New York City, Lundine is a former congressman from
Jamestown in western New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Lundine's backing for McCall has special significance given that federal
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, the eldest son of Mario Cuomo, is also
considering running for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Told about the McCall-Lundine alliance, a top political adviser to the
younger Cuomo, former state Democratic Chairman John Marino, said, "We only have
good things to say about Carl."
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now, the secretary's focus is on his job and making sure we have a
Democratic president in Al Gore and a Democratic senator in Hillary Clinton,"
Marino added. "That's really what we will be focused on for the next eight or
nine months and after that, at that point, he has other decisions to make."
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, Andrew Cuomo went on a hunting excursion in central New York with
one of the state Legislature's top Democrats, Assembly Majority Leader Michael
Bragman. Interestingly, Bragman is one of four co-chairmen of the McCall for
Governor Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to announcing Lundine's support, McCall on Sunday made public a
letter from his advisory committee seeking support for the comptroller's
possible run for governor.
</P>
<P>
	   "For more than five years, New Yorkers have suffered under a Republican
administration that is more concerned about patronage and politics than people
and policy," the letter from Bragman, U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, state
Assemblyman and Bronx Democratic Chairman Roberto Ramirez and North Hempstead
Town Supervisor May Newburger said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Carl McCall has seen the problems and he's ready to solve them ... Now, we
need his leadership in the governor's office," the four said in the letter that
went to about 700 party activists and others who might be helpful to McCall.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter said the committee, along with McCall, would hold meetings with
potential supporters in Albany on March 14, New York City on March 16, Syracuse
on March 22 and Buffalo on March 23.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Gov. George Pataki, who thwarted the elder Cuomo's bid for a
fourth term in 1992, has said he may want to run for a third term himself in
2002.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall said Sunday that he has been encouraged by early indications of
possible support and said that running for governor was "a very doable thing."
</P>
<P>
	   The comptroller was considered a possible candidate for governor in 1998 and
again this year for the Senate seat now being sought by Mrs. Clinton. He backed
away from both races. McCall said Sunday that people shouldn't read anything
into his earlier hesitancy to run.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to look at every situation in terms of the timing and whether it's
the right thing to do. In the past, it wasn't," McCall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The comptroller said his decision not to run for Senate was an easy one.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't want to go to Washington and start at the bottom," he said, adding
that he would have only had about a year "to raise a lot of money."
</P>
<P>
	   McCall has already hired a veteran Democratic fund-raiser to begin putting
together his campaign warchest, something that appears badly in need of help.
Earlier this month, Pataki reported to the state Board of Elections that his
campaign committee had 2.32 million in the bank. McCall reported that his
campaign committee had less than $73,000.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall, an ordained minister, is a former Citibank vice president who has
also served as New York City's Board of Education president, as a deputy U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations and as a state senator.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall said he would probably wait until after this year's November
elections to announce his decision about running for governor.

<HEADLINE> American Beauty Wins at Globes  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Denzel Washington was not alone as he accepted
his Golden Globe for "The Hurricane" Sunday night. The boxer he portrayed in the
story of justice delayed was on stage at his side in the star-studded hotel
ballroom.
</P>
<P>
	   "This man right here is love," Washington said of Rubin "Hurricane" Carter,
who was freed after spending years in prison for three murders he did not
commit.
</P>
<P>
	   A ceremony that is often devoted to the fantasies of Hollywood, this time
chose to honor a film that exposed a story of racism and the American court
system.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything that has happened with this film and this moment is about the
love that has come from him," Washington said after being named best dramatic
movie actor.
</P>
<P>
	   "American Beauty," a dark fable of life in suburbia, won awards for best
drama, director and screenplay, while "Toy Story 2" was judged the best comedy
movie.
</P>
<P>
	   But portrayals of real people caught the attention of Golden Globe voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Carrey's uncanny impersonation of the late comic Andy Kaufman in "Man on
the Moon" earned him the Globe fore best comedy movie actor. A year ago he won
best dramatic actor for "The Truman Show."
</P>
<P>
	   "Second year in a row -- what's going on here man?" said Carrey. "I'm the
establishment I once rejected. ... I'm the Tom Hanks of the Golden Globes."
</P>
<P>
	   The best dramatic film actress Globe also emerged from a true story. Hilary
Swank won for her breakout role in "Boys Don't Cry," in which she played a young
woman who was killed after her masquerade as a man was discovered.
</P>
<P>
	   British actress Janet McTeer won best actress in a musical or comedy film
for her performance as a Southern mom in "Tumbleweeds."
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Cruise of "Magnolia" and Angelina Jolie of "Girl, Interrupted" won
motion picture supporting actor honors.
</P>
<P>
	   "All About My Mother," from Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodovar, won the
foreign-language movie award.
</P>
<P>
	   A poignant moment in the television categories came when Michael J. Fox was
named best actor for the comedy "Spin City," which he announced he is leaving
because of his fight against Parkinson's disease. But he handled it lightly.
</P>
<P>
	   "Actor out of work -- news at 11," Fox said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the television categories, cable channel HBO and its stars were big
winners.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Sopranos," which won few major awards at the Emmys last year, was named
best drama series and dramatic acting trophies went to Edie Falco and James
Gandolfini. The acclaimed mob drama also earned a supporting actress trophy for
Nancy Marchand.
</P>
<P>
	   HBO's other winners were "Sex and the City" as best TV comedy, its star
Sarah Jessica Parker as best actress, "RKO 281" as best miniseries or
made-for-TV movie, and Halle Berry as best actress in a miniseries for
"Introducing Dorothy Dandridge."
</P>
<P>
	   Among other TV winners, Jack Lemmon was named best miniseries or TV movie
actor for Showtime's "Inherit the Wind."
</P>
<P>
	   "In the spirit of Ving Rhames I'm going to give this to Jack Lemmon," Lemmon
said, lightheartedly recalling the year in which winner Rhames gave his trophy
to Lemmon.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Fonda was TV's best supporting actor, for the Showtime miniseries
"Passion of Ayn Rand."
</P>
<P>
	   "American Beauty" was the leading movie contender going into this year's
Golden Globes, a ceremony which can serve as a bellwether for the upcoming
Oscars. The film had six nominees, including actress Annette Bening and actor
Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
	   Barbra Streisand, winner of more Golden Globe trophies than any other
entertainer, including best actress for "Funny Girl" and "A Star is Born,"
received the Cecil B. DeMille Award for "outstanding contribution to the
entertainment field."
</P>
<P>
	   The tribute, which forced presenter Shirley MacLaine to vamp when the
TelePrompTer didn't work, chewed up a lengthy chunk of the slow-paced show's
last hour.
</P>
<P>
	   "Someone asked me recently if they should be an actor and I said, 'If you
have to ask then the answer is no, because the only reason to choose that life
for yourself is because you feel passionate about it, because you have no other
choice," Streisand said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some movies that received awards buzz were largely ignored. They included
"The Green Mile" starring Hanks, "Anna and the King" with Jodie Foster, and
"Angela's Ashes" starring Emily Watson. Stanley Kubrick's final film, "Eyes Wide
Shut," received just one nomination, for best score.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC broadcast this year's awards, selected by reporters from the Hollywood
Foreign Press Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden Globe shows have come to be known for bordering on the giddy.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, Jack Nicholson delivered a salty acceptance speech and
Christine Lahti took the stage with toilet paper on her shoe, a reference to the
year she was in the ladies' room when her trophy was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   The awards have gained in prestige, but they once were viewed with suspicion
because of allegations of corrupt voting and questionable professionalism.
</P>
<P>
	   The low point came in 1981, when Pia Zadora was given a statue for the bomb
"Butterfly" and networks refused to show the program. After an effort to regain
respectability, the ceremony was welcomed back by television in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, association members quickly returned pricey watches sent to them
by the company that released the Sharon Stone comedy "The Muse."
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not stupid," said association president Helmut Voss. The awards
bring the group $2 million in income and members wouldn't endanger that by
casting doubt on their integrity, he said.

<HEADLINE> Golden Globe Awards Gain Dignity  </HEADLINE>
    By BOB THOMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- For most of the past 57 years, the Golden
Globes were ridiculed, reviled, castigated and dismissed as a movie industry
joke.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet on Sunday night at the Beverly Hilton, the awards show managed to
attract the biggest stars in film and television for another outpouring of
awards.
</P>
<P>
	   Recently, the Golden Globes have become cherished because of the often
surprising happenings in an atmosphere less structured and more relaxed -- akin
to an older Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
	   Like the early Academy Awards, the Golden Globes are presented at a sit-down
dinner where the drinks flow freely. The speeches were often off-the-wall, and
the reactions startling.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Nicholson has accepted an award by mooning -- though not with his pants
down -- his fellow nominees. Robin Williams has showed his joy at a win by
grabbing his crotch.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Connors has expressed his feelings about losing the award by hurling
dinner rolls at the winner. Christine Lahti once was announced winner when she
happened to be in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Nothing so wacky happened Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   At least three of the winners made fun of the warning on the TelePrompTer to
"Please wrap up" when their acceptances got too windy. After two winners
included their drivers in their litany of thanks, it became a running gag, with
Randy Quaid cracking, "Every actor knows the importance of a good Teamster
driver."
</P>
<P>
	   But that was as zany as it got.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, some lament that the Golden Globes even have become gentrified into
a three-hour marathon on network television, with endless acceptance speeches.
</P>
<P>
	   Why do actors and filmmakers even turn out in their finery for awards that
are voted by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association -- 80 foreign
correspondents -- some with questionable credentials?
</P>
<P>
	   Timing is a factor. The Golden Globes are the first major awards, and they
have often portended the Oscars. If nominated actors and directors fail to
appear, it might indicate their lack of interest and so might sway Academy
voters negatively. Winners could trumpet their awards in newspapers and
television ads and thus influence voting.
</P>
<P>
	   It's possible the Golden Globes have prevailed because Hollywood loves a
survivor. The Hollywood Press Association has had a rocky history, including a
Federal Communications Commission investigation of possible chicanery in the
voting. That knocked the awards off NBC, and they were presented on cable for
several years.
</P>
<P>
	   The nadir was reached in 1981, when Pia Zadora was named newcomer of the
year for her bomb "Butterfly." It was revealed that association members had been
entertained at the Las Vegas hotel-casino owned by Zadora's husband, Meshulam
Riklis.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Press Association worked to clean up its act, hiring a top
accounting firm to supervise the voting and banishing excessive favors from the
studios.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, it began a multimillion-dollar contract with NBC. It now has a new
headquarters in West Hollywood and can donate hundreds of thousands of dollars
to industry charities.

<HEADLINE> Few Long Speeches at Golden Globe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- The award for longest speeches at Sunday's
Golden Globes could have gone to Shirley MacLaine, who presented the Cecil B.
DeMille award -- or to Barbra Streisand, who received it.
</P>
<P>
	   The presentation went on 24 minutes, almost a quarter of the show.
</P>
<P>
	   MacLaine's speech got off to a shaky start when the TelePrompTer that was
supposed to help her recount the life of the singer-actress-director
malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
	   "Barbara's career began at some time whenever this TelePrompTer would begin
and then I would tell you it was sometime in nineteen-what? Fifty-whatever,"
MacLaine said, stalling for time. "Where is it, guys?"
</P>
<P>
	   Quoting Streisand as "an actress who can sing," MacLaine launched into a
catalogue of her friend's film achievements, from "Funny Girl" to "A Star is
Born" to "Yentl."
</P>
<P>
	   MacLaine then talked about their shared birthdate under the astrological
Taurus sign, the star's perfectionism and, at times, even veered into the
philosophical.
</P>
<P>
	   "Your honesty is your truth to be sure," she said, "but you fill it with
such incandescent insight that you help to actually redefine any given moment."
</P>
<P>
	   Upon accepting the award, Streisand spoke almost as long as MacLaine.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's great getting awards, but it's difficult knowing just what to say,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She hit her stride, though, speaking about her career, aging publicly and
the souvenirs on her desk, sprinkling her speech with asides that drew laughter
from the audience.
</P>
<P>
	   "Somebody's cellphone just rang, I think," she said. "Isn't that terrible?"
</P>
<P>
	   She closed by noting that some famous films never won an Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't matter really how many awards something receives," she said.
"What matters is, Does it stand the test of time?"

<HEADLINE> American Beauty Wins at Globes  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH HARRIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Good luck, Oscar voters.
</P>
<P>
	   While the dark satire "American Beauty" and biopics on boxer Rubin
"Hurricane" Carter and late comic Andy Kaufman won Golden Globe awards Sunday
night, no decisive frontrunner emerged for the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
	   For "The Sopranos," meanwhile, the embarrassing rubout at the September
Emmys is history: The mobster hit on HBO won best television drama and three
acting awards.
</P>
<P>
	   "American Beauty" led the motion picture categories with three awards --
best film drama, best director (Sam Mendes) and best screenplay (Alan Ball). But
its stars, Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey, were shut out in the acting
categories.
</P>
<P>
	   "There wasn't one clear-cut film that stood out," said "American Beauty"
co-producer Bruce Cohen.
</P>
<P>
	   The Golden Globe winners often provide a good indicator of upcoming Oscar
nominations, which are scheduled to be announced Feb. 15. This year, the Golden
Globes favored projects which were based on true stories.
</P>
<P>
	   Denzel Washington won best dramatic actor for his role as a boxer wrongly
convicted of murder in "The Hurricane." He was accompanied to the stage at the
Beverly Hilton hotel by the real "Hurricane," Carter.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't say enough that this was really about Rubin," Washington said
backstage. "This is a man who had a lot of hate in him and now he's pure love."
</P>
<P>
	   Hilary Swank won dramatic actress honors for "Boys Don't Cry," the
reality-based story of a Nebraska teen-ager who was killed after her masquerade
as a man was uncovered.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's amazing when you get recognition for your work in a movie that you're
so proud to be a part of," Swank said. "It's a very important story and it's
just amazing to me that people are embracing it."
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Carrey was named best movie comedy actor for his uncanny impersonation
of Kaufman in the movie "Man on the Moon." Carrey also won a Globe last year for
best dramatic actor in "The Truman Show."
</P>
<P>
	   "I sit around sometimes still and go, 'There will never be another like
that,"' Carrey said backstage of the Kaufman role. "I've never thrown myself
into something so drastically. I've never had a real person and real character
to study. It was like being a detective."
</P>
<P>
	   Halle Berry also won for best actress in a TV miniseries for "Introducing
Dorothy Dandridge," the first black woman to be nominated for a best actress
Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
	   Janet McTeer, a British actress who played a Southern mom in "Tumbleweeds,"
won best actress in a musical or comedy film. Tom Cruise of "Magnolia" and
Angelina Jolie of "Girl, Interrupted" won motion picture supporting actor
honors.
</P>
<P>
	   Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodovar won the foreign language movie award for
"All About My Mother."
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't prepare anything and I don't speak English so it doesn't matter,"
a smiling Almodovar said. "Just look at me and see how happy I am."
</P>
<P>
	   Cable channel HBO dominated the television categories, winning eight of 11
awards.
</P>
<P>
	   Virtually overlooked at the Emmys last year, "The Sopranos" was named best
drama series. It also nabbed dramatic acting trophies for Edie Falco and James
Gandolfini and supporting actress Nancy Marchand.
</P>
<P>
	   HBO's other winners were "Sex and the City" as best TV comedy, its star
Sarah Jessica Parker as best actress and "RKO 281" as best miniseries or made
for TV movie.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael J. Fox was named best comedy series actor for "Spin City," which he
is leaving because of his fight with Parkinson's disease. But he handled it
lightly.
</P>
<P>
	   "Actor out of work -- news at 11," Fox said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other TV winners, Jack Lemmon was named best miniseries or TV movie
actor for Showtime's "Inherit the Wind" and Peter Fonda was best supporting
actor for the Showtime miniseries "Passion of Ayn Rand."
</P>
<P>
	   Barbra Streisand, winner of more Golden Globe trophies than any other
entertainer, including best actress for "Funny Girl" and "A Star is Born,"
received the Cecil B. DeMille Award for "outstanding contribution to the
entertainment field."
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been called many names like perfectionist, difficult and obsessive. I
think it takes obsession, takes searching for the details for any artist to be
good," she said backstage. "It's easy to be sort of good. If you care so much
you kind of get punished for it."
</P>
<P>
	   The annual awards were selected by reporters from the Hollywood Foreign
Press Association.

<HEADLINE> Golden Globe Awards Gain Dignity  </HEADLINE>
    By BOB THOMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- For most of the past 57 years, the Golden
Globes were ridiculed, reviled, castigated and dismissed as a movie industry
joke.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet on Sunday night at the Beverly Hilton, the awards show managed to
attract the biggest stars in film and television for another outpouring of
awards.
</P>
<P>
	   Recently, the Golden Globes have become cherished because of the often
surprising happenings in an atmosphere less structured and more relaxed -- akin
to an older Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
	   Like the early Academy Awards, the Golden Globes are presented at a sit-down
dinner where the drinks flow freely. The speeches were often off-the-wall, and
the reactions startling.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Nicholson has accepted an award by mooning -- though not with his pants
down -- his fellow nominees. Robin Williams has showed his joy at a win by
grabbing his crotch.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Connors has expressed his feelings about losing the award by hurling
dinner rolls at the winner. Christine Lahti once was announced winner when she
happened to be in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Nothing so wacky happened Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   At least three of the winners made fun of the warning on the TelePrompTer to
"Please wrap up" when their acceptances got too windy. After two winners
included their drivers in their litany of thanks, it became a running gag, with
Dennis Quaid cracking, "Every actor knows the importance of a good Teamster
driver."
</P>
<P>
	   But that was as zany as it got.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, some lament that the Golden Globes even have become gentrified into
a three-hour marathon on network television, with endless acceptance speeches.
</P>
<P>
	   Why do actors and filmmakers even turn out in their finery for awards that
are voted by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association -- 80 foreign
correspondents -- some with questionable credentials?
</P>
<P>
	   Timing is a factor. The Golden Globes are the first major awards, and they
have often portended the Oscars. If nominated actors and directors fail to
appear, it might indicate their lack of interest and so might sway Academy
voters negatively. Winners could trumpet their awards in newspapers and
television ads and thus influence voting.
</P>
<P>
	   It's possible the Golden Globes have prevailed because Hollywood loves a
survivor. The Hollywood Press Association has had a rocky history, including a
Federal Communications Commission investigation of possible chicanery in the
voting. That knocked the awards off NBC, and they were presented on cable for
several years.
</P>
<P>
	   The nadir was reached in 1981, when Pia Zadora was named newcomer of the
year for her bomb "Butterfly." It was revealed that association members had been
entertained at the Las Vegas hotel-casino owned by Zadora's husband, Meshulam
Riklis.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Press Association worked to clean up its act, hiring a top
accounting firm to supervise the voting and banishing excessive favors from the
studios.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, it began a multimillion-dollar contract with NBC. It now has a new
headquarters in West Hollywood and can donate hundreds of thousands of dollars

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened sharply higher today as the latest round of
strong corporate earnings reports lifted investors' optimism about technology
and blue-chip companies alike.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 71.05 at 11,322.76.

<HEADLINE> Court Allows $22M Award to Ore. Man  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to free a pharmaceutical
company from having to pay $22 million because an Oregon man went blind after
taking medicine for his heart.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal in which American Home
Products Corp.'s lawyers said a jury's award of $20 million in punitive damages
-- aimed at punishing and deterring misconduct -- violated the Constitution's
ban on excessive fines.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that the ban on excessive fines does not
apply to punitive damages awarded to private citizens, but under Oregon law
nearly half of the $20 million in punitive damages won by heart patient Douglas
Axen would go to the state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly, the Eighth Amendment intended that if a state ... chooses by
statute to profit from money extracted by its courts as punishment, it cannot
escape the substantive protection against excessive fines,'' the appeal argued.
</P>
<P>
	   Axen was 56 when in August 1994 he began taking the drug amiodarone,
marketed under the brand name Cordarone by American Home Products'
pharmaceutical division, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
	   Within a month, he began noticing changes in his vision.
</P>
<P>
	   Cordarone had been on the market since 1985, when the Food and Drug
Administration had approved the drug for medical use. But beginning in 1986,
medical studies linked amiodarone with vision loss and optic neuropathy.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, a package insert listed ``optic neuritis'' -- optic nerve
inflammation -- as a rare side effect. The insert did not list permanent vision
loss as a possible side effect, and did not recommend regular eye examinations
while using the drug.
</P>
<P>
	   By October of 1994, Axen suffered from optic nerve swelling and hemorrhaging
in each eye. He stopped taking Cordarone that November but his vision continued
to deteriorate until he became legally blind.
</P>
<P>
	   Axen sued in a Multnomah County, Ore., court and in 1997 won $407,000 in
economic damages, $1.5 million for pain and suffering, and $20 million in
punitive damages. The jury also awarded his wife, Sandra, $936,000 in damages
but that amount later was reduced to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeal acted on today challenged only the punitive-damages award, which
was first upheld by the state Court of Appeals and then left intact by the
Oregon Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court cited ``clear and convincing evidence'' to conclude that
American Home Products ``had acted with extraordinary disregard of, or
indifference to, known or highly probable risks to others.''
</P>
<P>
	   When Axen won his award, a state law required that 50 percent of all
punitive-damages awards, minus attorney fees, be paid to the state's Criminal
Injuries Compensation Account.
</P>
<P>
	   In urging the justices to reject American Home Products' appeal, lawyers for
Axen noted that Oregon's award-splitting law has been struck down by a state
trial judge for violating the rights of the private citizens who win
punitive-damages awards.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the ruling .... is affirmed on appeal, Oregon's Criminal Injuries
Compensation Account will have no right to share in punitive damages awarded to
a private party to a civil action. In that event, the excessive-fines issue ...
will be moot,'' Axen's lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for American Home Products disagreed, and said Oregon authorities
are continuing to enforce the award-splitting law while appealing the trial
judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is American Home Products Corp. vs. Oregon, 99-784.

<HEADLINE> Congress Returns to Work  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is returning for a session in which patients'
rights, prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, gun control and tax cuts
will be debated against a background of election-year politicking.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the House and Senate were convening today for the second half of the
106th Congress, although there will be little action until President Clinton
delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate has its first vote Wednesday, on whether to cut off debate on
legislation -- pending from the end of the last session -- that would make it
tougher for people to erase their debts in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
	   The House has no votes scheduled this week. But there is a possibility that
it could take up proposals to grant citizenship or U.S. residency to Elian
Gonzalez, the Cuban boy at the center of a custody battle between U.S. and Cuban
relatives, said John Feehery, spokesman for Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   John Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
said the issue of the Cuban boy could also come before the Senate as early as
Wednesday, depending on the outcome of the bankruptcy vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Feehery said the first items the House will take up beginning next week are
GOP-backed plans to cut taxes, led off by a bill that would reduce the penalty
paid by some two-earner married couples filing jointly. Other tax plans expected
to see early action are one that would give tax credits to parents saving for
their children's education and a proposal, supported by the White House, to give
tax breaks for investments in the nation's neediest communities.
</P>
<P>
	   Also up for early House consideration is a measure, opposed by the
administration, that would strengthen U.S.-Taiwanese security ties. The Senate
may also return to legislation to establish a temporary storage site for nuclear
power plant waste.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate Banking Committee meets Wednesday to consider the renomination of
Alan Greenspan to a fourth term as Federal Reserve chairman, and the Senate
health committee will hear testimony on how to reduce medical errors and on
Labor Department regulations governing people who work from their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   The new session opened with the defection of Rep. Virgil Goode, a
second-term conservative Democrat from Virginia. His office said Goode, whose
departure from the party was not a surprise, intends to become an independent.
</P>
<P>
	   He would join the House's only current independent, Rep. Bernie Sanders of
Vermont, a liberal who usually votes with the Democrats. The House alignment
would become 222 Republicans, 211 Democrats and two independents. Republicans
hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Court Backs Local Election Changes  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today limited the federal government's
authority to squelch changes in state and local elections as discriminatory when
the new plans would leave racial and ethnic minorities no worse off.
</P>
<P>
	   By a 5-4 vote in a Louisiana case, the justices said the necessary federal
approval of such changes cannot be withheld when new election district lines
fail, for discriminatory reasons, to make things better.
</P>
<P>
	   The court upheld the current system of electing the Bossier Parish, La.,
school board's 12 members. In doing so, the justices clarified -- and refused to
extend -- federal authority to reject proposed election system changes in states
and counties covered by the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   Government clearance of election changes has a ``limited meaning'' and ``is
nothing more than a determination that the voting change is no more dilutive
than what it replaces, and therefore cannot be stopped in advance'' under one
section of the Voting Rights Act, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
	   That section of the law ``prevents nothing but backsliding, and preclearance
under (the law) affirms nothing but the absence of backsliding,'' Scalia wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   After an election change is cleared, it still can be challenged under
another section of the voting rights law, Scalia wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   No other school board election is planned until the current system gets
revamped after the 2000 but the court said that fact did not render the dispute
moot, or legally irrelevant. That plan will serve as a baseline for evaluating
the next voting plan, the court said.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was a tough one for the justices to decide. They twice heard
arguments in it. After a first argument last April, the court ordered lawyers
for both sides back to reargue it in October.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bossier Parish school board for years has had its members elected to
four-year terms from 12 different districts. About 20 percent of the parish's
population is black, concentrated in two areas, but none of the 12 districts has
a black majority.
</P>
<P>
	   As of 1990, no black had ever been elected to the school board.
</P>
<P>
	   After the 1990 census required a redrawing of the school board election map,
the local NAACP chapter proposed creating two black-majority districts. The
school board opted instead for a new map in 1992 with no such district, the same
map that had been adopted by the parish's chief governing body, called the
police jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though the police jury's plan had received Justice Department approval
required by the 1965 law, the school board's proposed redistricting plan did
not. Government lawyers decided the plan would dilute minority voting strength
because it would not maximize it as would a plan containing two black-majority
districts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Voting Rights Act's Section 5 allows the federal government to veto
proposed changes if they are deemed to have a discriminatory ``purpose or
effect.'' The act's Section 2 is more stringent, and prohibits any voting
practice that would dilute minority voters' clout.
</P>
<P>
	   In a 1997 decision involving the same Bossier Parish dispute, the nation's
highest court said Justice Department lawyers cannot refuse to approve a
proposal under Section 5 by deciding that the change would violate Section 2.
The court said then that a proposed change has a prohibited ``effect'' only if
it would be retrogressive -- leaving minority voters worse off than they are
under a current election system.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Scalia said, ``This explains why the sole consequence of failing to
obtain preclearance is continuation of the status quo. To deny preclearance to a
plan that is not retrogressive -- no matter how unconstitutional it may be --
would risk leaving in effect a status quo that is even worse.''
</P>
<P>
	   His opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
	   Dissenting were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
	   Writing for the four, Souter said, ``The behavior of Bossier Parish is a
plain effort to deny the voting equality that the Constitution just as plainly
guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now executive and judicial officers of the United States will be forced to
preclear illegal and unconstitutional voting schemes patently intended to
perpetuate discrimination,'' Souter added.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Louisiana case wended its way through federal courts, two black
candidates were elected to the 12-member school board in 1994 and were
re-elected in 1998, along with a third black candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Reno vs. Bossier Parish School Board, 98-405.

<HEADLINE> Va. Rep. Goode Leaving Democrats  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Virgil Goode, a second-term conservative Democrat
from Virginia, intends to become an independent, his office said today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He told the staff this morning he is running as an independent,'' said an
aide, Linwood Duncan.
</P>
<P>
	   Duncan said the lawmaker was personally faxing an announcement about his
decision from his campaign office in Virginia. He represents the state's 5th
District, which runs from Charlottesville to the tobacco-growing ``Southside.''
</P>
<P>
	   The second-term congressman had informed associates of his plans Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Goode's decision represents a triumph for Republicans, although it was not
clear whether he would seek to align himself with the GOP in any official way.
His decision could jeopardize Democrats' hopes of regaining control of the House
in this year's election.
</P>
<P>
	   With Goode's defection, Republicans will hold a 222-211 majority in the
House, with two independents, Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and Goode. Sanders
is closely aligned with the Democrats, who protect his committee assignments.
</P>
<P>
	   Party switches are unusual in Congress, although there have been several in
the years since the Republicans won control of the House in the 1994 elections.
Five House Democrats switched to the GOP over a period of several months in 1995
and 1996. The most recent change of parties came last summer, when a Republican,
Rep. Michael Forbes of New York, became a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   Goode (rhymes with food), 53, was first elected to Congress in 1996 after
serving in the Virginia Legislature. Democrats cheered his election, despite his
strongly conservative voting record, since his victory meant they had kept yet
another Southern seat from falling into the hands of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Rumors of Goode's disaffection with the Democrats began circulating within
months, and Republicans courted him actively. A fellow Virginian, Rep. Tom
Davis, is chairman of the House GOP campaign committee, and he has publicly
advocated giving Goode a coveted seat on the House Appropriations Committee if
he switched to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
	   He twice sought the Democratic nomination to the Senate, in 1982 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Goode, a lawyer, was given a rating of 84 by the American Conservative Union
for his votes in 1997 and an 83 in 1998. He voted against President Clinton's
agenda 68 percent of the time in 1997 and 74 percent of the time in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Among key votes in 1998, Goode voted for three counts of impeachment against
Clinton; against granting the president fast-track trade negotiating authority;
and for a Republican overhaul of managed heath care.
</P>
<P>
	   After Goode's votes to impeach Clinton, Democrats responded by not inviting
him to help put on a reception at the state party's major annual fund-raising
dinner in Richmond. Earlier this month he rejected an invitation to speak at the
party's Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner. And just last month Goode attended a
fund-raising for Republican George Allen, a Republican who is running against
Democratic Sen. Charles Robb.
</P>
<P>
	   Goode's district went against Clinton in both his elections.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Suspect Extradition Allowed  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Rwandan minister accused of participating in genocide
in his homeland lost a Supreme Court appeal today, freeing U.S. officials to
hand him over to a war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   The court, without comment, turned away Elizaphan Ntakirutimana's argument
that he cannot be extradited to stand trial before the United Nations'
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda because no treaty authorizes it.
</P>
<P>
	   Ntakirutimana, 75, was pastor of a Seventh-Day Adventist church in Rwanda
when in 1994 Hutu extremists killed more than 500,000 people, mostly minority
Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses say Ntakirutimana urged a large, mostly Tutsi group of men, women
and children to seek refuge in a church and hospital complex, then took part in
a day-long gun and machete attack on the Tutsis that left hundreds of people
dead.
</P>
<P>
	   In a second alleged incident, he is accused of providing food and drink to
armed attackers and instructing them to kill Tutsis. One witness reported seeing
Ntakirutimana shooting at Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
	   He was arrested in 1996 in Laredo, Texas, where his son lives. He had moved
there legally with a permanent resident visa.
</P>
<P>
	   Although there is no extradition treaty between the United States and the
U.N. tribunal, Congress passed a 1996 law that allows Ntakirutimana's
extradition.
</P>
<P>
	   The government, acting on the tribunal's behalf, asked a judge to order
Ntakirutimana's surrender. The request was denied, but after the government
filed a new request with more evidence, a second judge ordered him turned over
to the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision last August.
People can be surrendered to a formal court either through a treaty or a federal
law, the appeals court ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   In the appeal acted on today, Ntakirutimana's lawyers said a treaty is
required for extradition to a foreign court. They also contended that he
``should not be surrendered to face a trial that will inevitably be unfair''
because of difficulty in obtaining witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton administration lawyers urged the justices to reject the appeal,
saying that the appeals court ruled correctly that extradition can be authorized
by a law and in the absence of a treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Ntakirutimana vs. Reno, 99-479.

<HEADLINE> Court Allows Platter Forfeiture  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected the appeal of a New York
man whose antique Italian gold platter was confiscated by the government over a
false statement on a customs form.
</P>
<P>
	   The court, without comment, turned away arguments that forfeiture was an
excessive punishment and violated his due-process rights because someone else
was responsible for filling out the customs form.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael H. Steinhardt, an investment fund manager and antique collector,
agreed in December 1991 to buy a 4th Century B.C. antique gold platter of
Sicilian origin for $1.2 million from a Swiss art dealer.
</P>
<P>
	   A New York City art dealer who acted as intermediary brought the platter
from Switzerland to New York. A customs broker prepared an entry form that
listed the platter's country of origin as Switzerland and its value at $250,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Four years later, the Italian government sought help from the U.S.
government in recovering the platter. Italian law presumes that antique items
belong to the government unless they were privately owned before 1902.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Customs agents seized the platter from Steinhardt's home in 1995, and
the government began forfeiture proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge ordered the platter forfeited on grounds it was illegally
imported because the customs form falsely said it was from Switzerland. The
judge said the platter belonged to Italy and therefore should be considered
stolen.
</P>
<P>
	   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling based on the false
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   In the appeal acted on today, Steinhardt's lawyers said the appeals court
should have required proof that the platter would not have been allowed into the
country if the customs form had been correct. Instead, they said, the appeals
court required a lesser showing that the false statement would tend to influence
customs officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Steinhardt's lawyers also said forfeiting the platter was an excessive fine
and violated his due-process rights because he was an innocent party.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department lawyers urged the justices to reject the appeal. They
said Italy was harmed ``by the loss of a valuable antique artifact'' and that
the purpose of the forfeiture was to return the antique to that country.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Steinhardt vs. U.S., 99-641.

<HEADLINE> Court Backs States on Contributions  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today reaffirmed states' sweeping power
to deter corruption by imposing limits on campaign contributions to political
candidates. The decision removed any doubts over the continued legitimacy of the
$1,000 cap on contributions to federal candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said Missouri did not violate free-speech
rights when it capped individual contributions at $1,075 for state races.
</P>
<P>
	   About two-thirds of the states impose campaign contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal appeals court had struck down Missouri's limits, but today's
decision reversed that ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The new decision comes in an election year in which more than $3 billion is
expected to be spent for candidates for federal offices, including the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   In other action, the court:
</P>
<P>
	   --Ruled, by a 5-4 vote in a Louisiana case, that federal authorities cannot
squelch changes in state and local elections as discriminatory when the new
plans would leave racial and ethnic minorities no worse off.
</P>
<P>
	   --Refused to free Democratic fund-raiser Maria Hsia from charges that she
hid illegal contributions to the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   --Rejected an appeal by a pharmaceutical company ordered to pay $22 million
because an Oregon man went blind after taking medicine for his heart. American
Home Products Corp.'s lawyers said a jury's award of $20 million in punitive
damages -- aimed at punishing and deterring misconduct -- violated the
Constitution's ban on excessive fines.
</P>
<P>
	   --Turned away the appeal of a Rwandan minister accused of participating in
genocide in his homeland. U.S. officials can hand Elizaphan Ntakirutimana over
to a war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Clarence Thomas was missing from the bench today following the death
Sunday of his brother, Meyers, in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's highest court had not ruled on contribution limits since 1976,
when in a landmark decision called Buckley vs. Valeo it said free-speech rights
trump any attempt to limit an individual candidate's spending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The principal issues in this case are whether Buckley vs. Valeo ... is
authority for state limits on contributions to state political candidates and
whether the federal limits approved in Buckley, with or without adjustment for
inflation, define the scope of permissible state limitations today,'' Justice
David H. Souter wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We hold Buckley to be authority for comparable state regulations, which
need not be pegged to Buckley's dollars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Left unaffected by today's decision is currently unregulated ``soft money''
-- contributions made to groups that spend money without any ties to specific
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1976 decision drew a distinction between spending, which it said could
not be capped, and contributions, for which it upheld the current $1,000 limit
on individual contributions in federal elections.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1976 ruling focused on a federal law enacted after the Watergate scandal
of the early 1970s. The Missouri limits -- also $1,000 before adjusted to $1,075
-- were not imposed until 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Missouri's limits must fall
because inflation had eroded their fairness and because state officials had not
proved that larger donations would corrupt elections.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court had been told that $1,075 in today's dollars amounted to
only $378 in 1976 dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   But Souter referred to conflicting views on the effect of large political
contributions and said, ``There is little reason to doubt that sometimes large
contributions will work actual corruption on our political system, and no reason
to question the existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters.''
</P>
<P>
	   He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul
Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Antonin Scalia dissented.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The court's decision has lasting consequences for political speech in the
course of elections, the speech upon which democracy depends,'' Kennedy said in
a dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   But Stevens, confronting Kennedy's rationale in a separate opinion, said,
``Money is property; it is not speech.''
</P>
<P>
	   Writing for himself and Scalia, Thomas said, ``Buckley was in error and I
would overrule it. I would subject campaign contribution limits to strict
scrutiny, under which Missouri's contribution limits are patently
unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
	   The state's limits had been challenged by Bevis Schock, a St. Louis lawyer
who founded a political action committee called Shrink Missouri Government. He
balked at the limits imposed on his contributions to candidates who support
small government.
</P>
<P>
	   Schock wanted to give more than the legal limit to his friend Zev David
Fredman, an unsuccessful candidate in the Republican primary for state auditor
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   When the case was argued before the justices in October, they appeared
deeply split.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, Souter said, ``Most people assume -- I do certainly -- that
someone making an extraordinarily large contribution is going to get something
extraordinary in return.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Scalia extolled a wealthy man's right ``to participate in the democratic
process as fully as he is able.''
</P>
<P>
	   In defending Missouri's law, state Attorney General Jay Nixon warned the
court that ending or severely weakening contribution limits would lead most
Americans ``to believe that their government is literally for sale.''
</P>
<P>
	   But D. Bruce La Pierre, a St. Louis lawyer representing the Shrink Missouri
Government PAC, said, ``We can try trusting the American people'' to decide when
political candidates are taking too much money from any one contributor.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Nixon vs. Shrink Missouri Government, 98-963.

<HEADLINE> Report Ponders Amtrak Independence  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An independent commission studying Amtrak released an
initial report today questioning whether the passenger railroad can wean itself
from federal aid after three decades of subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Amtrak Reform Council said Amtrak may be using faulty accounting methods
to determine its bottom line. If the railroad is forced to change its
calculations it could fall short of meeting a congressional mandate for
self-sufficiency by the end of the 2003 fiscal year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a very important conflict at this point that we have to resolve,''
said Gil Carmichael, chairman of the council.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak says it is on track to meet the deadline, but the council report said
the railroad's revenue projections do not include equipment depreciation and
overhaul costs that will total $567 million in 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak did not include those costs in its 1999 financial report, which said
the railroad was $484 million short of self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
	   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, applied a
standard corporate measurement -- overall revenue minus overall expenses -- that
included the costs and came up with a $907 million operating loss for Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak officials say Congress does not require it to use standard accounting
rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The council is expected to decide later which accounting method should be
used to determine the railroad's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress in 1997 approved billions of dollars in support for Amtrak but
declared that government operating subsidies would end after five years. It
created the reform council to keep track of the railroad's efforts toward that
goal.
</P>
<P>
	   In anticipation of today's report, Amtrak officials issued a news release
Sunday trumpeting strong quarterly revenues and announcing a start date for the
railroad's long-anticipated high-speed service between Boston and New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak said its new Acela Regional service will begin Jan. 31 with a
celebration at Boston's South Station. The Boston-New York City trip, which now
takes about five hours, will drop to just under four.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue in the quarter ended Dec. 31 was 8 percent higher than last year,
Amtrak said. It also boasted of significant growth in ridership on its
Chicago-to-Los Angeles ``Texas Eagle'' route and its Oakland-to-Sacramento
``Capitols'' route in California.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rose today, but blue-chip shares gave up
an early advance as Procter &AMP; Gamble tumbled, puncturing some of the strength
created by corporate earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
	   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
43.12 at 11,208.59. The index was up more than 70 points in earlier trading.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 5.57 at 1,446.93, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 19.17 at 4,254.57.
The technology-driven Nasdaq set new closing records in the last three sessions
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose at the opening bell as investors rewarded companies for strong
earnings reports. Eastman Kodak rose 3 9/16 to 64 5/16 after reporting that it
earned $1.27 per share in the fourth quarter, beating analysts' estimates of
$1.24. Kodak, which has faltered in recent years due to tougher competition from
Fuji, also issued a strong outlook for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble fell steeply for a fourth consecutive session, dropping 6
7/8 to 96 3/8. The consumer products giant is said to be preparing a bid for
Warner-Lambert and American Home Products The deal would be one of the largest
takeover bids in history, and many shareholders believe it would hurt Procter &AMP;
Gamble's stock price.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks continued to flourish. Intel rose 5 3/8 to 103 5/16.
Amazon.com gained 8 17/32 to 70 19/32 after Goldman Sachs raised its rating on
the stock to "trading buy" from "market outperform." Also, Amazon.com announced
that Drugstore.com will pay it $105 million over three years in return for a
featured spot on the Amazon.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   The divergence of the market continued last week's trend, when blue-chip
stocks lost the strength demonstrated early in the year and technology stocks
once again sprinted higher.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rotation in this market has seen little follow-through," said Phil
Erlanger, who runs Phil Erlanger Research Co. in Acton, Mass. "We are currently
left with the old faithfuls as leaders -- technology and health technology."
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner, fresh from its $145 billion merger with America Online, slipped
2 to 89 1/8 after announcing plans to merge its music business with British
music company EMI Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues were nearly even with decliners on the New York Stock
Exchange, where volume came to 341.44 million shares, behind Friday's early
pace.

<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose for a seventh straight

<HEADLINE> Clinton Targets Male-Female Pay Gap  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is seeking $27 million to help close
the earnings gap between men and women and beef up enforcement of equal-pay
laws. ``This is about the value of work,'' he said. ``This is about the values
of our country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was joined at a White House event by soccer star Michelle Akers, who
with her teammates has been boycotting training because of a compensation
dispute that erupted after the U.S. women's World Cup championship last season.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Over the past years, women's sports and the view of women has changed a
ton,'' she said. ``However, ... the battle is not over. We are still being
discriminated against. We still are not paid equally for the amount of work that
we do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Women earn an average of 75 cents for every $1 men are paid, a disparity
Clinton has noted in the past as evidence of social injustice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make sure that in every field of endeavor, everyone knows that
those who work hard and play by the rules will have the chance to make the most
of their abilities,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the $27 million plan to close the wage gap, Clinton will seek $10
million for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to train up to 3,000
employers about equal pay laws and 1,000 staff inspectors.
</P>
<P>
	   A similar, $14 million initiative failed in Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
	   It would represent the first time since the EEOC took responsibility for
enforcement of equal-pay laws in 1998 that the agency had money to train
inspectors in the area. The agency also would produce public service
announcements on the subject.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department would receive $17 million to help train women for jobs
where they have been underrepresented, particularly in the high-technology
sector, through career centers the department supports and apprenticeships. The
department also would help employers improve their pay policies and strengthen
public-private partnerships.
</P>
<P>
	   Additionally, Clinton wants Congress to pass the ``paycheck fairness act,''
sponsored by Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Rep. Rosa DeLauro,
D-Conn., which would strengthen laws prohibiting wage discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   That bill, which failed in the last legislative session, would direct
federal agencies to collect data about wage disparities and increase penalties
for violating equal-pay statutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Akers and her soccer teammates want raises from $3,150 per month to $5,000
plus bonuses of $2,000 game. Despite their championship, the women say, they are
paid less than men who play soccer for the United States. A bargaining session
was scheduled today in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Hank Steinbrecher, executive director of the U.S. Soccer Federation, has
said that because most of the men play with professional clubs, they are paid by
the USSF only for short periods before games and tournaments. The U.S. women do
not have pro clubs or team contracts and are together longer, costing the USSF
more for their housing, food and travel.

<HEADLINE> Court Dismisses Electric Chair Case  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today backed out of deciding whether
death in Florida's electric chair is a type of ``cruel and unusual punishment''
the Constitution forbids.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices had agreed last October to use a challenge to Florida's death
penalty law to decide the issue. But that was when electrocution was the only
method used by the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The Florida Legislature last week passed new legislation providing for death
by injection unless an inmate prefers the electric chair, and Gov. Jeb Bush
signed it into law.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices today dismissed as moot, or legally irrelevant, the case they
had been studying.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida Attorney General Robert Butterworth had suggested such action in a
Jan. 13 letter to the justices.
</P>
<P>
	   In the dismissed case, convicted murderer Anthony Bryan had argued that
execution in Florida's electric chair, called ``Old Sparky,'' violates the
Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. He now can opt for death
by injection, but Bryan's lawyer opposed Butterworth's effort to get the case
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The new legislation ... cannot be applied retroactively to Mr. Bryan or
other persons sentenced to death for crimes committed before the effective date
... unless and until a settled rule of Florida constitutional law is changed to
permit this result,'' Brooklyn, N.Y., lawyer Martin McClain told the justices in
a recent letter.
</P>
<P>
	   But today's brief order washing out the case that was to be argued next
month said the court was relying on ``the representation by the state of Florida
... that (Bryan's) death sentence will be carried out by lethal injection unless
(he) affirmatively elects death by electrocution.''
</P>
<P>
	   Florida was one of just four states that require condemned killers to be
executed by electrocution. Now, only three states -- Alabama, Georgia and
Nebraska -- have such laws. The issue may return to the nation's highest court
in a case from one of those states.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the 38 states with death penalty laws have switched since 1950 to
lethal injection as the primary means of execution. Once, a peak of 26 states
used electric chairs.
</P>
<P>
	   The last man to die in Florida's electric chair was triple-murderer Allen
``Tiny'' Davis, whose execution in July was marked by a flow of blood from his
nose onto his chest. He may also have been partially suffocated before he was
electrocuted because of the placement of a leather mouthpiece across his face.
</P>
<P>
	   His death was preceded by problems in 1990 and 1997, when flames erupted
from the headpiece worn by two other condemned Florida killers.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Bryan vs. Moore, 99-6723.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rose today, but blue-chip shares gave up
an early advance as Procter &AMP; Gamble tumbled, puncturing some of the strength
created by corporate earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
27.61 at 11,224.10. The index was up more than 70 points in earlier trading.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 5.37 at 1,435.99, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 18.59 at 4,253.99.
The technology-driven Nasdaq set new closing records in the last three sessions
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose at the opening bell as investors rewarded companies for strong
earnings reports. Eastman Kodak rose 2 13/16 to 63 9/16 after reporting it
earned $1.27 per share in the fourth quarter, beating analysts' estimates of
$1.24. Kodak, which has faltered in recent years due to tougher competition from
Fuji, also issued a strong outlook for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble fell steeply for a fourth consecutive session, dropping 4
1/4 to 98 7/16 amid continuing rumors that it was preparing a bid for
Warner-Lambert and American Home Products. At midday, Procter &AMP; Gamble said it
had called off talks, citing leaks and speculation.
</P>
<P>
	   Rumors of deal had hammered Procter &AMP; Gamble's share price, as many
shareholders believed the company would have to issue significant amounts of new
stock to pay for the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks continued to flourish. Intel rose 5 3/8 to 103 5/16.
Amazon.com gained 9 11/16 to 71 3/4 after Goldman Sachs raised its rating on the
stock to "trading buy" from "market outperform." Also, Amazon.com announced that
Drugstore.com will pay it $105 million over three years in return for a featured
spot on the Amazon.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   The divergence of the market continued last week's trend, when blue-chip
stocks lost the strength demonstrated early in the year and technology stocks
once again sprinted higher.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rotation in this market has seen little follow-through," said Phil
Erlanger, who runs Phil Erlanger Research Co. in Acton, Mass. "We are currently
left with the old faithfuls as leaders -- technology and health technology."
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner, fresh from its $145 billion merger with America Online, slipped
2 to 89 1/8 after announcing plans to merge its music business with British
music company EMI Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues were nearly even with decliners on the New York Stock
Exchange, where volume came to 484.81 million shares, behind Friday's midday
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose for a seventh straight
session, gaining 2.17 to 536.11.

<HEADLINE> Congress Returns to Work  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is returning for a session in which patients'
rights, prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, gun control and tax cuts
will be debated against a background of election-year politicking.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the House and Senate convened today for the second half of the 106th
Congress, although there will be little action until President Clinton delivers
his State of the Union address to a joint session Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody seems to be in good spirits and ready to go to work,'' said
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   But Democrats quickly picked up the political sniping that characterized the
first year of the session ending last November. ``This House will complete month
one of the new millennium with no action either on this floor or in committee on
any of the major issues that this country faces,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett,
D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate has its first vote Wednesday, on whether to cut off debate on
legislation -- pending from the end of the last session -- that would make it
tougher for people to erase their debts in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
	   The House has no votes scheduled this week. But there is a possibility that
it could take up proposals to grant citizenship or U.S. residency to Elian
Gonzalez, the Cuban boy at the center of a custody battle between U.S. and Cuban
relatives, said John Feehery, spokesman for Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   John Czwartacki, spokesman for Lott, said the issue of the Cuban boy could
also come before the Senate as early as Wednesday, depending on the outcome of
the bankruptcy vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Feehery said the first items the House will take up beginning next week are
GOP-backed plans to cut taxes, led off by a bill that would reduce the penalty
paid by some two-earner married couples filing jointly. Other tax plans expected
to see early action are one that would give tax credits to parents saving for
their children's education and a proposal, supported by the White House, to give
tax breaks for investments in the nation's neediest communities.
</P>
<P>
	   Also up for early House consideration is a measure, opposed by the
administration, that would strengthen U.S.-Taiwanese security ties. The Senate
may also return to legislation to establish a temporary storage site for nuclear
power plant waste.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate Banking Committee meets Wednesday to consider the renomination of
Alan Greenspan to a fourth term as Federal Reserve chairman, and the Senate
health committee will hear testimony on how to reduce medical errors and on
Labor Department regulations governing people who work from their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   The new session opened with the defection of Rep. Virgil Goode, a
second-term conservative Democrat from Virginia. His office said Goode, whose
departure from the party was not a surprise, intends to become an independent.
</P>
<P>
	   He would join the House's only current independent, Rep. Bernie Sanders of
Vermont, a liberal who usually votes with the Democrats. The House alignment
would become 222 Republicans, 211 Democrats and two independents. Republicans
hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Court Backs States on Contributions  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today reaffirmed states' sweeping power
to deter corruption by imposing limits on campaign contributions to political
candidates. The decision removed any doubts over the continued legitimacy of the
$1,000 cap on contributions to federal candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said Missouri did not violate free-speech
rights when it capped individual contributions at $1,075 for state races.
</P>
<P>
	   About two-thirds of the states impose campaign contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal appeals court had struck down Missouri's limits, but today's
decision reversed that ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The new decision comes in an election year in which more than $3 billion is
expected to be spent for candidates for federal offices, including the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The court's opinion is a victory for democracy,'' President Clinton said
in a statement read by White House press secretary Joe Lockhart. ``The American
people know that our political system needs to be fixed, and today's decision
sets the stage for further reform,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president said he is again urging Congress to pass campaign finance
reform legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
	   In other action, the court:
</P>
<P>
	   --Ruled, by a 5-4 vote in a Louisiana case, that federal authorities cannot
squelch changes in state and local elections as discriminatory when the new
plans would leave racial and ethnic minorities no worse off.
</P>
<P>
	   --Refused to free Democratic fund-raiser Maria Hsia from charges that she
hid illegal contributions to the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   --Rejected an appeal by a pharmaceutical company ordered to pay $22 million
because an Oregon man went blind after taking medicine for his heart. American
Home Products Corp.'s lawyers said a jury's award of $20 million in punitive
damages -- aimed at punishing and deterring misconduct -- violated the
Constitution's ban on excessive fines.
</P>
<P>
	   --Turned away the appeal of a Rwandan minister accused of participating in
genocide in his homeland. U.S. officials can hand Elizaphan Ntakirutimana over
to a war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Clarence Thomas was missing from the bench today following the death
Sunday of his brother, Meyers, in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's highest court had not ruled on contribution limits since 1976,
when in a landmark decision called Buckley vs. Valeo it said free-speech rights
trump any attempt to limit an individual candidate's spending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The principal issues in this case are whether Buckley vs. Valeo ... is
authority for state limits on contributions to state political candidates and
whether the federal limits approved in Buckley, with or without adjustment for
inflation, define the scope of permissible state limitations today,'' Justice
David H. Souter wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We hold Buckley to be authority for comparable state regulations, which
need not be pegged to Buckley's dollars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Left unaffected by today's decision is currently unregulated ``soft money''
-- contributions made to groups that spend money without any ties to specific
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1976 decision drew a distinction between spending, which it said could
not be capped, and contributions, for which it upheld the current $1,000 limit
on individual contributions in federal elections.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1976 ruling focused on a federal law enacted after the Watergate scandal
of the early 1970s. The Missouri limits -- also $1,000 before adjusted to $1,075
-- were not imposed until 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Missouri's limits must fall
because inflation had eroded their fairness and because state officials had not
proved that larger donations would corrupt elections.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court had been told that $1,075 in today's dollars amounted to
only $378 in 1976 dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   But Souter referred to conflicting views on the effect of large political
contributions and said, ``There is little reason to doubt that sometimes large
contributions will work actual corruption on our political system, and no reason
to question the existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters.''
</P>
<P>
	   He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul
Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Antonin Scalia dissented.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The court's decision has lasting consequences for political speech in the
course of elections, the speech upon which democracy depends,'' Kennedy said in
a dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   But Stevens, confronting Kennedy's rationale in a separate opinion, said,
``Money is property; it is not speech.''
</P>
<P>
	   Writing for himself and Scalia, Thomas said, ``Buckley was in error and I
would overrule it. I would subject campaign contribution limits to strict
scrutiny, under which Missouri's contribution limits are patently
unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
	   The state's limits had been challenged by Bevis Schock, a St. Louis lawyer
who founded a political action committee called Shrink Missouri Government. He
balked at the limits imposed on his contributions to candidates who support
small government.
</P>
<P>
	   Schock wanted to give more than the legal limit to his friend Zev David
Fredman, an unsuccessful candidate in the Republican primary for state auditor
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   When the case was argued before the justices in October, they appeared
deeply split.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, Souter said, ``Most people assume -- I do certainly -- that
someone making an extraordinarily large contribution is going to get something
extraordinary in return.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Scalia extolled a wealthy man's right ``to participate in the democratic
process as fully as he is able.''
</P>
<P>
	   In defending Missouri's law, state Attorney General Jay Nixon warned the
court that ending or severely weakening contribution limits would lead most
Americans ``to believe that their government is literally for sale.''
</P>
<P>
	   But D. Bruce La Pierre, a St. Louis lawyer representing the Shrink Missouri
Government PAC, said, ``We can try trusting the American people'' to decide when
political candidates are taking too much money from any one contributor.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Nixon vs. Shrink Missouri Government, 98-963.

<HEADLINE> 'Once and Again' Finds New Home  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When last seen, Lily and Rick were torn apart by
infidelity. Lily and her estranged husband Jake were dancing on the grave of
their marriage. And Lily and Rick's respective offspring were fighting their own
adolescent battles.
</P>
<P>
	   And ABC and "Once and Again," the series that features this troubled circle
of spouses and lovers and kids, were at odds, too -- or so it would seem. After
all, "NYPD Blue" had successfully lobbied the network to reclaim its Tuesday
time slot.
</P>
<P>
	   But there are no hard feelings as the ousted "Once and Again" moves to
Monday after a brief hiatus, insists Marshall Herskovitz, who created and
produces the drama with partner Edward Zwick.
</P>
<P>
	   "To the extent that anybody was watching that flap over who was going to
stay at Tuesday night at 10 on ABC, I think there was perhaps a misconception
about it. We weren't at all sure that was a great time for us," Herskovitz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Competing with CBS' "Judging Amy" for female viewers was one disadvantage of
the original time period, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   And, Herskovitz added, "moving time slots isn't the sort of negative it used
to be. Many shows have benefited from moving -- 'The Practice' is a good
example. It took off when it was moved .... Monday at 10 gives us a new
opportunity. We'll see what we can do with it."
</P>
<P>
	   However it fares, the drama starring Billy Campbell and Sela Ward will
retain its focus on "how two grown-ups with the entire baggage train of their
lives behind them will find a way to bring their lives together," Herskovitz
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lily, in particular, will find the next few weeks a crucible, a challenge to
the emotional defenses on which she has relied to get through life, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hersokovitz and Zwick are starting off their repositioned series with a
blast from the past: They've resurrected Miles Drentell, the deliciously
Machiavellian figure from their 1987-91 ABC series "thirtysomething."
</P>
<P>
	   Played again seductively by David Clennon, Drentell pops up to bedevil
architect Rick as a demanding client. Rick is suffering over breaking up with
Lily, who in a moment of weakness had a fling with estranged hubby Jake (Jeffrey
Nordling).
</P>
<P>
	   Rick and Lily's kids, meanwhile, are tiptoeing around their parents'
romantic woes, just another shard from the painful wreckage of divorce. The
strength of "Once and Again" is in the delicately observed details and
unerringly true conversation.
</P>
<P>
	   "He saw the mom today," Rick's teen-age son says, explaining to his sister
why dad seemed so sad at the dinner table. "Oh. Duh, no wonder," the little girl
replies. She's limited in language but wise beyond her years.
</P>
<P>
	   The show has hit viewers hard, said Herskovitz, who scans the letters and
e-mail generated by "Once and Again."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's astonishing how deep people's responses are, and how thoughtful and
how varied: 'I love Lily. She's such a such a good mother,' or 'That Lily is ...
totally self-involved,' " Herskovitz said, reciting from memory.
</P>
<P>
	   If our own memory serves, the biggest knock against "thirtysomething" was
that it was inhabited by self-involved, self-obsessed yuppie twits whose
greatest skill was whining. Herskovitz offers no denial.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a whine factor in 'thirtysomething.' I freely admit that, because
I believe most people whine and complain. They just do it in private. ... I
think it's upsetting for some people to see it on television," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   If some Zwick-Herskovitz characters remain mired in baby-boom narcissism,
however, there has been progress elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   "A change has happened in television in the last 12 years," says Herskovitz.
"When we did 'thirtysomething,' people would look at the characters and
criticize us for, in some way, glorifying what were bad personality traits,
whining and complaining, and holding that up as a model.
</P>
<P>
	   "We weren't holding it up as a model. We were observing it," he continued.
"Nowadays, the audience is much more willing to accept a flawed main character.
Ally McBeal is a totally flawed character. Tony Soprano ('The Sopranos') is a
completely flawed character. ... It's been freeing in a way."
</P>
<P>
	   There's a talented team at work on "Once and Again," including Winnie
Holzman, who created the short-lived and lamented "My So-Called Life," and
Pamela Grey, writer of the acclaimed feature film "A Walk on the Moon."
</P>
<P>
	   They are working without a TV net, bypassing the formulaic safety of medical
or police or courtroom dramas in favor of something simple but daring.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we're trying to do is observe life as it's lived by people in relation
to each other," said Herskovitz. "It's not a genre. We're fascinated by what we
call dropping the pretense and just looking at the thing itself."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in television ....
</P>
<P>
	   NEW DOC IN TOWN: James Garner is joining the cast of "Chicago Hope," the CBS
medical series that airs 9 p.m. EST Thursday, in a recurring role later this
season. The former star of "The Rockford Files" and "Maverick" is cast as a
tough multimillionaire who buys the hospital and puts the staff in cardiac
arrest. "Chicago Hope" creator David E. Kelley called it a "privilege" to
welcome the veteran actor aboard.

<HEADLINE> Albright Tells U.N. About Helms  </HEADLINE>
   By DAFNA LINZER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sought
Monday to repair any damage to American credibility caused by the appearance
here last week of Jesse Helms, telling the Security Council that the
conservative senator doesn't speak for the United States or its policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright, who returned to her old stomping grounds Monday to chair a meeting
on peace prospects for Congo, used the opportunity to distance both herself and
the Clinton administration from Helms.
</P>
<P>
	   The North Carolina Republican made waves at the United Nations on Thursday,
telling members of the Security Council that the American people ``would never
accept the claims of the United Nations to be the `sole source of legitimacy on
the use of force,' in the world.''
</P>
<P>
	   He accused the organization of an anti-American bias and said the United
Nations needed to learn from its past mistakes, reform and work harder to
achieve peace in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   The speech was aimed at helping foreign ambassadors understand why Helms,
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, placed conditions on nearly
$1 billion in delinquent U.S. dues to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   His comments angered ambassadors, who challenged Helms on nearly every point
of his speech and criticized him for having conditioned legally binding dues to
his reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright described Helms as ``a man of conviction and a strong advocate of a
distinct point of view about the United Nations and America's relationship to
it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``So let me be clear,'' she continued, ``only the president and the
executive branch can speak for the United States. Today, on behalf of the
President, let me say that the Clinton administration and I believe that most
Americans see our role in the world and our relationship to this organization
quite differently than does Senator Helms.''
</P>
<P>
	   She went on to say that the United States believes in ``leading with other
nations whenever possible,'' and that the United Nations was the forum to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We recognize its many contributions to our own interests in a more secure,
democratic and humane world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her comments so starkly contradicted those of Helms that they drew
intermittent chuckles from foreign ambassadors seated around the Security
Council table.

<HEADLINE> Poet Laureate Dove Up for Award  </HEADLINE>
    By HILLEL ITALIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former U.S. poet laureate, the latest winner of Britain's
Booker Prize and Argentina's most famous writer were nominated Monday for this
year's National Book Critics Circle awards.
</P>
<P>
	   Rita Dove, poet laureate from 1993 to 1995, was named a poetry finalist for
her collection "On the Bus With Rosa Parks." South African author J.M. Coetzee,
who recently won the Booker Prize for his post-apartheid novel "Disgrace," was
nominated for fiction.
</P>
<P>
	   The late Jorge Luis Borges was a finalist for criticism for his "Selected
Non-Fictions," which compiles everything from movie reviews to essays on Dante.
Borges, a native of Argentina known all over the world for his surreal stories
and parables, died in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the non-nominees: "Dutch," Edmund Morris' controversial biography of
former President Reagan, in which the author inserted himself as a fictional
character.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do not believe it represents the best of what biographies should be,"
said NBCC president Barbara Hoffert.
</P>
<P>
	   David Gates, a fiction nominee in 1999, was nominated this year for his
story collection "The Wonders of the Invisible World." Others cited were
Jonathan Lethem for "Motherless Brooklyn," Frederick Busch for "The Night
Inspector" and A. Manette Ansay for "Midnight Champagne."
</P>
<P>
	   Only two authors nominated for the National Book Award also received NBCC
citations: Judith Thurman, for "Secrets of the Flesh, a biography of the French
author Colette, and John W. Dower, an National Book Award winner for "Embracing
Defeat," a study of Japan after World War II.

<HEADLINE> Sundance Touts Female Directors  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Sundance Film Festival organizer Geoffrey Gilmore
recalled a friend's sour reaction to the news that the event would showcase more
films than ever by female directors.
</P>
<P>
	   "My friend said, 'Great, that's a whole lot of romantic comedies I'm going
to have to sit through,"' said Gilmore, co-director of the nation's top
independent film festival, which runs through next weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   That's a wrong assumption about the record slate of 29 films by women out of
the 113 feature movies Sundance is showing, Gilmore said. The lineup by female
filmmakers is bold, diverse, edgy and -- in some cases -- not remotely romantic.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anyone who thinks these are a bunch of chick flicks is really making a
mistake," Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the field:
</P>
<P>
	   --Mary Harron's brutish, bloody "American Psycho," the adaptation of Bret
Easton Ellis' novel about a 1980s Wall Streeter whose hobby is serial murder by
ax, pistol, chainsaw or nail gun.
</P>
<P>
	   --Sofia Coppola's "The Virgin Suicides," a darkly comic tale of a group of
spirited sisters in a repressive family. The director is the daughter of
filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola.
</P>
<P>
	   --Gurinder Chadha's "What's Cooking?," a skillfully layered love song to Los
Angeles told through the turmoil of four ethnically diverse families as they
prepare for Thanksgiving. The movie was the premiere feature for the festival's
opening night last week.
</P>
<P>
	   --Karyn Kusama's "Girlfight," about a high school senior who bucks her
father and embarks on rigorous training as an amateur boxer.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you could open a dictionary to the word 'director' 40 years ago and it
had a picture, you would probably see some white guy with a beret and boots,"
said Lisa Krueger, director of "Committed," a Sundance film starring Heather
Graham as a jilted wife on a bold quest to stitch her life back together. "Now
the picture looks like 500 different people, men and women."
</P>
<P>
	   Krueger was honored at the festival over the weekend by the group Women in
Film, which called her a pioneer for "Committed" and her previous Sundance
feature, "Manny and Lo."
</P>
<P>
	   "We just want progress for women in film," said Carol Savoie, vice president
of the group's board. "We don't want to take over the world. And we are seeing
progress. Women are doing so much better at Sundance. That's a big step."
</P>
<P>
	   Film schools are turning out more female graduates, and more women are
moving into upper studio management, but women generally say they have a harder
time than male directors finding money to make their movies.
</P>
<P>
	   Valerie Breiman said it took almost six years to finish her Sundance entry,
"Love and Sex," a screwball comedy starring Famke Janssen.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's great just to see the excitement among all these women who made movies
and got them here," Breiman said. "We're all just kind of jumping up and down. I
hope it's not just a fad. I hope women will be able to continue to make more and
more movies."
</P>
<P>
	   Financial success ultimately dictates whether a male or female director will
be able to continue to make movies and graduate from low-budget independent
films to costlier productions. Exceptions such as Penny Marshall or Mimi Leder
aside, Hollywood rarely considers female directors for big-budget pictures.
</P>
<P>
	   "Somehow, men are seen as more able to marshal the armies of film
production," said Gale Anne Hurd, producer of "Armageddon" and "The Terminator."
"Many women I know don't have the larger-than-life presence a lot of male
directors have, but that doesn't have anything to do with whether they can
direct."
</P>
<P>
	   "When you've got 200 people on a set waiting for a leader, leadership is not
necessarily about being General Patton."
</P>

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading heavily
today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares fell for a fourth consecutive session until midday, when P&AMP;G said it
had called off talks to acquire drug makers Warner-Lambert Co. and American Home
Products Corp. P&AMP;G's shares snapped back on the news. The drug companies have a
combined market capitalization of $142 billion, larger than P&AMP;G's own.
</P>
<P>
	   The British telecommunications company said its Hong Kong unit is in merger
talks with Singapore Telecom. Analysts said the deal would provide Cable &AMP;
Wireless with additional cash to invest in its business of providing
telecommunications service to large corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
	   The company earned 73 cents per share in the fourth quarter, beating
analysts' forecasts of 68 cents per share. Lexmark, a maker of laser and ink jet
printers, said it expects to achieve its goal of 20 percent growth in earnings
per share in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Va. Rep. Goode Leaving Democrats  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Virgil Goode, a second-term conservative Democrat
from Virginia, announced plans today to become an independent, a decision that
could complicate his former party's efforts to win control of the House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I plan to continue voting on the issues on the basis of what I believe is
in the best interests of the Fifth District, and not on a particular party
position,'' Goode said in a statement faxed to the news media.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview today in Rocky Mount, Va., Goode declined to say whether he
would caucus with Democrats or Republicans, promising a statement soon on that
point.
</P>
<P>
	   House Democrats reacted cautiously to the defection.
</P>
<P>
	   The party's leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, said he was ``heartened
that he chose not to affiliate himself with'' the GOP. He said Democrats would
continue to protect Goode's committee assignments, and would welcome him back
into the fold ``when Democrats regain the House in January 2001.''
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Goode, Linwood Duncan, said the congressman had informed his
staff of his decision early in the day, then began personally faxing a formal
announcement from his campaign office.
</P>
<P>
	   He represents the state's 5th District, which runs from Charlottesville to
the tobacco-growing ``Southside.''
</P>
<P>
	   Goode's political position is a delicate one. While both sides are
struggling fiercely for a majority in the next elections -- and he could
theoretically join either party in 2001 -- Republicans have firm control of
congressional redistricting in Virginia. The party presumably could redraw the
district lines after the 2000 census in a way that could either help Goode or
hurt him.
</P>
<P>
	   The second-term congressman had informed associates of his plans Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Goode's decision represents a triumph for Republicans, although it was not
clear whether he would seek to align himself with the GOP in any official way.
His decision could jeopardize Democrats' hopes of regaining control of the House
in this year's election.
</P>
<P>
	   With Goode's defection, Republicans will hold a 222-211 majority in the
House, with two independents, Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and Goode. Sanders
is closely aligned with the Democrats, who protect his committee assignments.
</P>
<P>
	   Party switches are unusual in Congress, although there have been several in
the years since the Republicans won control of the House in the 1994 elections.
Five House Democrats switched to the GOP over a period of several months in 1995
and 1996. The most recent change of parties came last summer, when a Republican,
Rep. Michael Forbes of New York, became a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   Goode (rhymes with food), 53, was first elected to Congress in 1996 after
serving in the Virginia Legislature. Democrats cheered his election, despite his
strongly conservative voting record, since his victory meant they had kept yet
another Southern seat from falling into the hands of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Rumors of Goode's disaffection with the Democrats began circulating within
months, and Republicans courted him actively. A fellow Virginian, Rep. Tom
Davis, is chairman of the House GOP campaign committee, and he has publicly
advocated giving Goode a coveted seat on the House Appropriations Committee if
he switched to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
	   He twice sought the Democratic nomination to the Senate, in 1982 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Goode, a lawyer, was given a rating of 84 by the American Conservative Union
for his votes in 1997 and an 83 in 1998. He voted against President Clinton's
agenda 68 percent of the time in 1997 and 74 percent of the time in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Among key votes in 1998, Goode voted for three counts of impeachment against
Clinton; against granting the president fast-track trade negotiating authority;
and for a Republican overhaul of managed heath care.
</P>
<P>
	   After Goode's votes to impeach Clinton, Democrats responded by not inviting
him to help put on a reception at the state party's major annual fund-raising
dinner in Richmond. Earlier this month he rejected an invitation to speak at the
party's Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner. And just last month Goode attended a
fund-raising for Republican George Allen, a Republican who is running against
Democratic Sen. Charles Robb.
</P>
<P>
	   Goode's district went against Clinton in both his elections.

<HEADLINE> Report Ponders Amtrak Independence  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An independent commission studying Amtrak released an
initial report today questioning whether the passenger railroad can wean itself
from federal aid after three decades of subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Amtrak Reform Council said Amtrak may be using faulty accounting methods
to determine its bottom line. If the railroad is forced to change its
calculations it could fall short of meeting a congressional mandate for
self-sufficiency by 2003, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a very important conflict at this point that we have to resolve,''
said Gil Carmichael, chairman of the council.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak says it is on track to meet the deadline, but the council report said
the railroad's revenue projections do not include equipment depreciation and
overhaul costs that will total $567 million in 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak did not include those costs in its 1999 financial report, which said
the railroad was $484 million short of self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
	   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, applied a
standard corporate measurement -- overall revenue minus overall expenses -- that
included the costs and came up with a $907 million operating loss for Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak officials say Congress does not require it to use standard accounting
rules.
</P>
<P>
	   Carmichael said the council may ask Congress to decide which accounting
method should be used to determine the railroad's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress in 1997 approved billions of dollars in support for Amtrak but
declared that government operating subsidies would end after five years. It
created the reform council to keep track of the railroad's efforts toward that
goal.
</P>
<P>
	   In anticipation of today's report, Amtrak officials issued a news release
Sunday trumpeting strong quarterly revenues and announcing a start date for the
railroad's long-anticipated high-speed service between Boston and New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak said its new Acela Regional service will begin Jan. 31 with a
celebration at Boston's South Station. The Boston-New York City trip, which now
takes about five hours, will drop to just under four.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue in the quarter ended Dec. 31 was 8 percent higher than last year,
Amtrak said. It also boasted of significant growth in ridership on its
Chicago-to-Los Angeles ``Texas Eagle'' route and its Oakland-to-Sacramento
``Capitols'' route in California.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 76.94; Nasdaq Down 1.69  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly lower today as optimism about
corporate earnings gave way to jitters about rising interest rates and their
impact on profit growth.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 76.94 at 11,174.77. The index was up more than 70 points in earlier
trading.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down
14.95 at 1,426.41. The Nasdaq composite index gave up an early gain and was off
1.69 at 4,233.71.
</P>
<P>
	   A handful of blue-chip stocks moved higher today. Eastman Kodak rose 2 1/8
to 62 7/8 after reporting it earned $1.27 per share in the fourth quarter,
beating analysts' estimates of $1.24. Kodak, which has faltered in recent years
due to tougher competition from Fuji, also issued a strong outlook for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble rose 2 3/4 to 105 7/16 after calling off talks to acquire
drug makers Warner-Lambert and American Home Products. Procter &AMP; Gamble's share
price had tumbled 17 percent since rumors of a deal first emerged last week, as
many shareholders believed the company would have to issue significant amounts
of new stock to pay for the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The overall market's momentum collapsed around midday as investors once
again worried about the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates. The Fed
is widely expected to raise rates a quarter-percentage point at its next meeting
Feb. 1 and 2, but in recent sessions, many investors have come to believe an
increase then will be the first of several designed to slow economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the Fed raised interest rates three times, hoping to keep inflation
at bay. While most economists see few hints of inflation, the nation's economic
growth has continued to escalate.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan will testify before a Senate
committee about the federal budget. Traders suggested some investors today were
moving money out of the market in advance of his testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   Interest-rate sensitive stocks fell, including Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
down 2 5/8 to 129 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks continued to flourish. Intel rose 5 3/8 to 103 5/16.
Amazon.com gained 9 11/16 to 71 3/4 after Goldman Sachs raised its rating on the
stock to "trading buy" from "market outperform." Also, Amazon.com announced that
Drugstore.com will pay it $105 million over three years in return for a featured
spot on the Amazon.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading followed last week's trend, when blue-chip stocks lost the strength
they demonstrated early in the year and technology stocks once again sprinted
higher.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rotation in this market has seen little follow-through," said Phil
Erlanger, who runs Phil Erlanger Research Co. in Acton, Mass. "We are currently
left with the old faithfuls as leaders -- technology and health technology."
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner, fresh from its $145 billion merger with America Online, fell 3
5/8 to 87 1/2 after announcing plans to merge its music business with British
music company EMI Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 720.92 million shares, behind Friday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose for a seventh straight
session, gaining 1.67 to 535.61.

<HEADLINE> Court Backs Local Election Changes  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling its dissenters say
will perpetuate discrimination against minorities, limited federal authority to
veto changes in the way state and local elections are run.
</P>
<P>
	   The government cannot reject proposed changes in election systems -- even if
they are discriminatory -- so long as the changes leave minorities no worse off
than they were before, the court decided in a Louisiana case Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling applies to the 1965 federal Voting Rights Act's requirement that
all or part of 16 states get government or court clearance before implementing
new election districts, for example, or switching to an at-large voting plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Such government clearance has ``limited meaning'' and ``is nothing more than
a determination that the voting change is no more dilutive than what it
replaces,'' Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Preclearance under (the law) affirms nothing but the absence of
backsliding,'' Scalia wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   After an election change is cleared, Scalia said, it still can be challenged
under another section of the Voting Rights Act that prohibits any voting
practice that would dilute minority voters' clout.
</P>
<P>
	   Scalia's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
	   Dissenting were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now executive and judicial officers of the United States will be forced to
preclear illegal and unconstitutional voting schemes patently intended to
perpetuate discrimination,'' Souter wrote for the four.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress did not intend to let state and local governments ``pour old poison
into new bottles,'' Souter said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling upheld the current system of electing the Bossier Parish, La.,
school board's 12 members.
</P>
<P>
	   The school district's lawyer, Michael Carvin, said the ruling ``frees up the
largely southern jurisdictions to do their own redistricting free from Justice
Department interference.''
</P>
<P>
	   Carvin called the ruling a ``very dramatic turnaround'' that will ``reduce
the pressure to create minority-majority districts in these southern
jurisdictions.''
</P>
<P>
	   George Price, the former local NAACP president who opposed the Bossier
Parish voting plan, said Monday that ``the suit, although we were unable to make
a change in the district lines, has made clear the need for minority
representation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department spokeswoman Christine DiBartolo said, ``We're
disappointed with the decision.''
</P>
<P>
	   The justices heard arguments in the case twice, deciding after a first
argument last April to have lawyers argue it again in October.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bossier Parish school board's members are elected from 12 different
districts. About 20 percent of the parish's population is black, concentrated in
two areas, but no district has a black majority.
</P>
<P>
	   As of 1990, no black had ever been elected to the school board.
</P>
<P>
	   After the 1990 census required new districts to be drawn, the local NAACP
chapter proposed creating two black-majority districts.
</P>
<P>
	   The school board opted instead for a new map in 1992 with no such district,
but the Justice Department refused to clear the plan. However, a three-judge
federal court ruled that the plan must be upheld, and the Supreme Court affirmed
that decision Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Voting Rights Act's Section 5 allows the federal government to veto
proposed changes if they are deemed to have a discriminatory ``purpose or
effect.'' The act's Section 2 is more stringent, and prohibits any voting
practice that would dilute minority voters' clout.
</P>
<P>
	   In a 1997 decision involving the same Bossier Parish dispute, the nation's
highest court said Justice Department lawyers cannot refuse to approve a
proposal under Section 5 by deciding that the change would violate Section 2.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Louisiana case wended its way through federal courts, two black
candidates were elected to the 12-member school board in 1994 and were
re-elected in 1998, along with a third black candidate.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Campaign Limit Ruling  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Excerpts from the Supreme Court's decision Monday allowing states to impose
limits on contributions to political candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice David H. Souter's majority opinion:
</P>
<P>
	   The principal issues in this case are whether Buckley vs. Valeo (a 1976
ruling that upheld the $1,000 limit on individuals' contributions to candidates
for federal office) is authority for state limits on contributions to state
political candidates and whether the federal limits ... define the scope of
permissible state limitations today.
</P>
<P>
	   We hold Buckley to be authority for comparable state regulation, which need
not be tied to Buckley's dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   ... While neither law nor morals equate all political contributions, without
more, with bribes, we spoke in Buckley of the perception of corruption inherent
in a regime of large individual financial contributions to candidates for public
office ...
</P>
<P>
	   Leave the perception of impropriety unanswered, and the cynical assumption
that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to
take part in democratic governance. Democracy works only if the people have
faith in those who govern, and that faith is bound to be shattered when high
officials and their appointees engage in activities which arouse suspicions of
malfeasance and corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   ... There is little reason to doubt that sometimes large contributions will
work actual corruption of our political system, and no reason to question the
existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters.
</P>
<P>
	   ... In Buckley, we specifically rejected the contention that $1,000 or any
other amount was a constitutional minimum below which the legislatures could not
regulate ... We referred instead to the outer limits of contribution regulation
by asking whether there was any showing that the limits were so low as to impede
the ability of candidates to amass the resources necessary for effective
advocacy.
</P>
<P>
	   We asked, in other words, whether the contribution limitation was so radical
in effect as to render political association ineffective, drive the sound of a
candidate's voice below the level of notice and render contributions pointless.
Such being the test, the issue in later cases cannot be truncated to a narrow
question about the power of the dollar, but must go to the power to mount a
campaign with all the dollars likely to be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's dissent:
</P>
<P>
	   The court's decision has lasting consequences for political speech in the
course of elections, the speech upon which democracy depends ... Surely the
court's approach is unacceptable for a case announcing a rule that suppresses
one of our most essential and prevalent forms of political speech.
</P>
<P>
	   ... I would overrule Buckley and then free Congress or state legislatures to
attempt some new reform, if based upon their own considered view of the First
Amendment, it is possible to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Clarence Thomas' dissent:
</P>
<P>
	   In the process of ratifying Missouri's sweeping repression of political
speech, the court today adopts the analytic fallacies of our flawed decision in
Buckley vs. Valeo.
</P>
<P>
	   ... The decision of individuals to speak through contributions rather than
through independent expenditures is entirely reasonable. Political campaigns are
largely candidate focused and candidate driven. Citizens recognize that the best
advocate for a candidate and the policy positions he supports tends to be the
candidate himself ... By depriving donors of their right to speak through the
candidate, contribution limits relegate donors' points of view to less effective
modes of communication.
</P>
<P>
	   ... Because the court unjustifiably discounts the First Amendment interests
of citizens and candidates and consequently fails to strictly scrutinize the
inhibition of political speech and competition, I respectfully dissent.

<HEADLINE> Court Backs States on Contributions  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a timely election-year ruling, the Supreme Court
reaffirmed states' sweeping power to place limits on campaign contributions to
political candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices, splitting 6-3 Monday, reinstated Missouri's limits for state
races and safeguarded for now the $1,000 cap on individuals' contributions to
candidates for federal office, who could spend $3 billion nationwide this year.
</P>
<P>
	   About two-thirds of the states impose campaign contribution limits. In
California, voters will be asked in a March 7 initiative to impose limits and
ban corporate and union contributions in state races.
</P>
<P>
	   The court's three dissenters said Monday's decision tramples free-speech
rights and voted for letting people contribute as much as they want to all
candidates by overturning a 1976 Supreme Court landmark that still shapes the
nation's political landscape.
</P>
<P>
	   The court said fighting corruption, or even the perception of corruption,
justifies contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Leave the perception of impropriety unanswered, and the cynical assumption
that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to
take part in democratic governance,'' Justice David H. Souter wrote for the
court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Democracy works only if the people have faith in those who govern, and
that faith is bound to be shattered when high officials and their appointees
engage in activities which arouse suspicions of malfeasance and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
	   Left unaffected by the ruling is currently unregulated ``soft money'' --
contributions made to groups that spend money without ties to specific
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton praised the decision as ``a victory for democracy'' in a
statement read by press secretary Joe Lockhart. ``The American people know that
our political system needs to be fixed, and today's decision sets the stage for
further reform,'' said Clinton, who is urging Congress to pass more
campaign-finance changes this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain, an Arizona senator and Republican presidential contender,
also applauded the ruling as ``marvelous.'' He has made campaign reform the
centerpiece of his bid for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   E. Joshua Rosenkranz, of the pro-limits Brennan Center for Justice, called
the ruling ``a grand slam home run reformers have been waiting for'' because the
court ``holds in no uncertain terms that it is the province of the legislature,
not the courts, to set contribution limits.''
</P>
<P>
	   But James Bopp, an Indiana lawyer who represents the National Right to Life
Committee, the National Rifle Association and other groups in challenging
contribution limits, said restricting donations ``is bad for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bopp said courts still can strike down contribution limits found to be set
so low they prevent candidates from financing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's highest court had not ruled on contribution limits since 1976,
when, in a decision called Buckley vs. Valeo, it said free-speech rights trump
any attempt to limit an individual candidate's spending. But the court also said
back then that contributions to federal candidates could be limited to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
	   That ruling focused on a 1974 federal law enacted after the Watergate
scandal of the early 1970s. The Missouri limits for statewide races -- also
$1,000 before being adjusted to $1,075 -- were not imposed until 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal appeals court struck down the limitation, saying inflation had
eroded its fairness. But Souter said a state's authority to limit contributions
cannot be tied to the Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is little reason to doubt that sometimes large contributions will
work actual corruption on our political system, and no reason to question the
existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul
Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
	   Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy said the ruling ``suppresses one of our most essential and prevalent
forms of political speech.'' Thomas, writing for himself and Scalia, said,
``States are free to ... directly punish those engaged in corruption and require
the disclosure of large contributions, but they are not free to ... suppress a
tremendous amount of protected speech along with the targeted corruption.''
</P>
<P>
	   Missouri's contribution limits had been challenged by Bevis Schock, a St.
Louis lawyer who founded a political action committee called Shrink Missouri
Government. He balked at limits imposed on his contributions to candidates who
support small government.
</P>
<P>
	   Schock wanted to give more than the legal limit to his friend Zev David
Fredman, an unsuccessful candidate in the Republican primary for state auditor
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Fredman, contacted in St. Louis, said he was disappointed by the decision.
``The limits are put in place by legislators with the most to gain,'' he said.
``They are entrenched politicians.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Issues Heartburn Drug Warning  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The popular heartburn drug Propulsid can cause dangerous
irregular heartbeats and even sudden death, the government said Monday. The
medicine should be used only as a last resort -- and only by patients first
given heart tests to ensure they are at low risk for the side effect, it warned.
</P>
<P>
	   Patients now taking Propulsid should ask their doctors about switching
medication, and doctors should not prescribe the drug without first performing
an EKG, or electrocardiogram, the Food and Drug Administration said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nor should anyone with heart disease or a list of other illnesses use the
drug, the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA's unusually strong warning comes in the wake of 70 deaths and 200
other reports of irregular heartbeat and other heart rhythm disturbances since
Propulsid hit the market in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Manufacturer Janssen Pharmaceuticals, based in Titusville, N.J., mailed the
warning to thousands of physicians Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA first warned that Propulsid can cause serious heart problems in June
1998, but it continued to receive reports of deaths and hospitalizations.
</P>
<P>
	   So Monday, the agency took additional steps to make sure Propulsid is used
only by patients with severe nighttime heartburn who get no relief from other
drugs -- and only if they appear at low risk for the cardiac side effects.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA said it was not pulling Propulsid off the market because the drug
can help some patients and because the new warnings should make using it safer.
</P>
<P>
	   The cardiac risk is relatively small considering an estimated 30 million
Propulsid prescriptions have been written since 1993, and most people who
suffered the heart problems had clear risk factors, said Dr. Florence Houn,
FDA's chief of gastrointestinal drugs. That means careful doctors who heed the
new warnings should be able to keep Propulsid away from the patients most likely
to be hurt, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want warnings to go out. We want education to the prescribers to be
reinforced," she said. "This drug requires careful prescription."
</P>
<P>
	   But an expert on drug-induced irregular heartbeats said it will be difficult
for the doctors who most prescribe Propulsid -- gastrointestinal specialists --
to comply.
</P>
<P>
	   "FDA warnings have not been as successful as we would like in being
translated into care," said Dr. Raymond Woosley, a pharmacologist at Georgetown
University Medical Center. "This one will be especially difficult because of the
fact that many physicians don't have an EKG" machine in their offices.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, some computerized EKG equipment doesn't accurately read a critical
type of heartbeat measurement called "QT prolongation," requiring doctors
skilled in reading EKGs to determine that manually, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among FDA's warnings:
</P>
<P>
	   --Do not prescribe Propulsid to anyone with heart disease, including
valvular disease, or who has ever had an irregular heartbeat, abnormal EKG or QT
prolongation.
</P>
<P>
	   --Do not prescribe Propulsid to people with kidney disease; lung disease;
low blood levels of the electrolytes potassium, calcium or magnesium; an eating
disorder; dehydration or prolonged vomiting.
</P>
<P>
	   --Never take Propulsid while using a list of other medications, including
antibiotics like erythromycin; antifungals like ketoconazole; AIDS-fighting
protease inhibitors; drugs for irregular heartbeat; certain antidepressants and
antipsychotics such as Elavil or Serzone. Also do not take with grapefruit
juice.
</P>
<P>
	   --In addition to an EKG, patients being considered for Propulsid should
undergo blood tests to check electrolyte levels.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA will gather heartburn and cardiac experts for a special meeting
April 12 to determine whether the new Propulsid warnings are adequate.

<HEADLINE> Court Backs Local Election Changes  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling its dissenters say
will perpetuate discrimination against minorities, limited federal authority to
veto changes in the way state and local elections are run.
</P>
<P>
	   The government cannot reject proposed changes in election systems -- even if
they are discriminatory -- so long as the changes leave minorities no worse off
than they were before, the court decided in a Louisiana case Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling applies to the 1965 federal Voting Rights Act's requirement that
all or part of 16 states get government or court clearance before implementing
new election districts, for example, or switching to an at-large voting plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Such government clearance has ``limited meaning'' and ``is nothing more than
a determination that the voting change is no more dilutive than what it
replaces,'' Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Preclearance under (the law) affirms nothing but the absence of
backsliding,'' Scalia wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   After an election change is cleared, Scalia said, it still can be challenged
under another section of the Voting Rights Act that prohibits any voting
practice that would dilute minority voters' clout.
</P>
<P>
	   Scalia's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
	   Dissenting were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now executive and judicial officers of the United States will be forced to
preclear illegal and unconstitutional voting schemes patently intended to
perpetuate discrimination,'' Souter wrote for the four.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress did not intend to let state and local governments ``pour old poison
into new bottles,'' Souter said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling upheld the current system of electing the Bossier Parish, La.,
school board's 12 members.
</P>
<P>
	   The school district's lawyer, Michael Carvin, said the ruling ``frees up the
largely southern jurisdictions to do their own redistricting free from Justice
Department interference.''
</P>
<P>
	   Carvin called the ruling a ``very dramatic turnaround'' that will ``reduce
the pressure to create minority-majority districts in these southern
jurisdictions.''
</P>
<P>
	   George Price, the former local NAACP president who opposed the Bossier
Parish voting plan, said Monday that ``the suit, although we were unable to make
a change in the district lines, has made clear the need for minority
representation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Price's lawyer, Patricia Brannan, said she was disappointed but took heart
in the court's statement that people still can sue under another section of the
Voting Rights Act. ``A court majority says there are other ways of tackling the
problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department spokeswoman Christine DiBartolo said, ``We're
disappointed with the decision.''
</P>
<P>
	   The justices heard arguments in the case twice, deciding after a first
argument last April to have lawyers argue it again in October.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bossier Parish school board's members are elected from 12 different
districts. About 20 percent of the parish's population is black, concentrated in
two areas, but no district has a black majority.
</P>
<P>
	   As of 1990, no black had ever been elected to the school board.
</P>
<P>
	   After the 1990 census required new districts to be drawn, the local NAACP
chapter proposed creating two black-majority districts.
</P>
<P>
	   The school board opted instead for a new map in 1992 with no such district,
but the Justice Department refused to clear the plan. However, a three-judge
federal court ruled that the plan must be upheld, and the Supreme Court affirmed
that decision Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Voting Rights Act's Section 5 allows the federal government to veto
proposed changes if they are deemed to have a discriminatory ``purpose or
effect.'' The act's Section 2 is more stringent, and prohibits any voting
practice that would dilute minority voters' clout.
</P>
<P>
	   In a 1997 decision involving the same Bossier Parish dispute, the nation's
highest court said Justice Department lawyers cannot refuse to approve a
proposal under Section 5 by deciding that the change would violate Section 2.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Louisiana case wended its way through federal courts, two black
candidates were elected to the 12-member school board in 1994 and were
re-elected in 1998, along with a third black candidate.

<HEADLINE> Court Dismisses Electric Chair Case  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today backed out of deciding whether
death in Florida's electric chair is a type of ``cruel and unusual punishment''
the Constitution forbids.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices had agreed last October to use a challenge to Florida's death
penalty law to decide the issue. But that was when electrocution was the only
method used by the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The Florida Legislature earlier this month passed new legislation providing
for death by injection unless an inmate prefers the electric chair, and Gov. Jeb
Bush signed it into law.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices today dismissed as moot, or legally irrelevant, the case they
had been studying.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida Attorney General Robert Butterworth had suggested such action in a
Jan. 13 letter to the justices.
</P>
<P>
	   In the dismissed case, convicted murderer Anthony Bryan had argued that
execution in Florida's electric chair, called ``Old Sparky,'' violates the
Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. He now can opt for death
by injection, but Bryan's lawyer opposed Butterworth's effort to get the case
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The new legislation ... cannot be applied retroactively to Mr. Bryan or
other persons sentenced to death for crimes committed before the effective date
... unless and until a settled rule of Florida constitutional law is changed to
permit this result,'' Brooklyn, N.Y., lawyer Martin McClain told the justices in
a recent letter.
</P>
<P>
	   But today's brief order washing out the case that was to be argued next
month said the court was relying on ``the representation by the state of Florida
... that (Bryan's) death sentence will be carried out by lethal injection unless
(he) affirmatively elects death by electrocution.''
</P>
<P>
	   Florida was one of just four states that require condemned killers to be
executed by electrocution. Now, only three states -- Alabama, Georgia and
Nebraska -- have such laws. The issue may return to the nation's highest court
in a case from one of those states.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the 38 states with death penalty laws have switched since 1950 to
lethal injection as the primary means of execution. Once, a peak of 26 states
used electric chairs.
</P>
<P>
	   The last man to die in Florida's electric chair was triple-murderer Allen
``Tiny'' Davis, whose execution in July was marked by a flow of blood from his
nose onto his chest. He may also have been partially suffocated before he was
electrocuted because of the placement of a leather mouthpiece across his face.
</P>
<P>
	   His death was preceded by problems in 1990 and 1997, when flames erupted
from the headpiece worn by two other condemned Florida killers.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Bryan vs. Moore, 99-6723.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Targets Male-Female Pay Gap  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton appealed Monday to members of Congress
to ``do the right thing'' by closing the wage gap between working women and men.
He suggested they could start by approving his $27 million plan to bolster
enforcement of equal pay laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I made this request last year, and Congress failed to pass it,'' Clinton
said as he looked out at about 10 lawmakers who attended the White House
ceremony where he announced the proposal. ``I hope you will help us do this.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president coupled his appeal with a request for Congress to approve a
paycheck fairness act proposed by Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D. and Rep. Rosa
DeLauro, D-Conn., which would direct federal agencies to collect data about wage
disparities and increase penalties for violating equal-pay statutes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pass it. It's a good bill. There is no excuse not to pass it,'' Clinton
said. ``We need to clearly send the message that wage discrimination against
women is just as unacceptable as discrimination based on race or ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was joined by Michelle Akers, a member of the U.S. women's World Cup
championship soccer team. Akers and her teammates have been boycotting training
because they say they are paid less than the men's soccer team. They want raises
from $3,150 per month to $5,000, plus bonuses of $2,000 per game.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to stand here today for the women who have no voice,'' Akers said.
``Women's sports and the view of women has changed a ton. However, we still have
a ways to go. The battle is not over. We are still being discriminated
against.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sharon Long, of Baltimore, was testament to that. The lone female purchasing
agent for a heating and air conditioning wholesaler, she lost her job in 1994
after she suspected she was paid far less than her male counterparts and asked
for a raise. She filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission and some years later, her case was settled for $200,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Justice prevailed for me, but I know there are many more women out there
going through the same experience I survived,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
	   Women earn an average of 75 cents for every $1 men are paid, a disparity
Clinton has noted in the past as evidence of social injustice. For women of
color, he said, the disparity is even greater: 64 cents for black women and 55
cents for Hispanic women.

	   ``How would you like to show up for work every day, but only get to take
home three out of every four paychecks?'' Clinton asked. ``It's not a women's
issue. If a woman with a family is being denied equal pay for equal work, then
her husband suffers. Her children suffer. The family dynamic suffers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under Clinton's plan, $10 million would go to the EEOC to train up to 3,000
employers and 1,000 staff inspectors about equal pay laws. Last year, Clinton
proposed a similar, $14 million initiative that failed.
</P>
<P>
	   It would be the first time since the EEOC took responsibility for
enforcement of equal-pay laws in 1998 that the agency had money to train
inspectors on the subject. The agency also would produce public service
announcements.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department would receive $17 million to help train women for jobs
where they have been underrepresented, particularly in the high-technology
sector, through career centers the department supports and apprenticeships. The
department also would help employers improve their pay policies and strengthen
public-private partnerships.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down More Than 300  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled Monday as optimism about corporate earnings
gave way to jitters about rising interest rates and their impact on profit
growth.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last half-hour in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down about 310 points at 10,941. The Nasdaq composite
index was off more than 94 points at 4,141.
</P>
<P>
	   The market began the day higher, but its momentum collapsed around midday as
investors once again worried about the Federal Reserve's next move on interest
rates. The Fed is widely expected to raise rates a quarter-percentage point at
its next meeting Feb. 1 and 2, but in recent sessions, many investors have come
to believe an increase then will be the first of several designed to slow
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the Fed raised interest rates three times, hoping to keep inflation
at bay. While most economists see few hints of inflation, the nation's economic
growth has continued to escalate.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan will testify before a Senate
committee about the federal budget. Traders suggested some investors Monday were
moving money out of the market in advance of his testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial stocks, those most sensitive to rate changes, were among the big
losers.
</P>
<P>
	   In selling heavily, investors shrugged off another series of strong earnings
reports, including one from Dow stock Eastman Kodak.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Mixed in Auction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities were
mixed in Monday's auction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department sold $7.5 billion in three-month bills at a discount
rate of 5.385 percent, up from 5.350 percent last week. An additional $6.5
billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 5.520 percent, down from 5.535
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-month rate was the highest since Dec. 20 when the bills sold for
5.400 percent. The six-month rate was the lowest since Jan. 10 when the rate was
5.420.
</P>
<P>
	   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 5.549
percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,863.90 and
5.774 percent for a six-month bill selling for $9,720.90.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making changes to
adjustable rate mortgages, rose slightly to 6.13 percent last week from 6.12
percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans at 3-Month High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures rallied to their highest level in
three months Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade, buoyed by the
failure of significant rainfall to materialize in prime growing
regions of South America. Grains also rose.
</P>
<P>
	   Weekend showers had been expected to boost soybean crop
prospects in dry areas of South America, particularly Brazil. But
precipitation was only scattered, leaving the crop's size in doubt
after a long arid stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharp gains in corn also helped support soybean prices, which
climbed higher than they've been since October.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn futures gained again in a continuation of the bullish
sentiments that have pushed prices 13 percent higher this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat also advanced on a buying day for commodities, despite
continued oversupplies of U.S. wheat that are expected to prevent
any strong gains in its price.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.66 a bushel; March
corn rose 4 1/2 cents to $2.27 1/4 a bushel; March oats rose 1 1/2 cents to
$1.14 a bushel; March soybeans rose 6 3/4 cents to $5.12 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Beef and pork futures were mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   February live cattle were unchanged at 69.82 cents a pound;
March feeder cattle fell .13 cent to 84.72 cents a pound; February
lean hogs fell .55 cent to 56.52 cents a pound; February frozen
pork bellies fell 2.30 cents to 87.55 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> SEC Head Advises Mutual Fund Buyers  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investors should look at mutual fund fees and other
factors besides past performance when choosing funds, and be wary of ads
boasting of triple-digit returns, the nation's top securities regulator said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "For heaven's sake, don't play into the performance game," Arthur Levitt,
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, warned investors in an
interview with The Associated Press. "Ask the tough questions, beware of high
fees ... and make your judgments thoughtful rather than emotional."
</P>
<P>
	   At a time when 177 mutual funds are posting annual gains of 100 percent or
more, investors also should look at a fund's costs, which can have a huge impact
on returns, Levitt said. A 1 percent higher annual fee will reduce a fund
investor's ending balance by 18 percent after 20 years, he noted.
</P>
<P>
	   The stakes are high. Some 83 million Americans now invest in mutual funds,
whose total assets are estimated at $6 trillion, up from around $1 trillion in
1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Levitt decried a recent proliferation of advertising by mutual fund
companies boasting of triple-digit returns that may have been pumped up by
profits from hot sales of stock of companies going public. Only the fine print
in the ads explains why the performance was so strong, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ads "play to people's emotions rather than their intellect," he
maintained.
</P>
<P>
	   Elizabeth Powell, a spokeswoman for the Investment Company Institute, a
group representing the mutual fund industry, said, "We take very seriously our
responsibility to help people have realistic expectations."
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Powell said the group has been looking into the matter of advertising.
"Anything of this magnitude we're going to look at and take seriously," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   John Brennan, ICI's president, who also is the chief executive of big fund
company Vanguard Group, has said advertising that touts triple-digit returns
isn't a desirable practice because it ultimately will disappoint investors.
</P>
<P>
	   A few highly profitable initial public offerings, especially of technology
stocks, can bring extremely impressive results for small mutual funds -- a
performance that might not be repeated when the funds grow larger.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some of these mutual fund performance ads are about as informative as
30-second political spots," said Marc Beauchamp, spokesman for the North
American Securities Administrators Association, which represents state
securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first case of its kind, the SEC last September went after a mutual
fund company for allegedly misleading investors in ads and disclosure documents
by not explaining how one of its funds made big first-year gains.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corp., agreed to pay $100,000 in
a settlement. It neither admitted to nor denied the SEC's allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Enforcement cases "that we have brought and others that we may bring suggest
that this advertising has really gone too far," Levitt said.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC is considering tightening the requirements for material included in
mutual fund prospectuses and other disclosure documents, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Intense competition among the thousands of mutual funds and the spectacular
performance last year of technology-based funds are believed to have caused the
blow-your-horn advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   "In times of market exuberance, the easiest way for funds or investment
advisers to compete is on the basis of superior performance," Levitt said. "From
the investor's point of view, that's a very dangerous road to follow."
</P>
<P>
	   Investors should be aware that chasing mutual fund performance can often
hurt their returns on funds and should comparison-shop for funds that match
their long-term financial goals and tolerance for risk, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   High-performing funds often fail to repeat their gains, and investors who
switch in and out of funds typically receive significantly lower returns than
those realized by people who buy and hold funds.
</P>
<P>
	   A record 177 mutual funds reported returns of 100 percent or higher last
year, according to an industry survey. Before 1999, no more than six funds had
doubled investors' money in any given year.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC's mutual fund tips are available on the Investor Assistance section
of the agency's Web site at www.sec.gov. The site also includes a mutual fund
cost calculator, designed to help investors compare the long-term impact of
sales charges, fees and expenses.

<HEADLINE> Scripps Earnings Up 5 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CINCINNATI (AP) -- The E.W. Scripps Co. posted a 5 percent increase in net
fourth-quarter earnings Monday thanks to strong gains at its specialty
television networks.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income was $45.8 million, or 58 cents per share, compared with $43.6
million, or 55 cents a share, a year ago. Revenues increased 7.5 percent to
$427.1 million, compared with $397.4 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings exceeded the expectations of analysts, who predicted Scripps would
duplicate last year's figure of 55 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   "Profits at Home &AMP; Garden Television quadrupled, the Food Network was
profitable a year ahead of schedule and we successfully launched our newest
network, Do It Yourself," said chairman William R. Burleigh.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Scripps newspapers, which operate in some of the country's
top-performing markets, reported fourth-quarter ad revenue growth of 9 percent,
among the best in the industry."
</P>
<P>
	   But Burleigh also noted that strong results in those areas were partially
offset by weakness in broadcast television and investment in new businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   "The difficult story at Scripps has been broadcast television. A number of
factors, some outside our control, have negatively affected business," he said.
"However, this year will be better. We're already seeing improvement with the
Super Bowl, the presidential election and the Olympics on the horizon."
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, net income was $146.9 million, or $1.86 a share, compared with
$131.2 million, or $1.62 a share. Revenue was up 7.2 percent to $1.56 billion,
compared with $1.44 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The E.W. Scripps Co. operates 19 daily newspapers, nine network-affiliated
television stations and three specialty networks. Its United Media is a
worldwide syndicator and licenser of news features and comics.

<HEADLINE> Grief times three: Seton Hall fire victims mourned at funeral  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LONG BRANCH, N.J. (AP) - The teen-age pallbearers cried all the way up
the aisle, their faces contorted, their sobs echoing off the marble floors and
wooden rafters of St. Jerome Roman Catholic Church.
<P>
	   In the pews, Frank S. Caltabilota Jr.'s classmates and friends listened
intently to the priest's words, dabbing at their noses with tissues and wiping
away tears.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother sat in a front pew, clutching a teddy bear, her husband's arm
draped over her shoulders.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why did Frankie have to die so young?" asked the Rev. Frederick Jackiewicz.
"We have no answers for these questions. We do not understand the ways of God.
We try to the best of our limited ability to understand, but we cannot."
</P>
<P>
	   The heartbreaking tableau was mirrored in two other New Jersey churches
Monday as three Seton Hall University freshmen who died in a dormitory fire were
laid to rest. Like Caltabilota, John Giunta, 18, of Vineland, and Aaron Karol,
18, of Green Brook, were remembered as upbeat, selfless, promising young men.
</P>
<P>
	   "We say that Seton Hall is a family, and it is," said the university's
chancellor, Thomas Peterson, who spoke at Karol's funeral Mass. "We, like
yourselves, have lost a son."
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   Caltabilota, 18, of West Long Branch, was a three-sport standout at Shore
Regional High School who aspired to a career in medicine. An honor student, he
compared himself in his Seton Hall application essay to a basketball player who
chooses to pass to an open teammate instead of shooting the ball himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "My school counselor says that I am a natural caretaker. Maybe she's right,"
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 800 people - some wearing letter jackets from Shore Regional and
Seton Hall - filled the church for the service. The 400 seats in the sanctuary
filled by 8:30 a.m., a full hour before the start. The rest were ushered
downstairs, where a video monitor was set up to broadcast the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   Caltabilota's 15-year-old brother, Thomas, read a "Dear Frankie" letter to
his brother at the start of the service in which he thanked him for being a
great brother.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're a hero to everyone you've ever known," he said. "You're a hero to
me. I love you. May you rest in peace."
</P>
<P>
	   Caltabilota's girlfriend, Erin Brown, 18, had to pause several times during
a five-minute eulogy to gather herself. "You touched the lives of so many
people, even if you'd only known them five minutes," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Karol and Giunta were mentioned by name during the service, and Jackiewicz -
who had served Holy Communion to Caltabilota at this same altar eight days
before - prayed for the recovery of the surviving fire victims.
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   In Dunellen, about 450 people crowded into St. John the Evangelist Roman
Catholic Church to say goodbye to Karol, a soccer enthusiast and criminal
justice major who hoped to someday work for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was just an all-round, near-perfect kid," said Jimmy Byrnes, 17, a
soccer teammate at Watchung Hills Regional High School. "He had everything -
sports, popularity, smarts."
</P>
<P>
	   Two friends read poems written in tribute to Karol, eliciting loud sobs from
the standing-room-only crowd, which included two pews filled with former
teammates, all wearing their black soccer jackets.
</P>
<P>
	   Weeping teen-agers carried the coffin down the aisle, followed by Karol's
parents, sister and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
	   "Learn from the loss of this young man how precious life is," said the Rev.
John Morley, a Seton Hall priest. "And it does not come with guarantees."
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   In Vineland, about 500 people - including three busloads of Seton Hall
students - turned out for Giunta's funeral Mass at St. Francis of Assissi Roman
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
	   Giunta, an elementary education major who aspired to teaching in the inner
city, was remembered as a generous, loyal guy with a great future.
</P>
<P>
	   "He seemed like he had a dream ahead of him. He knew what he wanted to do,"
said John Henderson, 21, of Vineland, a high school classmate.
</P>
<P>
	   Teary-eyed classmates sniffled, occasionally wiping their eyes with wads of
white tissues. Many consoled each other, holding hands or patting one another on
the back.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today our faith cannot answer the question why," the Rev. William Sheridan,
assistant director of campus ministry at Seton Hall, told mourners. "Why did
three die? Why did John die? Why?"
</P>
<P>
	   Giunta's grief-stricken father, Phillip, read a tribute that moved many to
tears.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a time of immense loss," said Msgr. Robert Sheeran, the
university's president, who rushed to the Mass after attending Caltabilota's
service.
</P>
<P>
	   There were prayers for the three elsewhere, too.
</P>
<P>
	   -In Rome, a group of American priests at the Vatican offered Mass for the
victims Monday, Morley said. One of the priests was a former Seton Hall faculty
member.
</P>
<P>
	   -In Washington, U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg read a resolution honoring the
three on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
	   -In Trenton, Gov. Christie Whitman departed from the prepared text of her
annual budget message to say, "We want the families to know they are in our
hearts and in our prayers."
</P>
<P>
	   At Seton Hall, meanwhile, some freshmen returned to their rooms at Boland
Hall for the first time since the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents of the first two floors were allowed to move back into their
rooms, while third, fourth and fifth floor residents were being relocated,
university officials said. The university banned media from the South Orange
campus from until a Tuesday memorial service.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire broke out around 4:30 a.m. Wednesday on the third floor of Boland
Hall, a six-story dormitory that housed 640 people. Five remained hospitalized
Monday, four in critical condition with burns.

<HEADLINE> Black Doctors Blast Managed Care  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL SHEPARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's largest association of black doctors blasted
the managed health care industry, saying HMOs are excluding them, reducing black
patients' choice in selecting physicians of a similar background.
</P>
<P>
	   "This practice is not only racist but ultimately compromises patient care.
Patients feel more involved in their health care decisions when they receive
care from doctors of a similar race," said Dr. Gary C. Dennis, past president of
the National Medical Association, a medical society representing more than
25,000 black doctors nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   However, independent studies of the situation do not support the doctors'
allegation, and a representative of the industry denied that HMOs are
discriminating against blacks, saying they "need a diverse network of providers"
who can relate well to patients.
</P>
<P>
	   The 13 black doctors who held a press conference Monday to bring attention
to the issue acknowledged that thus far they have little more than anecdotal
evidence of any widespread move by HMOs to keep them out. But they said they
hope greater public awareness will fuel further research and documentation of
what they see as the dearth of black professionals in the health maintenance
industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all know there is a problem but we haven't been able to quantify it
yet," said Dr. Walter Shervington, chief executive officer at the New Orleans
Adolescent Hospital and president of the National Medical Association. "No, we
don't have a Harvard University study on this, but we know a problem exists."
</P>
<P>
	   Shervington likened the situation to that of black drivers who insisted for
decades that police officers pulled them over at disproportionately high rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The complaints led to studies by the Department of Justice and other
government agencies that confirmed in some jurisdictions the practice of black
driver harassment by police now popularly known as "Driving While Black."
</P>
<P>
	   Thus far, independent study of the issue seems to debunk the black doctors'
claims.
</P>
<P>
	   A University of California at San Francisco study published in the March 4,
1998 Journal of American Medicine showed that nonwhite doctors were no more
likely than white doctors to be denied or terminated from HMO contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also showed that nonwhite doctors participated in HMOs in the same
numbers or greater than white doctors. The study covered 13 large urban counties
in California.
</P>
<P>
	   A representative of the nation's health care organization industry said a
problem of a racial nature may exist but that it doesn't stem from
discrimination by HMOs.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles M. Cutler, chief medical officer of the American Association of
Health Plans, said the percentage of black doctors in America is dwarfed by the
percentage of blacks in the general population and that disparity might give the
impression that HMOs exclude blacks.
</P>
<P>
	   About 4 percent of the nation's 700,000 practicing physicians are black,
according to figures from the American Medical Association and the National
Medical Association. Blacks make up about 12 percent of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
	   "Frankly we were taken aback by the news conference this morning because we
don't understand why anyone would think managed care organizations would do
this," Cutler said. "We need a diverse network of providers because people want
doctors who can relate well to them."
</P>
<P>
	   He said he'd be happy to talk with the National Medical Association about
the matter, but said, "It does not seem to be a problem of substance. It's more
a problem of perception."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesperson for the health care organizations said her group was
preparing a letter to the National Medical Association to meet and discuss the
issue.

<HEADLINE> Waste, Fraud and Abuse a GOP Target  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans are citing billions of dollars
in federal overpayments and other waste as the GOP dusts off waste, fraud and
abuse as budget-cutting targets for this election year.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee, released a list Monday that claims $221 billion in wasted government
money, some of it dating to the 1980s. The paper, which compiled past findings
by agencies' inspectors general and the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative arm, cited $90 billion in unpaid taxes and $12.6 billion in
estimated Medicare overpayments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the reasons people are losing faith in government is because it
can't be counted on to spend taxpayers' dollars properly,'' Thompson said in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, planned to
release his own study next week chronicling more than $19 billion in waste he
calls ``just the tip of the iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
	   That survey, also recounting past audits by other agencies, cited
overpayments under Medicare, veterans' benefits and other programs. It noted
shoddy bookkeeping by the Defense Department and other agencies that Kasich said
meant hundreds of billions of dollars were improperly accounted for.
</P>
<P>
	   Improper handling of the people's money has been a favorite theme of
Presidents Clinton and Reagan and countless earlier administrations.
Congressional Republicans hope resurrecting the issue will boost their prospects
at the polls in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Casting reductions in spending as cutting into government waste can provide
Republicans with rationale for paring the budget, even as vast surpluses have
left voters feeling little urgency to make cuts. Focusing on waste also can help
soften the image of a GOP that five years ago sought to eliminate the Education
Department and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's more political popularity to reducing waste, fraud and abuse than
there is to reducing the size of government,'' said Marshall Wittmann,
congressional affairs director for the conservative Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   While promising to attack waste seems popular on its face, the effort faces
several obstacles.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans haven't decided exactly how to do it, with GOP senators
generally less enthusiastic than their House counterparts about the campaign.
And in an election year, some Republicans seem reluctant to target waste in
Medicare, food stamps and other popular programs.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the political payoff may be limited because Democrats say they
won't be outmaneuvered and will join in eliminating any valid problems
uncovered.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think we should lose sight of the problem just because we have
burgeoning surpluses,'' said Rep. John Spratt of South Carolina, ranking
Democrat on the Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   With government waste often in the eyes of the beholder, powerful
constituencies in and out of Congress frequently succeed in protecting targeted
programs. This leads analysts to question whether much will be achieved beyond
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In terms of actually getting something done, I think it's problematic,
because it's an election year,'' said Tom Schatz, president of the conservative
Citizens Against Government Waste.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, have promised to move forward. They have no specific strategy
beyond Kasich's report and his plans to hold a hearing on it.
</P>
<P>
	   One partisan benefit of the campaign: It implicitly blames the Clinton
administration. That includes the leading Democratic presidential contender,
Vice President Al Gore, who led a ``reinventing government'' effort begun in
1993 that the White House says has cut more than 350,000 federal jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republicans are being an echo to Al Gore's voice,'' Gore campaign
spokesman Chris Lehane countered, citing successes in streamlining government.
</P>
<P>
	   Erasing waste, fraud and abuse will join other GOP themes this year on
Capitol Hill, including cutting taxes, reducing the national debt and protecting
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   It is hard to say definitively how successful past efforts to trim waste
have been, largely because there is no objective, nonpolitical way to do it.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration says ``reinventing government'' has saved $137 billion;
Republicans dispute that.
</P>
<P>
	   Citizens Against Government Waste says $625 billion has been saved since
1984, when the Reagan-era Grace Commission made recommendations. Schatz, the
group's president, said that's not very much, considering that the savings took
15 years.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Targets Male-Female Pay Gap  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton appealed Monday to members of Congress
to ``do the right thing'' by closing the wage gap between working women and men.
He suggested they could start by approving his $27 million plan to bolster
enforcement of equal pay laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I made this request last year, and Congress failed to pass it,'' Clinton
said as he looked out at about 10 lawmakers who attended the White House
ceremony where he announced the proposal. ``I hope you will help us do this.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the chairmen of two House committees that deal with workforce issues
noted that money for equal employment enforcement already is at its highest
level ever. They accused Clinton of trying to gain a political advantage by
timing his announcement to coincide with the Iowa presidential caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is no accident that he has repackaged an initiative that went nowhere
last year and unveiled it on the day that the election season officially
begins,'' Reps. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., and John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a joint
statement. ``We are optimistic that women voters will see through this flawed
initiative and realize that it would serve primarily to ensure full employment
for lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president coupled his appeal with a request for Congress to approve a
paycheck fairness act proposed by Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D. and Rep. Rosa
DeLauro, D-Conn., which would direct federal agencies to collect data about wage
disparities and increase penalties for violating equal-pay statutes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pass it. It's a good bill. There is no excuse not to pass it,'' Clinton
said. ``We need to clearly send the message that wage discrimination against
women is just as unacceptable as discrimination based on race or ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was joined by Michelle Akers, a member of the U.S. women's World Cup
championship soccer team. Akers and her teammates have been boycotting training
because they say they are paid less than the men's soccer team. They want raises
from $3,150 per month to $5,000, plus bonuses of $2,000 per game.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to stand here today for the women who have no voice,'' Akers said.
``Women's sports and the view of women has changed a ton. However, we still have
a ways to go. The battle is not over. We are still being discriminated
against.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sharon Long, of Baltimore, was testament to that. The lone female purchasing
agent for a heating and air conditioning wholesaler, she lost her job in 1994
after she suspected she was paid far less than her male counterparts and asked
for a raise. She filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission and some years later, her case was settled for $200,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Justice prevailed for me, but I know there are many more women out there
going through the same experience I survived,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
	   Women earn an average of 75 cents for every $1 men are paid, a disparity
Clinton has noted in the past as evidence of social injustice. For women of
color, he said, the disparity is even greater: 64 cents for black women and 55
cents for Hispanic women.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How would you like to show up for work every day, but only get to take
home three out of every four paychecks?'' Clinton asked. ``It's not a women's
issue. If a woman with a family is being denied equal pay for equal work, then
her husband suffers. Her children suffer. The family dynamic suffers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under Clinton's plan, $10 million would go to the EEOC to train up to 3,000
employers and 1,000 staff inspectors about equal pay laws. Last year, Clinton
proposed a similar, $14 million initiative that failed.
</P>
<P>
	   It would be the first time since the EEOC took responsibility for
enforcement of equal pay laws in 1978 that the agency had money to train
inspectors on the subject. The agency also would produce public service
announcements.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department would receive $17 million to help train women for jobs
where they have been underrepresented, particularly in the high-technology
sector, through career centers the department supports and apprenticeships. The
department also would help employers improve their pay policies and strengthen
public-private partnerships.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Plunge; Dow Ends Down 243.54  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged today as optimism about corporate earnings
gave way to jitters about rising interest rates and their impact on profit
growth.
</P>
<P>
	   According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
243.54 to close at 11,008.17, its steepest loss since Jan. 4, when it lost 359
points.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators also fell in a volatile session. The Nasdaq
plummeted 139.54 points, its worst loss since Jan. 5, when it lost 150 points.
</P>
<P>
	   After a strong opening, stocks collapsed at midday as investors looked ahead
to the next meeting of the Federal Reserve on Feb. 1 and 2. Many on Wall Street
now fear that an interest rate increase at that meeting will be the first of
several this year as the central bank works to stave off inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the Fed raised interest rates three times, hoping to keep inflation
under control. While most economists see few hints of inflation, continued signs
of economic strength have convinced some economists that inflation could
escalate at any time.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Jack Guynn acknowledged
that last year's rate increases had little effect on economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no broad-scale evidence to show that those three increases have
done anything to dampen consumer demand," he said, although he noted that it
takes several months to see the full impact of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Guynn's comments unnerved investors a day before Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan's planned testimony before a Senate committee about the federal
budget. While his comments are not expected to specifically address interest
rates, Fed watchers will carefully monitor his comments for any signs of the
Fed's course, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's become a foregone conclusion that interest rates are on the rise, and
no matter how much, that hurts investors' psyche," said Arthur Hogan, chief
market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The broadness and the depth of today's selloff suggested that other factors
were at hand. Traders said some investors sold stocks to collect profits from a
solid rise in the Nasdaq last week. High-tech leaders like Cisco Systems and Sun
Microsystems fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Hogan said, investors are greeting Corporate America's strong earnings
reports with a pessimistic eye.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a lot of speculation about whether these numbers will be
repeatable," he said. Companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 are on track to
report average profit growth of 20 percent for the fourth quarter, and those
numbers will become especially tough to match if interest rates continue to
rise, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong corporate earnings convinced some investors to buy today. Eastman
Kodak rose after reporting it earned $1.27 per share in the fourth quarter,
beating analysts' estimates of $1.24. Kodak, which has faltered in recent years
due to tougher competition from Fuji, also issued a strong outlook for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble edged higher after calling off talks to acquire drug makers
Warner-Lambert and American Home Products. Procter &AMP; Gamble's share price had
tumbled 17 percent since rumors of a deal first emerged last week, as many
shareholders believed the company would have to issue significant amounts of new
stock to pay for the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner, fresh from its $145 billion merger with America Online, fell
after announcing plans to merge its music business with British music company
EMI Group PLC.

<HEADLINE> Big settlement means new start for Cayugas, says attorney  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - New York state should pay a minimum $335 million
to the Cayuga Indian Nation to settle a two-century-old illegal land deal, money
the tribe can use to pay for its rebirth, the Cayugas' attorney said Monday.
<P>
	   "The numbers involved in this case are very large, they are very
considerable. But they cover a substantial amount of land, they cover a
substantial period of time," attorney Martin R. Gold told a nine-member jury as
the Cayugas' historic damages trial got under way in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
	   "This case is about providing the Cayugas' a sum that they can use to get
themselves started again," Gold said. "They could acquire land, they could build
some buildings ... they could make a home again."
</P>
<P>
	   Jurors were cautioned, though, by Assistant State Attorney General David B.
Roberts, who said he would show that the Cayugas were asking for too much money
and already had been adequately paid for the land.
</P>
<P>
	   "This award should not be based on speculation, and, of course, it shouldn't
be based on sympathy," Roberts said. "We are asking you to do a factual,
empirical, scientific study. It should be a decision based on sound facts."
</P>
<P>
	   Jurors are to determine how much money the Cayugas should receive for 64,015
acres - 100 square miles - of lost ancestral land in Seneca and Cayuga counties.
Presiding U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn previously ruled that the land was
illegally acquired by New York state in 1795 and 1807 because the state did not
obtain the federal government's required approval for the transactions.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury will decide how much the Cayugas should be compensated for the
current market value of their lost lands as well as what rent they should be
paid for its occupancy and use over 205 years. It is the first of four pending
New York land claim cases to reach the damages phase.
</P>
<P>
	   McCurn has said the jury cannot award any land and that no present-day
property owners in the claim area would face eviction.
</P>
<P>
	   "To just kick everyone off and return the land to the Cayugas would be
trying to right an ancient wrong with a modern-day wrong," Gold told the jury,
although he said the tribe would use the money to buy land from willing sellers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayugas, who once spread out over 3 million acres of upstate New York,
are the only landless tribe among the five aboriginal tribes of the Iroquois
Confederacy. Currently, about 500 Cayugas live in western New York on and around
the Seneca's Cattaraugus reservation. Two other groups of Cayugas live in Canada
and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys began by outlining the trial for the nine jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   Gold said the Cayugas would not call any witnesses and instead rely on the
federal government's single witness, a real estate appraiser who has placed the
land's current market value at $264.7 million and its rental value at $70.5
million.
</P>
<P>
	   The state, however, expected to call several witnesses and finish its case
with testimony from its own expert appraiser, who put the land's current worth
at between $25 million and $40 million and its rental value at no more than $6
million.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the testimony will be about the different methods the two appraisers
used to do their calculations. On Monday, the attorneys took turns trumpeting
their side's method while telling jurors about the flaws it would show in the
other side's approach.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our role here is as tribal guardian," said Hank Meshorer, the lead attorney
for the U.S. Justice Department, suggesting the federal government's appraiser
was more credible. "The United States has nothing to gain or lose in this case.
He was told to appraise the land's value. No more, no less."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the differences, the state's appraiser calculated the land's value by
considering it as a large single tract, while the federal government's appraiser
figured it out as smaller subdivisions and used different formulas covering
three separate time periods.
</P>
<P>
	   Each side also used a different percentage to derive at the land's rental
value. The state based its results on 2 percent of the property's market value
and the federal government used 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts said jurors also would hear evidence that New York has been paying
the Cayugas a $1,800 annuity ever since purchasing the land in 1795.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is expected to last two to three weeks.

<HEADLINE> Congress Returns to Work  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress convened Monday with a blend of prayer and
political jousting, ready to confront an election-year agenda topped by tax cuts
and health care. Democrats were buffeted by Virginia Rep. Virgil Goode's
decision to become an independent.
</P>
<P>
	   Within moments of the opening gavel, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said
Republicans would push for an early vote on legislation granting citizenship to
Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban boy at the center of a politically charged custody
battle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Make the senators positive, courageous problem solvers,'' chaplain Lloyd
Ogilvie prayed from the Senate rostrum as Congress' long winter break came to an
end. ``Give them an unprecedented sense of oneness and unity to lead this great
nation together.''
</P>
<P>
	   The words were far less soothing in the House, where Democratic Rep. Lloyd
Doggett of Texas launched the first partisan attack within minutes of the
session's opening.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Reports that the House is returning to work today are inaccurate,'' he
said. ``This House will complete month one of the new millennium with no action
... on any of the major issues that this country faces. Nothing on education,
nothing on Social Security, nothing on the environment, nothing on tax reform or
prescription drugs for seniors.''
</P>
<P>
	   Doggett's sharply worded remarks reflected an underlying political struggle
in a year in which the presidency, all 435 House seats and 33 Senate seats will
be on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   The House, in particular, had a new look, a new carpet -- in a lighter shade
of blue -- as well as new wiring for the sound system.
</P>
<P>
	   January is customarily a slow month in Congress -- whether Republicans or
Democrats are in charge -- since lawmakers prefer to wait for the president's
State of the Union address and budget proposals before tackling key issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton speaks before Congress and a nationwide television audience on
Thursday and will unveil his budget 10 days later.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House and House Republicans have been laying out their agenda for
several days in advance of the session, the last of Clinton's two-term
presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert last week outlined a plan under which the
government's $3.7 trillion publicly held debt could be paid off by 2015,
assuming that Congress didn't dip into the Social Security trust fund surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   House Republicans intend to move quickly to bring legislation to the floor
to ease the so-called ``marriage penalty,'' and Majority Leader Dick Armey said
in an interview a bill would soon follow to provide education tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
	   Armey, R-Texas, also said the House will act early in the year on
legislation to revitalize communities where economic growth is stagnant.
</P>
<P>
	   House Republicans also intend to pass legislation relating to HMOs and some
sort of prescription drug benefit for Medicare, bills that Democrats first
placed on the agenda and that some GOP aides privately have said must pass if
the party is to hold the House next fall.
</P>
<P>
	   House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, R-Mo., in an interview, said, ``it
remains to be seen if they really are moving ... to the middle to the point''
where compromise is possible.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats will continue to push also for a minimum wage increase and
stricter gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Gephardt said that he was ``open and receptive to smaller tax
cut ideas,'' now that Republicans have decided to shelve a $792 billion plan
that was vetoed last year.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Senate, Lott, said debate could begin on the citizenship bill as
early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., the lead sponsor of the bill to grant citizenship
to Gonzalez, said the measure would ``move the decision-making out the hands of
the INS and into the hands of the (state) courts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, Lott has said little about his agenda for the year, although he
arranged to begin sketching out his plans at a Chamber of Commerce breakfast
speech Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Goode's decision served as an opening-day reminder of the political stakes.
</P>
<P>
	   His announcement, faxed on campaign stationery, said he would run for
re-election as an independent and cast his votes ``on the basis of what I
believe is in the best interests of the Fifth District and not on a particular
party position.''
</P>
<P>
	   He is expected to announce within two weeks whether he will caucus with
either party for the balance of this year.
</P>
<P>
	   His decision was a blow to Democrats, who are struggling to gain control of
the House in the fall elections. Goode's move means that Republicans command a
majority of 222-211, with two independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Gephardt said his party would continue to protect the second-term
conservative's committee assignments and added that ``when Democrats regain the
House in January 2001,'' Goode would be welcome to return to the party.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy Bill Filed in Congress  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress bestowed American citizenship on Winston
Churchill and Mother Teresa, and awarded it posthumously to Raul Wallenberg, the
Swedish diplomat who saved tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews in World War II.
But the extraordinary power has been used rarely -- and never for a minor child
against a parent's wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and a group of Florida
lawmakers put in motion a process to give citizenship to 6-year-old Cuban
refugee Elian Gonzalez, without his father's consent.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott, R-Miss., told the Senate the bill ``to grant citizenship to this young
boy'' could come up for debate as soon as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors hoped to whisk it through Congress quickly, largely to remove the
case from the jurisdiction of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which
has ruled that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba. Passage would
also render moot a federal court appeal of the INS ruling by Elian's
great-uncle, sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This moves the decision-making out of the hands of the INS and into the
hands of the (state) courts,'' Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., the chief Senate
sponsor, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton did not
believe Congress should get involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a real danger here that this can become a political issue, that
this young boy will be a political football,'' Lockhart said. ``And I think the
president has made it very clear to everyone that they ought to stay away from
politics here and stick to what the facts and the law dictate.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Mack said, ``There has been political influence even from the beginning
in the case,'' including rallies in Havana that Mack said were orchestrated by
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Senate Judiciary Committee's top
Democrat, denounced the legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the Congress to grant citizenship to a young boy over the father's
objection makes a mockery of family values, and it hands Castro yet another
reason to portray the United States as the enemy,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the high-profile examples of Churchill, Mother Teresa and
Wallenberg, Congress has used this power rarely and selectively. Its involvement
in individual immigration cases has declined sharply over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about half a dozen private immigration bills are introduced each year,
but most of them deal with advancing a pending case, trying to prevent a
deportation or helping an American employed overseas retain citizenship. Some
examples:
</P>
<P>
	   --In July 1997, Swiss banker Christoph Meili won permanent residency status.
He had lost his job after saving Holocaust-era bank documents from a shredder.
</P>
<P>
	   --In 1968, three men -- from Italy, Ireland and Germany -- who died while
fighting with American units in Vietnam, posthumously received U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   --In December 1975, Mrika Mrnacaj, a 111-year-old Albanian immigrant who
wanted to vote in a U.S. election before she died, won citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   --In 1988, Michael Wilding, the son of actress Elizabeth Taylor and a former
stepson of Sen. John Warner, R-Va., won citizenship. The British subject had
renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1971, and the bill blocked a possible
deportation on a marijuana possession conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   --In that same year, 1988, Congress rejected legislation that would have let
tennis star Ivan Lendl bypass the five-year waiting period for American
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of immigration bills fell off dramatically after the Abscam
scandal in the early 1980s when FBI agents posing as Arab sheiks asked members
of Congress to introduce private immigration bills to allow wealthy ``Arabs'' to
enter the United States in exchange for money.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining Mack and Lott in sponsoring the bill for Elian Gonzalez were Sens.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., and Bob Graham, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   In the House, Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas; and several Florida
lawmakers co-sponsored a similar bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Reps. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., and Peter
Deutsch, D-Fla, introduced a rival bill to grant Elian permanent residency
status.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will give Elian the choice, when he's old enough, to decide the
citizenship question for himself,'' Menendez said.
</P>
<P>
	   John Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said no
decision had yet been made on how to proceed in the House -- whether to try to
bring the bill to the floor directly, or to let the House Judiciary Committee
consider it first.
</P>
<P>
	   Although not a sponsor, Hastert supports the bill and ``he'll help to
advance it,'' said Feehery.

<HEADLINE> American Home Sued for Concealment  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK -- American Home Products, already facing thousands of lawsuits
related to its once popular diet drugs, was sued on Monday by its marketing
partner Interneuron Pharmaceuticals for allegedly concealing the health risks of
the pills.
</P>
<P>
	   Lexington, Mass.-based Interneuron is seeking unspecified damages against
American Home in the suit filed in the Superior Court of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   In the complaint, Interneuron accuses American Home of deliberately
concealing information regarding possible health risks associated with the use
of "fen-phen," a combination of the anti-obesity drugs Pondimin (fenfluramine)
and phentermine.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said the information was vital to help it assess the safety of
Redux, a chemical cousin of Pondimin, which was developed by Interneuron and
marketed by AHP.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home's failure to disclose the safety risks from February 1997
through June 1997 prevented Interneuron from taking action, including possibly
moving to take Redux off the market earlier, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said it lost the opportunity to disclose the safety problems to
its shareholders, the financial markets and regulatory agencies, according to
the suit. Such action would have helped protect its reputation, which was hurt
when the drugs were banned, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a result of AHP's fraudulent activities, Interneuron suffered serious
financial loss, including a decrease in its market capitalization of hundreds of
millions of dollars," said Glenn L. Cooper, president and chief executive
officer of Interneuron.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home denied any wrongdoing with respect to its contractual
obligations with Interneuron. A spokesman said American Home also disclosed all
safety data on its anti-obesity drugs to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
	   Pondimin and Redux were taken off the market in September 1997. Pondimin was
made and marketed by American Home, while Redux was developed by Interneuron and
marketed by American Home.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron is now facing more than 2,000 lawsuits related to Redux.
</P>
<P>
	   In October 1999, American Home agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle
thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to
fen-phen. But the settlement has not been finalized, and attorneys said many
clients will opt-out of the agreement so they can sue on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home's legal problems are one reason the company is having trouble
completing its proposed merger with Warner-Lambert. Warner-Lambert is now in
talks to merge with Pfizer Inc., putting the deal with American Home in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said it has tried for two years to negotiate a settlement with
American Home to indemnify Interneuron from lawsuits related to the diet drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said American Home first learned of health dangers of fen-phen
as early as February 1997, when it received information from the Mayo Clinic.
The Mayo Clinic had collected information from patients who had developed heart
valve damage after taking the drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the chemical similarity between Pondimin and Redux, American Home
should have immediately alerted Interneuron of the information, the complaint
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Interneuron said American Home waited until July 1997 to reveal the
information.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home withheld the data on the Mayo study because it feared the
results would have on the diet drugs' sales, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
	   In July 1997, the Mayo Clinic announced that it had received reports of 24
cases in which patients using fen-phen had been diagnosed with cardiac valve
disease. In September 1997, the companies removed Pondimin and Redux from the
market.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Interneuron fell 50 cents to $3 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Shares
of American Home fell $5 to $43 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani complains NYC is getting shorted on school aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani complained to
state legislators Monday that his city is continuing to get shorted on state
school aid.
<P>
	   New York City educates approximately 38 percent of all public school
students in the state, but receives only about 36 percent of state education
aid, according to Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have more than demonstrated our ability to turn around fundamentally
flawed systems ... we've produced tangible results - reducing crime, ending
dependency and creating private-sector jobs," Giuliani said. "But in order to
continue to turn around the education system in New York City, it's critical
that the state allocate to the city its fair share of education aid."
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's hearing was the first in a series that the state Senate Finance
Committee and the state Assembly Ways and Means Committee will hold jointly into
the 2000-01 state budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The difference between the number of students and the amount of state aid to
education in New York City means that the city is being shortchanged by about
$250 million in the state budget for fiscal 2000-01 proposed by Gov. George
Pataki, according to the mayor. The spending plan would allocate $4.64 billion
in aid for New York City schools out of the overall state funding of $12.9
billion for education.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani said he would use the additional $250 million for accountability
reforms at the Board of Education, which, according to the mayor, has been an
obstacle to meaningful change in the schools in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've put job protection ahead of our children's education," Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's Budget Division quibbled with the numbers Giuliani used on state
school aid going to the city. Budget spokesman Joseph Conway said the
administration believes the amount of aid doled out on the basis of the number
of students in a district is the best gauge of aid levels. Under that standard,
city districts get nearly 38 percent of the state's aid total while the city has
just over 37 percent of the state's students, Conway said.
</P>
<P>
	   Following a meeting with state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, Giuliani
told reporters that he supported abolishing principal tenure and introducing a
system of merit differential and productivity pay. The Senate passed the
principal tenure legislation Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki also had a cordial meeting with Giuliani Monday and the two
Republicans said they agreed about far more than they disagreed about.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor said the state would provide the city with its fair share of
aid, if special initiatives like his "Teachers for Tomorrow" program are created
by the Legislature. It would provide state money for local districts to give
tuition reimbursement to teachers who agree to teach in troubled urban
districts. Most of the money under that program would go to New York City,
Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think that, on balance, our budget is fair to all elements of the
state," Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor suggested the hiring of outside consultants to review state funded
programs at the Board of Education in order to judge their effectiveness. There
may be a need, he stressed, to fund these programs outside of the board
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani also proposed turning the management of certain schools on the
Schools Under Registration Review (SURR) list over to private educational
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   SURR schools are low-performing schools that are under special watch from
state and city officials. In order to be taken off the SURR list, schools must
meet prescribed performance standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani again proposed that legislation be enacted to make the education
system in New York City accountable to mayor, effective on the first day of the
next mayor's term. Similar proposals made by Giuliani in the past have failed.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you gave me money for law enforcement I could guarantee results, if you
gave me money for welfare reform I could give you results," Giuliani said. "But
if you give me money for education I can't guarantee results because the board
of education has an accountability problem."
</P>
<P>
	   Later in the hearing, Peter F. Vallone, the speaker of the New York City
Council said that he supported Giuliani's proposal to eliminate the Board of
Education.
</P>
<P>
	   "Since, 1995 I have called for the elimination of the Board of Education,
replacing it with a Chancellor who is appointed by the Mayor and approved by the
City Council," Vallone said. "I want to stress approval by the city council."

<HEADLINE> Va. Rep. Goode Leaving Democrats  </HEADLINE>
   By KIA SHANT'E BREAUX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCKY MOUNT, Va. (AP) -- Two-term Democratic Rep. Virgil Goode announced
Monday that he will seek re-election as an independent, a move that could
complicate his old party's hopes of retaking control of the House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've always voted independently of any party position, and I plan to
continue doing that,'' Goode said.
</P>
<P>
	   Goode's habit of voting consistently against President Clinton and with
other House Republicans had already created friction with some Democratic
leaders in his district, which includes Charlottesville and tobacco-growing
regions to the south.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republicans hold a 222-212 majority in the House, with only one
independent, Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
	   Goode, 53, has not said whether he will caucus with the Democrats or with
the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is just the latest good news in our quest to add to our majority in
the House,'' said Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, chairman of the National
Republican Campaign Committee, who said Goode is welcome in the GOP caucus.
``Any hope the Democrats had of winning back the House just ended.''
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia Democrats tried to put a positive spin on Goode's move.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Virgil Goode's statement is a blow to Republicans who were confidently
predicting that he would be joining the Republican Congressional Conference and
caucusing with them,'' said Kenneth Plum, chairman of the state Democratic
party.
</P>
<P>
	   Goode was elected to Congress in 1996 to fill the seat left vacant when
Democratic Rep. L.F. Payne ran unsuccessfully in 1997 for lieutenant governor.
Before that, he had spent 23 years in the Virginia Senate.

<HEADLINE> Anglican Bishop Backs Law on Gays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- An Anglican bishop on Monday joined Scotland's Catholic
cardinal in supporting a law that bans promoting homosexuality in schools, which
the Labor Party government wants repealed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rt. Rev. James Jones, bishop of Liverpool, said that English society
should acknowledge ``that those who give moral and social priority to marriage
are not necessarily homophobic.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jones' comments, which he wrote for London's Daily Telegraph, added to the
controversy in Scotland, where Cardinal Thomas Winning has denounced gay sex.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would not surprise me to discover a silent majority who believe that
children should be taught that the family based on marriage is morally and
socially expedient,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, the leader of the state
Church of England, also joined the debate, saying that while he deplored
anti-gay prejudice, he resisted ``placing homosexual relationships on an equal
footing with marriage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's aides reiterated that the government is
determined to repeal the law -- know as Section 28 after its clause number in a
bill passed by the Conservative Party government, which lost power in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Government officials argue that the law inhibits staff in local authorities,
which run many schools and colleges, from counseling gay and lesbian people, and
makes it difficult for teachers to stop bullying of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have seen outbreaks of homophobic bullying, we have gay and lesbian
pupils and indeed adults feeling that they had got no response from the
authorities for addressing their problems,'' said government minister Lord
Whitty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are talking about here is discrimination against a significant
minority of our citizens, many of whom find themselves in quite serious
emotional difficulty,'' he added in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Scotland's new separate Parliament is responsible for repealing the law in
Scotland. In England and Wales, the repeal would be by the House of Commons in
London which has not yet debated the issue. In the Edinburgh Parliament, the
debate is already under way.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All over Europe, an active and militant homosexual lobby is pushing for
greater power and the threat to the Christian family is very real,'' Winning,
leader of the 750,000 Catholics among the 5 million Scots, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   He has said that homosexuals should be celibate, and discrimination against
them in the recruitment of teachers, sports coaches, soldiers and as adoptive
parents is legitimate.

<HEADLINE> Study Sees Little Market for Hemp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Industrial hemp, the non-hallucinogenic cousin of
marijuana that can be used in both clothing and food, will never have anything
but a ``small, thin market'' in the United States, a government study says.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the hemp fiber, yarn and fabric that the United States currently
imports could be grown on less than 2,000 acres of land, says the study by the
Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service.
</P>
<P>
	   The study raises questions about efforts by farmers in a number of states to
get the federal government to legalize production of industrial hemp.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine states -- Arkansas, California, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, Montana,
New Mexico, North Dakota and Virginia -- passed pro-hemp bills last year that
provide for research, study or potential production of the crop, and the first
U.S. test plots were planted in Hawaii last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 35,000 acres were grown last year in Canada, which legalized hemp
production in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The USDA study, which was released Friday, doesn't see much demand for any
of hemp's uses:
</P>
<P>
	   --As a fiber, it's main competitor is linen, which is made from flax. There
is little textile flax production in the United States, despite the lack of
legal barriers, and that suggests there wouldn't be enough demand for hemp fiber
to make it profitable, the study said.
</P>
<P>
	   --Hemp seeds and flour are being added to nutrition bars, tortilla chips and
other food items. USDA says that will probably remain a small use, comparable to
the market for sesame and poppy seeds.
</P>
<P>
	   --As for hemp oil, it can't be used for frying, it has a short shelf life,
and it hasn't been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a salad oil.

<HEADLINE> Whitman pushes $9.4 billion school construction plan, tax breaks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman said Monday the state should
tap in to a national settlement with big tobacco to pay for a $9.4 billion
school construction plan and pitched a tax rebate for the working poor and lower
unemployment insurance taxes for all New Jersey workers. The proposals were
cotained in her annual budget address, delivered to a joint session of the state
Legislature.
<P>
	   The Republican governor said her record $21.3 billion state budget built on
tax dollars from a robust national economy provides New Jersey with a
"prosperity dividend" that enables her to pump up spending and return some
dollars back to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Let's use this dividend not to just build on what we've accomplished, but
to do even more for our fellow New Jerseyans," Whitman said in a 34-minute
speech interrupted 29 times by applause.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman proposed a plan for how New Jersey should spend the approximately
$300 million a year the state will receive over the next quarter century from a
national tobacco settlement. The governor said two-thirds of the money should be
spent on health programs. Whitman said she, Senate President Donald DiFrancesco
and Assembly Speaker Jack Collins agree the other third - about $100 million a
year - should pay for school construction.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey is under court order to refurbish old and crumbling schools in
many of its poorest school districts. Whitman, however, says other districts
should also get dollars for school construction. The plan calls for $5 billion
in funding for 30 "special needs" school districts and $4.4 billion for all
other districts.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget Whitman is proposing for the fiscal year that begins in July
would tap only about $12 million from the tobacco settlement for school
construction. She wants to use $123 million of those dollars to help pay for
hospital charity care.
</P>
<P>
	   However, beginning with the budget year that begins in July 2002, Whitman
said the state should spend $100 million a year from tobacco money for school
construction.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ours will be the biggest school construction and modernization program in
America," Whitman said. "Using the money from the tobacco settlement ... as well
as lottery and cigarette tax receipts, we will begin an up to $10 billion effort
to make every school building and every classroom conducive to learning."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers, however, have not yet agreed on a plan to dole out the school
construction dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman called for an earned income tax credit for the working poor. She
said the plan would provide tax credits for working families earning $20,000 or
less. Because the state does not tax families at this level, the credit would
mean cash for these families. The governor said after a four year phase-in,
families with incomes of $20,000 would receive a $480 credit. Families earning
$15,000 would receive $707.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan would cost the state budget $48 million this year. After the
four-year phase-in, that's expected to rise to $106 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman also proposed a tax savings for all who work in New Jersey -
including out-of-state residents who commute into the Garden State. The governor
wants to reduce by $42.40 a year the amount workers contribute to the
unemployment insurance tax. The cut would last for two years.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also wants to reduce employer contributions to the fund by $260
million over the next two years. She said the fund has a big surplus because of
the bountiful economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget proposes spending $250 million for road construction projects
without raising gas taxes, $70 million more to fund the start-up of a FamilyCare
subsidized health insurance program, and a $482 million boost in state aid to
public schools. It calls for a wide range of capital projects, including a new
minimum security prison. She also proposes adding $39 million to develop
programs for emotionally disturbed children.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Negotiators Plan Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With three weeks to go and not even a draft agreement in
sight, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators announced plans Monday for marathon
negotiations aimed at meeting a Feb. 13 deadline on the outline of a final
status agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Ehud Barak, limping on the Syrian track, is eager to show
results with the Palestinians. His office said in a release Monday that
negotiations would be held on several levels ``with the intent of speeding up
the talks.''
</P>
<P>
	   The talks will likely start Feb. 1, somewhere near Washington, according to
Palestinian officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They will address
the sensitive issues of borders, Palestinian refugees, the status of Jerusalem
and the future of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the renewed effort, Barak's office said he will most likely not
travel to Davos this weekend for a proposed summit with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and President Clinton, citing scheduling problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli media said Barak is reluctant to hold talks with the two leaders now
because he is concerned about being pressured into making concessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the renewed efforts, Israeli negotiator Oded Eran said Monday the
February deadline would be ``very difficult'' to meet.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak, elected in May on a platform of thawing peace talks frozen by his
hard-line predecessor, ambitiously set the February deadline for the outline of
an agreement. He predicted permanent peace agreements with the Palestinians and
the Syrians by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The renewed talks with the Syrians have proven more complex than he
realized, however, and have sidetracked him from the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Palestinian officials, Barak's distractions have meant that
there is not even a draft of an outline agreement, three weeks before the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks with the Syrians have all but collapsed over demilitarization and
border issues and -- to the Palestinians' delight -- Barak has returned to the
Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
	   His renewed involvement appeared to spur the resolution of disagreements
over the implementation of an interim agreement -- a side issue that had
nonetheless also dogged the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said after his 3 1/2-hour meeting
with Eran on Monday that they had reached an agreement on a delayed Israeli
troop withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank. The withdrawal, which had
been scheduled for Jan. 20, will now take place by Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians want the Israelis to hand over Arab suburbs of Jerusalem,
currently under joint control, to full Palestinian control in the next
withdrawal. Israel has resisted, apparently hoping the Palestinians would settle
for the suburbs as a substitute for Jerusalem in the final status agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   It is precisely because the Palestinians do not want the suburbs to cloud
the Jerusalem issue that they want full control now.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have reached an agreement satisfactory to both sides,'' Erekat said
when asked about the suburbs as he was leaving the luxury hotel on Jerusalem's
east-west divide, where the meeting took place.
</P>
<P>
	   Talk of returning Abu Dis, Azzariya and A-Ram outrages Israeli hard-liners,
including Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, who conjure images of a redivision of
Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Abu Dis lies only a few yards away from the Temple Mount,'' Olmert said,
referring to a site holy to Muslims and Jews alike. Handing it over would
``invite an endless political penetration from there into Jerusalem, the purpose
of which is to cut off the eastern part of the city.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israelis say they will never relinquish east Jerusalem, while Palestinians
want it as a capital to their planned state.
</P>
<P>
	   Haim Ramon, the minister in Barak's Cabinet who handles Jerusalem affairs,
said Israel did not intend to hand the suburbs over to full Palestinian control
just yet. But he said Israel would not object to the Palestinians using Abu Dis
as a seat of government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They can have their center of control in Abu Dis,'' he told Israel radio.
``There, they can do everything not against, or not harming the security
interests of Israel.''

<HEADLINE> SEC Head Warns Mutual Fund Buyers  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investors should look at mutual fund fees and other
factors besides past performance when choosing funds, and be wary of ads
boasting of triple-digit returns, the nation's top securities regulator said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "For heaven's sake, don't play into the performance game," Arthur Levitt,
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, warned investors in an
interview with The Associated Press. "Ask the tough questions, beware of high
fees ... and make your judgments thoughtful rather than emotional."
</P>
<P>
	   At a time when 177 mutual funds are posting annual gains of 100 percent or
more, investors also should look at a fund's costs, which can have a huge impact
on returns, Levitt said. A 1 percent higher annual fee will reduce a fund
investor's ending balance by 18 percent after 20 years, he noted.
</P>
<P>
	   The stakes are high. Some 83 million Americans now invest in mutual funds,
whose total assets are estimated at $6 trillion, up from around $1 trillion in
1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Levitt decried a recent proliferation of advertising by mutual fund
companies boasting of triple-digit returns that may have been pumped up by
stocks whose shares soared after an initial public offering. Only the fine print
in the ads explains why the performance was so strong, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ads "play to people's emotions rather than their intellect," he
maintained.
</P>
<P>
	   Elizabeth Powell, a spokeswoman for the Investment Company Institute, a
group representing the mutual fund industry, said, "We take very seriously our
responsibility to help people have realistic expectations."
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Powell said the group has been looking into the matter of advertising.
"Anything of this magnitude we're going to look at and take seriously," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   John Brennan, ICI's president, who also is the chief executive of big fund
company Vanguard Group, has said advertising that touts triple-digit returns
isn't a desirable practice because it ultimately will disappoint investors.
</P>
<P>
	   A few highly profitable initial public offerings, especially of technology
stocks, can bring extremely impressive results for small mutual funds -- a
performance that might not be repeated when the funds grow larger.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some of these mutual fund performance ads are about as informative as
30-second political spots," said Marc Beauchamp, spokesman for the North
American Securities Administrators Association, which represents state
securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first case of its kind, the SEC last September went after a mutual
fund company for allegedly misleading investors in ads and disclosure documents
by not explaining how one of its funds made big first-year gains.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corp., agreed to pay $100,000 in
a settlement. It neither admitted to nor denied the SEC's allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Enforcement cases "that we have brought and others that we may bring suggest
that this advertising has really gone too far," Levitt said.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC is considering tightening the requirements for material included in
mutual fund prospectuses and other disclosure documents, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Intense competition among the thousands of mutual funds and the spectacular
performance last year of technology-based funds are believed to have caused the
blow-your-horn advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   "In times of market exuberance, the easiest way for funds or investment
advisers to compete is on the basis of superior performance," Levitt said. "From
the investor's point of view, that's a very dangerous road to follow."
</P>
<P>
	   Investors should be aware that chasing mutual fund performance can often
hurt their returns on funds and should comparison-shop for funds that match
their long-term financial goals and tolerance for risk, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   High-performing funds often fail to repeat their gains, and investors who
switch in and out of funds typically receive significantly lower returns than
those realized by people who buy and hold funds.
</P>
<P>
	   A record 177 mutual funds reported returns of 100 percent or higher last
year, according to an industry survey. Before 1999, no more than six funds had
doubled investors' money in any given year.
</P>
<P>

section of the agency's Web site at www.sec.gov. The site also includes a mutual
fund cost calculator, designed to help investors compare the long-term impact of
sales charges, fees and expenses.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Head Urges Standards  </HEADLINE>
   By Carl Hartman Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawrence M. Small, a leading figure in the financial
world, took over leadership of the Smithsonian Institution on Monday with a plea
for new, strict standards to increase the number and satisfaction of its
visitors.
</P>
<P>
	   As the new secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Small, 58, received a
symbolic key from Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who has the title of
chancellor -- a title traditionally voted to him by the Smithsonian's Board of
Regents. Small moves from top executive of Fannie Mae, one of the chief U.S.
home mortgage firms, to management of the Smithsonian's 16 museums and the
National Zoo.
</P>
<P>
	   They include the National Museums of Air and Space, American history,
American Art and Natural History, with more than 141 million specimens and works
of art. About 35 million people a year visit a Smithsonian museums.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must be prepared,'' Small said, ``to apply... some of the same kind of
strict standards that other entities -- units of government, not-for-profit
organizations, companies and services in the commercial sector -- are
increasingly using to measure success.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Smithsonian will get $438 million this year from the federal government,
about 71 percent of its funding. The rest comes from private sources and its
business ventures.
</P>
<P>
	   Small spoke in a big tent set up for his inauguration outside the
Smithsonian Castle, its 153-year-old headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must win new audiences by giving the Smithsonian a greater presence
throughout the country,'' he said. ``We must increase our affiliation with local
institutions by lending them many more items from our collections. We must send
out additional traveling exhibitions. We must exploit the power of electronic
outreach...
</P>
<P>
	   ``Technology is transforming the American public's view of what constitutes
a satisfactory learning or recreational experience. And it is challenging the
traditional approach to mounting exhibitions and publishing magazines -- and
even to designing Web sites. We must make technology a faithful and effective
ally...''
</P>
<P>
	   After his inauguration, Small told a news conference he would not reconsider
a decision by his predecessor, I. Michael Heyman, on allocating space in the Old
Patent Office Building between the National Portrait Gallery and the National
Museum of American Art. The two share the same building, which closed earlier
this month for a three-year renovation.
</P>
<P>
	   Small held his first meeting with the Smithsonian's Board of Regents, where
he acts as secretary. David Umansky, spokesman for the Smithsonian, said the
board did not discuss Heyman's decision about the space.
</P>
<P>
	   He announced that the board had voted at the closed meeting to name a new
center at the National Postal Museum the ``William M. Blount Center for Postal
Studies.'' Blount, who served as the 62nd U.S. Postmaster General, donated $10
million to establish the center.

<HEADLINE> American Home Sued for Concealment  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- American Home Products, already facing thousands of
lawsuits related to its once popular diet drugs, was sued on Monday by its
marketing partner Interneuron Pharmaceuticals for allegedly concealing the
health risks of the pills.
</P>
<P>
	   Lexington, Mass.-based Interneuron is seeking unspecified damages against
American Home in the suit filed in Middlesex Superior Court in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   In the complaint, Interneuron accuses American Home of deliberately
concealing information regarding possible health risks associated with the use
of "fen-phen," a combination of the anti-obesity drugs Pondimin (fenfluramine)
and phentermine.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said the information was vital to help it assess the safety of
Redux, a chemical cousin of Pondimin, which was developed by Interneuron and
marketed by AHP.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home's failure to disclose the safety risks from February 1997
through June 1997 prevented Interneuron from taking action, including possibly
moving to take Redux off the market earlier, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said it lost the opportunity to disclose the safety problems to
its shareholders, the financial markets and regulatory agencies, according to
the suit. Such action would have helped protect its reputation, which was hurt
when the drugs were banned, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a result of AHP's fraudulent activities, Interneuron suffered serious
financial loss, including a decrease in its market capitalization of hundreds of
millions of dollars," said Glenn L. Cooper, president and chief executive
officer of Interneuron.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home denied any wrongdoing with respect to its contractual
obligations with Interneuron. A spokesman said American Home also disclosed all
safety data on its anti-obesity drugs to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
	   Pondimin and Redux were taken off the market in September 1997. Pondimin was
made and marketed by American Home, while Redux was developed by Interneuron and
marketed by American Home.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron is now facing more than 2,000 lawsuits related to Redux.
</P>
<P>
	   In October 1999, American Home agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle
thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to
fen-phen. But the settlement has not been finalized, and attorneys said many
clients will opt-out of the agreement so they can sue on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home's legal problems are one reason the company is having trouble
completing its proposed merger with Warner-Lambert. Warner-Lambert is now in
talks to merge with Pfizer Inc., putting the deal with American Home in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said it has tried for two years to negotiate a settlement with
American Home to indemnify Interneuron from lawsuits related to the diet drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said American Home first learned of health dangers of fen-phen
as early as February 1997, when it received information from the Mayo Clinic.
The Mayo Clinic had collected information from patients who had developed heart
valve damage after taking the drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the chemical similarity between Pondimin and Redux, American Home
should have immediately alerted Interneuron of the information, the complaint
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Interneuron said American Home waited until July 1997 to reveal the
information.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home withheld the data on the Mayo study because it feared the
results would have on the diet drugs' sales, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
	   In July 1997, the Mayo Clinic announced that it had received reports of 24
cases in which patients using fen-phen had been diagnosed with cardiac valve
disease. In September 1997, the companies removed Pondimin and Redux from the
market.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Interneuron fell 50 cents to $3 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Shares
of American Home fell $5 to $43 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Press Score of Proposals  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seven years after he declared ``our nation needs a new
direction,'' President Clinton might have used his last State of the Union
address to reflect on his record rather than for a long list of legislative
proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   But he won't.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's Thursday night speech to both houses of Congress promises a score
of specific policy proposals. It's a familiar formula, but one that often is
more effective in a president's first year than in his last.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clinton is in a terrible and also familiar place for presidents,'' said
Paul Light, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution.
``Whatever he says is rendered immediately irrelevant. Congress is not going to
do anything on his agenda.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The final State of the Union in an eight-year term can be an opportunity
for reflection, for setting a tone for the coming administration,'' Light said.
``It is not well-used as an opportunity to restate a long list of legislative
priorities. But presidents who are on their way out find it very difficult to do
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton offered 82 policy proposals in his 1999 address, and he has left no
doubt about which path he will take this year.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent weeks, he has appeared at a series of events staged to showcase
initiatives that he will propose in his fiscal 2001 budget from gun control to
tuition relief. In an interview with The Christian Science Monitor, he promised
the State of the Union would cover the patients' bill of rights, loopholes in
the Brady Bill, a minimum wage increase, hate crimes, job discrimination,
Medicare reform and more.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you see everything we recommend in the aggregate, you might think
that in terms of specifics, it's the most ambitious set of proposals since my
first year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   That first speech offers an example of how specific plans in a State of the
Union address can backfire. Clinton promised ``a comprehensive plan for health
reform that will finally bring costs under control'' while stamping out fraud in
the nation's health-care system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our families will never be secure, our business will never be strong and
our government will never again be fully solvent until we tackle the health-care
crisis,'' he said. ``We must do it this year.''
</P>
<P>
	   That was 1992. The resulting debacle ranks among the biggest setbacks of
Clinton's administration, and securing minimum guarantees for patients remains
high on the Clinton agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president has said time and time again we bit off more than we could
chew, but he doesn't regret having set that as a challenge for America,'' said
White House spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't the only State of the Union plan that provided political fodder
for Clinton's opponents. The Republican National Committee is circulating a list
of five ``broken promises'' made from the podium in the House of Representatives
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   The list includes raising the Social Security earnings limit and eliminating
the income tax marriage penalty. However, it also includes a tax credit for
parents, which Clinton later signed. Clinton recently has talked about cutting
the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, Clinton has had considerable success using the speech to
frame the political debate. Even though health-care reform failed, the issue
continues to resonate with voters, as evidenced by the debates ahead of the
Democratic primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Clinton's call to ``save Social Security first'' shifted the debate
to what should be done with the budget surplus. Siewert said Clinton again will
try to ``define the terms of debate on the larger issues the country faces.''
While he will mention his achievements, Siewert said, Clinton will ``very much
look forward to the unfinished business both of last year and the last
century.''
</P>
<P>
	   As far as Brookings' Light is concerned, focusing on specific business is
``a waste of the president's bully pulpit.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The far better approach would be for him to reflect on what's been
accomplished and what the next president needs to do,'' said Light. ``But it is
very tempting for a president in his last year to try to gin up enthusiasm over
an agenda that has no chance of passing.''

<HEADLINE> Proctor &AMP; Gamble Ends Merger Talks  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble, faced with investor backlash and a
sinking stock price, abandoned negotiations Monday to acquire drug makers
Warner-Lambert and American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., which makes Tide detergent, Cover Girl cosmetics and
Pampers diapers, has been eager to expand into higher-profit products like
prescription medicines.
</P>
<P>
	   But news reports about the company's discussions to buy Warner-Lambert Co.
and American Home Products Corp. for more than $140 billion in stock spooked
investors and sent P&AMP;G's shares down almost 20 percent in four days, making any
potential deal much more expensive for P&AMP;G shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believed Warner-Lambert, American Home Products and Procter &AMP; Gamble
could have been a blockbuster combination of technology, marketing and scale
capabilities," Durk I. Jager, chairman, chief executive and president of P&AMP;G,
said in a statement. But, he added, "we have concluded that leaks and resulting
speculation on a possible transaction have created an environment in which we
cannot continue meaningful discussions."
</P>
<P>
	   P&AMP;G said that while it still is in the market for an acquisition, it no
longer would be looking at drug companies.
</P>
<P>
	   After the announcement, Procter &AMP; Gamble's shares rebounded from a low of
$94.81 1/4 and closed up 18 3/4 cents at $102.87 1/2 on a sharply declining New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The abrupt end to the negotiations was the latest twist in a three-month
takeover battle for Warner-Lambert, which makes the best-selling
cholesterol-fighting drug Lipitor and consumer products like Certs breath mints,
Trident gum, Listerine mouthwash, and Schick razors.
</P>
<P>
	   On Nov. 4, Warner-Lambert agreed to be acquired for $55 billion by its New
Jersey neighbor American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
	   But rival drug maker Pfizer Inc., which co-markets Lipitor, almost
immediately trumped the deal with a $74 billion hostile bid for Warner-Lambert.
Pfizer also sued Warner-Lambert and American Home Products to block their deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert filed its own lawsuit against Pfizer and went looking for a
white knight to top Pfizer's offer even though it agreed to begin talks with
Pfizer this month, acknowledging that Pfizer's offer was a better deal than the
agreement with American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
	   With P&AMP;G stepping aside Monday, Warner-Lambert said it "will continue to
explore strategic alternatives, including discussions with Pfizer."
Warner-Lambert also has sounded out several competitors, including Bristol-Myers
Squibb, in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Any potential suitor, however, likely will think long and hard before
entering a bidding war for Warner-Lambert. Pfizer, which makes the
anti-impotence drug Viagra, is widely expected to fight hard for control of
Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer declined to comment on P&AMP;G's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquisition of Warner-Lambert and American Home Products, with a
combined market value of $140 billion, would have doubled the size of P&AMP;G and
marked a big change in company's direction. But investors also were concerned
P&AMP;G would pay for the deal by issuing stock, and thus dilute the stake of
current investors.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would rather see them (acquire a company) closer to their core business,
and I'm not that eager to see them make such a large transaction," said Steve
Paspal, an analyst and portfolio manager for Sovereign Asset Management, which
is a shareholder in P&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
	   Another drawback, he said, is the litigation among the companies, plus the
liability American Home Products faces from its recalled diet drug.

<HEADLINE> Procter &AMP; Gamble end talks with Warner-Lambert and American Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Procter &AMP; Gamble, faced with investor backlash and a
sinking stock price, abandoned negotiations Monday to acquire drug makers
Warner-Lambert and American Home Products.
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., which makes Tide detergent, Cover Girl cosmetics and
Pampers diapers, has been eager to expand into higher-profit products like
prescription medicines.
</P>
<P>
	   But news reports about the company's discussions to buy Warner-Lambert Co.
and American Home Products Corp. for more than $140 billion in stock spooked
investors and sent P&AMP;G's shares down almost 20 percent in four days, making any
potential deal much more expensive for P&AMP;G shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believed Warner-Lambert, American Home Products and Procter &AMP; Gamble
could have been a blockbuster combination of technology, marketing and scale
capabilities," Durk I. Jager, chairman, chief executive and president of P&AMP;G,
said in a statement. But, he added, "we have concluded that leaks and resulting
speculation on a possible transaction have created an environment in which we
cannot continue meaningful discussions."
</P>
<P>
	   P&AMP;G said that while it still is in the market for an acquisition, it no
longer would be looking at drug companies.
</P>
<P>
	   After the announcement, Procter &AMP; Gamble's shares rebounded from a low of
$94.81 1/4 and closed up 18 3/4 cents at $102.87 1/2 on a sharply declining New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The abrupt end to the negotiations was the latest twist in a three-month
takeover battle for Warner-Lambert, which makes the best-selling
cholesterol-fighting drug Lipitor and consumer products like Certs breath mints,
Trident gum, Listerine mouthwash, and Schick razors.
</P>
<P>
	   On Nov. 4, Morris Plains, N.J.-based Warner-Lambert agreed to be acquired
for $55 billion by its New Jersey neighbor American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
	   But rival drug maker Pfizer Inc., which co-markets Lipitor, almost
immediately trumped the deal with a $74 billion hostile bid for Warner-Lambert.
Pfizer also sued Warner-Lambert and American Home Products to block their deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert filed its own lawsuit against Pfizer and went looking for a
white knight to top Pfizer's offer even though it agreed to begin talks with
Pfizer this month, acknowledging that Pfizer's offer was a better deal than the
agreement with American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
	   With P&AMP;G stepping aside Monday, Warner-Lambert said it "will continue to
explore strategic alternatives, including discussions with Pfizer."
Warner-Lambert also has sounded out several competitors, including Bristol-Myers
Squibb, in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Any potential suitor, however, likely will think long and hard before
entering a bidding war for Warner-Lambert. Pfizer, which makes the
anti-impotence drug Viagra, is widely expected to fight hard for control of
Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer declined to comment on P&AMP;G's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquisition of Warner-Lambert and American Home Products, with a
combined market value of $140 billion, would have doubled the size of P&AMP;G and
marked a big change in company's direction. But investors also were concerned
P&AMP;G would pay for the deal by issuing stock, and thus dilute the stake of
current investors.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would rather see them (acquire a company) closer to their core business,
and I'm not that eager to see them make such a large transaction," said Steve
Paspal, an analyst and portfolio manager for Sovereign Asset Management, which
is a shareholder in P&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
	   Another drawback, he said, is the litigation among the companies, plus the
liability American Home Products faces from its recalled diet drug.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, American Home Products was sued by its marketing partner,
Interneuron Pharmaceuticals, for allegedly concealing the health risks of its
once popular diet pills.
</P>
<P>
	   And, in a separate case, the Surpreme Court rejected an appeal by American
Home Products, which was ordered to pay $20 million to a man who went blind
after taking the company's heart medication.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investors should look at mutual fund fees and
other factors besides past performance when choosing funds, and be
wary of ads boasting of triple-digit returns, the nation's top
securities regulator said Monday. ``For heaven's sake, don't play

	   Time Warner, EMI in Music Deal

<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- British music company EMI Group PLC and America's
Time Warner Inc. announced today they would merge their music
businesses, creating the world's largest music company with
combined annual revenues of $8 billion. The new company, to be
called Warner EMI Music, would combine two of the music industry's
biggest stables of talent and have a substantial share in every
major global market. Current leader Universal Music Group, which is
owned by Seagram, would drop to No. 2 in terms of revenues with
$6.3 billion. The deal, which comes hard on the heels of Time
Warner's $145 billion acquisition by Internet giant America Online
Inc., also would enable the combined group to take advantage of
increasingly important sales over the Internet.

	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A new newspaper greeted Philadelphia
commuters this morning, but competitors urged a federal judge to
block the free Metro tabloid because of its ties to a state transit
agency. U.S. District Judge Robert F. Kelly took no immediate
action on a request for a temporary restraining order from three
news organizations seeking to block distribution of the paper. The
publishers of the Inquirer, the Philadelphia Daily News, USA Today
and The New York Times filed a lawsuit contending Metro's deal is
unconstitutional and creates an unfair advantage by distributing
the paper free where other publications cannot be sold.The news
organizations argued that Metro's deal with Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority is unconstitutional and gives
the tabloid a competitive advantage.

	   NEW YORK -- American Home Products, already facing thousands of

concealing the health risks of the pills. Lexington, Mass.-based
Interneuron is seeking unspecified damages against American Home in
the suit filed in the Middlesex Superior Court in Massachusetts.
Interneuron accuses American Home of deliberately concealing
information regarding possible health risks associated with the use
of ``fen-phen,'' a combination of the anti-obesity drugs Pondimin
(fenfluramine) and phentermine.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Fourth-quarter earnings at Europe's

the late release of business-oriented Internet software. ''1999 was
a tough year for SAP,'' co-chairman and chief executive Hasso
Plattner told a news conference Monday. ``We had to accelerate our
slow preparation for the Internet.'' For the October-December
quarter, net earnings jumped 109 percent to 317 million euros ($320
million), from 152 million euros ($153.5 million) a year earlier.
The company does not calculate earnings per share on a quarterly

Siemen's fiscal year climbed 91 percent to 625 million euros ($631

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Small Market for Hemp  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Industrial hemp, the non-hallucinogenic cousin of
marijuana that can be used in both clothing and food, will never have anything
but a ``small, thin market'' in the United States, a government study says.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the hemp fiber, yarn and fabric that the United States currently
imports could be grown on less than 2,000 acres of land, says the study by the
Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service.
</P>
<P>
	   The study raises questions about efforts by farmers in a number of states to
get the federal government to legalize production of industrial hemp.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine states -- Arkansas, California, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, Montana,
New Mexico, North Dakota and Virginia -- passed pro-hemp bills last year that
provide for research, study or potential production of the crop, and the first
U.S. test plots were planted in Hawaii last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 35,000 acres were grown last year in Canada, which legalized hemp
production in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The USDA study, which was released Friday, doesn't see much demand for any
of hemp's uses:
</P>
<P>
	   --As a fiber, it's main competitor is linen, which is made from flax. There
is little textile flax production in the United States, despite the lack of
legal barriers, and that suggests there wouldn't be enough demand for hemp fiber
to make it profitable, the study said.
</P>
<P>
	   --Hemp seeds and flour are being added to nutrition bars, tortilla chips and
other food items. USDA says that will probably remain a small use, comparable to
the market for sesame and poppy seeds.
</P>
<P>
	   --As for hemp oil, it can't be used for frying, it has a short shelf life,
and it hasn't been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a salad oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Hemp supporters say that new uses and markets for the crop will develop once
it is clear to investors and companies that there will be a supply available.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's like soybeans 30 years ago,'' said Gale Glenn, a retired tobacco
grower who is vice chairwoman of the North American Industrial Hemp Council.
``The markets will grow, but the markets aren't going to grow until they have
the raw material.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Drug Enforcement Administration and the White House drug policy office
say that legalizing hemp farming would make it more difficult to control
marijuana production.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- The overnight ratings were down for the early NFL
conference championship game, but the numbers were up for the late game.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee's 33-14 win over Jacksonville in the AFC championship Sunday got a
24.2 rating and 47 share on CBS, Nielsen Media Research said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   That's down 6 percent from the 26.1 rating and 52 share for Atlanta's 30-27
overtime win over Minnesota on Fox, which was the early game last year.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis' 11-6 victory over Tampa Bay in the NFC championship got a 27.9

Denver's 23-10 win over the New York Jets on CBS, the late game last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The overnights are based on 47 markets that cover about 80 percent of

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmothers Land in Miami  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers flew from New York to Miami on
Monday in hopes of meeting with their 6-year-old grandson before they return to
Cuba. But the site of the get-together was in dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, and paternal grandmother,
Mariela Quintana, were invited to dinner Monday at the home of Elian's relatives
in Miami, who insisted the meeting take place there.
</P>
<P>
	   But federal officials said the grandmothers were hoping to meet privately
with Elian at a neutral site.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami relatives have been caring for Elian since he was found clinging
to an inner tube off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving. His mother and 10 other
Cubans died in their ill-fated attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled that Elian must be sent
back to Cuba to live with his father, but the Miami family is suing in federal
court to block the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   And on Monday, the first day of the new congressional session, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott and Florida lawmakers introduced a bill to give Elian
U.S. citizenship, which would free him from INS jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers, who flew from Cuba to New York on Friday, had asked
Attorney General Janet Reno over the weekend to arrange a meeting with Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to the INS, an attorney for the Miami family said a dinner at
the home of Lazaro Gonzalez -- Mrs. Quintana's brother-in-law and Elian's
great-uncle -- would let the grandmothers ``see and feel for themselves how well
Elian is doing and how much he wishes to remain in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, said the family
would only allow the meeting to take place at the home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is where they live. This is where Elian lives,'' Gutierrez said. ``No
budging on that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The family planned to welcome the grandmothers with a dinner of roast pork,
mixed black beans and rice and breaded chicken cutlets, Gutierrez said. Boxes of
flowers were seen being brought into the home. About 300 people gathered outside
holding signs and flowers to welcome the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
	   But Justice Department spokesman Carole Florman said authorities were trying
to arrange a meeting at a neutral location.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The grandmothers were not comfortable with a meeting at Lazaro's house.
They want a private meeting with the boy,'' Florman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez said the Miami family had bought cameras so Elian could take
pictures of his grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is an opportunity today for them to see with their own two eyes how
well Elian is doing, that he is not tied to a chair in the basement, that he's
going to school, that he's playing with his cousins, that's he got a nice,
modest, but clean, happy living environment,'' said Spencer Eig, an attorney for
the boy's Miami relatives. ``That's something which they may not have known
before, and this may go a long way to calming their anxiety.
</P>
<P>
	   On NBC's ``Today'' show, Ms. Rodriguez asked Congress not to give the boy
U.S. citizenship and to let him return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be more painful if he gets the citizenship,'' she said, speaking
in Spanish through an interpreter. ``I'm asking the congresspeople and people of
the United States that have supported us to stop all this. Please, don't make us
suffer any longer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although they said they have not spoken to the boy in five days, Mrs.
Quintana said Elian has told her over the telephone that ``he's crazy to go back
to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He misses everything there. His school, his classmates, everybody -- his
father's love. To be able to hug and kiss his father. He tells us every day,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Rodriguez denied that her daughter wanted to come to the United States
and have Elian live here. She said she was pressured to make the trip by her
boyfriend, ``a very violent person.''

<HEADLINE> Grief times three: Seton Hall fire victims mourned at funeral  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LONG BRANCH, N.J. (AP) - The teen-age pallbearers cried all the way up
the aisle, their faces contorted, their sobs echoing off the marble floors and
wooden rafters of St. Jerome Roman Catholic Church.
<P>
	   In the pews, Frank S. Caltabilota Jr.'s classmates and friends listened
intently to the priest's words, dabbing at their noses with tissues and wiping
away tears.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother sat in a front pew, clutching a teddy bear, her husband's arm
draped over her shoulders.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why did Frankie have to die so young?" asked the Rev. Frederick Jackiewicz.
"We have no answers for these questions. We do not understand the ways of God.
We try to the best of our limited ability to understand, but we cannot."
</P>
<P>
	   The heartbreaking tableau was mirrored in two other New Jersey churches
Monday as three Seton Hall University freshmen who died in a dormitory fire were
laid to rest. Like Caltabilota, John Giunta, 18, of Vineland, and Aaron Karol,
18, of Green Brook, were remembered as upbeat, selfless, promising young men.

	   "We say that Seton Hall is a family, and it is," said the university's
chancellor, Thomas Peterson, who spoke at Karol's funeral Mass. "We, like
yourselves, have lost a son."
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   Caltabilota, 18, of West Long Branch, was a three-sport standout at Shore
Regional High School who aspired to a career in medicine. An honor student, he
compared himself in his Seton Hall application essay to a basketball player who
chooses to pass to an open teammate instead of shooting the ball himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "My school counselor says that I am a natural caretaker. Maybe she's right,"
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 800 people - some wearing letter jackets from Shore Regional and
Seton Hall - filled the church for the service. The 400 seats in the sanctuary
filled by 8:30 a.m., a full hour before the start. The rest were ushered
downstairs, where a video monitor was set up to broadcast the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   Caltabilota's 15-year-old brother, Thomas, read a "Dear Frankie" letter to
his brother at the start of the service in which he thanked him for being a
great brother.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're a hero to everyone you've ever known," he said. "You're a hero to
me. I love you. May you rest in peace."
</P>
<P>
	   Caltabilota's girlfriend, Erin Brown, 18, had to pause several times during
a five-minute eulogy to gather herself. "You touched the lives of so many
people, even if you'd only known them five minutes," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Karol and Giunta were mentioned by name during the service, and Jackiewicz -
who had served Holy Communion to Caltabilota at this same altar eight days
before - prayed for the recovery of the surviving fire victims.
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   In Dunellen, about 450 people crowded into St. John the Evangelist Roman
Catholic Church to say goodbye to Karol, a soccer enthusiast and criminal
justice major who hoped to someday work for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was just an all-round, near-perfect kid," said Jimmy Byrnes, 17, a
soccer teammate at Watchung Hills Regional High School. "He had everything -
sports, popularity, smarts."
</P>
<P>
	   Two friends read poems written in tribute to Karol, eliciting loud sobs from
the standing-room-only crowd, which included two pews filled with former
teammates, all wearing their black soccer jackets.
</P>
<P>
	   Weeping teen-agers carried the coffin down the aisle, followed by Karol's
parents, sister and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
	   "Learn from the loss of this young man how precious life is," said the Rev.
John Morley, a Seton Hall priest. "And it does not come with guarantees."
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   In Vineland, about 500 people - including three busloads of Seton Hall
students - turned out for Giunta's funeral Mass at St. Francis of Assissi Roman
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
	   Giunta, an elementary education major who aspired to teaching in the inner
city, was remembered as a generous, loyal guy with a great future.
</P>
<P>
	   "He seemed like he had a dream ahead of him. He knew what he wanted to do,"
said John Henderson, 21, of Vineland, a high school classmate.
</P>
<P>
	   Teary-eyed classmates sniffled, occasionally wiping their eyes with wads of
white tissues. Many consoled each other, holding hands or patting one another on
the back.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today our faith cannot answer the question why," the Rev. William Sheridan,
assistant director of campus ministry at Seton Hall, told mourners. "Why did
three die? Why did John die? Why?"
</P>
<P>
	   Giunta's grief-stricken father, Phillip, read a tribute that moved many to
tears.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a time of immense loss," said Msgr. Robert Sheeran, the
university's president, who rushed to the Mass after attending Caltabilota's
service.
</P>
<P>
	   There were prayers for the three elsewhere, too.
</P>
<P>
	   -In Rome, a group of American priests at the Vatican offered Mass for the
victims Monday, Morley said. One of the priests was a former Seton Hall faculty
member.
</P>
<P>
	   -In Washington, U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg read a resolution honoring the
three on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
	   -In Trenton, Gov. Christie Whitman departed from the prepared text of her
annual budget message to say, "We want the families to know they are in our
hearts and in our prayers."
</P>
<P>
	   At Seton Hall, meanwhile, some freshmen returned to their rooms at Boland
Hall for the first time since the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents of the first two floors were allowed to move back into their
rooms, while third, fourth and fifth floor residents were being relocated,
university officials said. The university banned media from the South Orange
campus from until a Tuesday memorial service.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire broke out around 4:30 a.m. Wednesday on the third floor of Boland
Hall, a six-story dormitory that housed 640 people. Five remained hospitalized
Monday, four in critical condition with burns.

<HEADLINE> American Express Posts Gain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- American Express Co. reported a 15 percent gain in
fourth-quarter profits on Monday, meeting Wall Street projections amid strength
in its charge card and investment management businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   American Express said in the three months ended Dec. 31 it earned $606
million, or $1.33 a share, up from a profit of $530 million, or $1.16 a share,
in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue grew 15 percent to $5.23 billion from $4.56 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   American Express shares gained 31 1/4 cents to $152 on the New York Stock
Exchange amid a sharp retreat on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   The company partly cited a 15 percent gain in fourth-quarter profit from its
Travel Related Services unit, which includes charge and credit cards. The number
of Amex cards in use grew to 46 million worldwide from 43 million in the
year-ago quarter, while average spending on each card grew to $2,102 from
$1,861.
</P>
<P>
	   Amex also tied results to a 14 percent rise in profits from its investment
management business, where the company runs mutual funds and other investment
vehicles
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it also settled three class-action lawsuits related to
sales of insurance and annuity products and expects to pay about $215 million in
benefits to roughly 2 million people. While the bulk of the settlement costs
will be covered by money previously reserved, the company said it had set aside
an additional $74 million, before taxes, during the fourth quarter to cover the
deal. The agreement settles claims against the company dating back to 1985,
American Express said.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of last year, American Express said it earned $2.48 million, or
$5.42 a share, up 16 percent from a profit of $2.14 billion, or $4.63 a share,
in the year-ago quarter. Revenue grew to $19.48 billion from $17.21
billion.

<HEADLINE> Police say they've nabbed 'Soccer Guy'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - This scam was unique, even to seasoned police officers.
For months, Japanese men - tourists and residents - kept reporting that they had
been robbed by a man who demonstrated soccer moves on them.
<P>
	   The robber's fascinating footwork was enough to distract even the most
discerning person long enough for the suspect to grab his wallet and then walk
away.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Sunday, police say they nabbed their man, nicknamed the Soccer Guy.
Sgt. James Molloy of the NYPD's Grand Larceny Unit, said Monday he was one of
two cops who witnessed the scofflaw doing his soccer moves - kicking around the
shins, a bump here, a bump there - in front of a midtown Manhattan hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not a soccer fan, but he was very convincing," Molloy said. "He looked
pretty apt on his feet."
</P>
<P>
	   Molloy said since last October, 15 or 16 men have reported being victims of
the Soccer Guy, but he believes there are many more victims and urged them to
come forward if they were still in town.
</P>
<P>
	   Hirofumi Murabayashi, a spokesman for the Japanese Consulate's office here,
said his office has received several complaints from Japanese men about the
scam.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a new kind of crime targeting Japanese nationals," he said. "We
would like to call the attention of the Japanese community here to this in case
of similar crimes."
</P>
<P>
	   According to Molloy, Soccer Guy worked mostly around midtown Manhattan
hotels - 45th to 50th streets, between and Broadway and Madison Avenue,
sometimes venturing up to Central Park South.
</P>
<P>
	   "He would approach Japanese males, and asked them certain questions, like
'Where's Fifth Avenue?"' Molloy said. This was apparently to see if the men
spoke English, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   If the victims got drawn into a conversation, the suspect pulled out a
telephone calling card with a picture of popular soccer star Hidetoshi Nakata on
one side. Nakata, who plays for the Italian soccer team AS Roma, is a huge icon
in both Italy and Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Then the soccer moves would begin - without the benefit of a ball.
</P>
<P>
	   "He would pretend like he was playing soccer, kicking around their shins,
circling, bumping, circling, bumping, all the while feeling where they kept
their wallets," Molloy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the suspect had the wallet, he would casually walk away into the
midtown crowds. Police did not say how much money was taken, but victims
reported that any credit cards in their wallets were maxed out, Molloy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Molloy and Officer Tito Ramos, aware of reports about Soccer Guy, happened
upon the suspect as they were walking near the Hilton Hotel in midtown Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   "We observed an individual literally dancing around - he actually placed his
hand inside this individual's pocket but the complainant pushed him away,"
Molloy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Molloy and Ramos followed the suspect as he got into the passenger side of a
waiting car. Ramos ordered the suspect out of the car; he ran into a nearby
subway entrance, then out the other end, where Ramos nabbed him. The driver sped
away and is being sought for questioning.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspect was identified by four victims at lineups, Molloy said.
Identified as Ben-Msyly Gil-Elie, 29, of Astoria, Queens, he faced misdemeanor
charges of attempted grand larceny, resisting arrest and jostling, a legal term
used to describe the act of trying to distract someone in order to pick his
pocket.

<HEADLINE> Heating Oil Futures Dive 8 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Heating oil futures reversed course Monday, diving 8 percent in heavy
profit-taking after a scorching two-week rally that took its cues from cold
weather in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude oil prices also dropped.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, orange juice prices sank to a six-month low, palladium
reached another all-time high and soybeans led a strong advance by most
agricultural commodities.
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil prices had been primed for a comedown after a stunning run-up
that analysts said was the result of an overreaction by investors to the bull
market for crude oil and the subzero weather that smacked the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   When the upward movement finally hit resistance Monday, the buying frenzy
abated and the bottom fell out of the price on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil for March delivery tumbled 7.15 cents to 86.35 cents a gallon,
giving up all its frenzied gains of last Friday, the single hottest day of this
month's rally.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Meyers, senior analyst for Pioneer Futures Inc., said the market was
clearly overbought after the "just insane movement" in prices since temperatures
dropped, spurring demand in the Northeast -- the world's biggest heating-oil
market.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, a slight warming in the region eased some concerns about
soaring demand.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the roller coaster ride in price, Meyers said, is the result of
investor emotions rather than fundamental news such as the weather. But it's too
early to declare the price rise over.
</P>
<P>
	   "You still have cold weather, with a potential storm coming in in the middle
of the week," Meyers said. "It remains a very dangerous market to invest in.
Clearly market participants are expecting high volatility to remain for this
whole week."
</P>
<P>
	   West Texas intermediate crude for March delivery fell 37 cents to $27.83 a
barrel; February gasoline fell 1.66 cents to 75.30 cents a gallon; February
natural gas rose 4.3 cents to $2.528 per 1,000 cubic feet; February unleaded
gasoline fell 1.48 cents to 75.48 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   March Brent crude fell 29 cents to $26.06 on the International Petroleum
Exchange in London.
</P>
<P>
	   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures slumped after Florida, the nation's
top orange-juice producer, escaped any consequences from the ice storm that
struck neighboring Georgia over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Prospects of damage to orange groves had sent prices up ahead of the
weekend. But the low temperatures in key citrus areas remained above freezing
and well above the danger point.
</P>
<P>
	   The cool but not deadly weather actually helps the crop, since unharvested
fruit that undergoes a cold snap generally sees a boost in sugar levels.
</P>
<P>
	   March orange juice settled down 1.25 cents at 82.60 cents a pound on the New
York Board of Trade after dipping to their lowest since early August.
</P>
<P>
	   Palladium jumped to its latest in a series of all-time highs amid a
continued lack of exports by Russia, the world's leading producer of the metal
used to make automobile catalytic converters.
</P>
<P>
	   March palladium settled up $14.15 to $470.25 an ounce on the New York Merc.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybean futures rallied to their highest level in three months on the
Chicago Board of Trade after significant rains failed to materialize in dry
growing regions of South America.
</P>
<P>
	   Weekend showers had been expected to boost soybean crop prospects in Brazil
in particular. But precipitation was only scattered, leaving the crop size in
doubt after a long arid stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn futures gained again in a continuation of the bullish sentiments that
have pushed prices some 13 percent higher this month.
</P>
<P>
	   March soybeans rose 6 3/4 cents to $5.12 a bushel, while March corn rose 4
1/2 cents to $2.27 1/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Court Backs Local Election Changes  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling its dissenters say
will perpetuate discrimination against minorities, limited federal authority to
veto changes in the way state and local elections are run.
</P>
<P>
	   The government cannot reject proposed changes in election systems -- even if
they are discriminatory -- so long as the changes leave minorities no worse off
than they were before, the court decided in a Louisiana case Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling applies to the 1965 federal Voting Rights Act's requirement that
all or part of 16 states get government or court clearance before implementing
new election districts, for example, or switching to an at-large voting plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Such government clearance has ``limited meaning'' and ``is nothing more than
a determination that the voting change is no more dilutive than what it
replaces,'' Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Preclearance under (the law) affirms nothing but the absence of
backsliding,'' Scalia wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   After an election change is cleared, Scalia said, it still can be challenged
under another section of the Voting Rights Act that prohibits any voting
practice that would dilute minority voters' clout.
</P>
<P>
	   Scalia's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
	   Dissenting were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now executive and judicial officers of the United States will be forced to
preclear illegal and unconstitutional voting schemes patently intended to
perpetuate discrimination,'' Souter wrote for the four.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress did not intend to let state and local governments ``pour old poison
into new bottles,'' Souter said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling upheld the current system of electing the Bossier Parish, La.,
school board's 12 members.
</P>
<P>
	   The school district's lawyer, Michael Carvin, said the ruling ``frees up the
largely southern jurisdictions to do their own redistricting free from Justice
Department interference.''
</P>
<P>
	   Carvin called the ruling a ``very dramatic turnaround'' that will ``reduce
the pressure to create minority-majority districts in these southern
jurisdictions.''
</P>
<P>
	   George Price, the former local NAACP president who opposed the Bossier
Parish voting plan, said Monday that ``the suit, although we were unable to make
a change in the district lines, has made clear the need for minority
representation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Price's lawyer, Patricia Brannan, said she was disappointed but took heart
in the court's statement that people still can sue under another section of the
Voting Rights Act. ``A court majority says there are other ways of tackling the
problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department spokeswoman Christine DiBartolo said, ``While we're
disappointed that the court took a different view from ours ... the court has
reaffirmed that we can continue to pursue elimination of discriminatory voting
changes'' under another section of the voting-rights law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will continue to use all of the means at our disposal to ensure that
all voters have an equal opportunity to participate in our electoral system,''
DiBartolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices heard arguments in the case twice, deciding after a first
argument last April to have lawyers argue it again in October.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bossier Parish school board's members are elected from 12 different
districts. About 20 percent of the parish's population is black, concentrated in
two areas, but no district has a black majority.
</P>
<P>
	   As of 1990, no black had ever been elected to the school board.
</P>
<P>
	   After the 1990 census required new districts to be drawn, the local NAACP
chapter proposed creating two black-majority districts.
</P>
<P>
	   The school board opted instead for a new map in 1992 with no such district,
but the Justice Department refused to clear the plan. However, a three-judge
federal court ruled that the plan must be upheld, and the Supreme Court affirmed
that decision Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Voting Rights Act's Section 5 allows the federal government to veto
proposed changes if they are deemed to have a discriminatory ``purpose or
effect.'' The act's Section 2 is more stringent, and prohibits any voting
practice that would dilute minority voters' clout.
</P>
<P>
	   In a 1997 decision involving the same Bossier Parish dispute, the nation's
highest court said Justice Department lawyers cannot refuse to approve a
proposal under Section 5 by deciding that the change would violate Section 2.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Louisiana case wended its way through federal courts, two black
candidates were elected to the 12-member school board in 1994 and were
re-elected in 1998, along with a third black candidate.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Military Perilously Divided  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- One of the few public institutions that enjoys
widespread support in Ecuador is the military, known for honesty, compassion and
for providing health services and education to impoverished communities long
ignored by the government.
</P>
<P>
	   For years the armed forces have championed constitutional government,
resisting the temptation to take power as Ecuador spun out of control and
plunged into economic and political chaos.
</P>
<P>
	   But the military is a force divided -- between young more radical officers
and the top brass. And that division could be a roadblock to re-establishing
stable civilian rule in the wake of last week's coup.
</P>
<P>
	   The corruption and deep poverty that led the young military officers to
support an Indian protest that deposed President Jamil Mahuad remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't say there won't be another coup if we continue with the very
grave economic and social difficulties,'' said Luis Eladio Proano, a civilian
adviser to the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   As Ecuador's political leaders have become more and more discredited,
Ecuadorians have looked to the armed forces as the only public institution they
can trust. An August poll showed that 65 percent of Ecuadorians favor the
military. Politicians tallied only 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But with the events of last week, Ecuadorians are wondering how much longer
the military will stay on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign of the division within the military, an army captain called a TV
station on Saturday to protest the decision by Ecuador's top military commander
to turn power over to the vice president -- a civilian -- only a few hours after
he had taken control of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Please, let's take power! Ecuador needs military discipline to be able to
develop. Ecuador is not going to change if a civilian remains in power,'' Capt.
Luis Espinoza pleaded.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday as many as 150 junior officers, most of them colonels, joined
hundreds of Indian protesters who stormed Congress and proclaimed a new
governing junta to fight corruption and work to improve the lives of the poor.
The junta was composed of Indian leader Antonio Vargas, Col. Lucio Gutierrez and
a former Supreme Court president.
</P>
<P>
	   After debating for hours, the military high command threw its support to the
civilian-military junta, forcing Mahuad to abandon power.
</P>
<P>
	   But early Saturday, under pressure from the U.S. government and confronting
the opposition of more than 20 regional commanders who rejected the overthrow of
civilian rule, armed forces chief Gen. Carlos Mendoza announced he was turning
power over to Vice President Gustavo Noboa.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at a news conference Monday, Vargas agreed that the problems that
led to the coup haven't gone away.
</P>
<P>
	   If Noboa doesn't work to end corruption, the Indian leader predicted ``a
great social explosion that could lead to civil war'' in three to six months.
``And that would not be our fault.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mendoza, who had replaced Gutierrez in the junta, says he never had designs
on power himself, saying, in effect, he tricked the other two men with whom he
briefly formed a revolutionary junta.
</P>
<P>
	   But military experts and retired army general Jose Gallardo, who had served
as Mahuad's defense minister until the week before the coup, questioned
Mendoza's depiction of himself as a defender of democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Mendoza and army commander Gen. Telmo Sandoval didn't have the support of
the rank and file, and ``they suddenly became democrats,'' Proano said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mendoza resigned and Sandoval took over as military commander.
</P>
<P>
	   Gallardo said that Mendoza and Sandoval took advantage of the growing
discontent of junior officers to try to seize power. He said they were motivated
by political ambition, not the idealistic desire of the young officers to save
Ecuador from economic and social chaos.
</P>
<P>
	   Mendoza and Sandoval knew weeks ago there was a movement of junior officers
that planned to support the Indian protest, Gallardo said, arguing that they
acted irresponsibly by not discouraging the young officers, whose fates are
uncertain. The new government says they will face military justice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Young men are passionate. When they see injustice, they want to take
action immediately to end it. They don't have the experience and vision of older
people,'' Gallardo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Young officers rail most against the rampant corruption that characterizes
Ecuador's political class and has led to their salaries being eaten up by
inflation and devaluation. A colonel's pay has dropped from the equivalent of
$1000 a month to $250.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Negotiators Plan Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With three weeks to go and not even a draft agreement in
sight, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators announced plans Monday for marathon
negotiations aimed at meeting a Feb. 13 deadline on the outline of a final
status agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Ehud Barak, limping on the Syrian track, is eager to show
results with the Palestinians. His office said in a release Monday that
negotiations would be held on several levels ``with the intent of speeding up
the talks.''
</P>
<P>
	   The talks will likely start Feb. 1, according to Palestinian officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. They will address the sensitive issues of
borders, Palestinian refugees, the status of Jerusalem and the future of Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had hoped to meet with Barak and President
Clinton during the world economic summit at Davos, Switzerland this weekend. But
Barak said he would not attend because there were scheduling problems and that
is was unlikely there would be a meeting with Clinton, who never showed any
interest in a meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli media said Barak is reluctant to hold talks with the two leaders now
because he is concerned about being pressured into making concessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the renewed efforts, Israeli negotiator Oded Eran said Monday the
February deadline would be ``very difficult'' to meet.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak, elected in May on a platform of thawing peace talks frozen by his
hard-line predecessor, ambitiously set the February deadline for the outline of
an agreement. He predicted permanent peace agreements with the Palestinians and
the Syrians by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The renewed talks with the Syrians have proven more complex than he
realized, however, and have sidetracked him from the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Palestinian officials, Barak's distractions have meant that
there is not even a draft of an outline agreement, three weeks before the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks with the Syrians have all but collapsed over demilitarization and
border issues and -- to the Palestinians' delight -- Barak has returned to the
Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
	   His renewed involvement appeared to spur the resolution of disagreements
over the implementation of an interim agreement -- a side issue that had
nonetheless also dogged the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said after his 3 1/2-hour meeting
with Eran on Monday that they had reached an agreement on a delayed Israeli
troop withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank. The withdrawal, which had
been scheduled for Jan. 20, will now take place by Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians want the Israelis to hand over Arab suburbs of Jerusalem,
currently under joint control, to full Palestinian control in the next
withdrawal. Israel has resisted, apparently hoping the Palestinians would settle
for the suburbs as a substitute for Jerusalem in the final status agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   It is precisely because the Palestinians do not want the suburbs to cloud
the Jerusalem issue that they want full control now.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have reached an agreement satisfactory to both sides,'' Erekat said
when asked about the suburbs as he was leaving the luxury hotel on Jerusalem's
east-west divide, where the meeting took place.
</P>
<P>
	   Talk of returning Abu Dis, Azzariya and A-Ram outrages Israeli hard-liners,
including Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, who conjure images of a redivision of
Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Abu Dis lies only a few yards away from the Temple Mount,'' Olmert said,
referring to a site holy to Muslims and Jews alike. Handing it over would
``invite an endless political penetration from there into Jerusalem, the purpose
of which is to cut off the eastern part of the city.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israelis say they will never relinquish east Jerusalem, while Palestinians
want it as a capital to their planned state.
</P>
<P>
	   Haim Ramon, the minister in Barak's Cabinet who handles Jerusalem affairs,
said Israel did not intend to hand the suburbs over to full Palestinian control
just yet. But he said Israel would not object to the Palestinians using Abu Dis
as a seat of government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They can have their center of control in Abu Dis,'' he told Israel radio.
``There, they can do everything not against, or not harming the security
interests of Israel.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy Bill Filed in Congress  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress bestowed American citizenship on Winston
Churchill and Mother Teresa, and awarded it posthumously to Raul Wallenberg, the
Swedish diplomat who saved tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews in World War II.
But the extraordinary power has been used rarely -- and never for a minor child
against a parent's wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and a group of Florida
lawmakers put in motion a process to give citizenship to 6-year-old Cuban
refugee Elian Gonzalez, without his father's consent.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott, R-Miss., told the Senate the bill ``to grant citizenship to this young
boy'' could come up for debate as soon as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors hoped to whisk it through Congress quickly, largely to remove the
case from the jurisdiction of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which
has ruled that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba. Passage would
also render moot a federal court appeal of the INS ruling by Elian's
great-uncle, sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This moves the decision-making out of the hands of the INS and into the
hands of the (state) courts,'' Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., the chief Senate
sponsor, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart declined to say what President
Clinton would do if Congress passed the bill -- sign it or veto it -- but said
the White House would consider the matter after Congress acts. The president has
indicated he does not believe Congress should get involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a real danger here that this can become a political issue, that
this young boy will be a political football,'' Lockhart said. ``And I think the
president has made it very clear to everyone that they ought to stay away from
politics here and stick to what the facts and the law dictate.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Mack said, ``There has been political influence even from the beginning
in the case,'' including rallies in Havana that Mack said were orchestrated by
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Senate Judiciary Committee's top
Democrat, denounced the legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the Congress to grant citizenship to a young boy over the father's
objection makes a mockery of family values, and it hands Castro yet another
reason to portray the United States as the enemy,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the high-profile examples of Churchill, Mother Teresa and
Wallenberg, Congress has used this power rarely and selectively. Its involvement
in individual immigration cases has declined sharply over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about half a dozen private immigration bills are introduced each year,
but most of them deal with advancing a pending case, trying to prevent a
deportation or helping an American employed overseas retain citizenship. Some
examples:
</P>
<P>
	   --In July 1997, Swiss banker Christoph Meili won permanent residency status.
He had lost his job after saving Holocaust-era bank documents from a shredder.
</P>
<P>
	   --In 1968, three men -- from Italy, Ireland and Germany -- who died while
fighting with American units in Vietnam, posthumously received U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   --In December 1975, Mrika Mrnacaj, a 111-year-old Albanian immigrant who
wanted to vote in a U.S. election before she died, won citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   --In 1988, Michael Wilding, the son of actress Elizabeth Taylor and a former
stepson of Sen. John Warner, R-Va., won citizenship. The British subject had
renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1971, and the bill blocked a possible
deportation on a marijuana possession conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   --In that same year, 1988, Congress rejected legislation that would have let
tennis star Ivan Lendl bypass the five-year waiting period for American
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of immigration bills fell off dramatically after the Abscam
scandal in the early 1980s when FBI agents posing as Arab sheiks asked members
of Congress to introduce private immigration bills to allow wealthy ``Arabs'' to
enter the United States in exchange for money.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining Mack and Lott in sponsoring the bill for Elian Gonzalez were Sens.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., and Bob Graham, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   In the House, Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas; and several Florida
lawmakers co-sponsored a similar bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Reps. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., and Peter
Deutsch, D-Fla, introduced a rival bill to grant Elian permanent residency
status.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will give Elian the choice, when he's old enough, to decide the
citizenship question for himself,'' Menendez said.
</P>
<P>
	   And Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., introduced a resolution -- co-sponsored by
nine Democrats and one Republican -- urging that Elian be reunited with his
father.
</P>
<P>
	   John Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said no
decision had yet been made on how to proceed in the House -- whether to try to
bring the bill to the floor directly, or to let the House Judiciary Committee
consider it first.
</P>
<P>
	   Although not a sponsor, Hastert supports the bill and ``he'll help to
advance it,'' said Feehery.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Military Perilously Divided  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- One of the few public institutions that enjoys
widespread support in Ecuador is the military, known for honesty, compassion and
providing health services and education to impoverished communities long ignored
by the government.
</P>
<P>
	   For years the armed forces have championed constitutional government,
resisting the temptation to take power as Ecuador spun out of control and
plunged into economic and political chaos.
</P>
<P>
	   But the military is a force divided -- between young more radical officers
and the top brass. And that division could be a roadblock to re-establishing
stable civilian rule in the wake of last week's coup.
</P>
<P>
	   The corruption and deep poverty that led the young military officers to
support an Indian protest that deposed President Jamil Mahuad remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't say there won't be another coup if we continue with the very
grave economic and social difficulties,'' said Luis Eladio Proano, a civilian
adviser to the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   As Ecuador's political leaders have become more and more discredited,
Ecuadorians have looked to the armed forces as the only public institution they
can trust. An August poll showed that 65 percent of Ecuadorians favor the
military. Politicians tallied only 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But with the events of last week, Ecuadorians are wondering how much longer
the military will stay on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign of the division within the military, an army captain called a TV
station on Saturday to protest the decision by Ecuador's top military commander
to turn power over to the vice president -- a civilian -- only a few hours after
he had taken control of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Please, let's take power! Ecuador needs military discipline to be able to
develop. Ecuador is not going to change if a civilian remains in power,'' Capt.
Luis Espinoza pleaded.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday as many as 150 junior officers, most of them colonels, joined
hundreds of Indian protesters who stormed Congress and proclaimed a new
governing junta to fight corruption and work to improve the lives of the poor.
The junta was composed of Indian leader Antonio Vargas, Col. Lucio Gutierrez and
a former Supreme Court president.
</P>
<P>
	   After debating for hours, the military high command threw its support to the
civilian-military junta, forcing Mahuad to abandon power.
</P>
<P>
	   But early Saturday, under pressure from the U.S. government and confronting
the opposition of more than 20 regional commanders who rejected the overthrow of
civilian rule, armed forces chief Gen. Carlos Mendoza announced he was turning
power over to Vice President Gustavo Noboa.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at a news conference Monday, Vargas agreed that the problems that
led to the coup haven't gone away.
</P>
<P>
	   If Noboa doesn't work to end corruption, the Indian leader predicted ``a
great social explosion that could lead to civil war'' in three to six months.
``And that would not be our fault.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mendoza, who had replaced Gutierrez in the junta, says he never had designs
on power himself, saying, in effect, he tricked the other two men with whom he
briefly formed a revolutionary junta.
</P>
<P>
	   But military experts and retired army general Jose Gallardo, who had served
as Mahuad's defense minister until the week before the coup, questioned
Mendoza's depiction of himself as a defender of democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Mendoza and army commander Gen. Telmo Sandoval didn't have the support of
regional military commanders, and ``they suddenly became democrats,'' Proano
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mendoza resigned and Sandoval took over as military commander.
</P>
<P>
	   Gallardo said that Mendoza and Sandoval took advantage of the growing
discontent of junior officers to try to seize power. He said they were motivated
by political ambition, not the idealistic desire of the young officers to save
Ecuador from economic and social chaos.
</P>

	   Young officers rail most against the rampant corruption that characterizes
Ecuador's political class and has led to their salaries being eaten up by
inflation and devaluation. A colonel's pay has dropped from the equivalent of
$1000 a month to $250.
</P>
<P>
	   Former U.S. Ambassador Leslie Alexander, who left Ecuador in July, once
observed that one way of determining who was corrupt and was not corrupt was by
looking at wristwatches. He noted that politicians normally wear gold Rolexes
while generals use Seikos.

<HEADLINE> Proctor &AMP; Gamble Ends Merger Talks  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble, faced with investor backlash and a
sinking stock price, abandoned negotiations Monday to acquire drug makers
Warner-Lambert and American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., which makes Tide detergent, Cover Girl cosmetics and
Pampers diapers, has been eager to expand into higher-profit products like
prescription medicines.
</P>
<P>
	   But news reports about the company's discussions to buy Warner-Lambert Co.
and American Home Products Corp. for more than $140 billion in stock spooked
investors and sent P&AMP;G's shares down almost 20 percent in four days, making any
potential deal much more expensive for P&AMP;G shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believed Warner-Lambert, American Home Products and Procter &AMP; Gamble
could have been a blockbuster combination of technology, marketing and scale
capabilities," Durk I. Jager, chairman, chief executive and president of P&AMP;G,
said in a statement. But, he added, "we have concluded that leaks and resulting
speculation on a possible transaction have created an environment in which we
cannot continue meaningful discussions."
</P>
<P>
	   P&AMP;G said that while it still is in the market for an acquisition, it no
longer would be looking at drug companies.
</P>
<P>
	   After the announcement, Procter &AMP; Gamble's shares rebounded from a low of
$94.81 1/4 and closed up 18 3/4 cents at $102.87 1/2 on a sharply declining New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The abrupt end to the negotiations was the latest twist in a three-month
takeover battle for Warner-Lambert, which makes the best-selling
cholesterol-fighting drug Lipitor and consumer products like Certs breath mints,
Trident gum, Listerine mouthwash, and Schick razors.
</P>
<P>
	   On Nov. 4, Warner-Lambert agreed to be acquired for $55 billion by its New
Jersey neighbor American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
	   But rival drug maker Pfizer Inc., which co-markets Lipitor, almost
immediately trumped the deal with a $74 billion hostile bid for Warner-Lambert.
Pfizer also sued Warner-Lambert and American Home Products to block their deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert filed its own lawsuit against Pfizer and went looking for a
white knight to top Pfizer's offer even though it agreed to begin talks with
Pfizer this month, acknowledging that Pfizer's offer was a better deal than the
agreement with American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
	   With P&AMP;G stepping aside Monday, Warner-Lambert said it "will continue to
explore strategic alternatives, including discussions with Pfizer."
Warner-Lambert also has sounded out several competitors, including Bristol-Myers
Squibb, in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Any potential suitor, however, likely will think long and hard before
entering a bidding war for Warner-Lambert. Pfizer, which makes the
anti-impotence drug Viagra, is widely expected to fight hard for control of
Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer declined to comment on P&AMP;G's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquisition of Warner-Lambert and American Home Products, with a
combined market value of $140 billion, would have doubled the size of P&AMP;G and
marked a big change in company's direction. But investors also were concerned
P&AMP;G would pay for the deal by issuing stock, and thus dilute the stake of
current investors.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would rather see them (acquire a company) closer to their core business,
and I'm not that eager to see them make such a large transaction," said Steve
Paspal, an analyst and portfolio manager for Sovereign Asset Management, which
is a shareholder in P&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
	   Another drawback, he said, is the litigation among the companies, plus the
liability American Home Products faces from its recalled diet drug.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, American Home Products was sued by its marketing partner,
Interneuron Pharmaceuticals, for allegedly concealing the health risks of its
once popular diet pills.
</P>
<P>
	   And, in a separate case, the Surpreme Court rejected an appeal by American
Home Products, which was ordered to pay $20 million to a man who went blind
after taking the company's heart medication.
</P>
<P>
	   "This would have been a complex situation for (P&AMP;G) to get themselves into,"
Paspal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati-based P&AMP;G has set some aggressive growth projections, and the
acquisition of Warner-Lambert and American Home Products would have helped
exceed those targets. P&AMP;G could have used its marketing muscle and worldwide
distribution network to boost sales of the medicines it acquired.
</P>
<P>
	   The consumer products giant, however, won't be shopping for another
pharmaceutical company to fill the hole.
</P>
<P>
	   "The combination of Warner-Lambert and American Home Products generated a
lot of synergies in the pharmaceutical end," said Clayton C. Daley Jr., chief
financial officer of P&AMP;G. "If we go out and look at another pharmaceutical
company, those synergies won't be there."
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Warner-Lambert fell $4.06 1/4 to $87.93 3/4 as of 5:15 p.m. EST on
the NYSE, where American Home Products slumped $5.37 1/2 to $42.62 1/2, and
Pfizer's stock slipped 68 3/4 cents to $34.37 1/2.

<HEADLINE> ABC's Iger Named No. 2 at Disney  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- ABC network chief Robert Iger was named second in
command at The Walt Disney Co. Monday as Michael Eisner carried out a broad
restructuring of the company's top management.
</P>
<P>
	   Iger, 48, was promoted to president and chief operating officer, filling a
position left vacant since Hollywood dealmaker Michael Ovitz left in 1996 after
a futile attempt to share power with Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The changes beef up Disney's top management after more than a year of
slumping share prices and executive defections.
</P>
<P>
	   Eisner also announced the promotion of chief strategic officer Peter Murphy
and chief financial officer Thomas O. Staggs to senior executive vice
presidents.
</P>
<P>
	   They will become members of a new executive management committee that will
include Eisner, Iger, Disney vice chairman Sanford M. Litvack and heads of
individual business units.
</P>
<P>
	   In another development, Disney released a preview of first-quarter results
that showed net income rose 7 percent to $515 million, or 25 cents per share,
excluding its Go.com Internet business. Official results will be released in
February.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney announced in November that it planned to issue a separate stock for
Go.com, which is expected to yield a "substantial loss" in the first quarter due
to the cost of acquiring the Internet company Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
	   In a prepared statement, Eisner said the changes would "provide the
necessary communication and efficiency among our executive staff members as
Disney grows globally, and will better enable us to generate ideas, identify and
move on opportunities and quickly implement strategies."
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Disney rose 31 1/4 cents to $33.12 1/2 in trading on the New York
Stock Exchange before the news.
</P>
<P>
	   Iger previously was chairman of Disney's ABC Group, which included ABC, ESPN
and other properties, and president of Walt Disney International.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement follows the departure last week of Disney studio chief Joe
Roth, who quit to start his own film company.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth was the latest in a string of top executives to leave the company.
Others to leave in recent years include chief financial officers Steve
Bollenbach and Richard Nanula, ABC TV and radio station chief Steve Burke, and
cable programming boss Geraldine Laybourne.
</P>
<P>
	   Finding someone to fill the president's job has been an issue since the 1994
death of Eisner's longtime friend and trusted second-in-command, Frank Wells.
Wells, who died in a helicopter accident, was widely credited with handling the
day-to-day details of running Disney, freeing Eisner to focus on creative
development and long-range plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney's share price has lagged recently, reaching a 52-week high of $36.93
3/4 a few weeks ago, but trading generally below $30 during the second half of
1999. Board members reportedly have pressed Eisner to get help.
</P>
<P>
	   "Disney for some time has needed a strong No. 2 person to make sure the
trains are running on time," said Tom Wolzien, analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein
&AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have great conceptual management at the top, but a company as vast as
Disney needs somebody to make sure everybody's talking on a day-to-day basis,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Against Yen, Euro  </HEADLINE>
    By PETER ALAN HARPER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the euro Monday as the Group of
Seven industrialized nations failed to indicate support for the faltering
multinational currency following a meeting of G7 finance ministers over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also rose against the Japanese yen as the G7 made tepid remarks
about bringing down the Japanese currency, whose rise against the dollar makes
trade expensive for Japanese exporters.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0049, down from $1.0092
Friday. The dollar was quoted at 105.68 Japanese yen, up from 104.83.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro fell as low as $1.0015 Monday, the first trading day after a
Saturday communique didn't mention the currency of 11 European nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also rose against the yen, with the communique mentioning a
concern for the "potential impact of yen-appreciation" for Japan and the world
economy. Traders generally deemed the message as weak -- as they had expected --
especially since the finance ministers backed Japan's taking action without help
from other G7 members.
</P>
<P>
	   "Since Japan hosted the (G7) meeting, Japanese players had expected the
strong-yen concern to be somehow squeezed in," said Yukihiko Hashimoto, vice
president of foreign exchange at Sanwa Bank in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   While strong early, the dollar failed to maintain its gains during U.S.
trading. Stocks opened strongly but plunged by midday.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro and the yen spent "the afternoon grinding higher in the fade of a
weaker stock market," said John McCarthy, a senior vice president for foreign
exchange at ING Barings Capital Markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.6044 Swiss francs, up from 1.5961, and
1.4426 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4388. The British pound rose to $1.6499 from
$1.6496.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on the euro's
rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9461 German marks, up from 1.9379; 6.5269 French
francs, up from 6.4995; and 1,926.64 Italian lire, up from 1.918.52.

<HEADLINE> Procter &AMP; Gamble ends talks with Warner-Lambert and American Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Procter &AMP; Gamble, faced with investor backlash and a
sinking stock price, abandoned negotiations Monday to acquire drug makers
Warner-Lambert and American Home Products.
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., which makes Tide detergent, Cover Girl cosmetics and
Pampers diapers, has been eager to expand into higher-profit products like
prescription medicines.
</P>
<P>
	   But news reports about the company's discussions to buy Warner-Lambert Co.
and American Home Products Corp. for more than $140 billion in stock spooked
investors and sent P&AMP;G's shares down almost 20 percent in four days, making any
potential deal much more expensive for P&AMP;G shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believed Warner-Lambert, American Home Products and Procter &AMP; Gamble
could have been a blockbuster combination of technology, marketing and scale
capabilities," Durk I. Jager, chairman, chief executive and president of P&AMP;G,
said in a statement. But, he added, "we have concluded that leaks and resulting
speculation on a possible transaction have created an environment in which we
cannot continue meaningful discussions."
</P>
<P>
	   P&AMP;G said that while it still is in the market for an acquisition, it no
longer would be looking at drug companies.
</P>
<P>
	   After the announcement, Procter &AMP; Gamble's shares rebounded from a low of
$94.81 1/4 and closed up 18 3/4 cents at $102.87 1/2 on a sharply declining New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The abrupt end to the negotiations was the latest twist in a three-month
takeover battle for Warner-Lambert, which makes the best-selling
cholesterol-fighting drug Lipitor and consumer products like Certs breath mints,
Trident gum, Listerine mouthwash, and Schick razors.
</P>
<P>
	   On Nov. 4, Warner-Lambert agreed to be acquired for $55 billion by its New
Jersey neighbor American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
	   But rival drug maker Pfizer Inc., which co-markets Lipitor, almost
immediately trumped the deal with a $74 billion hostile bid for Warner-Lambert.
Pfizer also sued Warner-Lambert and American Home Products to block their deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert filed its own lawsuit against Pfizer and went looking for a
white knight to top Pfizer's offer even though it agreed to begin talks with
Pfizer this month, acknowledging that Pfizer's offer was a better deal than the
agreement with American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
	   With P&AMP;G stepping aside Monday, Warner-Lambert said it "will continue to
explore strategic alternatives, including discussions with Pfizer."
Warner-Lambert also has sounded out several competitors, including Bristol-Myers
Squibb, in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Any potential suitor, however, likely will think long and hard before
entering a bidding war for Warner-Lambert. Pfizer, which makes the
anti-impotence drug Viagra, is widely expected to fight hard for control of
Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer declined to comment on P&AMP;G's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquisition of Warner-Lambert and American Home Products, with a
combined market value of $140 billion, would have doubled the size of P&AMP;G and
marked a big change in company's direction. But investors also were concerned
P&AMP;G would pay for the deal by issuing stock, and thus dilute the stake of
current investors.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would rather see them (acquire a company) closer to their core business,
and I'm not that eager to see them make such a large transaction," said Steve
Paspal, an analyst and portfolio manager for Sovereign Asset Management, which
is a shareholder in P&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
	   Another drawback, he said, is the litigation among the companies, plus the
liability American Home Products faces from its recalled diet drug.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, American Home Products was sued by its marketing partner,
Interneuron Pharmaceuticals, for allegedly concealing the health risks of its
once popular diet pills.
</P>
<P>
	   And, in a separate case, the Surpreme Court rejected an appeal by American
Home Products, which was ordered to pay $20 million to a man who went blind
after taking the company's heart medication.
</P>
<P>
	   "This would have been a complex situation for (P&AMP;G) to get themselves into,"
Paspal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati-based P&AMP;G has set some aggressive growth projections, and the
acquisition of Warner-Lambert and American Home Products would have helped
exceed those targets. P&AMP;G could have used its marketing muscle and worldwide
distribution network to boost sales of the medicines it acquired.
</P>
<P>
	   The consumer products giant, however, won't be shopping for another
pharmaceutical company to fill the hole.
</P>
<P>
	   "The combination of Warner-Lambert and American Home Products generated a
lot of synergies in the pharmaceutical end," said Clayton C. Daley Jr., chief
financial officer of P&AMP;G. "If we go out and look at another pharmaceutical
company, those synergies won't be there."
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Warner-Lambert fell $4.06 1/4 to $87.93 3/4 as of 5:15 p.m. EST on
the NYSE, where American Home Products slumped $5.37 1/2 to $42.62 1/2, and
Pfizer's stock slipped 68 3/4 cents to $34.37 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Kodak's Sales and Profits Rise  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN DOBBIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co., benefiting from deep cutbacks in
costs and strong film sales worldwide, posted a 21 percent jump in profits in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The photography company said today that, excluding one-time charges and
credits, it earned $403 million, or $1.27 a share, up from $333 million, or
$1.05 a share, in the same quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The results beat Wall Street analysts' expectations of $1.24 a share,
according to First Call Corp. Kodak stock rose $1.31 1/4 to $62.06 1/4 in
trading at 5:15 p.m. New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   When one-time charges are included, Kodak's profit totaled $475 million, or
$1.50 a share, up 81 percent from $272 million, or 83 cents a share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Kodak gained $95 million in the quarter from selling its Dallas-based Image
Bank film archive and $25 million from the sale of a scientific instruments
business, but incurred $11 million in charges from closing its Elmgrove
manufacturing hub in Rochester. A year ago, earnings were reduced $71 million by
a variety of restructuring charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Carp, who took over as chief executive officer Jan. 1 from George
Fisher, predicted sales would grow between 6 percent and 7 percent this year.
Fisher is stepping down after a turbulent, six-year reign but staying on as
chairman until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues rose 7 percent to $3.8 billion from $3.56 billion, benefiting from
a 15 percent jump in sales of rolls of film around the world. Kodak's sales had
fallen for two years before turning upward in the last four quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Losses in digital photography, the recording of images on computer chips,
continued to narrow to $17 million in the quarter and $116 million in 1999 --
down from $262 million for all of 1998. Kodak expects to make its first profit
in that fast-growing field before long.
</P>
<P>
	   In the U.S. consumer film market, Kodak said sales rose 9 percent and prices
held steady in a market roiled by a price war sparked by Japanese nemesis Fuji
in 1997. Kodak corners about two-third of the U.S. market, but falling prices
have pinched profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Kodak cut costs by $520 million in 1999 and $730 million in 1998 -- $50
million more than its two-year target of $1.2 billion. That translated into
about 20,000 layoffs out of a worldwide payroll of 100,500 -- the deepest
cutbacks in Kodak's 119-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Kodak earned $1.392 billion, or $4.33 a share, up from
$1.390 billion, or $4.24 a share, in 1998. Sales for the year rose 5 percent to
$14.09 billion from $13.41 billion.

<HEADLINE> Bristol-Myers Earnings Rise  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bristol-Myers Squibb said its fourth-quarter earnings
excluding one-time charges rose 16 percent on the strength of the drugmaker's
diabetes and cancer medicines.
</P>
<P>
	   The third-largest U.S. pharmaceutical firm said Monday operating profits
were $1.05 billion or 52 cents per share in the final quarter of 1999, up from
$908 million or 45 cents per share a year ago. Results beat analysts' forecasts
by a penny, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fourth quarter of 1998, the company took an $800 million charge
against earnings to pay legal costs associated with several breast implant and
prescription drug pricing lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales in the latest quarter rose 11 percent to $5.4 billion from $4,9
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Taxol, the nation's top cancer drug, had a sales increase of 19 percent to
$414 million. Sales of the diabetes drug Glucophage rose 52 percent to $336
million.
</P>
<P>
	   One disappointment for Bristol-Myers was its top selling drug Pravachol, a
cholesterol-lowering pill. Pravachol sales rose just 4 percent to $1.7 billion.
Sales of the drug have been flat in the past year as it lost market share to
Lipitor, the cholesterol drug co-marketed by Warner-Lambert and Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
	   Enfamil, the company's infant formula, had sales increase 24 percent to $210
million for the quarter. Sales of Herbal Essences, a line of shampoos and
conditioners, rose 6 percent to $151 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding the special charge, in 1999 Bristol-Myers' earnings rose 15
percent to $4.17 billion or $2.06 per share, up from $3.14 billion or $1.79
cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 11 percent in 1999 to $20.2 billion from $18.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Bristol-Myers fell $2.50 to $58.68 3/4 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> German Conservatives Reach Impasse  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's conservatives said Monday they have reached a dead
end in their efforts to resolve a campaign money scandal to which ex-chancellor
Helmut Kohl holds the key.
</P>
<P>
	   An independent audit of party finances revealed more than $6.3 million came
from undetermined sources from 1989-98, according to party treasurer Matthias
Wissmann. Party officials suggested $1.14 million of that corresponds to amounts
Kohl says he solicited between 1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Party general secretary Angela Merkel said the figure could go higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl has denied misusing any of the money but has refused to disclose its
source.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators in Germany and four other countries are trying to trace a
complex series of payments, covert handoffs and front companies, leading to
references in the German media to ``Don Kohleone,'' a play on Don Corleone, the
central character in ``The Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
	   One of the most serious allegations is that former French President Francois
Mitterrand arranged payment of some $15.7 million to the Christian Democrats in
1992 to support Kohl's re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   A weekend report by German and French television claimed the money was
transferred as part of $44 million in payoffs by France's Elf Aquitaine for its
1992 purchase of a former East German refinery. A Kohl spokesman called the
report a smear campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Party officials said the audit turned up no evidence of the alleged millions
that were said to have flowed in the refinery deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Auditors should be able to trace the source of donations between 1989-92,
Wissmann said. But it will be difficult to clarify the course of donations after
1993 as long as Kohl and other key figures in setting up the illegal accounts
remain silent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Will we get the information from those who must know, or not?'' Wissmann
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Parliament is also investigating, and has been unable to locate some files
in the German chancellor's office left over from Kohl's administration related
to the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfgang Schaeuble, who took over leadership of the Christian Democrats,
said they ``will do everything to overcome the crisis and to renew the party.''
But, he acknowledged, ``We face limits.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble said legal pressure would be put on former tax adviser Horst
Weyrauch to cooperate. The party backed away from suggestions it would sue Kohl
to make him talk.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That would be ridiculous,'' Schaeuble said after a meeting of party
leaders to discuss the auditors' report, which they received Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble also leveled his harshest words yet at Kohl, saying he ``violated
inner-party democracy'' with the system of secret accounts that only he and a
small group of aides controlled. However, he said, the fact that his party's
irregularities were now coming to light and being investigated shows that
Germany's democratic institutions are healthy.
</P>
<P>
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who defeated Kohl two years ago, urged the
main opposition party to clear up the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only option is that the Christian Democrats do their duty and clear it
up,'' he told private N24 television. ``I think people expect that. People can
accept mistakes as long as they are not suppressed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl has been unapologetic. And he still has his supporters: The German
Soccer Association on Monday rejected calls by the governing Social Democrats to
dump Kohl from the guest list for its 100th anniversary gala Friday. Kohl later
said he would not attend.
</P>
<P>
	   The most bizarre twist in the case so far was a statement faxed to news
media Sunday that claimed Kohl was ready to identify the campaign donors. Kohl
swiftly declared the fax a forgery, saying his position hadn't changed.

<HEADLINE> Sudan's President Shuffles Gov't.  </HEADLINE>
   By MOHAMMED OSMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- President Omar el-Bashir reappointed an entirely new
government Monday in an effort to further purge Hassan Turabi, a Muslim
fundamentalist leader who had long been seen as the real power in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   El-Bashir fired 10 ministers and retained 15 ministers, including foreign,
interior and defense, in the new government, which is now packed with his
loyalists. Two ministries were disbanded. El-Bashir also appointed 25 new state
governors.
</P>
<P>
	   The shake-up came a day after the governing National Congress Party stripped
an advisory council headed by Turabi of its authority to appoint top party
posts, and set up a panel headed by el-Bashir with the mandate to nominate a new
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``God willing, with this team, we will guide Sudan toward peace,'' el-Bashir
said in an address to his new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   El-Bashir had been trying in recent months to wrest control of the
government from Turabi, who had sponsored a bloodless takeover -- an ``Islamic
coup'' unique in modern times -- in June 1989 that installed el-Bashir, then an
army officer, as president.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 12, el-Bashir declared a state of emergency and dissolved
Parliament, leaving Turabi without his job as Parliament speaker. In curbing
Turabi, el-Bashir accused him of trying to undermine the presidency. Turabi had
called for creating a prime minister's post and giving the legislature the power
to remove the president.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no immediate reports of tension in the streets. There had also
been no violence when el-Bashir had imposed emergency, indicating that Turabi's
fall was not widely mourned.
</P>
<P>
	   But Turabi, an urbane lawyer with degrees from universities in Britain and
France, is a renowned survivor. He has been a fixture of Sudanese politics since
1965, holding posts under five regimes, including a stint as attorney general.
</P>
<P>
	   His detractors abroad accused him of supporting Islamic militants, either by
providing refuge or setting up training camps -- charges that he described in an
interview in 1996 as ``absolute sheer nonsense.'' Nevertheless, his perceived
support for those groups alienated most of Sudan's neighbors, including Egypt,
Eritrea and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
	   One militant who took refuge in Sudan was Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi
millionaire the United States has accused of orchestrating twin bombings of
American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Turabi also advocates the imposition of strict Islamic law, first imposed in
this North African country in 1983 and a major factor in a rebellion by the
south. It was frozen in 1986 after a popular uprising toppled the government of
President Gaafar Nimeiri. Islamic law was revived in January 1991, 1 1/2 years
after el-Bashir came to power.
</P>
<P>
	   Sudan's political infighting has led to a stalemate in the search for a
political solution to the civil war in the south where rebels are fighting for
autonomy for the largely Christian and animist region from the Arabized north.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels have often said that no solution can be reached as long as Turabi
remained in power. About 2 million people have been killed in the 17-year-old
civil war and resulting famines.

<HEADLINE> Chinese General Meets U.S. Officials  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior Chinese general met Monday with Pentagon
officials to reopen high-level military contacts halted by China after U.S.
planes mistakenly bombed its embassy in Yugoslavia last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   People's Liberation Army Lt. Gen. Xiong Guangkai made courtesy calls on
Walter Slocombe, undersecretary of defense for policy, and Adm. Dennis Blair,
commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Command.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon spokesmen declined to provide details. There was no military honors
ceremony for Xiong's arrival.
</P>
<P>
	   Xiong also met at the State Department with Thomas Pickering, the
undersecretary of state, and John Holum, the department's top arms-control
official. It was during Pickering's visit to Beijing last October that Chinese
officials first indicated willingness to discuss resuming military-to-military
contacts.
</P>
<P>
	   Xiong met for about 20 minutes with Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well. More in-depth discussions with Pentagon
officials are scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   A former head of military intelligence, Xiong is deputy chief of the general
staff of the People's Liberation Army. He is one of China's most politically
influential generals and is known for hard-line views on the United States. He
is a member of the ruling Communist Party's committee that sets policy toward
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials had little to say about Xiong's first day of meetings but
were quick to offer an explanation for why a black Mercedes sedan carrying
members of Xiong's delegation was damaged by a security barricade on an entryway
to the Pentagon. The barricade popped up, snagging the car, because the driver
was following too closely behind another car in the delegation, according to
Pentagon spokesman Glenn Flood.
</P>
<P>
	   Flood said no one was injured, although the sedan was damaged and towed. In
a similar accident at the same barricade in September 1998, Japan's defense
chief suffered an injured ankle.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. government exchanges with the PLA are restricted by a provision of the
2000 defense authorization passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton
last fall. It prohibits the Pentagon from authorizing any military exchanges
involving nuclear operations, joint combat operations, space issues and other
activities.
</P>
<P>
	   The chief author of that legislation, Sen. Robert Smith, R-N.H., asserts
that Xiong has knowledge about Chinese government efforts to obtain military
technology illegally from U.S. defense companies. In a letter last week to Sen.
Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Government Affairs Committee,
Smith asked Thompson to consider issuing a subpoena for Xiong to testify before
the committee this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Xiong's talks at the
Pentagon Tuesday and Wednesday would cover a range of issues including strategic
assessments of security in the 21st century, geopolitical conditions in the
Asia-Pacific and military modernization. Bacon said Xiong also planned to see
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon hopes this week's talks will clarify prospects for expanding
high-level contacts to include visits to Beijing this year by Blair and Defense
Secretary William Cohen, who is to meet with Xiong on Wednesday. Cohen was
forced to cancel a planned visit to Beijing last year when the Kosovo conflict
began.
</P>
<P>
	   China agreed to send Xiong to Washington after the United States agreed in
mid-December to seek $28 million from Congress for the extensive bomb damage to
China's embassy in Belgrade. China agreed to pay $2.87 million for damage done
in reprisal attacks on the U.S. Embassy and consular offices in China.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seven years after he declared ``our nation needs a new
direction,'' President Clinton might have used his last State of the Union
address to reflect on his record rather than to offer a long list of legislative
proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   But he won't.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's Thursday night speech to both houses of Congress promises a score
of specific policy proposals. It's a familiar formula, but one that often is
more effective in a president's first year than in his last.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clinton is in a terrible and also familiar place for presidents,'' said
Paul Light, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution.
``Whatever he says is rendered immediately irrelevant. Congress is not going to
do anything on his agenda.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The final State of the Union in an eight-year term can be an opportunity
for reflection, for setting a tone for the coming administration,'' Light said.
``It is not well-used as an opportunity to restate a long list of legislative
priorities. But presidents who are on their way out find it very difficult to do
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton offered 82 policy proposals in his 1999 address, and he has left no
doubt about which path he will take this year.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent weeks, he has appeared at a series of events staged to showcase
initiatives that he will propose in his fiscal 2001 budget from gun control to
tuition relief. In an interview with The Christian Science Monitor, he promised
the State of the Union would cover the patients' bill of rights, loopholes in
the Brady Bill, a minimum wage increase, hate crimes, job discrimination,
Medicare reform and more.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you see everything we recommend in the aggregate, you might think
that in terms of specifics, it's the most ambitious set of proposals since my
first year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   That first speech offers an example of how specific plans in a State of the
Union address can backfire. Clinton promised ``a comprehensive plan for health
reform that will finally bring costs under control'' while stamping out fraud in
the nation's health-care system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our families will never be secure, our business will never be strong and
our government will never again be fully solvent until we tackle the health-care
crisis,'' he said. ``We must do it this year.''
</P>
<P>
	   That was 1992. The resulting debacle ranks among the biggest setbacks of
Clinton's administration, and securing minimum guarantees for patients remains
high on the Clinton agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president has said time and time again we bit off more than we could
chew, but he doesn't regret having set that as a challenge for America,'' said
White House spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't the only State of the Union plan that provided political fodder
for Clinton's opponents. The Republican National Committee is circulating a list
of five ``broken promises'' made from the podium in the House of Representatives
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   The list includes raising the Social Security earnings limit and eliminating
the income tax marriage penalty. However, it also includes a tax credit for
parents, which Clinton later signed. Clinton recently has talked about cutting
the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, Clinton has had considerable success using the speech to
frame the political debate. Even though health-care reform failed, the issue
continues to resonate with voters, as evidenced by the debates ahead of the
Democratic primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Clinton's call to ``save Social Security first'' shifted the debate
to what should be done with the budget surplus. Siewert said Clinton again will
try to ``define the terms of debate on the larger issues the country faces.''
While he will mention his achievements, Siewert said, Clinton will ``very much
look forward to the unfinished business both of last year and the last
century.''
</P>
<P>
	   As far as Brookings' Light is concerned, focusing on specific business is
``a waste of the president's bully pulpit.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The far better approach would be for him to reflect on what's been
accomplished and what the next president needs to do,'' said Light. ``But it is
very tempting for a president in his last year to try to gin up enthusiasm over
an agenda that has no chance of passing.''

<HEADLINE> Treasury Bond Prices Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices rose Monday, as investors sought the
security of government securities amid heavy selling of stocks on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year note climbed  5/8 point, or $6.25 per $1,000 in
face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.64
percent from 6.70 percent late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond prices often increase as stocks stumble, as investors seek a haven for
their funds and a fixed rate of return while they watch for clues on the course
of stock markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 243.54 Monday to close at 11,008.17,
its steepest loss since Jan. 4, when it plunged 359 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond trading was relatively slow as many investors await congressional
appearances by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities rose by
between 3/32 point and 3/16 point, and intermediate maturities rose 5/16 point
to 9/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.53 percent as the discount fell
0.04 percentage point to 5.37 percent. Six-month yields were 5.74 percent, as
the discount fell 0.06 to 5.50 percent. One-year yields were 6.07 percent as the
discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 5.73 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose
to 5.50 percent from 5.38 percent late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index for municipal bonds rose 1/32 to 91 3/16 point. The
yield was 6.31 percent, down from Friday's 6.32 percent.

<HEADLINE> Officials blame financial mismanagement for Dempsey deficit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Officials at the University of Connecticut Health
Center tried to hide a $21 million deficit, doled out questionable contracts and
set up multimillion dollar programs without proper approval, according to a
state agency report released Monday.
<P>
	   UConn officials blasted the state Office of Health Care Access report,
saying it was not based on fact.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond Gorman, OHCA's commissioner, said he found the problems while
developing recommendations on what should be done with the money-losing John
Dempsey Hospital, which is part of the health center operation.
</P>
<P>
	   The report says the 204-bed hospital should stay open for now, but it needs
strict financial oversight.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't feel there has been sufficient oversight of the financial
operations at the health center," Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The OHCA report was delivered to the General Assembly and the Attorney
General on Monday, Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gorman said the UConn Health Care Center, which also includes the
university's medical and dental schools, should be reviewed by an independent
auditing agency. That could cost $500,000 and take up to nine months, Gorman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The General Assembly allowed the health center to forego paying certain
taxes last June to save them from what was believed to be a $6.5 million
deficit. But Gorman said the problem was actually much worse.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Legislature was led to believe...that fixed the budget problems at John
Dempsey Hospital," Gorman said. "But the numbers were not based on reality."
</P>
<P>
	   In October, the health center reported a $14 million shortfall, and soon
revised that projection to a $21 million deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   Gorman said his agency is also concerned about a $2.25 million contract
UConn entered into with a private company that manages OB/GYN and in-vitro
fertilization services at the health center.
</P>
<P>
	   Gorman questioned whether public money should be paying for a private
company to run a state operation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that's something policy makers need to deal with," he said. "But
most importantly, we don't see any evidence that this was in the financial best
interest of the university."
</P>
<P>
	   Gorman said the health center also set up three new programs - including
units for a cardiac step-down service, ambulatory surgery and medical psychiatry
- without OHCA approval. New hospital services that cost more than $1 million
must have OHCA approval, Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Programs like that certainly would constitute a new service and in most
cases would also exceed the capital threshold of $1 million."
</P>
<P>
	   Lorraine M. Aronson, UConn's chief financial officer, said that allegation
is a based on a misinterpretation of law, and criticized the OHCA report.
</P>
<P>
	   "The conclusions are not founded on fact," said Aronson, a former budget
chief for Gov. Lowell Weicker. "There is nothing that backs up any of the
allegations concerning financial problems in the report."
</P>
<P>
	   Aronson acknowledged the health center has a $21 million deficit, but said
all other state hospitals and many medical centers across the country also are
in the red.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know where every penny is coming from where every penny is going and
we're fixing the problem," said Aronson.
</P>
<P>
	   House Democratic leaders said last week they want to keep Dempsey Hospital
open, and are willing to help plug the health center's deficit. Lawmakers have
not said how much they'll give the health center, but insisted the facility
would not be given a blank check.
</P>
<P>
	   The OHCA report recommends that any money the Legislature hands over should
be a one-time bailout, and stressed that an independent board should oversee the
health center's finances.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Toni Harp, co-chairwoman of the legislature's Public Health Committee,
said the OHCA report is filled with speculation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I find the report's allegation of fraud...to be particularly
inappropriate," said Harp, D-New Haven. "There is no proof offered. Without
proof, the allegation is baseless and irresponsible."

<HEADLINE> Thai Forces Storm Besieged Hospital  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW PENNINGTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RATCHABURI, Thailand (AP) -- Thai security forces stormed a hospital Tuesday
where heavily armed insurgents from Myanmar had trapped hundreds of patients,
visitors and staff in a 22-hour hostage drama.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels belonging to God's Army, an insurgent group led by 12-year-old
twins, seized the hospital on Monday and took the hostages in an attempt to
pressure the Thai government to help their beleaguered movement.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels, who reportedly were aided by dissidents from the group that took
control of Myanmar's embassy in Bangkok last October, wanted helicopters to make
their escape.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, the rebels released at least 40 patients, some in exchange for
food, and dozens of others escaped. Those freed included a pregnant 18-year-old
who went into labor and an 8-year-old boy in a coma after brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   The takeover began at dawn when the raiders hijacked a Thai bus near the
border with Myanmar and forced the driver to take them 45 miles to Ratchaburi.
</P>
<P>
	   About 10 rebels wearing camouflage gear and masks forced their way into
Ratchaburi provincial hospital. A food vendor, Somboon Sangthong, said he saw
two men overcome guards at the hospital gate, wire explosive devices to it and
fire shots into the air.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was shocked and everybody started to run away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Security officials said the rebels threatened to blow up the hospital if
attacked.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past week, God's Army has come under sustained attack by Myanmar --
formerly known as Burma -- at their jungle base near the border, driving at
least 1,000 minority Karen refugees into Thailand. Thai troops have fired
artillery to prevent the fighters from crossing over the border.
</P>
<P>
	   After the hospital was seized, army commander Gen. Surayud Chulanond said
Thailand would stop its shelling, allow civilians refuge and let injured
guerrillas receive treatment in Thai hospitals. Rebels seeking refuge would have
to surrender arms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will deal very carefully with the situation,'' he said. ``Our first
priority is every one of the hostages has to be safe.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 medical staff and 600 patients were in the hospital when it was
seized, said Dr. Kawat Suntrajarn of the Public Health Ministry. About 200 were
believed to be in the five-story administrative building and emergency room
building which were held by the insurgents.
</P>
<P>
	   Little was known about the gunmen or the situation inside the hospital until
they let in a television crew from Thai television Channel 7. They took footage
showing scores of frightened people sitting on rows of waiting-room benches and
of a masked man brandishing an assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to tell the world how Karen and Burmese refugees live during the
fighting,'' said one hostage-taker, who called himself Nui. ``We will not hurt
any hostages. We take good care of them.''
</P>
<P>
	   A doctor telephoned about two dozen patients and their relatives in the
postoperative ward, telling them not to move. Lacking contact with hospital
officials, the patients did what the rest of Thailand did -- watch the drama
unfold on television.
</P>
<P>
	   Prasert Panpongpaew, 63, a retired government official with diabetes, said
that at midday, the patients reasoned that the raiders weren't covering all the
buildings and they would try to escape.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wasn't scared, but some people were,'' Prasert said. ``We had to take
some risk. Fifty-fifty. We helped each other get up, and we got down the stairs
OK and outside.''
</P>
<P>
	   Boonmak Sirinavakul, a local member of parliament, said doctors outside were
using mobile phones to instruct nurses inside on caring for patients.
</P>
<P>
	   The government of Myanmar expressed hope that the siege would end without
bloodshed, and said the hostage-takers should be treated as terrorists by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
	   Boonmak said the gunmen had requested two helicopters. The ITV television
network said the insurgents asked for 10 doctors to be flown to the border.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Oct. 1, five members of a small dissident group, the Vigorous Burmese
Student Warriors, seized Myanmar's embassy in Bangkok and held dozens of
hostages for 26 hours before being flown to the border and freed. Media reports
said members of the same group is involved in the hospital takeover.
</P>
<P>
	   The dissidents then hid out with God's Army, composed mostly of ethnic
Karens and led by twins Johnny and Luther Htoo.
</P>
<P>
	   The twins told The Associated Press in December they were fighting for
democracy in their homeland, which has been ruled by military dictators since
1962. The Karens have been fighting for more autonomy for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Like most Karens, God's Army are Christians in a predominantly Buddhist
country.

<HEADLINE> Cash for new construction included in Whitman budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Flush with cash, Gov. Christie Whitman's $21.3
billion spending plan proposes millions of dollars on brick and mortar projects.
<P>
	   In addition to a refreshed fund for highways, bridges and mass transit, and
the first installment of a $9.4 billion school construction fund, the budget
also proposes a new minimum security prison, three new State Police helicopters,
a new veterans home, a new public health lab and assorted other goodies.
</P>
<P>
	   All told, the budget reserves $3.1 billion for capital projects, $700
million more than the last budget, according to state officials. About one-third
of the state's investment, $1.1 billion, would come from the general fund. The
remainder would be borrowed or come from other sources such as the tobacco
settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the big ticket items the governor wants to tackle in the budget year
that begins July 1:
</P>
<P>
	   School construction: Whitman announced plans to spend $5 billion in the
state's 30 special needs districts, $4.4 billion in the remainder of the school
districts, all over the next 10 years. The money would go toward complying with
a state Supreme Court order to replace or repair antiquated school buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   Transportation: The actual list of projects to be financed by a renewed
Transportation Trust Fund will be released in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Corrections: The governor included $33 million in capital funds, including
$10.2 million for new 350-bed minimum security prison for which a location must
still be determined. She also included $3 million for a 200-bed minimum security
expansion at the Ancora Psychiatric Hospital and $10.7 million for a 180-bed
expansion of the boot camp at New Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
	   Law and Public Safety: The governor budgeted $2 million to retrofit State
Police facilities to accommodate female troopers. She also is including $8.7
million to purchase three new ambulance helicopters for the State Police, which
would be the net cost after factoring in trade-ins.
</P>
<P>
	   Military and Veterans Affairs: Whitman budgeted $3.6 million for design
costs and $14.4 million in construction costs for a new veterans home in
Vineland. The project would increase the number of beds from 282 to 332.
</P>
<P>
	   Public Health: The state's laboratory was tapped out in 1999, according to
Whitman Administration officials. It tested Kosovar refugees for tuberculosis,
checked water supplies after Hurricane Floyd, and monitored the spread of the
West Nile strain of encephalitis in New Jersey. Whitman proposes spending
$750,000 to design a new lab, and $1.6 million to upgrade the existing lab while
the new one is being built.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman also included $51 million for hazardous waste cleanup and the
replacement of privately owned underground storage tanks, $25 million for shore
protection and beach replenishment and $98 million for open space purchases in
her budget.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Plunge; Dow Ends Down 243.54  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged Monday as optimism about corporate earnings
gave way to jitters about rising interest rates and their impact on profit
growth.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 243.54 to close at 11,008.17, its
steepest loss since Jan. 4, when it lost 359 points. The selloff was
broad-based, with 27 of 30 Dow component stocks finishing lower. General
Electric, down 6 to 138 1/8, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, down 6 3/16 to 83 11/16, led
the decline.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators also fell in a volatile session. The Nasdaq
plummeted 139.32 points to close at 4,096.08, its worst point drop since it fell
150 points Jan. 5, and its fourth-biggest point decline ever. The Nasdaq had
risen as much as 67 points in early trading.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 39.45 to 1,401.91 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell for the first time since Jan. 12, losing 10.99 to
close at 522.95.
</P>
<P>
	   After a strong opening, stocks began to slide at midday as investors looked
ahead to the next meeting of the Federal Reserve on Feb. 1 and 2. Many on Wall
Street now fear that an interest rate increase at that meeting will be the first
of several this year as the central bank works to stave off inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the Fed raised interest rates three times, hoping to keep inflation
under control. While most economists see little evidence of inflation now,
continued signs of economic strength have convinced some that inflation could
escalate at any time.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Jack Guynn acknowledged
that last year's rate increases had little effect on economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no broad-scale evidence to show that those three increases have
done anything to dampen consumer demand," he said, although he noted that it
takes several months to see the full impact of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Guynn's comments unnerved investors a day before Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan's planned testimony before a Senate committee about the federal
budget. While Greenspan is not expected to specifically address interest rates,
Fed watchers will carefully monitor his comments for any signs of the central
bank's course, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's become a foregone conclusion that interest rates are on the rise, and
no matter how much, that hurts investors' psyche," said Arthur Hogan, chief
market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The broadness and the depth of the selloff suggested that other factors
influenced the market on Monday. Traders said some investors sold stocks to
collect profits from a solid rise in the Nasdaq last week. Cisco Systems fell 6
3/16 to 109 1/16 and Sun Microsystems dropped 5 5/16 to 79 1/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Hogan said, investors are greeting Corporate America's strong earnings
reports with a pessimistic eye.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a lot of speculation about whether these numbers will be
repeatable," he said. Companies in the S&AMP;P 500 are expected to report average
profit growth of 20 percent for the fourth quarter, and those numbers will
become especially tough to match if interest rates continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong corporate earnings prompted some investors to buy. Eastman Kodak rose
1 5/16 to 62 1/16 after reporting it earned $1.27 per share in the fourth
quarter, beating analysts' estimates of $1.24. Kodak, which has faltered in
recent years due to tougher competition from Fuji, also issued a strong outlook
for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble edged up 3/16 to 102 7/8 after calling off talks to acquire
drug makers Warner-Lambert and American Home Products. Procter &AMP; Gamble's stock
price had tumbled 17 percent since rumors of a deal emerged last week, as
shareholders believed the company would have had to issue significant amounts of
new stock to pay for the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner, fresh from its $145 billion merger with America Online, fell 3
1/2 to 87 5/8 after announcing plans to merge its music business with British
music company EMI Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, decliners led by a 4-to-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE consolidated volume totaled 1.38 billion shares, compared with 1.46
billion in the previous session. The Nasdaq had its busiest session ever, with
1.97 billion shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.0 percent. Germany's DAX index
fell 0.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 gained 0.5 percent, and France's CAC-40
closed 0.2 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> American Home accused of concealing health risk of diet drugs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP)- American Home Products, already facing thousands of
lawsuits related to its once popular diet drugs, was sued on Monday by its
marketing partner Interneuron Pharmaceuticals for allegedly concealing the
health risks of the pills.
<P>
	   Lexington, Mass.-based Interneuron is seeking unspecified damages against
American Home in the suit filed in Middlesex Superior Court in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   In the complaint, Interneuron accuses American Home of deliberately
concealing information regarding possible health risks associated with the use
of "fen-phen," a combination of the anti-obesity drugs Pondimin (fenfluramine)
and phentermine.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said the information was vital to help it assess the safety of
Redux, a chemical cousin of Pondimin, which was developed by Interneuron and
marketed by AHP.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home's failure to disclose the safety risks from February 1997
through June 1997 prevented Interneuron from taking action, including possibly
moving to take Redux off the market earlier, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said it lost the opportunity to disclose the safety problems to
its shareholders, the financial markets and regulatory agencies, according to
the suit. Such action would have helped protect its reputation, which was hurt
when the drugs were banned, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a result of AHP's fraudulent activities, Interneuron suffered serious
financial loss, including a decrease in its market capitalization of hundreds of
millions of dollars," said Glenn L. Cooper, president and chief executive
officer of Interneuron.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home denied any wrongdoing with respect to its contractual
obligations with Interneuron. A spokesman said American Home also disclosed all
safety data on its anti-obesity drugs to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
	   Pondimin and Redux were taken off the market in September 1997. Pondimin was
made and marketed by American Home, while Redux was developed by Interneuron and
marketed by American Home.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron is now facing more than 2,000 lawsuits related to Redux.
</P>
<P>
	   In October 1999, American Home agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle
thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to
fen-phen. But the settlement has not been finalized, and attorneys said many
clients will opt-out of the agreement so they can sue on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home's legal problems are one reason the company is having trouble
completing its proposed merger with Warner-Lambert. Warner-Lambert is now in
talks to merge with Pfizer Inc., putting the deal with American Home in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said it has tried for two years to negotiate a settlement with
American Home to indemnify Interneuron from lawsuits related to the diet drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said American Home first learned of health dangers of fen-phen
as early as February 1997, when it received information from the Mayo Clinic.
The Mayo Clinic had collected information from patients who had developed heart
valve damage after taking the drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the chemical similarity between Pondimin and Redux, American Home
should have immediately alerted Interneuron of the information, the complaint
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Interneuron said American Home waited until July 1997 to reveal the
information.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home withheld the data on the Mayo study because it feared the
results would have on the diet drugs' sales, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
	   In July 1997, the Mayo Clinic announced that it had received reports of 24
cases in which patients using fen-phen had been diagnosed with cardiac valve
disease. In September 1997, the companies removed Pondimin and Redux from the
market.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Interneuron rose 56 1/4 cents to $3 in trading at 4 p.m. on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. Shares of American Home fell $5.37 1/2 to $42.62 1/2 in
trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Judge Refuses Restraint of Tabloid  </HEADLINE>
    By BILL BERGSTROM AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A federal judge refused to block distribution of a new
daily tabloid that debuted at transit stops Monday, despite objections from
competitors who said the paper's relationship with the city's transit agency was
unconstitutional and unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Robert F. Kelly refused to grant the temporary
restraining order sought by the publishers of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the
Philadelphia Daily News, The New York Times and USA Today against Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   They had argued that Metro's deal with SEPTA was unconstitutional because it
allowed a government agency to assert control over a newspaper and created an
unfair advantage by allowing the free paper to be distributed where other
publications cannot be sold.
</P>
<P>
	   But Kelly said the publishers failed to show that they would suffer
"immediate and irreparable harm" unless a restraining order was granted.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision does not prevent the publishers from continuing their challenge
of SEPTA's relationship with Metro, but allows the tabloid to operate as it had
planned.
</P>
<P>
	   "They will have to weigh whether the benefits of proceeding outweigh the
negative publicity of an unseemly appearance of large, powerful news media
attempting to suppress a small competitor," said SEPTA attorney William Roberts.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Schwartz, an attorney for Inquirer and Daily News publisher
Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., said he would appeal Kelly's ruling to the U.S.
3rd Circuit Court of Appeals and also would file a request with the judge to
issue an injunction pending that appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe that SEPTA's policy to allow the newspaper Metro to be
distributed in areas where no other newspapers are distributed is
unconstitutional under the First Amendment," Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the other publications could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling came hours after the inaugural edition of the 24-page Metro was
delivered to train, subway and bus stops across SEPTA's five-county area.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously we're very pleased and we're looking forward to continuing to
publish just as we did today and provide Philadelphia with a great, new
newspaper," said Jack Roberts, managing director and publisher of Metro.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a five-year contract, the paper guarantees SEPTA a minimum of $30,000
a month in advertising revenue and $15,000 a month in costs to help clean up
discarded newspapers. In exchange, the newspaper is to be distributed at 852
locations in SEPTA's coverage area.
</P>
<P>
	   Metro's competitors challenged the SEPTA contract, which states that
commuters will receive "an objective and nonpartisan newspaper" but also says
"each issue should provide SEPTA with significant editorial coverage and must
conform to SEPTA's editorial standards for content." Metro also must conform to
SEPTA advertising policies.
</P>
<P>
	   "The government has no business making its own decision as to what is fair,
honest or in good taste," Schwartz said at a hearing earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts said the editorial requirement will be met by providing the agency
with its own full page for announcements and news items in each issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "Other than that, they have absolutely no way of knowing what we are doing,"
Editor Mary Ellen Bornak said.
</P>
<P>
	   Launched six years ago in Sweden, Metro International now publishes free
daily transit system newspapers in 13 European cities and in Santiago, Chile.
The company, which is eyeing the New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco
markets, chose Philadelphia as its first U.S. city in part because SEPTA was
looking for a publication it could use to improve communication with its riders.
</P>
<P>
	   Billing itself as "a paper that could change the face of journalism in the
United States," Metro published a colorful edition Monday, with the Time
Warner-EMI merger as the lead story and a fire that killed a family of four
Sunday in suburban Levittown the top local story.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Metro's stories were two or three paragraphs. A two-page spread gave
the history of the Metro papers elsewhere. The sports section featured mostly
two-paragraph stories, plus a two-page spread on professional wrestling.
</P>
<P>
	   "Short is good for the train," said Sarah Jones as she read the paper.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy Bill Filed in Congress  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress bestowed American citizenship on Winston
Churchill and Mother Teresa, and awarded it posthumously to Raoul Wallenberg,
the Swedish diplomat who saved tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews in World War
II. But the extraordinary power has been used rarely -- and never for a minor
child against a parent's wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and a group of Florida
lawmakers put in motion a process to give citizenship to 6-year-old Cuban
refugee Elian Gonzalez, without his father's consent.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott, R-Miss., told the Senate the bill ``to grant citizenship to this young
boy'' could come up for debate as soon as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors hoped to whisk it through Congress quickly, largely to remove the
case from the jurisdiction of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which
has ruled that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba. Passage would
also render moot a federal court appeal of the INS ruling by Elian's
great-uncle, sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This moves the decision-making out of the hands of the INS and into the
hands of the (state) courts,'' Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., the chief Senate
sponsor, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Monday, Mack formally introduced the measure in the Senate, and Lott
invoked a parliamentary procedure designed to bring it before the chamber as
early as Wednesday for debate. A vote Wednesday was possible, but both sides
said they doubted final action would occur until next week at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart declined to say what President
Clinton would do if Congress passed the bill -- sign it or veto it -- but said
the White House would consider the matter after Congress acts. The president has
indicated he does not believe Congress should get involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a real danger here that this can become a political issue, that
this young boy will be a political football,'' Lockhart said. ``And I think the
president has made it very clear to everyone that they ought to stay away from
politics here and stick to what the facts and the law dictate.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Mack said, ``There has been political influence even from the beginning
in the case,'' including rallies in Havana that Mack said were orchestrated by
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Senate Judiciary Committee's top
Democrat, denounced the legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the Congress to grant citizenship to a young boy over the father's
objection makes a mockery of family values, and it hands Castro yet another
reason to portray the United States as the enemy,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the high-profile examples of Churchill, Mother Teresa and
Wallenberg, Congress has used this power rarely and selectively. Its involvement
in individual immigration cases has declined sharply over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about half a dozen private immigration bills are introduced each year,
but most of them deal with advancing a pending case, trying to prevent a
deportation or helping an American employed overseas retain citizenship. Some
examples:
</P>
<P>
	   --In July 1997, Swiss banker Christoph Meili won permanent residency status.
He had lost his job after saving Holocaust-era bank documents from a shredder.
</P>
<P>
	   --In 1968, three men -- from Italy, Ireland and Germany -- who died while
fighting with American units in Vietnam, posthumously received U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   --In December 1975, Mrika Mrnacaj, a 111-year-old Albanian immigrant who
wanted to vote in a U.S. election before she died, won citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   --In 1988, Michael Wilding, the son of actress Elizabeth Taylor and a former
stepson of Sen. John Warner, R-Va., won citizenship. The British subject had
renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1971, and the bill blocked a possible
deportation on a marijuana possession conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   --In that same year, 1988, Congress rejected legislation that would have let
tennis star Ivan Lendl bypass the five-year waiting period for American
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of immigration bills fell off dramatically after the Abscam
scandal in the early 1980s when FBI agents posing as Arab sheiks asked members
of Congress to introduce private immigration bills to allow wealthy ``Arabs'' to
enter the United States in exchange for money.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining Mack and Lott in sponsoring the bill for Elian Gonzalez were Sens.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., and Bob Graham, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   In the House, Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas; and several Florida
lawmakers co-sponsored a similar bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Reps. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., and Peter
Deutsch, D-Fla, introduced a rival bill to grant Elian permanent residency
status.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will give Elian the choice, when he's old enough, to decide the
citizenship question for himself,'' Menendez said.
</P>
<P>
	   And Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., introduced a resolution -- co-sponsored by
nine Democrats and one Republican -- urging that Elian be reunited with his
father.
</P>
<P>
	   John Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said no
decision had yet been made on how to proceed in the House -- whether to try to
bring the bill to the floor directly, or to let the House Judiciary Committee
consider it first.
</P>
<P>
	   Although not a sponsor, Hastert supports the bill and ``he'll help to
advance it,'' said Feehery.

<HEADLINE> Officials blame financial mismanagement for Dempsey deficit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Officials at the University of Connecticut Health
Center tried to hide a $21 million deficit, doled out questionable contracts and
set up multimillion dollar programs without proper approval, according to a
state agency report released Monday.
<P>
	   UConn officials blasted the state Office of Health Care Access report,
saying it was not based on fact.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond Gorman, OHCA's commissioner, said he found the problems while
developing recommendations on what should be done with the money-losing John
Dempsey Hospital, which is part of the health center operation.
</P>
<P>
	   The report says the 204-bed hospital should stay open for now, but it needs
strict financial oversight.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't feel there has been sufficient oversight of the financial
operations at the health center," Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The OHCA report was delivered to the General Assembly and the Attorney
General on Monday, Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gorman said the UConn Health Care Center, which also includes the
university's medical and dental schools, should be reviewed by an independent
auditing agency. That could cost $500,000 and take up to nine months, Gorman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The General Assembly allowed the health center to forego paying certain
taxes last June to save them from what was believed to be a $6.5 million
deficit. But Gorman said the problem was actually much worse.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Legislature was led to believe...that fixed the budget problems at John
Dempsey Hospital," Gorman said. "But the numbers were not based on reality."
</P>
<P>
	   In October, the health center reported a $14 million shortfall, and soon
revised that projection to a $21 million deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   Gorman said his agency is also concerned about a $2.25 million contract
UConn entered into with a private company that manages OB/GYN and in-vitro
fertilization services at the health center.
</P>
<P>
	   Gorman questioned whether public money should be paying for a private
company to run a state operation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that's something policy makers need to deal with," he said. "But
most importantly, we don't see any evidence that this was in the financial best
interest of the university."
</P>
<P>
	   Gorman said the health center also set up three new programs - including
units for a cardiac step-down service, ambulatory surgery and medical psychiatry
- without OHCA approval. New hospital services that cost more than $1 million
must have OHCA approval, Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Programs like that certainly would constitute a new service and in most
cases would also exceed the capital threshold of $1 million."
</P>
<P>
	   Lorraine M. Aronson, UConn's chief financial officer, said that allegation
is a based on a misinterpretation of law, and criticized the OHCA report.
</P>
<P>
	   "The conclusions are not founded on fact," said Aronson, who served as
budget chief for former Gov. Lowell Weicker. "There is nothing that backs up any
of the allegations concerning financial problems in the report."
</P>
<P>
	   Aronson acknowledged the health center has a $21 million deficit, but said
all other state hospitals and many medical centers across the country also are
in the red.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know where every penny is coming from where every penny is going and
we're fixing the problem," said Aronson.
</P>
<P>
	   House Democratic leaders said last week they want to keep Dempsey Hospital
open, and are willing to help plug the health center's deficit. Lawmakers have
not said how much they'll give the health center, but insisted the facility
would not be given a blank check.
</P>
<P>
	   The OHCA report recommends that any money the Legislature hands over should
be a one-time bailout, and stressed that an independent board should oversee the
health center's finances.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Toni Harp, co-chairwoman of the legislature's Public Health Committee,
said the OHCA report is filled with speculation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I find the report's allegation of fraud...to be particularly
inappropriate," said Harp, D-New Haven. "There is no proof offered. Without
proof, the allegation is baseless and irresponsible."

<HEADLINE> Publishers Clearing House Sued  </HEADLINE>
    By ASHLEY H. GRANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. PAUL (AP) -- Sixteen states filed complaints Monday against sweepstakes
giant Publishers Clearing House, claiming the company misled consumers into
believing that they had a better chance of winning if they ordered more
products.
</P>
<P>
	   The Port Washington, N.Y.-based company, which sells magazines and other
merchandise through direct mail, misrepresents that it has a "personal
relationship with consumers" and that it induces people into believing that they
are guaranteed winners of multimillion dollar prizes, when they were winners of
$1 or costume jewelry, according to the lawsuit filed in Minnesota -- typical of
those filed in other states.
</P>
<P>
	   Also suing Monday were Colorado, New York, North Carolina, New Jersey,
Illinois, Ohio, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Vermont, Oregon, Pennsylvania, West
Virginia, Louisiana, Georgia and California. Similar complaints had been filed
separately in nine states.
</P>
<P>
	   Christopher L. Irving, director of consumer affairs at Publishers Clearing
House, said the majority of people who return their sweepstakes entries do so
without ordering.
</P>
<P>
	   "The majority of our millionaire winners, 23 of 30, did not order with their
winning entry," Irving said.
</P>
<P>
	   Irving said the company does not target any age group or demographic.
</P>
<P>
	   "The audience that we seek is the United States population," he said, adding
that the company sells everything from "Rolling Stone" magazine to Glenn Miller
tapes.
</P>
<P>
	   The states sued Monday because a hearing was scheduled Tuesday in a proposed
settlement of a class-action lawsuit against the company. The attorneys general
feared a settlement might keep them from suing in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the lawyers who filed that suit, Steven A. Katz, expected consumers
to collect between $14 million and $16 million in that case. The deadline for
filing a claim was Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
	   The "fairness hearing" to finalize the case is scheduled for Tuesday in U.S.
District Court in East St. Louis, Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 43 million consumers eligible in the class-action lawsuit, about
100,000 people responded, Irving said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, President Clinton signed into law a measure designed to help
protect people from sweepstakes scams.
</P>
<P>
	   The Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act bars sponsors from
implying that buying products can increase entrants' chances of winning big
prizes, requires prominent display of messages that no purchase is required and
bars telling recipients that they have won a prize unless they actually have.
</P>
<P>
	   It also imposes million-dollar fines on sweepstakes companies that violate
the law.
</P>
<P>
	   The states that had sued Publishers Clearing House prior to Monday were
Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan, Missouri, Texas, Wisconsin, Washington
and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
	   Publishers Clearing House was founded in 1953 and has been holding
sweepstakes since 1967. The company has given out about $137 million in major
prizes and awards, Irving said. In 1997 and 1998, the company had annual sales
of about $375 million.

<HEADLINE> American Home Sued for Concealment  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP)-- American Home Products, already facing thousands of lawsuits
related to its once popular diet drugs, was sued on Monday by its marketing
partner Interneuron Pharmaceuticals for allegedly concealing the health risks of
the pills.
</P>
<P>
	   Lexington, Mass.-based Interneuron is seeking unspecified damages against
American Home in the suit filed in Middlesex Superior Court in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   In the complaint, Interneuron accuses American Home of deliberately
concealing information regarding possible health risks associated with the use
of "fen-phen," a combination of the anti-obesity drugs Pondimin (fenfluramine)
and phentermine.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said the information was vital to help it assess the safety of
Redux, a chemical cousin of Pondimin, which was developed by Interneuron and
marketed by AHP.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home's failure to disclose the safety risks from February 1997
through June 1997 prevented Interneuron from taking action, including possibly
moving to take Redux off the market earlier, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said it lost the opportunity to disclose the safety problems to
its shareholders, the financial markets and regulatory agencies, according to
the suit. Such action would have helped protect its reputation, which was hurt
when the drugs were banned, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a result of AHP's fraudulent activities, Interneuron suffered serious
financial loss, including a decrease in its market capitalization of hundreds of
millions of dollars," said Glenn L. Cooper, president and chief executive
officer of Interneuron.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home denied any wrongdoing with respect to its contractual
obligations with Interneuron. A spokesman said American Home also disclosed all
safety data on its anti-obesity drugs to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
	   Pondimin and Redux were taken off the market in September 1997. Pondimin was
made and marketed by American Home, while Redux was developed by Interneuron and
marketed by American Home.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron is now facing more than 2,000 lawsuits related to Redux.
</P>
<P>
	   In October 1999, American Home agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle
thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to
fen-phen. But the settlement has not been finalized, and attorneys said many
clients will opt-out of the agreement so they can sue on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home's legal problems are one reason the company is having trouble
completing its proposed merger with Warner-Lambert. Warner-Lambert is now in
talks to merge with Pfizer Inc., putting the deal with American Home in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said it has tried for two years to negotiate a settlement with
American Home to indemnify Interneuron from lawsuits related to the diet drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Interneuron said American Home first learned of health dangers of fen-phen
as early as February 1997, when it received information from the Mayo Clinic.
The Mayo Clinic had collected information from patients who had developed heart
valve damage after taking the drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the chemical similarity between Pondimin and Redux, American Home
should have immediately alerted Interneuron of the information, the complaint
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Interneuron said American Home waited until July 1997 to reveal the
information.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home withheld the data on the Mayo study because it feared the
results would have on the diet drugs' sales, the lawsuit said.

<HEADLINE> Hartford Group Federal Thrift OK'd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., one of the
country's largest insurance companies, has won permission from federal
regulators to operate a new federally-insured thrift.
</P>
<P>
	   The Office of Thrift Supervision announced Monday its approval for the
company, known as the Hartford Group, to establish the thrift. It will be named
the Hartford Bank and will offer trust services for individuals and companies
nationwide from its base in Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
	   The approval makes The Hartford Group the latest in a string of insurance
companies, securities firms and other businesses outside the banking industry to
get new federal savings and loan charters in recent months.
</P>
<P>
	   Trust services include acting as an investment adviser or custodian of trust
funds or property held in trust, executing wills and acting as guardian of an
estate or trustee of an IRA account.
</P>
<P>
	   For the new thrift, the trust services will be marketed -- along with
annuities and mutual funds -- by brokers, independent financial planners and
Hartford Group employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hartford Group, with some $154 billion in assets, sells numerous types
of insurance including life, health, auto, property, general liability, marine
and agricultural.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year the thrift agency, part of the Treasury Department, granted
similar charters to Aetna Inc., one of the nation's largest life and health
insurers, to mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments and to American
International Group Inc., another major U.S. insurance company.
</P>
<P>
	   This month, the thrift regulators approved online brokerage ETrade Group
Inc.'s acquisition of Telebanc Financial Corp., which created the first
financial services company entirely based on the Internet, and Southwest
Securities Group Inc.'s purchase of a thrift.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress enacted in November sweeping legislation, signed into law by
President Clinton, rewriting the financial services laws and allowing banks,
insurance companies and securities firms to merge and sell each other's
products.
</P>
<P>
	   By approving applications from a number of financial companies outside the
banking industry, the federal thrift regulators had chipped away at the
Depression-era laws separating the financial services industries before Congress
acted.

<HEADLINE> Nuns: U.S. Has Taken Up Our Cause  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The case of two American nuns who refuse to leave a
Russian Orthodox monastery in the West Bank city of Jericho is being negotiated
at ``the highest levels'' by U.S. officials, one of the nuns said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian police evicted four nuns and monks of the exiled Russian
Orthodox, or ``White,'' church from the Jericho Garden Monastery on Jan. 15,
apparently at the request of its more powerful rival based in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian officials had said they had papers showing the Moscow-based, or
``Red'' church owned the property and were acting on a request made by Moscow
Patriarch Alexy II, who met earlier this month with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
	   A political attache from the U.S. consulate, Victoria Coffineau, had been to
visit the nuns on Monday, said Sister Maria, a sister of the former aide to
President Clinton, George Stephanopoulos.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were told today by Coffineau that there are a great deal of contacts at
the highest levels in Washington, Moscow and the Palestinian areas,'' Sister
Maria said from her mobile phone inside the compound. ``Right now we're just at
a standstill, laying low.''
</P>
<P>
	   Coffineau and other U.S. officials were unavailable for comment late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Palestinian officials reported that Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright raised the issue in a meeting this month with Arafat. Arafat promised
Albright to abide by the law, but the officials -- who spoke on condition of
anonymity -- didn't clarify which church that meant they would favor.
</P>
<P>
	   Sister Maria, 40, from New York City, said three men belonging to the
``Red,'' church were living inside the monastery and had occasionally made hand
motions to signify that the two nuns would be thrown out. Shouting can also
occasionally be heard from the room where they are staying, she added.
</P>
<P>
	   About six Palestinian police are constantly guarding the area, Sister Maria
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Russian men might be inclined to use physical force to get us out if
the Palestinian (police) weren't here,'' Sister Maria said.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian security officials have since said they will not evict the nuns
by force.
</P>
<P>
	   The evicted nuns have been handing packages of food to Sister Maria and
Sister Tina Cesana of San Francisco. There are no shower facilities at the
monastery and only an outside bathroom, Sister Maria told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's an uneasy situation but you trust in God,'' Sister Maria said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``White'' church has controlled the chapel since 1921, Sister Maria
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute between the churches dates back to the Russian revolution in
1917 when the communist regime seized control of the Russian Orthodox church.
Opponents of the communists set up a church in exile.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``White'' church controlled Russian shrines in the Holy Land until 1948,
when Israel recognized the Moscow Patriarchate's claim as a gesture of gratitude
to the Soviet Union for its recognition of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
	   Church property in east Jerusalem and the West Bank remained under the
control of the exiled church through Jordanian and later Israeli control.
Despite the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the two churches never reconciled.

<HEADLINE> Stronger sales, steadier market boost Kodak profits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Eastman Kodak Co., wrapping up two years of deep
cost-cutting, benefited from stronger consumer film sales and steadying prices
to post a 21 percent jump in fourth-quarter profits.
<P>
	   Excluding one-time charges and credits, the photography company said Monday
it earned $403 million, or $1.27 a share, up from $333 million, or $1.05 a
share, in the same quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The results beat Wall Street analysts' expectations of $1.24 a share,
according to First Call Corp. Kodak stock rose $1.31 1/4 to $62.06 1/4 in
trading at 5:15 p.m. New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   When one-time charges are included, Kodak's profit totaled $475 million, or
$1.50 a share, up 81 percent from $272 million, or 83 cents a share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues rose 7 percent to $3.8 billion from $3.56 billion, propelled by a
15 percent jump in sales of rolls of film around the world. Revenues had fallen
for two years before turning upward in the last four quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   In the U.S. consumer film market, Kodak said sales rose 9 percent and prices
held steady in a market roiled since 1997 by a price war sparked by Japanese
rival Fuji. While Kodak corners about two-thirds of the U.S. market, falling
prices have been pinching profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Carp, who took over as chief executive officer Jan. 1 from George
Fisher, predicted sales would grow between 6 percent and 7 percent this year.
Fisher is stepping down after a turbulent, six-year reign but staying on as
chairman until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Losses in digital photography, the recording of images on computer chips,
continued to narrow to $17 million in the quarter and $116 million in 1999 -
down from $262 million for all of 1998. Kodak expects to make its first profit
in that fast-growing field before long.
</P>
<P>
	   Benjamin Reitzes, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said the film sales were
"surprisingly solid" but said the stock price was weighed down by the company's
uncertain prospects in the digital field.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Internet and digital tend to lower the barriers of entry to the
photography business and the average investor can see digital as a threat," he
said. "The stock would really get moving if Kodak can prove and illustrate that
it is a contender in the digital world. ... They're showing some progress, but
the jury's still out."
</P>
<P>
	   In the quarter, Kodak gained $95 million from selling its Dallas-based Image
Bank film archive and $25 million from the sale of a scientific instruments
business, but incurred $11 million in charges from closing its Elmgrove
manufacturing hub in Rochester. A year ago, earnings were reduced $71 million by
a variety of restructuring charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Kodak cut costs by $520 million in 1999 and $730 million in 1998 - $50
million more than its two-year target of $1.2 billion. That translated into
about 20,000 layoffs out of a worldwide payroll of 100,500 - the deepest
cutbacks in Kodak's 119-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Kodak earned $1.392 billion, or $4.33 a share, up from
$1.390 billion, or $4.24 a share, in 1998. Sales for the year rose 5 percent to
$14.09 billion from $13.41 billion.

<HEADLINE> Thai Forces Storm Besieged Hospital  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW PENNINGTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RATCHABURI, Thailand (AP) -- Thai security forces stormed a hospital Tuesday
where heavily armed insurgents from Myanmar had trapped hundreds of patients,
visitors and staff in a 22-hour hostage drama.
</P>
<P>
	   Automatic weapons fire crackled and explosions thudded from inside the
hospital, possibly from grenades or mines that the hostage-takers had rigged
after taking it over Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Reporters in front of the sprawling hospital compound throughout the daylong
crisis had been steadily moved back by police. When the assault began,
journalists could see trucks and jeeps filled with police and soldiers speeding
into the walled, six-acre hospital compound.
</P>
<P>
	   Sporadic gunfire and occasional explosions were still ringing out over the
compound more than 15 minutes after the operation began.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no initial reports on casualties in the attack, which was
launched in the predawn hours.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels belonging to God's Army, an insurgent group led by 12-year-old
twins, took the hostages in an attempt to pressure the Thai government to help
their beleaguered movement.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels, who reportedly were aided by dissidents from the group that took
control of Myanmar's embassy in Bangkok last October, wanted helicopters to make
their escape.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels had released at least 40 patients Monday afternoon, some in
exchange for food, and dozens of others escaped. Those freed included a pregnant
18-year-old who went into labor and an 8-year-old boy in a coma after brain
surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   The takeover began at dawn when the raiders hijacked a Thai bus near the
border with Myanmar and forced the driver to take them 45 miles to Ratchaburi.
</P>
<P>
	   About 10 rebels wearing camouflage gear and masks forced their way into
Ratchaburi provincial hospital. A food vendor, Somboon Sangthong, said he saw
two men overcome guards at the hospital gate, wire explosive devices to it and
fire shots into the air.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was shocked and everybody started to run away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Security officials said the rebels threatened to blow up the hospital if
attacked.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past week, God's Army has come under sustained attack by troops from
Myanmar -- formerly known as Burma -- at their jungle base near the border,
driving at least 1,000 minority Karen refugees into Thailand. Thai troops have
fired artillery to prevent the fighters from crossing over the border.
</P>
<P>
	   After the hospital was seized, army commander Gen. Surayud Chulanond said
Thailand would stop its shelling, allow civilians refuge and let injured
guerrillas receive treatment in Thai hospitals. Rebels seeking refuge would have
to surrender their arms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will deal very carefully with the situation,'' he said. ``Our first
priority is every one of the hostages has to be safe.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 medical staff and 600 patients were in the hospital when it was
seized, said Dr. Kawat Suntrajarn of the Public Health Ministry. About 200 were
believed to be in the five-story administrative building and emergency room
building which were held by the insurgents.
</P>
<P>
	   Little was known about the gunmen or the situation inside the hospital until
they let in a television crew from Thai television Channel 7. They took footage
showing scores of frightened people sitting on rows of waiting-room benches and
of a masked man brandishing an assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to tell the world how Karen and Burmese refugees live during the
fighting,'' said one hostage-taker, who called himself Nui. ``We will not hurt
any hostages. We take good care of them.''
</P>
<P>
	   The government of Myanmar expressed hope that the siege would end without
bloodshed, and said the hostage-takers should be treated as terrorists by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Oct. 1, five members of a small dissident group, the Vigorous Burmese
Student Warriors, seized Myanmar's embassy in Bangkok and held dozens of
hostages for 26 hours before being flown to the border and freed. Media reports
said members of the same group is involved in the hospital takeover.
</P>
<P>
	   The dissidents then hid out with God's Army, composed mostly of ethnic
Karens and led by twins Johnny and Luther Htoo.
</P>
<P>
	   The twins told The Associated Press in December they were fighting for
democracy in their homeland, which has been ruled by military dictators since
1962. The Karens have been fighting for more autonomy for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Like most Karens, God's Army are Christians in a predominantly Buddhist
country.

<HEADLINE> Congress Returns to Work  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress convened Monday with a blend of prayer and
political jousting, ready to confront an election-year agenda topped by tax cuts
and health care. Democrats were buffeted by Virginia Rep. Virgil Goode's
decision to become an independent.
</P>
<P>
	   Within moments of the opening gavel, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said
Republicans would push for an early vote on legislation granting citizenship to
Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban boy at the center of a politically charged custody
battle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Make the senators positive, courageous problem solvers,'' chaplain Lloyd
Ogilvie prayed from the Senate rostrum as Congress' long winter break came to an
end. ``Give them an unprecedented sense of oneness and unity to lead this great
nation together.''
</P>
<P>
	   The words were far less soothing in the House, where Democratic Rep. Lloyd
Doggett of Texas launched the first partisan attack within minutes of the
session's opening.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Reports that the House is returning to work today are inaccurate,'' he
said. ``This House will complete month one of the new millennium with no action
... on any of the major issues that this country faces. Nothing on education,
nothing on Social Security, nothing on the environment, nothing on tax reform or
prescription drugs for seniors.''
</P>
<P>
	   Doggett's sharply worded remarks reflected an underlying political struggle
in a year in which the presidency, all 435 House seats and 33 Senate seats will
be on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   The House, in particular, had a new look, a new carpet -- in a lighter shade
of blue -- as well as new wiring for the sound system.
</P>
<P>
	   January is customarily a slow month in Congress -- whether Republicans or
Democrats are in charge -- since lawmakers prefer to wait for the president's
State of the Union address and budget proposals before tackling key issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton speaks before Congress and a nationwide television audience on
Thursday and will unveil his budget 10 days later.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House and House Republicans have been laying out their agenda for
several days in advance of the session, the last of Clinton's two-term
presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert last week outlined a plan under which the
government's $3.7 trillion publicly held debt could be paid off by 2015,
assuming that Congress didn't dip into the Social Security trust fund surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   House Republicans intend to move quickly to bring legislation to the floor
to ease the so-called ``marriage penalty,'' and Majority Leader Dick Armey said
in an interview a bill would soon follow to provide education tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
	   Armey, R-Texas, also said the House will act early in the year on
legislation to revitalize communities where economic growth is stagnant.
</P>
<P>
	   House Republicans also intend to pass legislation relating to HMOs and some
sort of prescription drug benefit for Medicare, bills that Democrats first
placed on the agenda and that some GOP aides privately have said must pass if
the party is to hold the House next fall.
</P>
<P>
	   House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, R-Mo., in an interview, said, ``it
remains to be seen if they really are moving ... to the middle to the point''
where compromise is possible.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats will continue to push also for a minimum wage increase and
stricter gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Gephardt said that he was ``open and receptive to smaller tax
cut ideas,'' now that Republicans have decided to shelve a $792 billion plan
that was vetoed last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota noted the widespread
skepticism that Congress is capable of significant accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why not surprise them,'' he said, adding that Congress should concentrate
on protecting Social Security and Medicare, providing help to families left
behind in the current expansion and finish minimum wage, health care and other
bills left from 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Senate, Lott, said debate could begin on the citizenship bill as
early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., the lead sponsor of the bill to grant citizenship
to Gonzalez, said the measure would ``move the decision-making out the hands of
the INS and into the hands of the (state) courts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, Lott has said little about his agenda for the year, although he
arranged to begin sketching out his plans at a Chamber of Commerce breakfast
speech Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Goode's decision served as an opening-day reminder of the political stakes.
</P>
<P>
	   His announcement, faxed on campaign stationery, said he would run for
re-election as an independent and cast his votes ``on the basis of what I
believe is in the best interests of the Fifth District and not on a particular
party position.''
</P>
<P>
	   He is expected to announce within two weeks whether he will caucus with
either party for the balance of this year.
</P>
<P>
	   His decision was a blow to Democrats, who are struggling to gain control of
the House in the fall elections. Goode's move means that Republicans command a
majority of 222-211, with two independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Gephardt said his party would continue to protect the second-term
conservative's committee assignments and added that ``when Democrats regain the
House in January 2001,'' Goode would be welcome to return to the party.

<HEADLINE> Time Warner, EMI in Music Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    AP Graphic
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner's merger deals with America Online and EMI were
hatched separately, but they both help advance a common goal: bringing music to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner's chairman and CEO, Gerald Levin, has been saying for months
that the music business would be the first big winner from opportunities in
promotion and distribution offered by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   He repeated that mantra Monday in announcing the merger between his
company's Warner Music Group and EMI of Britain, which would create the world's
largest music company with $8 billion in annual revenues. Seagram's Universal
Music Group had been No. 1 with $6.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   "Music, out of all our businesses, is the one that will benefit most from
the Internet and the digital revolution," Levin told a London news conference
via satellite from New York.
</P>
<P>
	   To be sure, Time Warner's blockbuster merger with Internet leader AOL,
announced just two weeks ago, is expected to be a far greater catalyst in
bringing music and other elements from Time Warner's media warehouse online.
AOL's 22 million subscribers offer a giant market to be exploited.
</P>
<P>
	   The addition of EMI will create a massive stable of 2,500 artists and a
large music catalog of albums and songs to be delivered over the Internet or
shipped via CD to consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It can only help" accelerate a digital music push, says James Penhune, an
analyst with Yankee Group. "It certainly isn't a cataclysmic event like the AOL
merger, but it adds fuel to the fire."
</P>
<P>
	   Other analysts pointed to other, more conventional rationales behind
bringing Warner and EMI together: cutting costs by eliminating overlapping
operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies say they would save $400 million a year by the end of three
years. As part of that drive, 3,000 jobs are being cut, or 13 percent of the
company's combined work force of 23,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Ken Berry, who heads EMI Recorded Music and would be chief operating officer
of the merged company, said the cuts would most likely come in manufacturing,
distribution, and back office areas
</P>
<P>
	   The deal doesn't solve one problem faced by both companies -- a dearth of
hot new music acts.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner has a big stable of well-known artists such as Cher, Eric Clapton,
Phil Collins, Madonna, Metallica and REM, but its fortunes have been declining
in recent years as its acts have grown older.
</P>
<P>
	   EMI boasts names like the Spice Girls, Van Morrison, the Beatles, Rolling
Stones and Frank Sinatra, but it too has been slumping recently.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike the AOL-Time Warner deal, which combined two fairly different
companies, the Warner-EMI union could face tighter scrutiny from antitrust
regulators since it reduces the number of major record companies from five to
four. The others, besides Seagram's Universal, are BMG, which is part of the
German media conglomerate Bertelsmann, and Sony.
</P>
<P>
	   The board of the new company, which would be called Warner EMI Music, will
sell one of every four CDs bought in the United States. Its board will be
comprised of six Time Warner representatives and five from EMI. Eric Nicoli,
chairman of EMI, and Time Warner president Richard Parsons will be co-chairmen.
</P>
<P>
	   The back-to-back mergers come just as the music industry is coming to terms
with the Internet. The major labels initially opposed distributing music
digitally out of fear of piracy, but several have been experimenting with ways
to distribute music securely.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts remain skeptical about the major studios' drive toward digital
distribution. These analysts say upstart competitors like RealNetworks have been
moving more aggressively in bringing music to Internet users.
</P>
<P>
	   "I see very little evidence that either of these companies is willing to
take risks in terms of experimenting with the packaging, promotion and sale of
digital forms of entertainment to consumers," says Dan O'Brien, a media analyst
with Forrester Research. "I see them acting more out of fear than a desire to
serve consumers."
</P>
<P>
	   In some respects, the music industry remains on the defensive. On Friday,
The Recording Industry Association of America filed a copyright infringement
lawsuit against MP3.com, a music Web site, for allowing customers to store music
from their own CDs online.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts, however, say the twin Time Warner deals could help build
consensus among the music industry on how to address the Internet question. By
putting AOL, Warner and EMI all "on the same wavelength, it could help the
industry," said Scott Davis, a media analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co.

Patrol" minivan out on Super Bowl Sunday to surprise winners, got a jolt of its
own Monday as New York and 15 other states sued it alleging deceptive
advertising.
<P>
	   The Port Washington, N.Y., company which sells magazine subscriptions and
other merchandise through direct mail solicitation had been negotiating a
settlement with New York over its practices when it was informed that it had
been sued.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are dismayed and disappointed that New York has chosen to abandon
negotiation and proceed with legal action against our company," said Bill Low,
lawyer and senior vice president for the sweepstakes company.
</P>
<P>
	   Also suing Monday were Colorado, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey,
Illinois, Ohio, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Vermont, Oregon, Pennsylvania, West
Virginia, Louisiana, Georgia and California.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a great day for New Jersey consumers," said Mark Herr, director of the
New Jersey's Division of Consumer Affairs. "We have been increasingly concerned
about misleading come-ons in sweepstakes land. We know that many people are
duped by them. We know that our senior citizens are especially vulnerable to
them."
</P>
<P>
	   "We want them to stop the bad act. We want them to be sanctioned - that
means penalities - for their bad act, and we want them to change the way they do
business," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuits were filed individually in local courts in each state. However,
New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said the lawsuits were sparked by a
multi-state investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "This sweepstakes company has engaged in an elaborate scheme to increase its
bottom line, financed on the backs of some who can least afford it: the
elderly," Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   That brings the number of states suing Publishers Clearing House to 25.
Arizona, Texas, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Washington
and Wisconsin already have sued the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher agreed with Spitzer. 'The
company's alleged illegal business practices shamelessly prey on older
Pennsylvanians who spend a lot of money on magazines and other items ...
convinced that the Prize Patrol is about to deliver thousands of dollars to
their door," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Publishers Clearing House spokesman Chris Fisher denied it targets senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   "Publishers Clearing House does not target the elderly," he said. "We don't
even know the ages of our consumers. ... Our market is the U.S. population."
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent lawsuit accuses the company of:
</P>
<P>
	   - Faking handwritten notes, internal memos, government documents and
personal letters to get people to apply quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   - Hiding bulk-rate mailings with official looking symbols and large bold
print warnings.
</P>
<P>
	   - Routinely asking customers for information that would only be needed if
they actually had won a prize.
</P>
<P>
	   - Requesting information for customers who order magazines that it does not
ask from people who do not order magazines.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer and the other attorneys general want Publishers Clearing House
banned from using its current promotions and for the company to pay unspecified
restitution.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer also wants civil penalties under the state's deceptive acts statute
and the state Prize Award Scheme Law, as well as an additional $10,000 for
violations of a state law enacted to penalize frauds perpetrated against the
elderly.

<HEADLINE> Golden Globes Telecast Ratings Down  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Faced with some stiff competition, the Golden Globe awards
on NBC Sunday night saw a 9 percent drop in viewership from last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The awards ceremony was a triumph for HBO, which won eight of the 11
television trophies, with four of the awards going to "The Sopranos," honored as
the best television drama.
</P>
<P>
	   As it turned out, "The Sopranos" may have been one of the reasons Golden
Globe ratings sank. The second episode of its second season aired Sunday night
in direct competition with the Golden Globes.
</P>
<P>
	   More likely, the awards show suffered because of "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire," ABC's continuing sensation. The game show drew 29 million viewers
on Sunday night, according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-hour Golden Globes telecast drew an average audience of 22.1
million viewers, down from 24.2 million in 1999, Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Viewing peaked during the tribute to Barbra Streisand after 10 p.m. EST,
when there was less formidable competition. The highest ratings were in the
entertainment capitals of New York and Los Angeles, where the Golden Globes had
their best showing ever.
</P>
<P>
	   The suburban satire "American Beauty" won for best film drama, best director
and best screenplay. DreamWorks SKG said on Monday that the movie will re-open
on about 750 screens nationwide on Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Filmed profiles of boxer Rubin "Hurricane" Carter and the late comedian Andy
Kaufman also won major awards.
</P>
<P>
	   A Golden Globes sweep for a movie often presages a major run at the Oscars,
but Sunday night's results were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   Things were much clearer on the television side, where "The Sopranos" atoned
for its snub last fall by Emmy Award voters. HBO's "Sex and the City" won for
best comedy and its star, Sarah Jessica Parker, won for best comic actress.

<HEADLINE> High court decision thrills Hempstead plaintiffs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) - Plaintiffs in a voting-rights case were elated by
a U.S. Supreme Court decision Monday that requires the town of Hempstead to
change the way its board members are elected.
<P>
	   "I am one of the happiest men in the world," said Sam Prioleau, one of the
plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit that alleged the town's system of at-large
voting illegally diluted blacks' voting strength.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been beaten down for such a long time, and they kept us out of Town
Hall," said Prioleau, one of a group of black Hempstead residents who filed the
lawsuit in 1988. "Now we can get to the ballot box and we can make a
difference."
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court, without comment, upheld an appeals court decision
ordering the town to restructure its elections so that board members are elected
from districts instead of in at-large voting. Prioleau said the old system made
it nearly impossible for blacks to elect their chosen candidates to the board.
</P>
<P>
	   Hempstead Supervisor Rich Guardino said the town, which fought the lawsuit,
would create a district system and schedule a special election to fill the new
seats as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   "I continue to believe that the residents of the Town of Hempstead are not
voting on the basis of race, but on the issues, and that the November 1999
election clearly proved this," Guardino said in a statement, referring to the
election to the town board of Dorothy Goosby, a black Democrat and the lead
plaintiff in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our residents have told us repeatedly they would prefer to vote for six
town council members rather than one," Guardino's statement continued. "However,
the town board members with whom I have spoken agree with me that the time has
come to end this matter."
</P>
<P>
	   The town had argued that politics, not race, was why black voters - mostly
Democrats - have been unable to elect their chosen candidates in the mostly
Republican town.
</P>
<P>
	   Hempstead, on Long Island, is 83 percent white and 12 percent black,
according to 1990 census figures.
</P>
<P>
	   After a November 1999 election in which Democrats surged throughout heavily
Republican Nassau County, Hempstead's six-member board is evenly split between
Democrats and Republicans. Two of the board's members are black - a Republican
who first joined the council in 1993 and Goosby, a Democrat elected in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Frederick Brewington, the plaintiffs' lawyer, rejected Guardino's assertion
that Goosby's election proves the existing system is fair to blacks. She swept
into office on a powerful Democratic wave, making her election a one-time fluke,
Brewington said.
</P>
<P>
	   Brewington said the Supreme Court ruling would open up Hempstead politics
and make elections fairer.
</P>
<P>
	   "Across the board, African-Americans were being shut out and shut down," the
lawyer said. "This case stands as a benchmark for all towns."

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Military Perilously Divided  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- One of the few public institutions that enjoys
widespread support in Ecuador is the military, known for honesty, compassion and
providing health services and education to impoverished communities long ignored
by the government.
</P>
<P>
	   For years the armed forces have championed constitutional government,
resisting the temptation to take power as Ecuador spun out of control and
plunged into economic and political chaos.
</P>
<P>
	   But the military is a force divided -- between young more radical officers
and the top brass. And that division could be a roadblock to re-establishing
stable civilian rule in the wake of last week's coup.
</P>
<P>
	   The corruption and deep poverty that led the young military officers to
support an Indian protest that deposed President Jamil Mahuad remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't say there won't be another coup if we continue with the very
grave economic and social difficulties,'' said Luis Eladio Proano, a civilian
adviser to the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   As Ecuador's political leaders have become more and more discredited,
Ecuadorians have looked to the armed forces as the only public institution they
can trust. An August poll showed that 65 percent of Ecuadorians favor the
military. Politicians tallied only 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But with the events of last week, Ecuadorians are wondering how much longer
the military will stay on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign of the division within the military, an army captain called a TV
station on Saturday to protest the decision by Ecuador's top military commander
to turn power over to the vice president -- a civilian -- only a few hours after
he had taken control of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Please, let's take power! Ecuador needs military discipline to be able to
develop. Ecuador is not going to change if a civilian remains in power,'' Capt.
Luis Espinoza pleaded.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday as many as 150 junior officers, most of them colonels, joined
hundreds of Indian protesters who stormed Congress and proclaimed a new
governing junta to fight corruption and work to improve the lives of the poor.
The junta was composed of Indian leader Antonio Vargas, Col. Lucio Gutierrez and
a former Supreme Court president.
</P>
<P>
	   After debating for hours, the military high command threw its support to the
civilian-military junta, forcing Mahuad to abandon power.
</P>
<P>
	   But early Saturday, under pressure from the U.S. government and confronting
the opposition of more than 20 regional commanders who rejected the overthrow of
civilian rule, armed forces chief Gen. Carlos Mendoza announced he was turning
power over to Vice President Gustavo Noboa.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at a news conference Monday, Vargas agreed that the problems that
led to the coup haven't gone away.
</P>
<P>
	   If Noboa doesn't work to end corruption, the Indian leader predicted ``a
great social explosion that could lead to civil war'' in three to six months.
``And that would not be our fault.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mendoza, who had replaced Gutierrez in the junta, says he never had designs
on power himself, saying, in effect, he tricked the other two men with whom he
briefly formed a revolutionary junta.
</P>
<P>
	   But military experts and retired army general Jose Gallardo, who had served
as Mahuad's defense minister until the week before the coup, questioned
Mendoza's depiction of himself as a defender of democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Mendoza and army commander Gen. Telmo Sandoval didn't have the support of
regional military commanders, and ``they suddenly became democrats,'' Proano
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mendoza resigned and Sandoval took over as military commander.
</P>
<P>
	   Gallardo said that Mendoza and Sandoval took advantage of the growing
discontent of junior officers to try to seize power. He said they were motivated
by political ambition, not the idealistic desire of the young officers to save
Ecuador from economic and social chaos.
</P>
<P>
	   Mendoza and Sandoval knew weeks ago there was a movement of junior officers
that planned to support the Indian protest, Gallardo said, arguing that they
acted irresponsibly by not discouraging the young officers, whose fates are
uncertain. The new government says they will face military justice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Young men are passionate. When they see injustice, they want to take
action immediately to end it. They don't have the experience and vision of older
people,'' Gallardo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Young officers rail most against the rampant corruption that characterizes
Ecuador's political class and the government mismanagement that has led to their
salaries being eaten up by inflation and devaluation. A colonel's pay has
dropped from the equivalent of $1,000 a month to $250.
</P>
<P>
	   Former U.S. Ambassador Leslie Alexander, who left Ecuador in July, once
observed that one way of determining who was corrupt and was not corrupt was by
looking at wristwatches. He noted that politicians normally wear gold Rolexes
while generals use Seikos.

<HEADLINE> Albright Chides Russia, China  </HEADLINE>
   By DAFNA LINZER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright took a
swipe Monday at Russia, China and France for trying to block the U.N.
secretary-general's candidate to be the next chief weapons inspector for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan had selected Rolf Ekeus, a Swede who was
the first U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq. The nomination was supported by the
United States, but three of the other Security Council members rejected Ekeus
last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright noted that countries who were wistful for Ekeus during the tenure
of his successor, Australian Richard Butler, were now complaining about bringing
him back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I find it mighty ironic that, at a time when Ambassador Ekeus is being put
forward, and when I remember that there were certain members during the Butler
era who longed for Ambassador Ekeus, that when they had the opportunity to
support him, they did not,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright also chided Ekeus' opponents for not honoring ``the agreement made
that the secretary-general would be able to name a chairman.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright, who was at the United Nations for a meeting Monday on peace in the
Congo, said ``there is no more important subject for the Security Council to
deal with than Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ekeus headed the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, which was created in
1991 in the aftermath of the Gulf War to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass
destruction. The organization was tainted by allegations of spying for the
United States, and Baghdad ultimately banned inspectors from returning after the
United States and Britain launched airstrikes against Iraq in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia, China and France have said that Ekeus' association with UNSCOM makes
him unfit to head the new agency. And they say the United Nations needs a
candidate who will be acceptable to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Ekeus is to retire as Sweden's ambassador to the United States.

<HEADLINE> IBF's court-appointed monitor resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The court-appointed monitor for the troubled
International Boxing Federation has resigned after less than two weeks, saying
his marriage to a federal judge could raise conflict-of-interest questions.
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge John W. Bissell accepted Joseph A. Hayden Jr.'s
resignation Monday and appointed a new monitor, Newark lawyer William W.
Robertson, to monitor the financial affairs of the East Orange-based boxing
organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Hayden is married to U.S. District Judge Katherine Hayden and said in a
Friday-dated letter to Bissell that he was concerned about a statute that bans
relatives of federal employees from serving as federal court appointees.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the statute could be read to apply to only full-time appointments,
"I believe that the open question as to the validity of my appointment would
cast a shadow upon the position of monitor and be a potential distraction from
the real issues of the litigation," Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bissell appointed Hayden to oversee the IBF on Jan. 13, following November
indictments of founder Robert W. Lee Sr. and other IBF officials on charges they
accepted $338,000 to rig its rankings of boxers.
</P>
<P>
	   Hayden's appointment represented the first time a U.S. sports organization
has been subject to a remedy usually applied to mob-riddled labor unions
</P>
<P>
	   Since his appointment, Hayden hired a forensic accountant to review the
organization's books, met with the organization's lawyers and treasurers and had
several discussions about "standards which must be put in place to ensure that
all decisions in the field of boxing by the IBF are consistent with fairness and
integrity," Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bissell said in an order Monday that he was unaware of the statute when he
appointed Hayden.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee's attorney, Gerald Krovatin, said he had no concerns about Hayden's
fairness.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were prepared to waive any allegations of conflict," he said. Krovatin
said lawyers would continue to cooperate with the monitor.
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson is a lawyer with 30 years experience in New Jersey, including
service as a deputy attorney general who worked on organized crime cases. He is
the founder and first president of the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers
of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson didn't return a telephone call seeking comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee has pleaded innocent to charges of racketeering, conspiracy, money
laundering and tax evasion and is scheduled to stand trial in the spring. He is
on leave as president of the IBF.

<HEADLINE> Amex Posts Gain, Discloses Claims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- American Express Co. disclosed a $215 million settlement of
claims on Monday that it misled people into buying insurance products without
fully disclosing fees. But the company managed to report a 15 percent profit in
the fourth quarter that met Wall Street projections.
</P>
<P>
	   American Express, which did not admit any wrongdoing, said the preliminary
settlement of three class-action lawsuits covered 2 million people who bought
annuity products from the company starting in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   The company cited strength in its charge card and investment management
businesses for its profit growth in the three months Dec. 31, when it earned
$606 million, or $1.33 a share. That was up from a profit of $530 million, or
$1.16 a share, in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue grew 15 percent to $5.23 billion from $4.56 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   American Express shares gained 31 1/4 cents to $152 on the New York Stock
Exchange amid a sharp retreat on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   The company partly cited a 15 percent gain in fourth-quarter profit from its
Travel Related Services unit, which includes charge and credit cards. The number
of Amex cards in use grew to 46 million worldwide from 43 million in the
year-ago quarter, while average spending on each card grew to $2,102 from
$1,861.
</P>
<P>
	   Amex also tied results to a 14 percent rise in profits from its investment
management business, where the company runs mutual funds and other investment
vehicles
</P>
<P>
	   The company said its settlement of three class-action lawsuits, related to
sales of insurance and annuity products, will mostly be covered by money
previously reserved. But American Express said it had set aside an additional
$74 million, before taxes, during the fourth quarter to cover the deal. The
agreement settles claims against the company dating back to 1985, American
Express said.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of last year, American Express said it earned $2.48 billion, or
$5.42 a share, up 16 percent from a profit of $2.14 billion, or $4.63 a share,
in the year-ago quarter. Revenue grew to $19.48 billion from $17.21 billion.

<HEADLINE> Signs of Normality in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA EDDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In signs that some normality is returning to
Kosovo, a licensed bank started operating Monday -- the first to open since last
year's conflict -- and more than 100 judges were sworn in to tackle a backlog of
criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Those taking office included Supreme Court of Kosovo judges and lay judges,
who sit on the jury, for municipal courts in Pristina, Podujevo, Lipljan and
Urosevac.
</P>
<P>
	   Another 137 legal officials were selected by a committee of local ethnic
Albanians and approved by international law officials serving with the United
Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, based on
their academic backgrounds and assessment of problems.
</P>
<P>
	   A backlog of thousands of unresolved criminal cases, left over from when a
three-month mandate for the previous group of U.N.-appointed judges ran out,
awaits the new justices.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the cases are ethnically motivated violent crimes, mostly against
Serbs by ethnic Albanians seeking revenge for the violent Serb crackdown that
began nearly a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The local judicial system hasn't functioned since NATO-led peacekeepers
entered the province in June.
</P>
<P>
	   International efforts to re-establish peace in Kosovo ``have been hampered
by the absence of courts to prosecute those who commit crimes,'' Tom Koening, a
senior U.N. administrator, told the judges at a swearing-in ceremony. ``Your job
is to restore the rule of law in Kosovo without regard to ethnicity, language or
political affiliation.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the past decade, only Serbs and ethnic Albanians sympathetic to the
Belgrade regime were allowed to hold judicial posts.
</P>
<P>
	   The opening of the Micro Enterprise Bank was also a sign of recovery for the
troubled province. The bank is backed by several international financial
institutions and investment companies and is funded largely by the German and
Dutch governments.
</P>
<P>
	   While the bank's president and director are both internationals, the
chairman of its board of directors is a local Albanian economic expert, Ajri
Begu.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to have to try to win back the lost faith of the citizens in
the banking system,'' said Begu. ``It's going to be a big battle and it won't be
easy.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bank will have an initial equity holding of $2.3 million and will
provide accounts, money transfers, loans and cashless payment transactions to
micro and small enterprises as well as individual customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Within the next three years the bank is expected to have seven branches
across the province.
</P>
<P>
	   During the opening ceremony held in Pristina's National Theater, thousands
of Kosovo Albanians held a silent protest outside, appealing to international
leaders in the province to aid in the immediate and unconditional release of all
prisoners jailed in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbian authorities claim that some 1,800 ethnic Albanians are being held in
Serb jails, but international authorities in Kosovo and human rights officials
say the numbers could be as high as 7,000.

<HEADLINE> Judge Gives Questioning Go-Ahead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brushing aside objections by President Clinton, a judge
gave the go-ahead Monday for more questioning in a lawsuit by former government
employees whose FBI background files were collected by the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said a conservative group that filed the
suit should be permitted to question former FBI official Larry Potts about his
work for a private investigative firm that also had been retained by Clinton's
legal team in thre Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton objected to questions about contacts Potts had with the FBI since he
began working for the firm, Investigative Group International, because it would
force Potts to reveal privileged communications he had with the president's
lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Jarvi To Lead Cincinnati Symphony  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CINCINNATI (AP) -- Estonian-born Paavo Jarvi, a widely traveled guest
conductor and recording artist, was selected Monday to succeed Jesus Lopez-Cobos
as music director of the 105-year-old Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
	   Lopez-Cobos, who has been music director of the nation's fifth-oldest
orchestra since 1986, is retiring. Only Eugene Goossens had a longer tenure
among the symphony's music directors, who have included Leopold Stokowski and
Fritz Reiner. Goossens was its music director from 1931 to 1947.
</P>
<P>
	   Jarvi, who signed a four-year contract, takes over in September 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Jarvi, 37, moved to the United States at age 17 with his family. His father,
Neeme Jarvi, is music director of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. His brother,
Kristjan Jarvi, is assistant conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
	   "Since the moment I decided to conclude my tenure, I thought he would be a
good possible choice," Lopez-Cobos said. "I believe he is the ideal person to
take over the orchestra."
</P>
<P>
	   Symphony chairman Peter Strange said the selection committee was impressed
with Jarvi's range of experience and described him as a "gifted conductor and
passionate music maker."
</P>
<P>
	   "We also found a charismatic leader who at 37 years old has a 21st century
viewpoint and the conviction to boldly lead this orchestra to exciting new
advances in artistic growth and community engagement," Strange said.

<HEADLINE> FDA warns heartburn drug Propulsid can kill some patients  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The popular heartburn drug Propulsid can cause
dangerous irregular heartbeats and even sudden death, the government said
Monday. The medicine should be used only as a last resort - and only by patients
first given heart tests to ensure they are at low risk for the side effect, it
warned.
<P>
	   Patients now taking Propulsid should ask their doctors about switching
medication, and doctors should not prescribe the drug without first performing
an EKG, or electrocardiogram, the Food and Drug Administration said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nor should anyone with heart disease or a list of other illnesses use the
drug, the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA's unusually strong warning comes in the wake of 70 deaths and 200
other reports of irregular heartbeat and other heart rhythm disturbances since
Propulsid hit the market in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Manufacturer Johnson &AMP; Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., mailed the
warning to thousands of physicians Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA first warned that Propulsid can cause serious heart problems in June
1998, but it continued to receive reports of deaths and hospitalizations.
</P>
<P>
	   So Monday, the agency took additional steps to make sure Propulsid is used
only by patients with severe nighttime heartburn who get no relief from other
drugs - and only if they appear at low risk for the cardiac side effects.
Johnson &AMP; Johnson shares on Monday closed at $83.68 3/4, down 6.18 3/4, or 6.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Propulsid had sales of about $970 million last year, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA said it was not pulling Propulsid off the market because the drug
can help some patients and because the new warnings should make using it safer.
</P>
<P>
	   The cardiac risk is relatively small considering an estimated 30 million
Propulsid prescriptions have been written since 1993, and most people who
suffered the heart problems had clear risk factors, said Dr. Florence Houn,
FDA's chief of gastrointestinal drugs. That means careful doctors who heed the
new warnings should be able to keep Propulsid away from the patients most likely
to be hurt, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want warnings to go out. We want education to the prescribers to be
reinforced," she said. "This drug requires careful prescription."
</P>
<P>
	   But an expert on drug-induced irregular heartbeats said it will be difficult
for the doctors who most prescribe Propulsid - gastrointestinal specialists - to
comply.
</P>
<P>
	   "FDA warnings have not been as successful as we would like in being
translated into care," said Dr. Raymond Woosley, a pharmacologist at Georgetown
University Medical Center. "This one will be especially difficult because of the
fact that many physicians don't have an EKG" machine in their offices.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, some computerized EKG equipment doesn't accurately read a critical
type of heartbeat measurement called "QT prolongation," requiring doctors
skilled in reading EKGs to determine that manually, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among FDA's warnings:
</P>
<P>
	   -Do not prescribe Propulsid to anyone with heart disease, including valvular
disease, or who has ever had an irregular heartbeat, abnormal EKG or QT
prolongation.
</P>
<P>
	   -Do not prescribe Propulsid to people with kidney disease; lung disease; low
blood levels of the electrolytes potassium, calcium or magnesium; an eating
disorder; dehydration or prolonged vomiting.
</P>
<P>
	   -Never take Propulsid while using a list of other medications, including
antibiotics like erythromycin; antifungals like ketoconazole; AIDS-fighting
protease inhibitors; drugs for irregular heartbeat; certain antidepressants and
antipsychotics such as Elavil or Serzone. Also do not take with grapefruit
juice.
</P>
<P>
	   -In addition to an EKG, patients being considered for Propulsid should
undergo blood tests to check electrolyte levels.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA will gather heartburn and cardiac experts for a special meeting
April 12 to determine whether the new Propulsid warnings are adequate.

<HEADLINE> New York, 15 other states sue Publishers Clearing House  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Publishers Clearing House, which sends its "Prize
Patrol" minivan out on Super Bowl Sunday to surprise winners, got a jolt of its
own Monday as New York and 15 other states sued it alleging deceptive
advertising.
<P>
	   The Port Washington, N.Y., company which sells magazine subscriptions and
other merchandise through direct mail solicitation had been negotiating a
settlement with the states over its practices when it was informed that it had
been sued.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are dismayed and disappointed that New York has chosen to abandon
negotiation and proceed with legal action against our company," said Bill Low,
lawyer and senior vice president for the sweepstakes company.
</P>
<P>
	   New Mexico Attorney General Patricia Madrid said states had to file suit
against the company "to put an end to its false, misleading and deceptive
mailings that induce New Mexicans, and particularly our senior citizens, to
purchase items that they do not truly want or need."
</P>
<P>
	   Also suing Monday were Colorado, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey,
Illinois, Ohio, Oklahoma, Vermont, Oregon, Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
Louisiana, Georgia and California.
</P>
<P>
	   "Publishers Clearing House is very artful in stating half-truths to create
an overall impression that the particular consumer will be more likely to win an
enormous cash prize if he or she purchases something," Minnesota Attorney
General Mike Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuits were filed individually in local courts in each state. However,
New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said the lawsuits were sparked by a
multi-state investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "This sweepstakes company has engaged in an elaborate scheme to increase its
bottom line, financed on the backs of some who can least afford it: the
elderly," Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   That brings the number of states suing Publishers Clearing House to 25.
Arizona, Texas, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Washington
and Wisconsin already have sued the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher agreed with Spitzer. 'The
company's alleged illegal business practices shamelessly prey on older
Pennsylvanians who spend a lot of money on magazines and other items ...
convinced that the Prize Patrol is about to deliver thousands of dollars to
their door," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Publisher's Clearing House for years has been targeting the elderly and the
gullible with a blizzard of deceptive mailers that are really disguised sales
pitches," California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Publishers Clearing House spokesman Chris Fisher denied it targets senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   "Publishers Clearing House does not target the elderly," he said. "We don't
even know the ages of our consumers. ... Our market is the U.S. population."
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent lawsuit accuses the company of:
</P>
<P>
	   - Faking handwritten notes, internal memos, government documents and
personal letters to get people to apply quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   - Hiding bulk-rate mailings with official looking symbols and large bold
print warnings.
</P>
<P>
	   - Routinely asking customers for information that would only be needed if
they actually had won a prize.
</P>
<P>
	   - Requesting information for customers who order magazines that it does not
ask from people who do not order magazines.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer and the other attorneys general want Publishers Clearing House
banned from using its current promotions and for the company to pay unspecified
restitution.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer also wants civil penalties under the state's deceptive acts statute
and the state Prize Award Scheme Law, as well as an additional $10,000 for
violations of a state law enacted to penalize frauds perpetrated against the
elderly.

<HEADLINE> Sharpton, Amadou Diallo's parents press for federal monitor of  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The No. 2 official at the Justice Department on Monday
told the Rev. Al Sharpton and the parents of Amadou Diallo that federal
officials would monitor the trial of four officers charged with gunning down the
unarmed immigrant.
<P>
	   But Assistant Attorney General Eric Holder did not say specifically what
kind of federal scrutiny the racially-charged case would face, according to
those at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "We received no assurances except that we would receive a thorough review,"
Sharpton said outside the Justice Department after a meeting that lasted more
than an hour with Holder and Bill Lamb Lee, head of the Attorney General's Civil
Rights Division. Rep. Charles Rangel, D-Harlem, and handful of church officials
joined the Diallo family and Sharpton at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton and other black activists are upset that the trial of the four
white police officers accused of firing 41 bullets at Diallo was moved from the
Bronx, where the shooting took place, to Albany. Attorneys for the cops had
argued the wave of pretrial publicity would make it impossible to find an
impartial jury in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sharpton said Monday he was optimistic because of the attention given to
the case by Holder, Attorney General Janet Reno's top assistant.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Conason, a lawyer representing the Diallo family, said the hope is to
have a Justice Department official in the courtroom monitoring testimony in case
federal officials decide to pursue civil rights charges against the four
officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's shooting touched off weeks of angry protests in New York City, with
citizens alleging widespread brutality against minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection is set to begin in the case next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton said although he said he opposed moving the trial upstate, he had
no quarrel with Albany or the Albany police.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not against the people of Albany. They did not make this decision,"
he said. "What the courts decided should not be an excuse to divide the people
in Albany against the people of New York City."
</P>
<P>
	   He said protests at the trial would include organized prayer and he planned
to meet with Albany church groups Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Plainclothes officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Richard Murphy and
Kenneth Boss were indicted on second-degree murder charges in March after they
fired 41 bullets at Diallo while searching a Bronx neighborhood for violent
criminals. Attorneys for the officers claimed their clients mistakenly believed
the street vendor, a West African immigrant, was reaching for a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   While the meeting took place Monday about 40 protesters bussed in from New
York City marched outside of the Justice Department and chanted "How many shots?
41"
</P>
<P>
	   About a dozen District of Columbia police officers arrived on motorcycles to
monitor the protest but left after less than 10 minutes to cheers from the
demonstrators.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani and Hillary Clinton visit state Capitol  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki and other Republican allies of
Rudolph Giuliani accused Hillary Rodham Clinton of trying to upstage the mayor
on Monday as he made his annual pilgrimage to Albany seeking more state aid for
New York City.
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, expected to face the mayor in this year's U.S. Senate race,
arrived later in the day to meet with Democratic members of the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question in my mind that the first lady chose today to come
because she doesn't want people to hear the positive message of the successful
record of Mayor Giuliani," Pataki said at a news conference with a beaming mayor
by his side.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady's camp denied any such motive and she said at a state Capitol
news conference that "at last count, I've been in upstate New York more than 30
times and I have never run into the mayor."
</P>
<P>
	   Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver,
said the invitation from Silver to Mrs. Clinton went out "several months ago."
</P>
<P>
	   "One could say the governor's hastily staged news conference was in response
to her being here," Lynch huffed.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a day for trading such charges.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, a Republican backer of the
mayor's expected Senate candidacy, repeatedly called Mrs. Clinton the "stranger
from Arkansas."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, at a morning stop in Westchester County where she now lives, Mrs.
Clinton said that the mayor's fund raising showed that if he were elected to the
Senate he would be "beholden to the far right of the Republican Party and fringe
groups."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani laughed when told about that.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're doing the right-wing conspiracy again? That's deja vu all over
again," the mayor responded.
</P>
<P>
	   Before President Clinton admitted to lying about his sexual relationship
with Monica Lewinsky, Mrs. Clinton had blamed a "vast, right-wing conspiracy"
for her husband's problems.
</P>
<P>
	   During an appearance before the state Legislature's budget committees,
Giuliani sought Monday to convince lawmakers that Pataki's latest $77 billion
state budget plan didn't do enough to help the city.
</P>
<P>
	   But unlike previous years, when Giuliani appeared almost confrontational
over what he saw as a shortchanging of the city by the state, the mayor opened
his testimony to lawmakers this year by praising "the very strong partnership
between the city and the state."
</P>
<P>
	   "Conditions in both the city of New York and the state of New York have
improved dramatically," the mayor told lawmakers at a public hearing on fellow
Republican Pataki's budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, at his news conference with Pataki, the mayor and governor seemed to
have developed a mutual admiration society.
</P>
<P>
	   "Let's keep this partnership and let's have it in Washington come the end of
this year," Pataki said at the end of their news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, Giuliani crossed party lines to endorse then-Gov. Mario Cuomo in
his unsuccessful bid for a fourth term against Pataki. Relations between the
Republican governor and the mayor have been frosty for most of the time since
then. They have warmed as Giuliani prepared to run against Mrs. Clinton.

<HEADLINE> J.C. Penney Aims for Less Clutter  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID KOENIG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- J.C. Penney Co. will centralize more of its buying
decisions to let local managers focus on sprucing up their stores, new chief
executive Vanessa Castagna promised Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Castagna held a three-day strategy session and pep rally for 1,500 store
managers and other officials of the retailer, which has been rocked by
competition from fancier department stores and more efficient discount chains.
</P>
<P>
	   They've been losing customers like Linda Martin, who was leaving the Penney
store in this Dallas suburb carrying a new pair of $80 shoes -- from a nearby
Foley's department store.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's pretty unorganized in there. They've got nice stuff, but they need to
make the stores look nicer and they need more customer service," Ms. Martin said
of Penney, adding that she first tried to buy shoes at Penney but couldn't find
a clerk to help her.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Castagna, 49, who moved from Wal-Mart to take the helm of Plano-based
Penney last year, said the chain will revamp its merchandising process to better
serve customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "They will see a much more focused merchandise presentation. It'll be easier
for our customers to shop because there will be less clutter," Ms. Castagna said
in an interview. "Hopefully they'll be able to find what they're looking for
much more quickly."
</P>
<P>
	   Department store sales fell 2 percent during the last 48 weeks of 1999.
Internet sales, while still a small fraction of overall sales, grew sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said Penney has been whipsawed by Americans' changing shopping
habits. Upscale mall department stores and lower-priced discounters located away
from big malls have thrived in recent years, while Penney remains stuck in the
middle.
</P>
<P>
	   They say Penney can't sell pricey apparel without alienating its base of
moderate-income shoppers, and a higher cost structure makes it difficult to
compete with the discounters.
</P>
<P>
	   Linda Kristiansen, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co., said Penney didn't work
closely enough with vendors to find out which items needed stocking and which
should be dumped. And, she said, it gave local store managers too much power in
buying decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are difficult stores to shop," Ms. Kristiansen added. "At Kohl's" -- a
competitor that is rapidly expanding in Texas -- "you have clean sight lines.
You can see at a glance where everything is. Penneys' are kind of crammed with
merchandise."

<HEADLINE> Whitman proposes 'holiday' for $42 unemployment tax  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman announced Monday that people
who work in New Jersey - rich, poor and in between - will get a $42 cut in
payroll taxes.
<P>
	   Starting next year.
</P>
<P>
	   And spread out over 20 weeks or more.
</P>
<P>
	   And thus noticeable mostly to people who check their pay stubs closely.
</P>
<P>
	   The tax cut adds up to $130 million a year for workers statewide, compared
with the $48 million cost of the more highly touted tax credit for the working
poor.
</P>
<P>
	   Those pay-stub checkers will note that for the first few months of every
year, they are charged a "UI" tax - a deduction that is deposited not into the
state treasury but into the legally independent Unemployment Insurance Trust
Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   The trust fund is the reserve used to pay unemployment benefits. Employers
pay into it also at a rate set according to a firm's track record for layoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said she would reduce it by roughly half for both sectors, cutting
revenues into the fund by $260 million a year for the next two fiscal years
until July 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   At that point, it will be up to the officials employed by a new governor to
decide if the cut can be maintained, according to Treasurer Roland Machold.
</P>
<P>
	   In other words, the cut is temporary. Policy aide Brian Baxter referred to
it as a "holiday."
</P>
<P>
	   The unemployment tax is assessed as a fraction of one percent of the first
$21,200 of income earned by everyone who works in New Jersey. The most recent
breakdowns from the 1990 census show that about 7 percent of those workers live
out-of-state, according to Labor Department spokesman Kevin Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   The tax is deducted from the paycheck each week until $90 is collected.
Those earning $42,000 pay the assessment until June. Those earning $500,000 a
year pay it for about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   To make it more complicated, the tax is divided into separate uses: $42 for
unemployment benefits and $48 for "health care" and worker development.
</P>
<P>
	   The worker development money funds retraining for laid-off workers. The
health care component is actually diverted by the Whitman administration to
provide state aid to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollars that go unemployment benefits is the part being discounted
starting next January because it would be too complicated to implement this
month, Machold said.
</P>
<P>
	   The impact on the unemployment fund is $260 million a year for each of two
years.
</P>
<P>
	   But the fund is flush with $2.9 billion, almost a third more than it needs
to be in balance. Whitman said the fund could pay all current unemployment
claims for two years without an additional penny of revenue.

	   Machold's staff said even with the two-year tax cut, the fund should grow
further to $3.3 billion by 2002 when the tax holiday ends.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked why the tax cut could not be extended, Machold said it is prudent to
keep track of collections and unanticipated drains on the fund, which could be
triggered by an increase in unemployment.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think caution is recommended," Machold said. "I always remember 10 or 15
years ago that that fund was negative $500 million."

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy Bill Filed in Congress  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress bestowed American citizenship on Winston
Churchill and Mother Teresa, and awarded it posthumously to Raoul Wallenberg,
the Swedish diplomat who saved tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews in World War
II. But the extraordinary power has been used rarely -- and never for a minor
child against a parent's wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and a group of Florida
lawmakers put in motion a process to give citizenship to 6-year-old Cuban
refugee Elian Gonzalez, without his father's consent.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott, R-Miss., told the Senate the bill ``to grant citizenship to this young
boy'' could come up for debate as soon as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors hoped to whisk it through Congress quickly, largely to remove the
case from the jurisdiction of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which
has ruled that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba. Passage would
also render moot a federal court appeal of the INS ruling by Elian's
great-uncle, sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This moves the decision-making out of the hands of the INS and into the
hands of the (state) courts,'' Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., the chief Senate
sponsor, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Monday, Mack formally introduced the measure in the Senate, and Lott
invoked a parliamentary procedure designed to bring it before the chamber as
early as Wednesday for debate. A vote Wednesday was possible, but both sides
said they doubted final action would occur until next week at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart declined to say what President
Clinton would do if Congress passed the bill -- sign it or veto it -- but said
the White House would consider the matter after Congress acts. The president has
indicated he does not believe Congress should get involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a real danger here that this can become a political issue, that
this young boy will be a political football,'' Lockhart said. ``And I think the
president has made it very clear to everyone that they ought to stay away from
politics here and stick to what the facts and the law dictate.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Mack said, ``There has been political influence even from the beginning
in the case,'' including rallies in Havana that Mack said were orchestrated by
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Senate Judiciary Committee's top
Democrat, denounced the legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the Congress to grant citizenship to a young boy over the father's
objection makes a mockery of family values, and it hands Castro yet another
reason to portray the United States as the enemy,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Elian's grandmothers, who flew Monday from New York to Miami in
hopes of seeing their 6-year-old grandson, planned to meet Tuesday afternoon in
Washington with Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the senator's aides announced.
Dodd is a sponsor of legislation introduced every year to ease the trade embargo
with Cuba in effect for four decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the high-profile examples of Churchill, Mother Teresa and
Wallenberg, Congress has used this power rarely and selectively. Its involvement
in individual immigration cases has declined sharply over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about half a dozen private immigration bills are introduced each year,
but most of them deal with advancing a pending case, trying to prevent a
deportation or helping an American employed overseas retain citizenship. Some
examples:
</P>
<P>
	   --In July 1997, Swiss banker Christoph Meili won permanent residency status.
He had lost his job after saving Holocaust-era bank documents from a shredder.
</P>
<P>
	   --In 1968, three men -- from Italy, Ireland and Germany -- who died while
fighting with American units in Vietnam, posthumously received U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   --In December 1975, Mrika Mrnacaj, a 111-year-old Albanian immigrant who
wanted to vote in a U.S. election before she died, won citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   --In 1988, Michael Wilding, the son of actress Elizabeth Taylor and a former
stepson of Sen. John Warner, R-Va., won citizenship. The British subject had
renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1971, and the bill blocked a possible
deportation on a marijuana possession conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   --In that same year, 1988, Congress rejected legislation that would have let
tennis star Ivan Lendl bypass the five-year waiting period for American
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of immigration bills fell off dramatically after the Abscam
scandal in the early 1980s when FBI agents posing as Arab sheiks asked members
of Congress to introduce private immigration bills to allow wealthy ``Arabs'' to
enter the United States in exchange for money.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining Mack and Lott in sponsoring the bill for Elian Gonzalez were Sens.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., and Bob Graham, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   In the House, Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas; and several Florida
lawmakers co-sponsored a similar bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Reps. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., and Peter
Deutsch, D-Fla, introduced a rival bill to grant Elian permanent residency
status.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will give Elian the choice, when he's old enough, to decide the
citizenship question for himself,'' Menendez said.
</P>
<P>
	   And Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., introduced a resolution -- co-sponsored by
nine Democrats and one Republican -- urging that Elian be reunited with his
father.
</P>
<P>
	   John Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said no
decision had yet been made on how to proceed in the House -- whether to try to
bring the bill to the floor directly, or to let the House Judiciary Committee
consider it first.
</P>
<P>
	   Although not a sponsor, Hastert supports the bill and ``he'll help to
advance it,'' said Feehery.

<HEADLINE> Freed Militant Back in Kashmir  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Freed last month in exchange for hostages held on
an Indian airliner in Afghanistan, the leader of a militant Islamic group has
rejoined his comrades fighting in Indian-held Kashmir, militants said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, leader of the Jammu Kashmir Ul-Umar Mujahedeen, vowed
his ``mujahedeen,'' or holy warriors, would continue their struggle until the
Kashmiri people win self-determination, the group said in a statement in the
Urdu language.
</P>
<P>
	   Zargar returned to Kapora district in Indian-held Kashmir, the group said.
He was one of three militants released from prison to end the hijacking of an
Indian Airlines plane on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The most prominent of the prisoners, Maulana Massood Azhar, returned to his
homeland, Pakistan. The whereabouts of the third prisoner, British-born
Pakistani Ahmed Omar Sayed Sheikh, is unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Guns alone will end Indian occupation of Kashmir,'' the statement quoted
Zargar as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting regularly wracks the mountainous region, the stage for two wars
between nuclear neighbors India and Pakistan since independence in 1947. Both
countries control part of the area and claim the rest.
</P>
<P>
	   Militant secessionists are demanding either outright independence or -- as
in the case of Zargar's group -- union with Islamic Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, soldiers hunkered down in their trenches in the war-battered
Pakistani post of Ghaigian, 120 miles from Muzaffarabad, the capital of
Pakistan-ruled Kashmir, as Indian mortar and heavy machine gun fire roared
across the disputed Kashmir frontier.
</P>
<P>
	   Dried grass burned and the air was thick with black ash.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent weeks, U.S. officials have been meeting Pakistani and Indian
leaders urging a reduction in tension.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan summoned the acting Indian ambassador Monday to the foreign
ministry in Islamabad to lodge a ``strong protest'' against the attack, a
foreign ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both countries accuse the other of firing the first shot in the latest
fighting. Last week, India said Pakistan sent troops across the border, but the
attack was repulsed. Pakistan called the accusation baseless and accused Indian
troops of indiscriminate firing at troops and civilians alike.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Indian soldiers crossed the line of control and attacked this excluded
post from three sides,'' said Lt. Col. Shahid Zaman, speaking from the
front-line post. ``Indians overran a portion of it, destroying a few bunkers.
But our troops fought back and drove them away.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistani soldiers showed the remains of three bunkers they said were
destroyed by Indian shells. From the distance the roar of shells could be heard,
several could be seen slamming into Pakistani territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan said a funeral procession on its side of the border was hit by
Indian shells, killing three people last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan's Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar also has reported the Indian attack
to the United Nations and asked the U.N. to send a special envoy to defuse
tensions.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighting, in the height of winter, warns of a tough summer ahead. Last
summer, the two countries waged their fiercest battle in Kashmir, a territory
that has been the cause of two wars between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Usually it is from May to September when Pakistani and Indian troops lock
their horns,'' said Zaman.

<HEADLINE> Report Ponders Amtrak Independence  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak supporters defended the national railway Monday
after an oversight committee released a report questioning whether it can become
self-sufficient after three decades of government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Amtrak Reform Council, in its first annual report, challenged Amtrak's
claim that it is on target to become self-sufficient by the end of fiscal year
2002, as required by Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the council's interpretation, Amtrak must save or earn an additional
$567 million by that deadline to avoid possible wholesale changes in its
operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said the report ``mischaracterized
the intent of this administration'' on how to measure Amtrak's progress.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak officials said the report failed to recognize the railroad's recent
progress over the last few years in increasing riders and revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the past two years we've been ahead of our business plan targets,''
Amtrak spokesman John Wolf said. ``Through the first quarter of this year, we're
ahead of our business targets again. You can't argue with that success.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ross Capon, executive director of the National Association of Railroad
Passengers which represents frequent rail travelers, said the financial gap
mentioned by the council could be nearly impossible to close.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're going to raise the bar another $567 million, it seems to me it's
a no-brainer that they can't do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sonny Hall, president of the AFL-CIO transportation trades department, said
the report should have been titled ``a preliminary death wish for Amtrak.''
</P>
<P>
	   Council Chairman Gil Carmichael said the report was written to raise
questions rather than offer conclusions and was not meant to be a condemnation
of Amtrak. ``The council wants Amtrak to succeed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report was approved 8-3 by the council, with two dissenters writing
separate opinions.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarence Monin, the labor union representative, wrote that the council ``has
carved out an ideological agenda for itself which ... extends far beyond what
Congress intended.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jolene Molitoris, administrator of the Federal Rail Administration who
represents Slater on the council, wrote that the report ``works counter to our
shared goal'' of helping Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
	   The report found that Amtrak's ridership ``has remained virtually
unchanged'' during a decade of transportation growth in America and that Amtrak
continues to incur ``significant financial losses.'' It questioned whether
Amtrak productivity is improving.
</P>
<P>
	   But for now, the main point of contention between the council and the
railway is over how to define the congressional mandate that Amtrak become
financially self-sustaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Using the standard it believes should apply -- which excludes the cost of
equipment depreciation and some equipment overhauls -- Amtrak says it is on pace
to be free of government operating subsidies by the end of fiscal year 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   But the council report said that, factoring in the disputed costs, Amtrak
will miss that mark by $567 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who chairs the Senate Commerce
subcommittee on surface transportation, said she hopes to hold hearings in March
on what standard should be apply.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak could face possible liquidation and a restructuring of rail service
if it fails to meet the 2002 deadline. But Hutchison said it would be ``very
myopic to cut Amtrak off and lose (it) ... forever until we have given them
every chance to succeed.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Issues Heartburn Drug Warning  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The popular heartburn drug Propulsid can cause dangerous
irregular heartbeats and even sudden death, the government said Monday. The
medicine should be used only as a last resort -- and only by patients first
given heart tests to ensure they are at low risk for the side effect, it warned.
</P>
<P>
	   Patients now taking Propulsid should ask their doctors about switching
medication, and doctors should not prescribe the drug without first performing
an EKG, or electrocardiogram, the Food and Drug Administration said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nor should anyone with heart disease or a list of other illnesses use the
drug, the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA's unusually strong warning comes in the wake of 70 deaths and 200
other reports of irregular heartbeat and other heart rhythm disturbances since
Propulsid hit the market in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Manufacturer Johnson &AMP; Johnson mailed the warning to thousands of physicians
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson &AMP; Johnson shares closed Monday at $83.68 3/4, down 6.18 3/4, or 6.9
percent. Propulsid had sales of about $970 million last year, according to
analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA first warned that Propulsid can cause serious heart problems in June
1998, but it continued to receive reports of deaths and hospitalizations.
</P>
<P>
	   So Monday, the agency took additional steps to make sure Propulsid is used
only by patients with severe nighttime heartburn who get no relief from other
drugs -- and only if they appear at low risk for the cardiac side effects.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA said it was not pulling Propulsid off the market because the drug
can help some patients and because the new warnings should make using it safer.
</P>
<P>
	   The cardiac risk is relatively small considering an estimated 30 million
Propulsid prescriptions have been written since 1993, and most people who
suffered the heart problems had clear risk factors, said Dr. Florence Houn,
FDA's chief of gastrointestinal drugs. That means careful doctors who heed the
new warnings should be able to keep Propulsid away from the patients most likely
to be hurt, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want warnings to go out. We want education to the prescribers to be
reinforced," she said. "This drug requires careful prescription."
</P>
<P>
	   But an expert on drug-induced irregular heartbeats said it will be difficult
for the doctors who most prescribe Propulsid -- gastrointestinal specialists --
to comply.
</P>
<P>
	   "FDA warnings have not been as successful as we would like in being
translated into care," said Dr. Raymond Woosley, a pharmacologist at Georgetown
University Medical Center. "This one will be especially difficult because of the
fact that many physicians don't have an EKG" machine in their offices.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, some computerized EKG equipment doesn't accurately read a critical
type of heartbeat measurement called "QT prolongation," requiring doctors
skilled in reading EKGs to determine that manually, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among FDA's warnings:
</P>
<P>
	   --Do not prescribe Propulsid to anyone with heart disease, including
valvular disease, or who has ever had an irregular heartbeat, abnormal EKG or QT
prolongation.
</P>
<P>
	   --Do not prescribe Propulsid to people with kidney disease; lung disease;
low blood levels of the electrolytes potassium, calcium or magnesium; an eating
disorder; dehydration or prolonged vomiting.
</P>
<P>
	   --Never take Propulsid while using a list of other medications, including
antibiotics like erythromycin; antifungals like ketoconazole; AIDS-fighting
protease inhibitors; drugs for irregular heartbeat; certain antidepressants and
antipsychotics such as Elavil or Serzone. Also do not take with grapefruit
juice.
</P>
<P>
	   --In addition to an EKG, patients being considered for Propulsid should
undergo blood tests to check electrolyte levels.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA will gather heartburn and cardiac experts for a special meeting
April 12 to determine whether the new Propulsid warnings are adequate.

<HEADLINE> Libya-London Flights Resuming  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The first Libyan Arab Airlines plane to land in Britain since
1986 touched down Monday evening at London's Heathrow Airport, signifying
improving relations between Britain and Col. Moammar Gadhafi's regime.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain had accused the state-run airline of supporting terrorist activity
and banned all its flights in October 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   Heathrow officials said the airline planned to operate three services a week
between the two capitals. No date has been set for the resumption of commercial
flights, the Foreign Office said.
</P>
<P>
	   Diplomatic ties between the two countries were reinstated in December after
Libya paid unspecified compensation for the April 1984 killing of London
policewoman Yvonne Fletcher, who was shot by a gunman firing from inside the
Libyan Embassy. Britain broke off diplomatic relations after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Another obstacle was removed this year when Gadhafi handed over two suspects
in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988.
The attack killed 270 people in the air and on the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspects were turned over for trial before Scottish judges at a special
court in The Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
	   The Libyan state airline made an inaugural symbolic flight to London before
turning around and returning to Tripoli. The British ambassador to Libya,
Richard Dalton, was on board the flight, the Foreign Office said.

<HEADLINE> Africans Pledge Peace for Congo  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In an extraordinary meeting orchestrated by the
United States, the presidents of countries warring in the Congo pledged Monday
to recommit themselves to a faltering cease-fire and to peace in Central Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   But the African leaders, including Congolese President Laurent Kabila in his
first U.S. visit, also demanded the world body deploy a U.N. peacekeeping force
to monitor the 6-month-old truce. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
chaired the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has acknowledged holding up authorization for the force,
arguing the mission would be doomed because the cease-fire has been so widely
flouted by all sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni agreed there was an enormous risk and cost
in setting up the peacekeeping force, which U.N. officials have estimated could
require some 25,000 members.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But the cost of inaction, as witnessed in Rwanda, would be too ghastly,
more costly and morally repugnant,'' he told his counterparts in the Security
Council chamber, the first time they have met outside Africa over the war in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   Congo's war has drawn in a half-dozen African nations, with Uganda and
Rwanda backing the rebels who rebelled against Kabila in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Kabila subsequently enlisted the support of Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia to
fight a war that has destabilized the entire Great Lakes region of Central
Africa, killing untold numbers and uprooting close to 1 million people from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   The governments signed a cease-fire agreement in Lusaka, Zambia, last July
and the rebels signed on in August. But fighting has persisted.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke visited several African countries late
last year and invited their leaders to New York to shore up the Lusaka
agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the absence at Monday's meeting of the main rebel groups in the
Congo, U.S. officials said they hoped the mini-summit of leaders, which will
continue this week behind closed doors, would produce a ``Lusaka-Plus''
agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright praised the leaders' willingness to come to New York, and pledged
$2 million for the peace process. Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy
pledged the same.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said she would work with Congress to obtain its approval for the
next installment of the U.N. peacekeeping plan for Congo, ``provided our efforts
this week result in renewed impetus towards implementation of the peace
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a report to the Security Council last week, Secretary-General Kofi Annan
asked the council to authorize a mission of 500 military observers and 3,400
troops to protect them. The next step would be a full-fledged peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan said Monday that the United Nations was prepared to do its part but
that the real responsibility rested with the countries involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If peace is to take hold, and if international engagement is to be
sustained, the warring parties face a paramount challenge: They need to
demonstrate the political will to apply the agreement fully, without further
delay,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kabila said he was prepared to work for peace and launch talks immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although history has not always been kind to my country, we are a people
-- a people who know how to forgive,'' Kabila said. ``And I am here today once
again to offer my hand of reconciliation to those that have done us harm.''
</P>
<P>
	   Museveni and Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu pledged to work to
implement the Lusaka agreement but said the United Nations should deploy the
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is your responsibility,'' Bizimungu said. ``All you need to muster is
the moral authority and courage to do it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Joining Kabila at the meeting were his allies, Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Namibian Foreign Minister
Theo-Ben Gurirab.
</P>
<P>
	   Other leaders came from Zambia, Botswana, Mozambique and the Organization of
African Unity.

<HEADLINE> Overnite Sues Teamsters for $5.2M  </HEADLINE>
    By AMY GREEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A trucking company involved in a labor dispute
filed a lawsuit in federal court Monday accusing Teamsters president James P.
Hoffa and other union leaders in a string of violence and illegal activities
including 57 acts of attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
	   The 225-page suit, filed by Overnite Transportation Co. in Jackson, accuses
the Teamsters of devising a scheme to "put Overnite out of business if ... its
employees do not agree to collective bargaining representation by the Teamster
International."
</P>
<P>
	   The suit seeks damages in excess of $5.2 million for an alleged pattern of
violent activities.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have said at least five shootings appear related to the dispute. The
most serious came Dec. 1, when driver William Wonder of Evansville, Ind., was
shot in the stomach as he drove from the Memphis hub.
</P>
<P>
	   Dave Cameron, a national coordinator for the Teamsters, said the suit is
Overnite's "desperate" attempt to draw public attention away from its own
illegal activities, including the alleged harassment and illegal firing of its
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Richmond, Va.-based Overnite, one of the nation's largest predominantly
nonunion truckload carriers, has been locked in a labor dispute with the

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- "Beverly Hills, 90210" will be marked "canceled" after
10 seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   The drama about youngsters living in the upscale Southern California enclave
will wrap up at the end of this season, Fox Broadcasting Co. said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The network had considered airing new summer episodes and bringing the
series back for an 11th season, but apparently was swayed by the cost, now $2.2
million per episode, Daily Variety reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennie Garth, Ian Ziering, Brian Austin Green and Tori Spelling are the
remaining cast members of the ensemble drama that has moved from a high school
setting to post-college as its characters aged.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The tug-of-war over Elian Gonzalez will be the subject
of a four-hour CBS miniseries.
</P>
<P>
	   The network said Monday it hired Craig Anderson, the producer of CBS'
upcoming "Sally Hemings" miniseries about Thomas Jefferson and his slave, for
the story of 6-year-old Elian. No air date has been set.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, rescued off the Florida coast Nov. 25 after his mother and 10 others
drowned attempting to flee Cuba, is involved in a custody battle between his
father in Cuba and relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The network had no comment on how the politically charged story would be
approached, spokesman Chris Ender said. But he called Anderson a
"well-credentialed" producer.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson said he wants to film part of the miniseries in Cuba and hopes
Elian's relatives there and in the United States will cooperate on the project.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tears flowed on the "Donny &AMP; Marie" show as entertainer
Marie Osmond discussed her marital woes.

<P>
	   "No outside parties or influences" prompted her to separate from music
producer Brian Blosil, her husband of 13 years, Miss Osmond said at the

she didn't want to be secretive about it.

	   Donny Osmond, her brother and co-host, cried as he told his sister he loves
and supports her. Miss Osmond fought back tears when she spoke of her seven
children.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, she revealed that after having a baby in July, she left her
family for a few days in a bout of postpartum depression.

amicable and asked the media to respect their privacy.

<HEADLINE> Whitman pushes $9.4 billion school construction plan, tax breaks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman, calling her proposed $21.3
billion state budget a "prosperity dividend" for New Jersey, said Monday the
state should tap into a national tobacco settlement to help pay for $9.4 billion
in school construction and pitched tax rebates for the working poor and lower
unemployment taxes for those employed in the state.
<P>
	   Whitman, delivering her annual budget address to a joint session of the
state Legislature, said the record spending plan built on tax dollars from a
robust economy provides New Jersey with an opportunity to pump up spending,
invest for the future and return money to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   "And we can do it this year," Whitman said. "Let's use this dividend not to
just build on what we've accomplished, but to do even more for our fellow New
Jerseyans."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman's budget also calls for spending $250 million for transportation
projects without raising taxes, boosting the state payroll by 640, and freeing
up dollars for a wide range of construction projects, including a new prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers from both parties said the spending plan reflected New Jersey's
high-octane economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's more than raining pennies from heaven," said Sen. Robert Martin,
R-Morris. "It's raining dollars from Trenton."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman proposed how New Jersey should spend the approximately $300 million
a year the state will receive over the next quarter century from a national
tobacco settlement. The Republican governor said two-thirds of the money should
go toward health-related programs. And Whitman said she, Senate President Donald
DiFrancesco and Assembly Speaker Jack Collins have agreed that the other third -
about $100 million a year - should pay for school construction.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey is under court order to refurbish old and crumbling schools in
many of its poorest school districts. Whitman, however, says other districts
should also get money for school construction. The plan calls for $5 billion in
funding for 30 "special needs" school districts and $4.4 billion for all other
districts.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ours will be the biggest school construction and modernization program in
America," Whitman said. "Using the money from the tobacco settlement ... as well
as lottery and cigarette tax receipts, we will begin an up to $10 billion effort
to make every school building and every classroom conducive to learning."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers have not yet agreed on a plan on how to dole out the school
construction money.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget Whitman is proposing for the fiscal year that begins in July
would tap only about $12 million from the tobacco settlement for school
construction, and use another $89 million from other sources. She wants to use
$123 million of tobacco settlement money this year to help pay for hospital
charity care.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman called for an earned income tax credit for the working poor. She
said the plan would provide tax credits for working families earning $20,000 or
less.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will give more than 200,000 hard-working families a real hand up, not
just a handout," Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the state does not tax families at that level, the credit would mean
cash for those families. The governor said after a four-year phase-in, families
with incomes of $20,000 would receive a $480 credit. Families earning $15,000
would receive $707. The money would be doled out as tax refund checks, according
to Treasurer Roland Machold.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan would cost the state budget $48 million this year, and is expected
to rise to $106 million after the four-year phase-in.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman also proposed a tax savings for all who work in New Jersey -
including out-of-state residents who commute to the Garden State. For two years
beginning in 2001, the governor wants to reduce by $42.40 a year the amount
workers contribute to the unemployment insurance tax.
</P>
<P>
	   Those who live in New Jersey but commute out of state will not qualify
because they pay unemployment taxes in the state where they are employed.
Out-of-staters commuting to New Jersey would get a tax break.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also wants to reduce employer contributions to the fund by $260
million over the next two years. She said the fund has a surplus because of the
bountiful economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget proposes spending $250 million for road construction projects,
$70 million more to fund the start-up of a FamilyCare subsidized health
insurance program, and a $482 million boost in state aid to public schools.
Whitman also proposes adding $10 million in state funds to develop programs for
emotionally disturbed children.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman is proposing spending 8.9 percent more than the budget she signed
last June. It is nearly 11 percent fatter than the budget she proposed last
January.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a good budget based on really good economic times," said DiFrancesco.
</P>
<P>
	   "One thing everybody has to admit: This economy has done well, Governor
Whitman has been governor during this time, we're the Republican Legislature,"
said Collins. "New Jersey has done very very well and this budget shows it."
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Democratic Leader Richard Codey, D-Essex criticized Whitman's
approach to funding road projects without finding a permanent source of revenue
for them.
</P>
<P>
	   "What happens if the economy turns bad?" he said.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmothers Land in Miami  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers flew from New York to Miami on
Monday in hopes of meeting with their 6-year-old grandson before they return to
Cuba. But several hours after their arrival, the women were still at the airport
because the site of the get-together was in dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, and paternal grandmother,
Mariela Quintana, were invited to dinner Monday at the home of Elian's relatives
in Miami, who insisted the meeting take place there.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials said the grandmothers were hoping to meet privately with
Elian at a neutral site. There was no official word Monday evening on whether
the grandmothers would indeed visit with Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy spoke by telephone with his father in Cuba and was excited as he
prepared for his grandmothers' arrival, according to Armando Gutierrez, a
spokesman for the Miami relatives. Gutierrez said the family had bought cameras
so Elian could take pictures of his grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's heartbreaking,'' said Spencer Eig, an attorney for the Miami family.
``We still have hope.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami relatives have been caring for Elian since he was found clinging
to an inner tube off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving. His mother and 10 other
Cubans died in their ill-fated attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled that Elian must be sent
back to Cuba to live with his father, but the Miami family is suing in federal
court to block the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   And on Monday, the first day of the new congressional session, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott and Florida lawmakers introduced a bill to give Elian
U.S. citizenship, which would free him from INS jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers, who flew from Cuba to New York on Friday, had asked
Attorney General Janet Reno over the weekend to arrange a meeting with Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to the INS, an attorney for the Miami family said a dinner at
the home of Lazaro Gonzalez -- Mrs. Quintana's brother-in-law and Elian's
great-uncle -- would let the grandmothers ``see and feel for themselves how well
Elian is doing and how much he wishes to remain in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, said the family
would only allow the meeting to take place at the home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is where they live. This is where Elian lives,'' Gutierrez said. ``No
budging on that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The family planned to welcome the grandmothers with a dinner of roast pork,
mixed black beans and rice and breaded chicken cutlets, Gutierrez said. Boxes of
flowers were seen being brought into the home. About 300 people gathered outside
holding signs and flowers to welcome the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department spokesman Carole Florman said authorities were trying to
arrange a meeting at a neutral location.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The grandmothers were not comfortable with a meeting at Lazaro's house.
They want a private meeting with the boy,'' Florman said.
</P>
<P>
	   On NBC's ``Today'' show, Ms. Rodriguez asked Congress not to give the boy
U.S. citizenship and to let him return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be more painful if he gets the citizenship,'' she said, speaking
in Spanish through an interpreter. ``I'm asking the congresspeople and people of
the United States that have supported us to stop all this. Please, don't make us
suffer any longer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although they said they have not spoken to the boy in five days, Mrs.
Quintana said Elian has told her over the telephone that ``he's crazy to go back
to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He misses everything there. His school, his classmates, everybody -- his
father's love. To be able to hug and kiss his father. He tells us every day,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Rodriguez denied that her daughter wanted to come to the United States
and have Elian live here. She said she was pressured to make the trip by her
boyfriend, ``a very violent person.''

<HEADLINE> GOP, Democrats To Duel on Surplus  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With political positioning and billions of dollars at
stake, congressional Democrats and Republicans are ready to launch an
election-year duel over the future size of the federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office will release three scenarios on
Wednesday projecting the surplus at between $1 trillion and $2 trillion over the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats are expected to embrace the smallest of three CBO projections, or
roughly $1 trillion excluding Social Security, say congressional aides speaking
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans have not decided what to do, but many of them,including Senate
Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., seem likely to endorse a
projection totaling about $2 trillion over the 10 years. That's double what CBO
projected last year, a figure that has grown because of the persistently strong
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   CBO, using still other assumptions, will release a third projection which,
though arrived at differently, also foresees about $2 trillion in black ink,
aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the figures are only projections, the number Congress ultimately uses
is crucial because it will decide how much money lawmakers have available for
tax cuts, spending increases or reduction of the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unusual for CBO to produce more than one surplus estimate without
endorsing one as the figure it believes most valid. CBO's decision to release
three projections highlights the immense political pressure on the agency as the
two parties vie over rival visions of how to use the government's huge projected
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   The figure Democrats are expected to be embrace assumes that one-third of
the $1.7 trillion federal budget that Congress must approve every year will grow
annually with the rate of inflation. The money covers everything but
automatically paid benefits like Social Security and interest payments on the
federal debt.
</P>
<P>
	   This number also assumes the most government spending with less money left
over for the tax cuts than the other two CBO projections. It also most nearly
approaches what has actually happened in recent years, as lawmakers have
consistently increased spending for defense and many domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The number many Republicans like assumes that spending subject to annual
congressional approval will remain frozen at roughly $620 billion and assumes
less spending than Democrats would like, with more money left over for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   The third option assumes that spending limits on this portion of the budget
will be obeyed. These limits have been ignored for the past two years by tens of
billions of dollars annually, and are virtually certain to be ignored again this
coming year. This calculation assumes bigger surpluses for the next few years,
but smaller surpluses in later years than the assumption Republicans are
expected to use.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Republicans like the second option because it allows room for big tax
cuts over the decade, but does not make the unrealistic assumption that the
spending limits will be obeyed.
</P>
<P>
	   The fiscal 2001 budget President Clinton is expected to introduce next
month, likely will embrace a surplus estimate that is a bit more generous than
the $1 trillion figure congressional Democrats favor.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace May Cost US Billions  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK LAVIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The United States will be asked to pay the multibillion
dollar bill for peace between Israel and Syria, a Cabinet minister involved in
the negotiations said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, chief of staff of the Israeli army before entering
politics in 1998, said the bill could reach the $17 billion reported in the
Israeli media, and said it would be a ``reasonable price'' for the United States
to pay.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Ehud Barak picked Lipkin-Shahak and Foreign Minister David
Levy to join him in talks with the Syrians. Syria called off the most recent
round, scheduled for last week. No new date has been set.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The (Israeli) army knows what it needs,'' Lipkin-Shahak told The
Associated Press in an interview at the Knesset, Israel's parliament, spelling
out the expensive security arrangements Israel would require as part of its
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria is demanding that Israel return the strategic Golan Heights, a plateau
overlooking Israel's north and providing Israel a clear view of Syrian military
deployments. Israel captured the territory in 1967. Barak has indicated that he
would be prepared to give up most or all of the highlands in return for security
assurances from Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington is hoping a peace arrangement between Syria and Israel will help
push the region to an overall peace. In return for cooperating with U.S. efforts
in the region, Syria hopes for massive U.S. aid to revamp its economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite some signs of shock from Washington at the thought of a multibillion
dollar pricetag, Lipkin-Shahak expected that the U.S. would pay the bill in the
end, calling it an investment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How much did the (1991) Gulf war (against Iraq) cost?'' he asked. ``How
much is it worth (to the United States) to have stability in oil prices? How
much is it worth to develop a Middle East market to American products?''
</P>
<P>
	   The ex-general said Israel must keep its listening post high atop Mt. Hermon
at the northern edge of the Golan Heights, the highest elevation in the region,
where Israeli soldiers keep an eye on Syrian troop movements all the way to the
Syrian capital of Damascus.
</P>
<P>
	   Lipkin-Shahak confirmed media reports that Israel would ask for Tomahawk
cruise missiles from the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel would need cruise missiles in case of a war against faraway enemies
like Iran or Iraq, said military analyst Shlomo Brom, a former director of
military planning, ``to hit distant targets without the need to overfly
countries with which we are at peace, using manned aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the expense would be for relocating Israeli army bases on the Golan
Heights, Lipkin-Shahak said. He said security arrangements would have to be in
effect for ten to 15 years ``to build credibility between the two sides.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lipkin-Shahak rejected the contention by some military experts that Israel
must recreate its entire array of offensive and defensive capabilities once it
withdraws from the Golan Heights. ``We are making peace, not war,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> President Opens China Debate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Congress returned to work Monday, President Clinton
opened what he has promised will be an all-out mobilization to pass a trade deal
with China this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton sent a letter to the Republican leaders of the House and Senate
arguing that normalizing trade relations with China is in America's economic
interest. The deal also increases U.S. leverage with China on human rights and
other non-economic issues, Clinton wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must do it to encourage China along the path of domestic reform, human
rights, the rule of law and international cooperation,'' Clinton wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Commerce Secretary William Daley is helping lead an administration push for
the deal worked out with China last November. The administration points to the
economic benefits that greater access to the Chinese market would offer U.S.
businesses, especially in the agriculture industry. China, with more than 1
billion people, is the world's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers are expected to vote by late spring on whether to grant China
permanent normal trading relations with the United States as part of a deal to
allow China to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal Clinton administration officials made with China is one step on the
road to China's entrance into the WTO and one source of controversy behind the
large protests that disrupted the WTO meeting in Seattle in December.
</P>
<P>
	   In general, Republicans support the trade deal while many congressional
Democrats, labor and environmental groups oppose it.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rican Gov. Rejects Offer  </HEADLINE>
   By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Gov. Pedro Rossello on Monday rejected a new
Pentagon offer to resolve a dispute over a U.S. Navy bombing range on the Puerto
Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
	   The offer was presented on Friday. Rossello met with political, religious
and civic leaders Monday afternoon and spoke at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The offer was the latest attempt by the U.S. government to defuse a
political battle that started when a U.S. Marine Corps jet dropped two bombs
off-target on April 19, killing a civilian security guard in the Vieques
training ground.
</P>
<P>
	   The guard's death touched off demonstrations against the U.S. Navy, which
owns two-thirds of Vieques. Protesters have camped out in the bombing range to
prevent further exercises, and Rossello has demanded the military leave.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Defense on Friday offered to hand over some of the land if
the Puerto Rican government allows it to continue military exercises with dummy
bombs, Rossello's aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   They said the deal would also call for a referendum among Vieques' 9,400
residents on whether the Navy should be allowed to resume bombing with live
explosives.
</P>
<P>
	   If residents approve, the Department of Defense would ask Congress for a $40
million economic aid package for the island. If they disapprove, the deal would
require the military to leave Vieques by March 2005.
</P>
<P>
	   After efforts to clean the land of explosives, the training ground would be
turned over to the U.S. Interior Department and the General Services
Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   But opponents of the Navy want the military training to stop completely.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Navy has not internalized that they have to stop their exercises,''
said former Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon. A bitter rival of Rossello, Hernandez
Colon joined the governor Monday to show the rare unity the issue has inspired
among Puerto Rico's politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   Rossello said he would continue to try to seek a ``valid and just''
agreement with Clinton but would not negotiate with the Department of Defense.

<HEADLINE> Russia To Stop Some Food Handouts  </HEADLINE>
   By NICK WADHAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- Russia will no longer distribute food or
humanitarian aid to refugees who fled several regions in breakaway Chechnya that
are now under federal control, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The decree was aimed at inducing some of the 180,000 refugees in Ingushetia,
the neighboring Russian region, to head back to Chechnya and freeing up space
for refugees still fleeing the fighting in the capital Grozny and Chechnya's
south, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If those people don't leave and people from Grozny keep coming, then what
will we do?'' said Musa Aslanbekov, commandant of the Sputnik tent camp, one of
Ingushetia's largest. ``There isn't heating or beds for all of them, and it's
cold now. We've got to move them back so there are less here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Russia has taken control of more than two-thirds of Chechnya since launching
its military campaign in September to reassert control in the republic. But many
refugees are unwilling to return to Russian-controlled areas, saying they don't
believe the Russian claims that they will be safe.
</P>

54-year-old Zina Basayeva. She said other refugees who heard of the decree had
given her some of their food.

bread per person, each day and enough soup for each family to have one hot meal
a day. Foreign aid groups have supplied flour, sugar, blankets, clothes and
other goods like toothpaste and soap.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 7,000 registered residents of Sputnik, about 600 were from the
regions mentioned in the decree, said Ruslan Kaloyev, Ingushetia's deputy
emergency situations minister. The affected areas were the Naursky, Shelkovsky,
Nadterechny, Asinovsky and Sernovodsk regions, all in northern Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> NBC Chief Pledges More Diversity  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- NBC president Bob Wright pledged Monday to keep his
network focused on bolstering racial diversity at all levels, but he said a
limited pool has spread minority talent too thin.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright acknowledged that broadcast TV needs more diversity. "There's not a
doubt in my mind that our concern about this (at NBC) is very substantial,"
Wright said speaking at the National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said real a limited supply of minority talent coming through the
pipeline threatens quick change.
</P>
<P>
	   "The minority pool that is currently available both behind the camera and in
front of it is very small and is spread very thin," Wright said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said NBC is working on projects to address that problem.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC and the NAACP struck a deal this month in which the network agreed to
systematically seek out more minorities to write, produce and direct its
television shows and decide what goes on the air. Because of NBC's commitment,
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People removed the
threat of a boycott against the network.
</P>
<P>
	   On some other hot-button issues, Wright said CBS went too far in digitally
superimposing its logo over an NBC sign on a news broadcast. CBS used technology
on New Year's Eve to cover a giant NBC-sponsored screen that appeared in a
camera's view of Times Square behind CBS network anchor Dan Rather. Instead,
viewers saw the CBS eye logo.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that crossed the line," Wright said. He noted that NBC spent
millions of dollars to invest in the Times Square space.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright also was questioned about the recent disclosure that the government
used financial incentives to get TV networks to include anti-drug messages in
their shows.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it does raise issues," Wright said, but he asserted that NBC
submitted no scripts to the White House's drug office for approval before any
show was taped.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he believed some of the problems would be addressed by Congress.

<HEADLINE> Senator Seeks End to Smoke Grants  </HEADLINE>
   By LIBBY QUAID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While the Clinton administration spends billions of
dollars to curb smoking, it also is providing money to Indian tribes for
businesses that sell cheaper cigarettes, a Senate report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1997, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has doled out
$4.2 million in grants for construction of five Oklahoma convenience stores and
one Nevada smoke shop run by tribes that can offer discounted cigarettes because
of their tax-free status.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., chairman of the Appropriations Committee's
subcommittee that controls HUD's budget, sent a letter Monday to HUD Secretary
Andrew Cuomo demanding the agency end the practice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``HUD's decision to finance construction of these smoke shops for the sale
of discounted cigarettes is completely at odds with efforts to discourage teen
smoking,'' Bond wrote. ``HUD has the power to choose not to fund discount
cigarette retail outlets.''
</P>
<P>
	   Calling Bond's comments ``the height of hypocrisy,'' HUD spokesman David
Egner said HUD has no legal authority to ban sales of tobacco products in stores
that get federal funds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Only Congress has the authority to impose such a ban, and Sen. Bond has
refused to support this action,'' Egner said. ``The senator's report is really a
harsh condemnation of his own inaction on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tribes defended the money, saying tobacco is just one of the many legal
products tribes sell to match their non-Indian competitors. The stores create
jobs and boost income, taxes and retail sales for communities, said Choctaw
Nation Chief Gregory E. Pyle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For every dollar Indian tribes make and put back into assistance for our
citizens, this is a dollar less we are dependent on the federal or state
government,'' said Pyle, whose tribe received grants of $750,000 apiece for
stores in Ada and Broken Bow, Okla.
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-smoking advocates were riled by news of the $4.2 million in funds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The grants are totally inconsistent with your administration's priority of
preventing youth smoking and reducing the deadly and costly toll of tobacco in
our country,'' Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,
wrote in a letter to President Clinton.

<HEADLINE> ABC's Iger Named No. 2 at Disney  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- ABC network chief Robert Iger was named second in
command at The Walt Disney Co. Monday as Michael Eisner reorganized the
company's top management.
</P>
<P>
	   Iger, 48, was promoted to president and chief operating officer, filling a
position left vacant since Hollywood dealmaker Michael Ovitz left in 1996 after
a futile attempt to share power with Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The changes beef up Disney's top management after more than a year of
slumping share prices and executive defections.
</P>
<P>
	   Eisner also announced the promotion of chief strategic officer Peter Murphy
and chief financial officer Thomas O. Staggs to senior executive vice
presidents.
</P>
<P>
	   They will become members of a new executive management committee that will
include Eisner, Iger, Disney vice chairman Sanford M. Litvack and heads of
individual business units.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney also released a preview of first quarter results that showed net
income rose 7 percent to $515 million, or 25 cents per share, excluding its
Go.com Internet business. Official results will be released in February.
</P>
<P>
	   The management changes should reassure investors and analysts who worried by
recent departures, said Doug Christopher, an analyst with Crowell Weedon.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it adds some depth and experience to the management team, and
credibility," he said. "I think the company is turning around. This is a company
that's got a lot of the right things happening."
</P>
<P>
	   Disney announced in November that it planned to issue a separate stock for
Go.com, which is expected to yield a "substantial loss" in the first quarter due
to the cost of acquiring the Internet company Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings increase exceeded Wall Street expectations and reflected the
strong performance of ABC, which benefited from better ad sales and the
popularity of the thrice-weekly game show "Who Wants to be a Millionaire." Ad
sales rose to a record $1 billion during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's like having three half-hour hits," Eisner said in a conference call
with industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Disney rose 31 1/4 cents to $33.12 1/2 in trading on the New York
Stock Exchange before the news.
</P>
<P>
	   Iger previously was chairman of Disney's ABC Group, which included ABC, ESPN
and other properties, and president of Walt Disney International.
</P>
<P>
	   "He has overseen the ABC Television Network's turnaround," Eisner said. "At
the same time, Bob has spearheaded the reorganization of our company's
international efforts. ... As a result, our entire company is now poised for
growth in the opportunity-laden overseas markets."
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement follows the departure last week of Disney studio chief Joe
Roth, who quit to start his own film company.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth was the latest in a string of top executives to leave the company.
Others to leave in recent years include chief financial officers Steve
Bollenbach and Richard Nanula, ABC TV and radio station chief Steve Burke, and
cable programming boss Geraldine Laybourne.
</P>
<P>
	   Finding someone to fill the president's job has been an issue since the 1994
death of Eisner's longtime friend and trusted second-in-command, Frank Wells.
Wells, who died in a helicopter accident, was widely credited with handling the
day-to-day details of running Disney, freeing Eisner to focus on creative
development and long-range plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney's share price has lagged recently, reaching a 52-week high of $36.93
3/4 a few weeks ago, but trading generally below $30 during the second half of
1999. Board members reportedly have pressed Eisner to get help.
</P>
<P>
	   "Disney for some time has needed a strong No. 2 person to make sure the
trains are running on time," said Tom Wolzien, analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein
&AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have great conceptual management at the top, but a company as vast as
Disney needs somebody to make sure everybody's talking on a day-to-day basis,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> State fails disturbed children, Whitman wants to close gaps  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Huge cracks in a fragmented state system allow
troubled youth, like convicted killer Sam Manzie, to slip through without
getting the help they need, state officials said Monday.
<P>
	   It's time to seal the cracks, Gov. Christie Whitman said during her budget
address Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   That means hiring an agency to coordinate the care of these children and
changing the rules so that all families can get help, before the problems become
so acute that kids end up in the hospital - or in jail.
</P>
<P>
	   It also means eventually providing enough funding to create the services
that are currently lacking in the state's system, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has become increasingly clear, in recent years, that we can better serve
children with emotional and behavioral problems by coordinating the many
services the state offers them," Whitman said during her budget address. "The
system has become too fragmented. It's time to fix it."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman's proposal comes, in part, because of high profile cases of teen
violence that have erupted around the country, said Human Services Chief Michele
Guhl.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Manzie is New Jersey's extreme example of what happens when disturbed
children don't get the help they need.
</P>
<P>
	   At 15, Manzie strangled and raped 11-year-old Eddie Werner, who was selling
candy door-to-door in Jackson Township in 1997. His parents had tried to get him
into a residential treatment center, but a judge denied their request.
</P>
<P>
	   Child advocates say the system that failed Manzie has been fragmented for
years.
</P>
<P>
	   They also say streamlining the system won't solve all the problems, and
believe the state needs to spend more money on providing services to these
children so they don't hurt others or end up in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   "A big part of the reason that these kids' needs are not met is that these
services are not in place," said Ceil Zalkind, assistant director of the
Association for Children of New Jersey. "It isn't simply a matter of moving
around services."
</P>
<P>
	   But, Zalkind said if the state can provide a broad array of services to all
children - regardless of how they come to the state's attention - then families
could get the help they need.
</P>
<P>
	   For the new system to work, different state agencies have to work together -
and share funds. Currently, children come to the state's attention primarily
through the child protection, mental health and juvenile justice systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Children are often treated based on the "door" through which they enter the
system, said Guhl. If children come in through the juvenile courts, for example,
judges often decide where to send them based on what programs are available,
without knowing what they need.
</P>
<P>
	   "Often our kids end up in juvenile justice because it's the only game in
town," said Charlie Bednarsh, a parent advocate case manager for the Mental
Health Association of Monmouth County. "Our options are so limited that the only
place that couldn't refuse them is juvenile justice."
</P>
<P>
	   Guhl, who is working with representatives from the different departments to
put the new system together, described the task as "daunting."
</P>
<P>
	   Under Whitman's plan, the state would add $39 million in new state and
federal funding to the $167 million already spent on services for disturbed
youth.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of that money would be used to hire an agency - dubbed Care Management
Organizations - to coordinate services and create central files on each child.
The agency would also decide what additional care the child needs. The program
would begin in three counties, which have not yet been determined, Guhl said.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the next four years, funding would increase to $280 million and the
program would be statewide, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials were vague about what services would be added, but they
promised funding would be available for needed programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Bednarsh said the proposal is a significant step.
</P>
<P>
	   "Families will be helped earlier," said Bednarsh, who has negotiated the
mental health system with her son. "This is a new beginning to giving us the
options we need."

<HEADLINE> Judge Refuses Restraint of Tabloid  </HEADLINE>
    By BILL BERGSTROM AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A federal judge refused to block distribution of a new
daily tabloid that debuted at transit stops Monday, despite objections from
competitors who said the paper's relationship with the city's transit agency was
unconstitutional and unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Robert F. Kelly refused to grant the temporary
restraining order sought by the publishers of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the
Philadelphia Daily News, The New York Times and USA Today against Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   They had argued that Metro's deal with SEPTA was unconstitutional because it
allowed a government agency to assert control over a newspaper and created an
unfair advantage by allowing the free paper to be distributed where other
publications cannot be sold.
</P>
<P>
	   But Kelly said the publishers failed to show that they would suffer
"immediate and irreparable harm" unless a restraining order was granted.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision does not prevent the publishers from continuing their challenge
of SEPTA's relationship with Metro, but allows the tabloid to operate as it had
planned.
</P>
<P>
	   "They will have to weigh whether the benefits of proceeding outweigh the
negative publicity of an unseemly appearance of large, powerful news media
attempting to suppress a small competitor," said SEPTA attorney William Roberts.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Schwartz, an attorney for the newspapers challenging Metro, said he
would appeal Kelly's ruling to the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals and also
would file a request with the judge to issue an injunction pending that appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe that SEPTA's policy to allow the newspaper Metro to be
distributed in areas where no other newspapers are distributed is
unconstitutional under the First Amendment," Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the other publications could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling came hours after the inaugural edition of the 24-page Metro was
delivered to train, subway and bus stops across SEPTA's five-county area.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously we're very pleased and we're looking forward to continuing to
publish just as we did today and provide Philadelphia with a great, new
newspaper," said Jack Roberts, managing director and publisher of Metro.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a five-year contract, the paper guarantees SEPTA a minimum of $30,000
a month in advertising revenue and $15,000 a month in costs to help clean up
discarded newspapers. In exchange, the newspaper is to be distributed at 852
locations in SEPTA's coverage area.
</P>
<P>
	   Metro's competitors challenged the SEPTA contract, which states that
commuters will receive "an objective and nonpartisan newspaper" but also says
"each issue should provide SEPTA with significant editorial coverage and must
conform to SEPTA's editorial standards for content." Metro also must conform to
SEPTA advertising policies.
</P>
<P>
	   "The government has no business making its own decision as to what is fair,
honest or in good taste," Schwartz said at a hearing earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts said the editorial requirement will be met by providing the agency
with its own full page for announcements and news items in each issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "Other than that, they have absolutely no way of knowing what we are doing,"
Editor Mary Ellen Bornak said.
</P>
<P>
	   Launched six years ago in Sweden, Metro International now publishes free
daily transit system newspapers in 13 European cities and in Santiago, Chile.
The company, which is eyeing the New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco
markets, chose Philadelphia as its first U.S. city in part because SEPTA was
looking for a publication it could use to improve communication with its riders.
</P>
<P>
	   Billing itself as "a paper that could change the face of journalism in the
United States," Metro published a colorful edition Monday, with the Time
Warner-EMI merger as the lead story and a fire that killed a family of four
Sunday in suburban Levittown the top local story.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Metro's stories were two or three paragraphs. A two-page spread gave
the history of the Metro papers elsewhere. The sports section featured mostly
two-paragraph stories, plus a two-page spread on professional wrestling.
</P>
<P>
	   "Short is good for the train," said Sarah Jones as she read the paper.

<HEADLINE> 'Next Friday' Was Real No. 1 Movie  </HEADLINE>

<HEADLINE> Report by oversight panel questions Amtrak's financial progress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Amtrak supporters defended the national railway Monday
after an oversight committee released a report questioning whether it can become
self-sufficient after three decades of government subsidies.
<P>
	   The Amtrak Reform Council, in its first annual report, challenged Amtrak's
claim that it is on target to become self-sufficient by the end of fiscal year
2002, as required by Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the council's interpretation, Amtrak must save or earn an additional
$567 million by that deadline to avoid possible wholesale changes in its
operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said the report "mischaracterized the
intent of this administration" on how to measure Amtrak's progress.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak officials said the report failed to recognize the railroad's recent
progress over the last few years in increasing riders and revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the past two years we've been ahead of our business plan targets,"
Amtrak spokesman John Wolf said. "Through the first quarter of this year, we're
ahead of our business targets again. You can't argue with that success."
</P>
<P>
	   Ross Capon, executive director of the National Association of Railroad
Passengers which represents frequent rail travelers, said the financial gap
mentioned by the council could be nearly impossible to close.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you're going to raise the bar another $567 million, it seems to me it's
a no-brainer that they can't do it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sonny Hall, president of the AFL-CIO transportation trades department, said
the report should have been titled "a preliminary death wish for Amtrak."
</P>
<P>
	   Council Chairman Gil Carmichael said the report was written to raise
questions rather than offer conclusions and was not meant to be a condemnation
of Amtrak. "The council wants Amtrak to succeed," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Carmichael succeeded New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman as chairman of the
council. Whitman quit the panel after deciding it faced too many restrictions
imposed by Congress. While saying they share her frustration, other members
disagreed with her conclusion and continued their work.
</P>
<P>
	   The report was approved 8-3 by the council, with two dissenters writing
separate opinions.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarence Monin, the labor union representative, wrote that the council "has
carved out an ideological agenda for itself which ... extends far beyond what
Congress intended."
</P>
<P>
	   Jolene Molitoris, administrator of the Federal Rail Administration who
represents Slater on the council, wrote that the report "works counter to our
shared goal" of helping Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
	   The report found that Amtrak's ridership "has remained virtually unchanged"
during a decade of transportation growth in America and that Amtrak continues to
incur "significant financial losses." It questioned whether Amtrak productivity
is improving.
</P>
<P>
	   But for now, the main point of contention between the council and the
railway is over how to define the congressional mandate that Amtrak become
financially self-sustaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Using the standard it believes should apply - which excludes the cost of
equipment depreciation and some equipment overhauls - Amtrak says it is on pace
to be free of government operating subsidies by the end of fiscal year 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   But the council report said that, factoring in the disputed costs, Amtrak
will miss that mark by $567 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who chairs the Senate Commerce
subcommittee on surface transportation, said she hopes to hold hearings in March
on what standard should be apply.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak could face possible liquidation and a restructuring of rail service
if it fails to meet the 2002 deadline. But Hutchison said it would be "very
myopic to cut Amtrak off and lose (it) ... forever until we have given them
every chance to succeed."

<HEADLINE> Body found in wheel well of Northwest plane  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A mechanic found the body of a Turkish man who
apparently stowed away behind the wheel of a plane that flew from Amsterdam to
Newark International Airport on Monday, authorities said.
<P>
	   The mechanic found Riza Karadag, 38, in the wheel well of a Northwest
Airlines DC-10 after the plane made an emergency landing about 1:30 p.m. because
of smoke coming from that area, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
spokesman Steve Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the 184 passengers or 11-person crew were injured, and the smoke
problem was later determined to be unrelated to the body in the wheel well,
Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Coleman said that Karadag apparently tried to stow away in Amsterdam or
Bombay, India, where the flight originated. Authorities were still trying to
determine how and when he died.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest spokesman Jon Austin denied that Northwest Flight 57 made an
emergency landing or had a smoke problem. He said a mechanic discovered the body
after noticing a suspicious leak from the wheel well under the plane's right
wing.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy Bill Filed in Congress  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress bestowed American citizenship on Winston
Churchill and Mother Teresa, and awarded it posthumously to Raoul Wallenberg,
the Swedish diplomat who saved tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews in World War
II. But the extraordinary power has been used rarely -- and never for a minor
child against a parent's wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and a group of Florida
lawmakers put in motion a process to give citizenship to 6-year-old Cuban
refugee Elian Gonzalez, without his father's consent.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott, R-Miss., told the Senate the bill ``to grant citizenship to this young
boy'' could come up for debate as soon as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors hoped to whisk it through Congress quickly, largely to remove the
case from the jurisdiction of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which
has ruled that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba. Passage would
also render moot a federal court appeal of the INS ruling by Elian's
great-uncle, sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This moves the decision-making out of the hands of the INS and into the
hands of the (state) courts,'' Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., the chief Senate
sponsor, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Monday, Mack formally introduced the measure in the Senate, and Lott
invoked a parliamentary procedure designed to bring it before the chamber as
early as Wednesday for debate. A vote Wednesday was possible, but both sides
said they doubted final action would occur until next week at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart declined to say what President
Clinton would do if Congress passed the bill -- sign it or veto it -- but said
the White House would consider the matter after Congress acts. The president has
indicated he does not believe Congress should get involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a real danger here that this can become a political issue, that
this young boy will be a political football,'' Lockhart said. ``And I think the
president has made it very clear to everyone that they ought to stay away from
politics here and stick to what the facts and the law dictate.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Mack said, ``There has been political influence even from the beginning
in the case,'' including rallies in Havana that Mack said were orchestrated by
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Senate Judiciary Committee's top
Democrat, denounced the legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the Congress to grant citizenship to a young boy over the father's
objection makes a mockery of family values, and it hands Castro yet another
reason to portray the United States as the enemy,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Elian's grandmothers, who flew Monday from New York to Miami in
hopes of seeing their 6-year-old grandson, planned to meet Tuesday afternoon in
Washington with Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the senator's aides announced.
Dodd is a sponsor of legislation introduced every year to ease the trade embargo
with Cuba in effect for four decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the high-profile examples of Churchill, Mother Teresa and
Wallenberg, Congress has used this power rarely and selectively. Its involvement
in individual immigration cases has declined sharply over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about half a dozen private immigration bills are introduced each year,
but most of them deal with advancing a pending case, trying to prevent a
deportation or helping an American employed overseas retain citizenship. Some
examples:
</P>
<P>
	   --In July 1997, Swiss bank guard Christoph Meili won permanent residency
status. He had lost his job after saving Holocaust-era bank documents from a
shredder.
</P>
<P>
	   --In 1968, three men -- from Italy, Ireland and Germany -- who died while
fighting with American units in Vietnam, posthumously received U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   --In December 1975, Mrika Mrnacaj, a 111-year-old Albanian immigrant who
wanted to vote in a U.S. election before she died, won citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   --In 1988, Michael Wilding, the son of actress Elizabeth Taylor and a former
stepson of Sen. John Warner, R-Va., won citizenship. The British subject had
renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1971, and the bill blocked a possible
deportation on a marijuana possession conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   --In that same year, 1988, Congress rejected legislation that would have let
tennis star Ivan Lendl bypass the five-year waiting period for American
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of immigration bills fell off dramatically after the Abscam
scandal in the early 1980s when FBI agents posing as Arab sheiks asked members
of Congress to introduce private immigration bills to allow wealthy ``Arabs'' to
enter the United States in exchange for money.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining Mack and Lott in sponsoring the bill for Elian Gonzalez were Sens.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., and Bob Graham, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   In the House, Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas; and several Florida
lawmakers co-sponsored a similar bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Reps. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., and Peter
Deutsch, D-Fla, introduced a rival bill to grant Elian permanent residency
status.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will give Elian the choice, when he's old enough, to decide the
citizenship question for himself,'' Menendez said.
</P>
<P>
	   And Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., introduced a resolution -- co-sponsored by
nine Democrats and one Republican -- urging that Elian be reunited with his
father.
</P>
<P>
	   John Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said no
decision had yet been made on how to proceed in the House -- whether to try to
bring the bill to the floor directly, or to let the House Judiciary Committee
consider it first.
</P>
<P>
	   Although not a sponsor, Hastert supports the bill and ``he'll help to
advance it,'' said Feehery.

<HEADLINE> Warrant Issued for U.S. Fugitive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON (AP) -- Canadian authorities issued a nationwide arrest warrant
Monday for James Charles Kopp, a U.S. fugitive on the FBI's most wanted list for
an alleged anti-abortion murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Kopp also is wanted for questioning in at least two other shootings of
doctors who performed abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canadian warrant issued Monday charged Kopp with attempted murder in the
1995 shooting of Dr. Hugh Short, who was wounded in the elbow but survived the
attack at his home in Ancaster, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It allows us to spread his name far and wide across Canada and say that he
is wanted for attempted murder,'' said police Inspector Dave Bowen.
</P>
<P>
	   Kopp, who is from Vermont, was indicted last year in the October 1998
shooting death of Dr. Barnet Slepian, an obstetrician in Buffalo, New York. He
also is wanted in connection with the shooting of doctors in Winnipeg, Vancouver
and Rochester, New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Slepian was killed by a single gunshot fired from a wooded area through a
window of his home.
</P>
<P>
	   Kopp purports to be a devout Roman Catholic, and the majority of jobs he has
held over the past 20 years have been related to the anti-abortion movement, the
U.S. Justice Department said last year. He has been arrested more than a dozen
times during abortion protests in seven states and Italy.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI says Kopp has used 29 aliases. He was the 456th person to be placed
on the FBI's most wanted list, which began in 1950. Since then, 427 fugitives
have been taken into custody or located, 133 of them as a result of citizen
assistance, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of $650,000 is being offered in the United States for information
leading to Kopp's arrest.

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Opposes Fine in Waco Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- Government attorneys say they acted in good faith in
turning over documents in the Branch Davidian civil lawsuit and shouldn't be
penalized for what attorneys for the Davidians call stalling tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   In a filing Monday in federal court, Justice Department attorney Marie
Louise Hagen said the government opposes a $50,000 sanction requested two weeks
ago by lawyers for surviving Branch Davidians who have sued the government for
wrongful death.
</P>
<P>
	   She said plaintiffs' attorneys caused part of the delay in turning over
evidence by insisting on taking 24 depositions in December, which took
government employees away from document production.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the Branch Davidians asked U.S. District Judge Walter Smith to
fine the government, alleging Justice Department lawyers would delay the
surrender of thousands of documents until shortly before a court-imposed
deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Lead plaintiff's attorney Michael Caddell had said he feared a ``last-minute
document dump'' that would slow his preparation for the trial's scheduled start
in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Hagen said in Monday's filing that most documents were sent to
plaintiffs before the deadline, including 51 boxes of materials sent the final
weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The government sent some materials after the deadline. Ms. Hagen said
thousands of pages of Department of Defense documents still must be declassified
before being turned over.
</P>
<P>
	   The deadly standoff near Waco began Feb. 28, 1993, when federal agents
raided the rural home of Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and his followers.
Four agents and six sect members died in the gunbattle.

<HEADLINE> Rioting Breaks Out in East Timor  </HEADLINE>
   By HEATHER PATTERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Gangs of youths wielding machetes and clubs rioted
Tuesday in Dili's main marketplace, eyewitnesses said. At least four people were
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign peacekeeping troops stopped the fighting, which broke out between
two gangs of local youths. A short time later, peacekeepers and civilian police
were guarding about 30 young men sitting in the street, some still holding
knives.
</P>
<P>
	   The riot was believed to be the result of escalating tension between rival
groups in Dili and a perceived lack of policing of petty crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said up to 80 people were involved in the fighting. Authorities
confiscated weapons including machetes and clubs, which were piled in the back
of at least one vehicle.
</P>
<P>
	   Troops from the international peacekeeping force in East Timor were
conducting a house-to-house search of an area around the market, in central
Dili.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said they heard two shots fired. Ambulances took at least four
people from the scene. Witnesses said one man had serious head injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   One gang member, Ajuro, said the territory's fledgling government, known as
the CNRT, was not doing enough to protect people in the market.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every day there are problems in the market, we are not getting any
protection from the CNRT,'' Arujo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Violence in Dili has been rising recently, as the United Nations settles
into its transitional administration of the territory.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 14, East Timorese scrambling to apply for jobs offered by the United
Nations threw rocks at a small group of international peacekeepers and U.N.
civilian police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Unemployment is chronic in East Timor after its devastation last year by
militia gangs who opposed independence from Indonesia. Tens of thousands of East
Timorese live in tents and makeshift huts without money to rebuild their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   East Timor overwhelming voted in an Aug. 30 U.N.-supervised referendum to
break away from Indonesia, which invaded it in 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations took over the administration of the territory, a former
Portuguese colony, after the peacekeepers arrived on Sept. 20.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmothers Land in Miami  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers flew from New York to Miami on
Monday in hopes of meeting with their 6-year-old grandson before they return to
Cuba. But several hours after their arrival, the women were still at the airport
because the site of the get-together was in dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, and paternal grandmother,
Mariela Quintana, were invited to dinner Monday at the home of Elian's relatives
in Miami, who insisted the meeting take place there.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials said the grandmothers were hoping to meet privately with
Elian at a neutral site. There was no official word Monday evening on whether
the grandmothers would indeed visit with Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy spoke by telephone with his father in Cuba and was excited as he
prepared for his grandmothers' arrival, according to Armando Gutierrez, a
spokesman for the Miami relatives. Gutierrez said the family had bought cameras
so Elian could take pictures of his grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's heartbreaking,'' said Spencer Eig, an attorney for the Miami family.
``We still have hope.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami relatives have been caring for Elian since he was found clinging
to an inner tube off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving. His mother and 10 other
Cubans died in their ill-fated attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled that Elian must be sent
back to Cuba to live with his father, but the Miami family is suing in federal
court to block the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   And on Monday, the first day of the new congressional session, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott and Florida lawmakers introduced a bill to give Elian
U.S. citizenship, which would free him from INS jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers, who flew from Cuba to New York on Friday, had asked
Attorney General Janet Reno over the weekend to arrange a meeting with Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to the INS, an attorney for the Miami family said a dinner at
the home of Lazaro Gonzalez -- Mrs. Quintana's brother-in-law and Elian's
great-uncle -- would let the grandmothers ``see and feel for themselves how well
Elian is doing and how much he wishes to remain in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, said the family
would only allow the meeting to take place at the home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is where they live. This is where Elian lives,'' Gutierrez said. ``No
budging on that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The family planned to welcome the grandmothers with a dinner of roast pork,
mixed black beans and rice and breaded chicken cutlets, Gutierrez said. Boxes of
flowers were seen being brought into the home. About 300 people gathered outside
holding signs and flowers to welcome the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department spokesman Carole Florman said authorities were trying to
arrange a meeting at a neutral location.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The grandmothers were not comfortable with a meeting at Lazaro's house.
They want a private meeting with the boy,'' Florman said.
</P>
<P>
	   On NBC's ``Today'' show, Ms. Rodriguez asked Congress not to give the boy
U.S. citizenship and to let him return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be more painful if he gets the citizenship,'' she said, speaking
in Spanish through an interpreter. ``I'm asking the congresspeople and people of
the United States that have supported us to stop all this. Please, don't make us
suffer any longer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although they said they have not spoken to the boy in five days, Mrs.
Quintana said Elian has told her over the telephone that ``he's crazy to go back
to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He misses everything there. His school, his classmates, everybody -- his
father's love. To be able to hug and kiss his father. He tells us every day,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Rodriguez denied that her daughter wanted to come to the United States
and have Elian live here. She said she was pressured to make the trip by her
boyfriend, ``a very violent person.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's grandmothers planned to meet Tuesday afternoon in Washington with
Sen. Christopher Dodd, the senator's aides announced. The Connecticut Democrat
is a sponsor of legislation introduced every year to ease the trade embargo with
Cuba that has been in effect for four decades.

<HEADLINE> Thai Forces Storm Besieged Hospital  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW PENNINGTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RATCHABURI, Thailand (AP) -- Thai security forces stormed a hospital Tuesday
and killed nine heavily armed insurgents from a Myanmar rebel group who had
taken hundreds of patients, visitors and staff hostage.
</P>
<P>
	   No hostages were hurt during the daylong siege, but two police officers were
seriously wounded, Lt. Gen. Thaweep Suwannasingha told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's an operation to clear the situation,'' Thaweep said. ``As far as I
know, nine of hostage-takers were killed. The others fled. We are looking for
them. We cannot let any foreign troops violate our sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Approximately 450 people were believed to have been trapped in the walled,
six-acre compound when the attack was launched before dawn Monday. About that
number had been freed or escaped throughout the day and night.
</P>
<P>
	   Sporadic gunfire and occasional explosions were still ringing out over the
compound more than an hour after the operation was launched. Helicopters circled
overhead.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels belonging to God's Army, an insurgent group led by 12-year-old
twins, took the hostages in an attempt to pressure the Thai government to help
their beleaguered movement. It was not clear if the twins were involved in the
hospital raid.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels reportedly were aided by dissidents from the group that took
control of Myanmar's embassy in Bangkok last October.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, automatic weapons fire crackled and explosions thudded from inside
the hospital, possibly from grenades or mines that the hostage-takers had rigged
after taking it over.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the course of the day Monday, the rebels released patients, some
in exchange for food. Dozens of others escaped. Those freed included a pregnant
18-year-old who went into labor and an 8-year-old boy in a coma after brain
surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   The takeover began at dawn when the raiders hijacked a Thai bus near the
border with Myanmar and forced the driver to take them 45 miles to Ratchaburi.
</P>
<P>
	   About 10 rebels wearing camouflage gear and masks forced their way into
Ratchaburi provincial hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Security officials said the rebels threatened to blow up the hospital if
attacked.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past week, God's Army has come under sustained attack by troops from
Myanmar -- formerly known as Burma -- at their jungle base near the border,
driving at least 1,000 minority Karen refugees into Thailand. Thai troops have
fired artillery to prevent the fighters from crossing over the border.
</P>
<P>
	   After the hospital was seized, army commander Gen. Surayud Chulanond said
Thailand would stop its shelling, allow civilians refuge and let injured
guerrillas receive treatment in Thai hospitals. Rebels seeking refuge would have
to surrender their arms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will deal very carefully with the situation,'' he said. ``Our first
priority is every one of the hostages has to be safe.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 medical staff and 600 patients were in the hospital when it was
seized, said Dr. Kawat Suntrajarn of the Public Health Ministry. About 200 were
believed to be in the five-story administrative building and emergency room
building which were held by the insurgents.
</P>
<P>
	   Little was known about the gunmen or the situation inside the hospital until
they let in a television crew from Thai television Channel 7. They took footage
showing scores of frightened people sitting on rows of waiting-room benches and
of a masked man brandishing an assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to tell the world how Karen and Burmese refugees live during the
fighting,'' said one hostage-taker, who called himself Nui. ``We will not hurt
any hostages. We take good care of them.''
</P>
<P>
	   The government of Myanmar expressed hope that the siege would end without
bloodshed, and said the hostage-takers should be treated as terrorists by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Oct. 1, five members of a small dissident group, the Vigorous Burmese
Student Warriors, seized Myanmar's embassy in Bangkok and held dozens of
hostages for 26 hours before being flown to the border and freed. Media reports
said members of the same group is involved in the hospital takeover.

<P>
	   The dissidents then hid out with God's Army, composed mostly of ethnic
Karens and led by twins Johnny and Luther Htoo.
</P>
<P>
	   The twins told The Associated Press in December they were fighting for
democracy in their homeland, which has been ruled by military dictators since
1962. The Karens have been fighting for more autonomy for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Like most Karens, God's Army are Christians in a predominantly Buddhist
country.

<HEADLINE> New Arbitration Option for Investors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors who get into disputes with their stock brokers
can now take their cases to an independent arbitrator under a new program that
began Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The current system of settling disputes between investors and brokers has
frequently been criticized for appearing to be biased against investors.
</P>
<P>
	   That appearance of bias stems from the fact that disputes have traditionally
been settled by arbitrators selected by either the New York Stock Exchange or
the National Association of Securities Dealers, the parent of the Nasdaq Stock
Market.
</P>
<P>
	   But the brokers who are involved in a typical arbitration hearing work for
the brokerage firms that make up the memberships of the NYSE and the NASD. And
those firms' membership fees help run the two markets, including paying for a
portion of arbitration costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Consequently, many investors have argued that the traditional arbitration
system has a glaring conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new program, some investors will be able to settle their cases
before one of two independent arbitration services; the American Arbitration
Association and the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service.
</P>
<P>
	   "The premise of this program is that giving people additional choices is a
good thing," said Thomas Stipanowich, a member of the Securities Industry
Conference on Arbitration and a law professor at the University of Kentucky
College of Law.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven of the largest brokerage firms have agreed to participate. They are
Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, PaineWebber Group, Prudential
Securities, Salomon Smith Barney, Raymond James Financial and A.G. Edwards.
</P>
<P>
	   Stipanowich said taking the independent route could be more expensive for
investors since investors must help cover the costs of the hearing process.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, investors must hire a lawyer to represent them before an
independent arbitrator. Lawyers aren't required in disputes settled by
exchange-sponsored arbitrators.

<HEADLINE> Peace Protests Planned in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Antiwar activists in Colombia plan more creative
protests after a weekend ``blackout for peace'' had 18 million people turning
off their lights to condemn rebel bombings of electricity towers.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombians responded massively Sunday night to the call to sit in the dark.
</P>
<P>
	   Electricity demand during the two minute protest dropped by 15 percent, as
an estimated 3.9 million households flicked off their lights, the national
electric company reported.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first major action by a budding peace movement since last
October, when street protests turned out five million marchers in the country of
40 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   Peace activists are demanding that civilians be spared from the rigors of
the South American country's nearly 36-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Next month, they'll begin placing mailboxes around the country where
Colombians can drop anonymous letters to the warring factions.
</P>
<P>
	   People will be able to write to the guerrillas to complain about their
frequent kidnappings, or tell right-wing paramilitary groups how they feel about
massacres of unarmed civilians, activist Francisco Santos said in a radio
interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's unusual protest followed rebel bombings of 22 electricity pylons
last week that caused massive school closings and forced severe power rationing
for hundreds of thousands of Colombians.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebel National Liberation Army has vowed to continue the sabotage
campaign unless the government meets its conditions for beginning peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Texas Instruments Profits Surge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- Texas Instruments Inc. said Monday that its fourth-quarter
profits rose 69 percent due to strong demand for cellular phones and other
devices that use its computer chips.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dallas-based company said operating profit rose to $564 million, or 51
cents, from $335 million, or 31 cents a share, in the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   That beat Wall Street's expectations. Analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial had expected profit of 47 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said after removing costs from two recent acquisitions,
amortization and a tax benefit for research, operating profits rose to $538
million, 49 cents a share, from $323 million, or 30 cents, in the year-ago
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales were $2.55 billion, a 26 percent increase from the prior year.
</P>
<P>
	   For fiscal 1999, TI said pro forma net income more than doubled from $765
million, or 93 cents a share, to more than $1.5 billion, or $1.83 a share.
Revenue rose 10 percent, from $8.6 billion to nearly $9.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Chairman and chief executive Tom Engibous called 1999 "a breakthrough year
for growth and profitability at TI." He said each of the company's divisions hit
record operating margins.
</P>
<P>
	   Engibous said TI gained market share in semiconductors, digital signal
processors, or DSPs, and analog chips. DSPs drive many communications devices,
from cellular phones to high-speed modems for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it expects its semiconductor growth to continue this year
-- strong enough to buck the traditional early-year slump. In addition to cell
phones and other wireless communications devices, TI said it was looking to
benefit from strong growth in applications for high-speed Internet access,
including Internet audio, digital cameras and digital speakers.
</P>
<P>
	   TI said it will increase capital expenditures more than 40 percent, to $2
billion. Research and development is expected to increase from $1.3 billion to
$1.5 billion, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   In trading Monday, before the announcement of earnings, Texas Instruments
shares fell $1.12 1/2 to $110 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> BellSouth, Bell Atlantic Profits Up  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE MEYERSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Operating profits jumped 26.7 percent at BellSouth in the final three months
of 1999, edging most forecasts, while Bell Atlantic met expectations with a 12.3
percent gain over the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Wireless and Internet-related businesses again played an increasingly
prominent role for the two regional phone companies compared with traditional
local calling services, accounting for about a quarter of their overall
revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   BellSouth, the local phone company for most of the Southeast, reported
Monday an 8.3 percent gain in fourth-quarter revenues, driven by double-digit
growth in wireless and Web-related business.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic, which serves most of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, saw
fourth-quarter revenues rise 6.6 percent overall, compared with better than
25-percent growth in wireless and Internet-related services.
</P>
<P>
	   The Atlanta-based Baby Bell earned $1.0 billion, or 53 cents per share, in
the fourth quarter, excluding a one-time gain of $47 million related to changes
in foreign currency exchange rates that gave Bell South a net profit of $1.05
billion, or 55 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   In the same period in 1998, BellSouth posted an operating profit of $831
million, or 42 cents a share. Including one-time factors, the company earned
$1.0 billion, or 51 cents per share, in the fourth quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest profit tally surpassed forecasts of 52 cents per share among
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial, but BellSouth's stock sagged
$1.12 1/2 a share to $45.93 3/4 on Monday amid a steep selloff on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, revenues totaled $6.68 billion, up from $6.17 billion in the fourth
quarter of 1998. Internet and e-commerce revenues jumped 30.1 percent to $760
million, while the company's domestic wireless business grew 18.6 percent to
$836 million.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, BellSouth's net income was $3.44 billion, or $1.80 per
share, compared with 1998's tally of $3.53 billion, or $1.78 per share.
Excluding one-time charges, the company had an operating profit of $3.83
billion, or $2 per share, compared with $3.26 billion, or $1.64 per share, in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues for the year were a record $25.22 billion, a gain of 9.1 percent
from $23.12 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York-based company earned $1.22 billion, or 77 cents per share, in
the three months ended Dec. 31, excluding $499 million in one-time acquisition
costs that left Bell Atlantic with a net profit to $719 million, or 45 cents per
share.
</P>
<P>
	   Those results, which matched most Wall Street forecasts, compare with Bell
Atlantic's operating profit of $1.06 billion, or 69 cents a share, earned in the
fourth quarter of 1998, also excluding one-time factors.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter revenues totaled $8.61 billion, up from 8.08 a year earlier.
Wireless revenues grew 27.5 percent to $1.6 billion, and while data and other
Web-related business grew 26.2 percent to nearly $800 million. By contrast,
domestic telecom revenues rose just 3.5 percent from year-earlier levels.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Bell Atlantic earned $4.76 billion, or $3.01 per share,
excluding one-time factors. In 1998, Bell Atlantic posted an operating profit of
$4.29 billion, or $2.72 a share a year ago. Including all one-time factors, last
year's net profit totaled $4.20 billion, or $2.65 per share, compared with
1998's total of $2.93 billion, or $1.86 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues totaled $33.17 billion in 1999, up 5.1 percent from the prior
year's tally of $31.57 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   In reporting its latest results, Bell Atlantic reiterated the company's
prediction that the acquisition of GTE will gain all needed government approvals
and close near the end of the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic's shares edged higher on Monday, rising 6 1/4 cents to $60.12
1/2 a share on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmothers Land in Miami  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers flew from New York to Miami on
Monday in hopes of meeting with their 6-year-old grandson before they return to
Cuba. But several hours after their arrival, the women had not seen the boy
because the site of the get-together was in dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, and paternal grandmother,
Mariela Quintana, were invited to dinner Monday at the home of Elian's relatives
in Miami, who insisted the meeting take place there.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials said the grandmothers were hoping to meet privately with
Elian at a neutral site.
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to resolve the dispute, a group including Elian's two
great-uncles and Ms. Rodriguez's sister agreed to meet the women at the airport,
but they were not bringing Elian along, family spokesman Armando Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy had spoken by telephone with his father in Cuba and was excited as
he prepared for his grandmothers' arrival, Gutierrez said. The family had bought
cameras so Elian could take pictures of his grandmothers, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's heartbreaking,'' said Spencer Eig, an attorney for the Miami family.
``We still have hope.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami relatives have been caring for Elian since he was found clinging
to an inner tube off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving. His mother and 10 other
Cubans died in their ill-fated attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled that Elian must be sent
back to Cuba to live with his father, but the Miami family is suing in federal
court to block the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   And on Monday, the first day of the new congressional session, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott and Florida lawmakers introduced a bill to give Elian
U.S. citizenship, which would free him from INS jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers, who flew from Cuba to New York on Friday, had asked
Attorney General Janet Reno over the weekend to arrange a meeting with Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to the INS, an attorney for the Miami family said a dinner at
the home of Lazaro Gonzalez -- Mrs. Quintana's brother-in-law and Elian's
great-uncle -- would let the grandmothers ``see and feel for themselves how well
Elian is doing and how much he wishes to remain in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez said the family would only allow the meeting to take place at the
home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is where they live. This is where Elian lives,'' Gutierrez said. ``No
budging on that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The family planned to welcome the grandmothers with a dinner of roast pork,
mixed black beans and rice and breaded chicken cutlets, Gutierrez said. Boxes of
flowers were seen being brought into the home. About 300 people gathered outside
holding signs and flowers to welcome the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department spokesman Carole Florman said authorities were trying to
arrange a meeting at a neutral location.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The grandmothers were not comfortable with a meeting at Lazaro's house.
They want a private meeting with the boy,'' Florman said.
</P>
<P>
	   On NBC's ``Today'' show, Ms. Rodriguez asked Congress not to give the boy
U.S. citizenship and to let him return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be more painful if he gets the citizenship,'' she said, speaking
in Spanish through an interpreter. ``I'm asking the congresspeople and people of
the United States that have supported us to stop all this. Please, don't make us
suffer any longer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although they said they have not spoken to the boy in five days, Mrs.
Quintana said Elian has told her over the telephone that ``he's crazy to go back
to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He misses everything there. His school, his classmates, everybody -- his
father's love. To be able to hug and kiss his father. He tells us every day,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Rodriguez denied that her daughter wanted to come to the United States
and have Elian live here. She said she was pressured to make the trip by her
boyfriend, ``a very violent person.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's grandmothers planned to meet Tuesday in Washington with members of
Congress, including Sen. Christopher Dodd, the senator's aides announced. The
Connecticut Democrat is a sponsor of legislation introduced every year to ease
the trade embargo with Cuba that has been in effect for four decades.

<HEADLINE> Countries Ask WTO for More Time  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    GENEVA (AP) -- Eight developing countries on Monday asked the World Trade
Organization to give them more time to phase out laws aimed at protecting
domestic producers from foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Most wanted more time before they abolish rules requiring automobile
manufacturers to use a certain proportion of domestically produced parts. The
agreement to scrap the regulations came into force in 1995, but poorer countries
were allowed to ask for an extension until Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The Philippines, Mexico, Argentina and Malaysia asked for between four and
seven years' grace from the provisions of the WTO agreement which forces them to
abandon the requirement for "local content."
</P>
<P>
	   Their representatives told the WTO's council on trade in goods that economic
problems mean that they still need the rule.
</P>
<P>
	   The Philippines said that if it changed its laws immediately, around 15,000
jobs could be lost, while Malaysia said 200 of its companies could go out of
business.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombia said rules requiring food processors to use local harvests were
necessary to avoid farmers planting illegal drug crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Romania, Pakistan and Chile also asked for extensions.
</P>
<P>
	   The 135-nation WTO meeting of ministers in Seattle last month came close to
agreeing to extend the period for all developing countries by another two years,
but the meeting ended in disarray without any decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   Developing countries are hoping a meeting of the WTO general council on Feb.
7 will agree to the blanket extension, but rich countries with major automobile
industries -- including the United States, the European Union and Japan -- said
Monday requests should be considered on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
	   The chairman of the council on trade in goods, New Zealand Ambassador Roger
Farrell, told the members they should go away and begin consultations between
interested parties. No date was for reconvening the meeting.

<HEADLINE> For the Democrats: Gore promises to fight, Bradley sees fresh  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Playing the prizefighter, Vice President Al Gore
clocked a minute-by-minute countdown to Monday night's first test of his
retooled candidacy. Bill Bradley promised a "fresh start" in the White House.
<P>
	   From charging down a gantlet of pompom girls with his fists raised, to
turning his fire on the Republicans, Gore seemed in general election spirits
even as he urged his supporters on in the Democratic caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm a fighter," he said when asked Monday at lunch what sets him apart.
"For 23 years I have been unafraid to take on special interests." Questioned by
reporters as he ate at the Iowa Machine Shed diner in Davenport, Gore said his
experience also was important.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley told a raucous rally of mostly students at Iowa State University in
Ames that he was still fighting, too. "We're going to surprise a lot of people
across this country," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   His caucus-day activities were as low-decibel - but dogged - as the quiet
insurgency he mounted 13 months ago against President Clinton's favored
successor. The former senator from New Jersey, drumming up votes in a round
robin of local TV interviews just before caucus start time, promised to "set us
on the right path for generations to come."
</P>
<P>
	   No matter how he fared against Gore here, Bradley said he had the bankroll
to fight on for the nomination in next week's New Hampshire primary and in the
cluster of state primaries on March 7, which he called the first "national
primary."
</P>
<P>
	   House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, a Gore booster, voiced some
concern about a protracted nomination fight. "For the sake of winning the House,
we would like to coalesce as soon as possible, coalesce resources. But I would
never tell any candidate that they should get out," said Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
	   At Iowa school gymnasiums, union halls and diners in the final days before
voting, Gore checked his watch and reminded supporters of the number of hours
and minutes remaining to victory. He railed against his Republican opponents,
saying their tax cut plans threaten a return to recession.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, consistently trailing in polls here, pumped as much as $2 million
into the state and spent most of the month here. But he did not begin drawing
real crowds - comparable to the 400 or 500 that greeted Gore at every turn -
until the final days.
</P>
<P>
	   Precious days in the final week were consumed by questions about Bradley's
heartbeat irregularity and whether he had tarnished his "non-politician" appeal
by going after Gore on decades-old tobacco votes and Gore's tactics in his
failed 1988 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, Bradley campaigned here on the pillars of his campaign:
universal access to health insurance, alleviation of child poverty, gun control
and campaign finance reform. He said he wanted to "restore some honor and trust
to the system."
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Edwards, a Des Moines-area computer programmer, said he favored Bradley
because he "seems more of an anti-politician than Gore, who's been in the thick
of it for the last eight years."
</P>
<P>
	   Medical student Erin Roylance, waiting outside Gore headquarters for a
glimpse of the candidate and his wife, Tipper, said Gore's time in the White
House "gives him name recognition and makes him the best Democratic candidate to
win for us" in November.
</P>
<P>
	   It was in the thick of Clinton's impeachment that Gore launched his race and
then publicly stumbled as he sought distance from the president, a meaningful
message, a loyal staff, an appealing wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore acknowledged his rocky start. "Total immersion in this process is
something that I think has been very good for me. I have been able to
communicate more effectively because of what I've learned from the people of
Iowa and New Hampshire," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The past few days brought dozens of White House aides and former aides onto
the campaign trail to pitch in for Gore. Officials said the government workers
were in Iowa on personal vacation time.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, Gore sought to turn his resume from the White House, and from
the Senate and House before that, to his advantage. At the same time, he sought
to paint Bradley as a quitter in Democratic fights (he resigned his Senate seat
amid Clinton's battles with the Republican Congress) and a leader who would
focus only on his pet priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   "I haven't turned my back or walked away from any fight over the past seven
years," he said.

<HEADLINE> Croatian Voters Choosing President  </HEADLINE>
   By EUGENE BRCIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- In a contest seen as a turning point in Croatia's
modern history, Croats voted overwhelmingly Monday for two candidates who
pledged to make a clean break from the autocratic policies of the late President
Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
	   With more than 96 percent of the ballots counted, the government election
commission said Stipe Mesic led the nine-candidate field with 40 percent of the
vote. The 65-year-old lawyer was considered a dark horse just weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Since an absolute majority is necessary for victory, Mesic will face Drazen
Budisa, who trailed with about 28 percent, in a runoff Feb. 7. Budisa is the
junior leader of the center-left coalition that won the Jan. 3 parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Granic, the candidate of Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union, finished third
with 21 percent. A former foreign minister, he had distanced himself from the
autocratic policies of Tudjman and was considered the likely successor in the
weeks preceding Tudjman's death last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Mesic led the field going into the polls, espousing a clean break from
Tudjman's authoritarianism, which had left the country internationally isolated
and deep in economic recession.
</P>
<P>
	   Such an agenda, if carried out, is likely to put the country on to the fast
track towards integration into financial and security structures like the
European Union and NATO, which shunned Croatia during the Tudjman years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People recognized my message,'' a confident Mesic said before mingling
with hundreds of supporters who packed a rented hall in downtown Zagreb and
euphorically cheered the first unofficial results.
</P>
<P>
	   Budisa congratulated Mesic for the first round win, but looked ahead to the
next race.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I announce a fierce competition and a victory at the end of these
elections,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of 4.2 million voters, including citizens in 48 countries abroad,
were eligible to cast ballots in about 6,900 polling stations across the
boomerang-shaped Balkan country.

	   Sixty-four percent of the voters cast ballots, despite snow flurries in much
of the country. The turnout was higher only at a 1991 referendum on Croatia's
independence and in parliamentary elections earlier this month, when Croats
ousted Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union by a landslide, ending the
nationalist party's almost decade-long grip on power.

	   As president of the junior partner in the victorious parliamentary
coalition, Budisa seemed a likely pick for voters seeking to bolster the group's
goals. Opinion polls taken days before the contest, however, showed that he
trailed Mesic, the last president of former Yugoslavia's rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   Political analysts and psychologists attribute Mesic's popularity to his
tongue-in-cheek manner and candid language -- a striking contrast to Tudjman's
somber demeanor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our new president must be honest -- that's all,'' said Tomislav Oresic, a
28-year-old doctor, alluding to widespread corruption and nepotism that
characterized Tudjman's tenure.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen early Tuesday in light
trading ahead of a key speech by the U.S. Federal Reserve chief. Japanese stocks
fell following sharp drops on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 105.68 yen, up 0.76 yen from late Monday in Tokyo but
unchanged from its late Monday level in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 157.47 points, or 0.83
percent, to 18,899.24 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Monday, the average
closed up 178.62 points, or 0.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 13.52 points, or 0.82 percent, to 1,634.44. The TOPIX closed up
20.82 points, or 1.28 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar would move in a narrow range
amid a lack of new incentives ahead of a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan before the Senate Budget Committee later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said the dollar was supported somewhat as G7 finance ministers made
tepid remarks about bringing down the yen after the weekend meeting in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese officials fear that a strong yen could hamper the nation's economy
as it struggles to recover from its worst slowdown in 50 years. A higher yen
makes Japanese exports more expensive.

<HEADLINE> New York, 15 other states sue Publishers Clearing House  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Publishers Clearing House, which sends its "Prize
Patrol" minivan out on Super Bowl Sunday to surprise winners, got a jolt of its
own Monday as New York and 15 other states sued it alleging deceptive
advertising.
<P>
	   The Port Washington, N.Y., company which sells magazine subscriptions and
other merchandise through direct mail solicitation had been negotiating a
settlement with the states over its practices when it was informed that it had
been sued.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are dismayed and disappointed that New York has chosen to abandon
negotiation and proceed with legal action against our company," said Bill Low,
lawyer and senior vice president for the sweepstakes company.
</P>
<P>
	   New Mexico Attorney General Patricia Madrid said states had to file suit
against the company "to put an end to its false, misleading and deceptive
mailings that induce New Mexicans, and particularly our senior citizens, to
purchase items that they do not truly want or need."
</P>
<P>
	   Also suing Monday were Colorado, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey,
Illinois, Ohio, Oklahoma, Vermont, Oregon, Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
Louisiana, Georgia and California.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a great day for New Jersey consumers," said Mark Herr, director of the
New Jersey's Division of Consumer Affairs. "We have been increasingly concerned
about misleading come-ons in sweepstakes land. We know that many people are
duped by them. We know that our senior citizens are especially vulnerable to
them."
</P>
<P>
	   "We want them to stop the bad act. We want them to be sanctioned - that
means penalities - for their bad act, and we want them to change the way they do
business," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuits were filed individually in local courts in each state. However,
New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said the lawsuits were sparked by a
multi-state investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "This sweepstakes company has engaged in an elaborate scheme to increase its
bottom line, financed on the backs of some who can least afford it: the
elderly," Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   That brings the number of states suing Publishers Clearing House to 25.
Arizona, Texas, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Washington
and Wisconsin already have sued the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher agreed with Spitzer. 'The
company's alleged illegal business practices shamelessly prey on older
Pennsylvanians who spend a lot of money on magazines and other items ...
convinced that the Prize Patrol is about to deliver thousands of dollars to
their door," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Publisher's Clearing House for years has been targeting the elderly and the
gullible with a blizzard of deceptive mailers that are really disguised sales
pitches," California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Publishers Clearing House spokesman Chris Fisher denied it targets senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   "Publishers Clearing House does not target the elderly," he said. "We don't
even know the ages of our consumers. ... Our market is the U.S. population."
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent lawsuit accuses the company of:
</P>
<P>
	   - Faking handwritten notes, internal memos, government documents and
personal letters to get people to apply quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   - Hiding bulk-rate mailings with official looking symbols and large bold
print warnings.
</P>
<P>
	   - Routinely asking customers for information that would only be needed if
they actually had won a prize.
</P>
<P>
	   - Requesting information for customers who order magazines that it does not
ask from people who do not order magazines.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer and the other attorneys general want Publishers Clearing House
banned from using its current promotions and for the company to pay unspecified
restitution.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer also wants civil penalties under the state's deceptive acts statute
and the state Prize Award Scheme Law, as well as an additional $10,000 for
violations of a state law enacted to penalize frauds perpetrated against the
elderly.

<HEADLINE> ABC's Iger Named No. 2 at Disney  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- ABC network chief Robert Iger was named second in
command at The Walt Disney Co. Monday as Michael Eisner reorganized the
company's top management.
</P>
<P>
	   Iger, 48, was promoted to president and chief operating officer, filling a
position left vacant since Hollywood dealmaker Michael Ovitz left in 1996 after
a futile attempt to share power with Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The changes beef up Disney's top management after more than a year of
slumping share prices and executive defections.
</P>
<P>
	   Eisner also announced the promotion of chief strategic officer Peter Murphy
and chief financial officer Thomas O. Staggs to senior executive vice
presidents.
</P>
<P>
	   They will become members of a new executive management committee that will
include Eisner, Iger, Disney vice chairman Sanford M. Litvack and heads of
individual business units.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney also released a preview of first quarter results that showed net
income rose 7 percent to $515 million, or 25 cents per share, excluding its
Go.com Internet business. Official results will be released in February.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts applauded Iger's appointment and the other changes.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's an extremely talented manager, very well rounded, very well liked and
respected," said Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. "They're
putting a structure in place that should be viewed positively."
</P>
<P>
	   The management changes should reassure investors and analysts who worried by
recent departures, said Doug Christopher, an analyst with Crowell Weedon.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it adds some depth and experience to the management team, and
credibility," he said. "I think the company is turning around. This is a company
that's got a lot of the right things happening."
</P>
<P>
	   Disney announced in November that it planned to issue a separate stock for
Go.com, which is expected to yield a "substantial loss" in the first quarter due
to the cost of acquiring the Internet company Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings increase exceeded Wall Street expectations and reflected the
strong performance of ABC, which benefited from better ad sales and the
popularity of the thrice-weekly game show "Who Wants to be a Millionaire." Ad
sales rose to a record $1 billion during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's like having three half-hour hits," Eisner said in a conference call
with industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Disney rose 31 1/4 cents to $33.12 1/2 in trading on the New York
Stock Exchange before the news.
</P>
<P>
	   Iger previously was chairman of Disney's ABC Group, which included ABC, ESPN
and other properties, and president of Walt Disney International.
</P>
<P>
	   He joined Disney when the company acquired Capital Cities/ABC in 1996. He
went to work for ABC in 1974 and spent 12 years with ABC sports. Iger had been
named to become Capital Cities/ABC's chief executive officer when Disney
purchased the company.
</P>
<P>
	   "He has overseen the ABC Television Network's turnaround," Eisner said. "At
the same time, Bob has spearheaded the reorganization of our company's
international efforts. ... As a result, our entire company is now poised for
growth in the opportunity-laden overseas markets."
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement follows the departure last week of Disney studio chief Joe
Roth, who quit to start his own film company.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth was the latest in a string of top executives to leave the company.
Others to leave in recent years include chief financial officers Steve
Bollenbach and Richard Nanula, ABC TV and radio station chief Steve Burke, and
cable programming boss Geraldine Laybourne.
</P>
<P>
	   Finding someone to fill the president's job has been an issue since the 1994
death of Eisner's longtime friend and trusted second-in-command, Frank Wells.
Wells, who died in a helicopter accident, was widely credited with handling the
day-to-day details of running Disney, freeing Eisner to focus on creative
development and long-range plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney's share price has lagged recently, reaching a 52-week high of $36.93
3/4 a few weeks ago, but trading generally below $30 during the second half of
1999. Board members reportedly have pressed Eisner to get help.
</P>
<P>
	   "Disney for some time has needed a strong No. 2 person to make sure the
trains are running on time," said Tom Wolzien, analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein
&AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have great conceptual management at the top, but a company as vast as
Disney needs somebody to make sure everybody's talking on a day-to-day basis,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Sharpton, Amadou Diallo's parents press for federal monitor of  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The No. 2 official at the Justice Department on Monday
told the Rev. Al Sharpton and the parents of Amadou Diallo that federal
officials would monitor the trial of four officers charged with gunning down the
unarmed immigrant.
<P>
	   But Assistant Attorney General Eric Holder did not say specifically what
kind of federal scrutiny the racially-charged case would face, according to
those at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "We received no assurances except that we would receive a thorough review,"
Sharpton said outside the Justice Department after a meeting that lasted more
than an hour with Holder and Bill Lan Lee, head of the Attorney General's Civil
Rights Division. Rep. Charles Rangel, D-Harlem, and handful of church officials
joined the Diallo family and Sharpton at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton and other black activists are upset that the trial of the four
white police officers accused of firing 41 bullets at Diallo was moved from the
Bronx, where the shooting took place, to Albany. Attorneys for the cops had
argued the wave of pretrial publicity would make it impossible to find an
impartial jury in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sharpton said Monday he was optimistic because of the attention given to
the case by Holder, Attorney General Janet Reno's top assistant.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Conason, a lawyer representing the Diallo family, said the hope is to
have a Justice Department official in the courtroom monitoring testimony in case
federal officials decide to pursue civil rights charges against the four
officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's shooting touched off weeks of angry protests in New York City, with
citizens alleging widespread brutality against minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection is set to begin in the case next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton said although he said he opposed moving the trial upstate, he had
no quarrel with Albany or the Albany police.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not against the people of Albany. They did not make this decision,"
he said. "What the courts decided should not be an excuse to divide the people
in Albany against the people of New York City."
</P>
<P>
	   He said protests at the trial would include organized prayer and he planned
to meet with Albany church groups Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Plainclothes officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Richard Murphy and
Kenneth Boss were indicted on second-degree murder charges in March after they
fired 41 bullets at Diallo while searching a Bronx neighborhood for violent
criminals. Attorneys for the officers claimed their clients mistakenly believed
the street vendor, a West African immigrant, was reaching for a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   While the meeting took place Monday about 40 protesters bussed in from New
York City marched outside of the Justice Department and chanted "How many shots?
41"
</P>
<P>
	   About a dozen District of Columbia police officers arrived on motorcycles to
monitor the protest but left after less than 10 minutes to cheers from the
demonstrators.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmothers Leave Miami  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers flew to Miami on Monday in hopes
of meeting with their 6-year-old grandson, but the women left town without
seeing the boy because of a dispute over the site of the get-together.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, and paternal grandmother,
Mariela Quintana, were invited to dinner Monday at the home of Elian's relatives
in Miami, who insisted the meeting take place there.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers wanted to meet privately with Elian at a neutral site.
After flying in from New York, the grandmothers spent about five hours at the
airport before getting back on the plane and taking off. They had meetings
planned in Washington with members of Congress on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers left as a group including Elian's two great-uncles and Ms.
Rodriguez's sister were heading to meet the women at the airport. They were not
bringing Elian along, and Spencer Eig, an attorney for the Miami relatives, said
they were told the grandmothers had no interest in meeting with the
great-uncles.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of Churches, who
sponsored the women's trip, said Monday night the grandmothers were scared to
come to Miami because of protests by Cuban-Americans who want Elian to stay in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian had spoken by telephone with his father in Cuba and was excited as he
prepared for his grandmothers' arrival, family spokesman Armando Gutierrez said.
The family had bought cameras so Elian could take pictures of his grandmothers,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami relatives have been caring for Elian since he was found clinging
to an inner tube off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving. His mother and 10 other
Cubans died in their ill-fated attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled that Elian must be sent
back to Cuba to live with his father, but the Miami family is suing in federal
court to block the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   And on Monday, the first day of the new congressional session, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott and Florida lawmakers introduced a bill to give Elian
U.S. citizenship, which would free him from INS jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers, who flew from Cuba to New York on Friday, had asked
Attorney General Janet Reno over the weekend to arrange a meeting with Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to the INS, an attorney for the Miami family said a dinner at
the home of Lazaro Gonzalez -- Mrs. Quintana's brother-in-law and Elian's
great-uncle -- would let the grandmothers ``see and feel for themselves how well
Elian is doing and how much he wishes to remain in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez said the family would only allow the meeting to take place at the
home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is where they live. This is where Elian lives,'' Gutierrez said. ``No
budging on that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The family had planned to welcome the grandmothers with a dinner of roast
pork, mixed black beans and rice and breaded chicken cutlets, Gutierrez said.
Boxes of flowers were seen being brought into the home. About 300 people
gathered outside holding signs and flowers to welcome the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department spokesman Carole Florman said authorities had tried to
arrange a meeting at a neutral location.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The grandmothers were not comfortable with a meeting at Lazaro's house.
They want a private meeting with the boy,'' Florman said.
</P>
<P>
	   On NBC's ``Today'' show, Ms. Rodriguez asked Congress not to give the boy
U.S. citizenship and to let him return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be more painful if he gets the citizenship,'' she said, speaking
in Spanish through an interpreter. ``I'm asking the congresspeople and people of
the United States that have supported us to stop all this. Please, don't make us
suffer any longer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although they said they have not spoken to the boy in five days, Mrs.
Quintana said Elian has told her over the telephone that ``he's crazy to go back
to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He misses everything there. His school, his classmates, everybody -- his
father's love. To be able to hug and kiss his father. He tells us every day,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Rodriguez denied that her daughter wanted to come to the United States
and have Elian live here. She said she was pressured to make the trip by her
boyfriend, ``a very violent person.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's grandmothers planned to meet Tuesday in Washington with members of
Congress, including Sen. Christopher Dodd, the senator's aides announced. The
Connecticut Democrat is a sponsor of legislation introduced every year to ease
the trade embargo with Cuba that has been in effect for four decades.

<HEADLINE> Warrant Issued for U.S. Fugitive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Ontario (AP) -- Canadian authorities issued a nationwide arrest
warrant Monday for James Charles Kopp, a U.S. fugitive on the FBI's most wanted
list for an alleged anti-abortion murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Kopp also is wanted for questioning in at least two other shootings of
doctors who performed abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canadian warrant issued Monday charged Kopp with attempted murder in the
1995 shooting of Dr. Hugh Short, who was wounded in the elbow but survived the
attack at his home in Ancaster, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It allows us to spread his name far and wide across Canada and say that he
is wanted for attempted murder,'' said police Inspector Dave Bowen.
</P>
<P>
	   Kopp, who is from Vermont, was indicted last year in the October 1998
shooting death of Dr. Barnet Slepian, an obstetrician in Buffalo, New York. He
also is wanted in connection with the shooting of doctors in Winnipeg, Vancouver
and Rochester, New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Slepian was killed by a single gunshot fired from a wooded area through a
window of his home.
</P>
<P>
	   Kopp purports to be a devout Roman Catholic, and the majority of jobs he has
held over the past 20 years have been related to the anti-abortion movement, the
U.S. Justice Department said last year. He has been arrested more than a dozen
times during abortion protests in seven states and Italy.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI says Kopp has used 29 aliases. He was the 456th person to be placed
on the FBI's most wanted list, which began in 1950. Since then, 427 fugitives
have been taken into custody or located, 133 of them as a result of citizen
assistance, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of $650,000 is being offered in the United States for information
leading to Kopp's arrest.

<HEADLINE> State suspends tougher emissions test as Parsons probes abound  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The Whitman administration on Monday suspended the
tougher auto emissions test at centralized inspection stations across New
Jersey, as lawmakers and the State Commission of Investigation vowed independent
probes of the state's $400 million deal to have a private company operate the
lanes.
<P>
	   Motorists instead will be given the old emissions test.
</P>
<P>
	   The tougher test was "suspended indefinitely" by Transportation Commissioner
James Weinstein as a time-saving measure because more than half of the motorists
whose inspections are due by the end of the month have not yet shown up,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The time-savings, per car, will probably be about two to three minutes.
State officials, however, said they need to do something to speed up the lines
with an expected crush of last-minute motorists.
</P>
<P>
	   The move comes amid growing controversy over a tougher auto emissions system
that forced long lines and long waiting times. The system was enacted a month
ago despite persistent memos from a subcontractor warning of a DMV disaster. The
state's consultant on the deal also said state officials were warned of
potential problems. The system has been bedeviled with computer, equipment and
personnel problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman last week ordered Attorney General John Farmer to
launch an investigation into why the warnings of subcontractor Sierra Research
of Pasadena, Calif., went unheeded. Whitman and Weinstein maintain they knew
nothing of the warnings until The Star-Ledger of Newark prodded the memos from
state officials last week.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials said the tougher emissions test, which looks for
asthma-causing smog, were suspended on Monday and replaced with the old tailpipe
test, which basically looks for carbon monoxide. The enhanced test was launched
to help New Jersey meet its federal mandate to clean the air.
</P>
<P>
	   The state made no announcements about the move. Officials merely responded
to reporters' questions late in the day, explaining they were more focused on
Whitman's state budget speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Dana Sullivan, spokesman for the Division of Motor Vehicles, said the state
is making the switch because as of the end of last week, fewer than half of the
200,000 cars the state anticipated at the centralized lanes for January had
shown up for an inspection.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to go to the curb idle test to get through this very busy
period," said Sullivan, adding that most of the motorists show up in the last
week of any given month.
</P>
<P>
	   The order is for the centralized inspection lanes only, officials said. That
means motorists who pay private garages for inspections will still take the
tougher test.
</P>
<P>
	   The new inspection process can take up to five times longer than the old
one, but two of the three tests are for safety inspections. The switch from the
tougher emissions test to the old tailpipe test is likely to save at most two to
three minutes per car, officials said. Sullivan said this "will multiply" and
therefore cut down on lines.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan said federal Environmental Protection Agency officials were
apprised of the state's action, but did not say if they approved it. EPA
officials could not be reached for comment late Monday. The EPA had threatened
New Jersey with a loss of federal highway funds if it did not implement its
long-stalled inspection process last month. However, EPA officials did allow New
Jersey to make some adjustments to iron out the problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Carl Golden, a spokesman with Parsons Infrastructure and Technology, the
private vendor operating the stations, said the company "will comply."
</P>
<P>
	   Golden added that Parsons engineers say moving to the old test "is not going
to save any time at all. The wait times between the old test and the new test
have been fairly consistent."
</P>
<P>
	   The state on Friday announced it would pay Parsons $4 less an inspection -
the agreed-to rate for the old emissions test - because officials were not
satisfied with the contractor's performance. However, serious questions have
been raised about whether the Whitman administration ignored warnings in order
to make sure the state made its deadline for the program. Parsons Infrastructure
claims state demands for change in computer software helped prompt the problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers have called for reviews that are independent of the Whitman
administration investigation. The State Commission of Investigation on Monday
announced it would look into "the events and process leading up to the drafting
of the contract" and the awarding of the deal to Parsons, which was the only
bidder.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a good thing for the people of New Jersey to have an independent
examination of how things went so wrong in the face of so many warning signs,"
said Sen. John Lynch, D-Middlesex, who asked for the SCI probe.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Democratic Leader Richard Codey and Assembly Democratic Leader Joseph
Doria repeated their demands for an independent legislative inquest employing
the Legislature's subpoena powers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The people of New Jersey want answers about this monumental screw-up,"
Codey said.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, R-Union, said he intends to create a
legislative committee to look into the Parsons deal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want a Legislative response to this," DiFrancesco said. "We need to have
a committee look at what has happened here."
</P>
<P>
	   DiFrancesco on Monday said he has drafted a bill that would suspend
inspections altogether until Parsons can get the system running smoothly.

<HEADLINE> Italian Tenor Carlo Cossutta Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    UDINE, Italy (AP) -- Carlo Cossutta, an Italian tenor renowned for his
performances in Giuseppe Verdi's "Otello," has died. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
	   Cossutta, who had liver cancer, died Saturday in a hospital in the northern
Italian city of Udine, his wife Nidia said. Cossutta won acclaim for singing the
lead in Franco Zeffirelli's staging of Verdi's "Otello" at London's Covent
Garden.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Trieste, northern Italy, Cossutta emigrated to Argentina where he
made his opera debut at the Teatro Colon theater in Buenos Aires in 1948.
Cossutta first performed in Europe in 1962.
</P>
<P>
	   His other career highlights included a recording of Verdi's "Requiem"
conducted by Herbert von Karajan, and a recording of "Otello" conducted by Sir
Georg Solti.

<HEADLINE> Missing Plane Found in Andes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MENDOZA, Argentina (AP) -- A team climbing the Andes mountains has discovered
the remains of an English plane reported missing 53 years ago, authorities said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Small parts of the plane, a Lancaster model popular during World War II,
were found in near perfect condition in a frigid, high mountain area, said
Alberto Quinones, an army official. Members of the Argentine army made up a part
of the team that recovered the remains.
</P>
<P>
	   The bodies of three passengers were also found, well-preserved by the
year-round freezing temperatures atop the Tupungato mountain near the
Argentine-Chilean border, Quinones said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's fuselage, its propeller, pieces of clothing, and the bodies were
found at 18,000, he said. A five-person expedition made the discovery last
Wednesday, but it was first made public Monday, Quinones added.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was reported missing in August of 1947 after it disappeared during
a heavy storm while en route to Santiago, Chile from Buenos Aires. It wasn't
clear how many passengers were on board when the plane went down, authorities
said, but the Lancaster plane was normally outfitted to carry 14 people.
</P>
<P>
	   An Argentine federal judge has ordered DNA tests be performed to determine
the identities of the three passengers.

Quadruple Transplant Patient Recovers
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- In a voice strangled with emotion, the stepfather of a
20-year-old Victoria musician who received four new organs over the weekend said
Monday his son believed the risky procedure was his only chance to live.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was extremely keen to have the surgery,'' Derek Kasper said of son
Noah, who was listed in critical but stable condition at Toronto General
Hospital. ``He recognized it was his chance for a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
	   In an operation that took two days to perform and required 90 units of
blood, Noah received a new stomach, liver, pancreas, and small bowel.
</P>
<P>
	   Derek Kasper said his son could not yet speak, but was responsive to
questions as he recovered from the complex procedure, performed a handful of
times in Ontario, and only 40 times worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The transplant involved removing all of the remaining small bowel, the
pancreas, the stomach and the liver,'' said Dr. David Grant. ``Then we replaced
these organs ... We would expect for the (new) organs to function normally and
allow him to eat and return to a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Noah's ordeal began last summer when he developed a freak blood clot in his
leg. The clot ultimately led to multiple organ failure and Noah was fed through
a tube because he was unable to eat normally.

Warning Issued on Deceptive Car Dealers
</P>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- An alarming number of car buyers are being deceived by
dealerships, sometimes even before they step on the lot, a consumer advocacy
group said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   It said 60 percent of car dealerships got a failing grade in overall
customer satisfaction when visited by Automobile Protection Association
researchers who posed as shoppers.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, which was funded by Industry Canada, will be featured Tuesday
night on CTV's W-FIVE.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers visited 45 dealerships in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Montreal
and Quebec City last fall. They were looking for a variety of popular cars and
minivans.
</P>
<P>
	   In many cases, ads left out important information, the advertised cars were
not at the dealership, or they were selling at a higher price.
</P>
<P>
	   Some used cars owned by rental companies were passed off as ``executive
driven'', while some dealerships charged excessive administrative fees.

U.S. FBI Suspect Sought in Canada
</P>
<P>
	   HAMILTON (AP) -- A man wanted by the FBI in the murder of a Buffalo, N.Y.,
abortion doctor was officially named Monday as a suspect in a similar shooting
in Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   A Canada-wide arrest warrant has been issued for James Kopp in the attempted
murder of Dr. Hugh Short, an abortion doctor who was shot at his home in nearby
Ancaster, Ontario, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrest warrant does not give the police any additional powers in their
hunt for Kopp.
</P>
<P>
	   Kopp was charged last May with second-degree murder in the death of Dr.
Barnett Slepian of Amherst, N.Y., near Buffalo. Slepian was killed in October
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Police also want to talk to Kopp, a Vermont anti-abortion activist, about
the shootings of Dr. Garson Romalis of Vancouver in 1994 and Dr. Jack Fainman of
Winnipeg in 1997, as well as the wounding of an unnamed abortion doctor near
Rochester, N.Y., in 1997.

Clark Backs Elsie Wayne As Deputy

	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Conservative Leader Joe Clark, facing continued division in
his caucus on national unity strategy, tried to squelch rumors Monday that
deputy leader Elsie Wayne's job was on the line in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm delighted to have Elsie Wayne as the deputy leader of the party,''
Clark said as the two left a caucus meeting grinning broadly.
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   Clark has denounced the bill as a provocation that invites a separatist
backlash, while Wayne has argued the consequences of separation need to be
spelled out to Quebecers.

Murderer Gets Second Life Sentence

	   NEW WESTMINSTER, British Columbia (AP) -- A man received a second life
sentence for a deadly hammer attack on his wife and two children in a crime the
Crown said he committed because he wanted to start a new life with a woman he'd
met three weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Holtam, 40, was sentenced in British Columbia Supreme Court on Monday
for attempting to murder his son Cody, now 10.

<P>
	   The boy was in a coma for two weeks after being attacked by a hammer and has
permanent amnesia about the incident.

Watchdog Group Cites Media Lapses

<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Stories about labor, weapons exports and white-collar crime
are among blind spots in Canadian print journalism cited in a report released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Missing News, by media monitoring group NewsWatch Canada, blames such
omissions on ownership concentration and newsroom cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Disproportionate use of ``right-wing'' sources and newspapers' biased
reluctance to criticize influential owners and corporations are also red-flagged
in the 233-page book. Broadcasters weren't studied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Canadian print media, by and large, on matters of economics ... veer very
strongly to the right,'' said co-author Richard Gruneau, a communications

<HEADLINE> Proposed Pork Merger Raises Concern  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The Iowa attorney general filed a lawsuit Monday
seeking to block the sale of Murphy Family Farms in Iowa to Smithfield Foods
Inc., saying the deal would violate state law.
</P>
<P>
	   "We allege a Smithfield acquisition of Murphy farms would violate Iowa law
that prohibits meat processors from owning, controlling or operating a feedlot
in Iowa," Attorney General Tom Miller said Monday after filing the lawsuit in
Humboldt County District Court in Dakota City.
</P>
<P>
	   Smithfield Foods, of Smithfield, Va., and Murphy Farms, Rose Hill, N.C., the
nation's two largest hog producers, announced a $290 million merger Sept. 2,
1999, after producer pork prices hit rock bottom.
</P>
<P>
	   The state is seeking injunctions to block the merger, which is expected to
complete as early as Tuesday, according to the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
	   "If Smithfield acquires Murphy Farms, it will retain essential control of
pork production at about 300 sites in Iowa where Iowa producers have swine
production contracts with Murphy Farms," Miller said.
</P>
<P>
	   Farm groups have asked the Justice Department to take a closer look at such
mergers, complaining that farmers are losing their independence and bargaining
power as the number of food processors, grain traders and farm suppliers shrink.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, the U.S. Senate rejected a proposed 18-month moratorium on
agribusiness mergers.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Spy Testifies in Hearing  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Denying he is trying to ``create paranoia and a new Cold
War,'' Rep. Dan Burton held a hearing on Russian espionage Monday with an ex-spy
testifying and a congressional colleague displaying a mockup of a briefcase-size
nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanislav Lunev, a former Soviet and Russian spy, was led into the hearing
room with a black bag over his head, then was placed behind a screen that
shielded him from the audience at the sparsely attended House Committee on
Government Reform hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of his testimony was a repeat of allegations made in his 1998 book in
which he alleged that Russia's post-Cold War leaders still see the United States
as the enemy.
</P>
<P>
	   Lunev, who is in the federal witness protection program, said he masqueraded
as a reporter for the Russian news agency Tass for three years during which he
scouted ``drop sites'' for weapons caches. But he said he has no idea if they
were ever planted.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton, R-Ind., sought to explain why he chose California for the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's my understanding that there are many potential targets for Russian
sabotage in California,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But by the time the hearing ended, no one had been able to do more than
speculate that there were ``dead drop sites'' for Russian weapons in California.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., suggested in November that the spy caches might
include suitcase-sized nuclear weapons that can produce a 10-kiloton blast.
</P>
<P>
	   Weldon, who also testified, stood at one point, holding up a large briefcase
and announced: ``I have a small atomic demolition device I'd like to bring up to
you.''
</P>
<P>
	   Burton quickly reassured the audience that it was ``a mockup'' created by
the CIA.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials have confirmed their arsenal includes such devices, but
investigators have said there is no evidence they are part of the purported
hidden stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
	   During a break, Burton was questioned by reporters about his motives for the
hearings and whether he knows of actual weapons sites in California.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know whether there's anything like that here nor does the
administration,'' he said, but he insisted that the Russians should be asked.
</P>
<P>
	   When he returned to the hearing room, Burton said, ``Some members of the
media are indicating we might be trying to create paranoia and a new Cold War.
That's untrue. ... I'm distressed that some members of the media think we're
trying to scare everyone to death.''
</P>
<P>
	   Burton said he has repeatedly asked the White House and the State Department
to investigate the question of weapons caches but they have never responded.

<HEADLINE> For the Democrats: Iowa picks fighter Gore over Bradley's fresh  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Fists thrust high, Vice President Al Gore made a
prizefighter's appeal to Iowans and easily won the first round over Bill Bradley
on Monday. Bradley viewed his defeat as just "a bump in the road.".
<P>
	   From charging down a gantlet of glitter-painted pompom girls, to turning his
fire on the Republicans, Gore was in general election spirits even before the
final verdict of Iowa's Democratic caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm a fighter," he said when asked Monday at lunch what sets him apart.
"For 23 years I have been unafraid to take on special interests." Questioned by
reporters as he ate at the Iowa Machine Shed diner in Davenport, Gore said his
experience also was important.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was leading Bradley 2-to-1 in interviews conducted by Voter News
Service as voters entered their caucus sites. VNS is a consortium of The
Associated Press and the nation's principal television outlets.
</P>
<P>
	   As the pre-caucus polls showed Gore the clear winner, Bradley's aunt,
Hardeman Bond, said the boy who was called "Mr. President" ever since high
school would not be stopped by the Iowa disappointment.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a little bump in the road," said the elderly Bond, who traveled
from Bradley's Crystal City, Mo., hometown to be with her nephew. "He'll step
over it and go on."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley began the day hoping for a surprise, as he told a raucous rally of
mostly students at Iowa State University in Ames. A poster there on the wall
summed up the core of his candidacy: "When was the last time we had a president
we could be proud of?"
</P>
<P>
	   No matter the results in Iowa, Bradley said he had the bankroll to fight on
for the nomination in next week's New Hampshire primary and in the cluster of
state primaries on March 7, which he called the first "national primary."
</P>
<P>
	   House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, a Gore booster, voiced some
concern about a protracted nomination fight. "For the sake of winning the House,
we would like to coalesce as soon as possible, coalesce resources. But I would
never tell any candidate that they should get out," said Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore showed confidence in his win in the final days before voting. At his
last pre-caucus rally, Gore looked like a star quarterback taking the field, his
fists aloft, as he hustled down a chute of high school cheerleaders to take the
floor at the University of Iowa gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, consistently trailing in polls here, pumped as much as $2 million
into the state and spent most of the month here. But he did not begin drawing
real crowds - comparable to the 400 or 500 that greeted Gore at every turn -
until the final days.
</P>
<P>
	   Precious days in the final week were consumed by questions about Bradley's
heartbeat irregularity and whether he had tarnished his "non-politician" appeal
by going after Gore on decades-old tobacco votes and Gore's tactics in his
failed 1988 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, Bradley campaigned here on the pillars of his campaign:
universal access to health insurance, alleviation of child poverty, gun control
and campaign finance reform. He said he wanted to "restore some honor and trust
to the system."
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Edwards, a Des Moines-area computer programmer, said he favored Bradley
because he "seems more of an anti-politician than Gore, who's been in the thick
of it for the last eight years."
</P>
<P>
	   Medical student Erin Roylance, waiting outside Gore headquarters for a
glimpse of the candidate and his wife, Tipper, said Gore's time in the White
House "gives him name recognition and makes him the best Democratic candidate to
win for us" in November.
</P>
<P>
	   It was in the thick of Clinton's impeachment that Gore launched his race and
then publicly stumbled as he sought distance from the president, a meaningful
message, a loyal staff, an appealing wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore acknowledged his rocky start. "Total immersion in this process is
something that I think has been very good for me. I have been able to
communicate more effectively because of what I've learned from the people of
Iowa and New Hampshire," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The past few days brought dozens of White House aides and former aides onto
the campaign trail to pitch in for Gore. Officials said the government workers
were in Iowa on personal vacation time.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, Gore sought to turn his resume from the White House, and from
the Senate and House before that, to his advantage. At the same time, he sought
to paint Bradley as a quitter in Democratic fights (he resigned his Senate seat
amid Clinton's battles with the Republican Congress) and a leader who would
focus only on his pet priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   "I haven't turned my back or walked away from any fight over the past seven
years," he said.

<HEADLINE> Grandfathers Rally for Elian  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandfathers were the guests of honor at a
Havana rally for the return of the 6-year-old as his grandmothers sought to meet
with him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The event at Cuba's National Theater was attended by elderly Cubans and
featured songs in honor of Elian and speakers castigating ``the mafia of Miami''
for allegedly kidnapping Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   Paternal grandfather Juan Gonzalez and Rolando Betancourt, the husband of
Elian's maternal grandmother, did not speak during the event held Monday, nor
did Elian's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who also attended.
</P>
<P>
	   The two-plus hour rally was one in a series of almost nightly rallies to
demand the child's return from the United States. It also continued the harsh
rhetoric aimed at anti-Castro exiles based in Miami, who have been at the
forefront of the effort to keep Elian in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Maceo, a grandson of Cuban independence hero Antonio Maceo, noted that
Cuban officials have referred to U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros Lehtinen, a Florida
Republican who has been involved in the case, as ``a savage wolf.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I say that if savage wolves heard this they would feel very offended
because it would not occur to any savage wolf to obtain someone else's cub and
put it in her pack,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The event occurred as Elian's grandmothers, Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela
Quintana, flew to Miami in hopes of meeting with the boy, who has been in the
United States since Nov. 25, when he was rescued from a shipwreck that killed
his mother and 10 other people.
</P>
<P>
	   However they left Miami without seeing Elian due to a dispute over where the
meeting was to take place. Elian's great-uncle insisted the meeting should be at
his house. They insisted on meeting the child alone.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmothers Leave Miami  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers flew to Miami on Monday in hopes
of meeting with their 6-year-old grandson before they return to Cuba, but the
women left town without seeing the boy because of a dispute over the site of the
get-together.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, and paternal grandmother,
Mariela Quintana, shunned an invitation to have dinner Monday night at the home
of Elian's relatives in Miami, who insisted the meeting take place there.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers wanted to meet privately with Elian at a neutral site.
After flying in from New York, they spent about five hours at the airport before
getting back on the plane and taking off for Washington, where they planned to
meet with members of Congress on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers left while a group including Elian's two great-uncles and
Ms. Rodriguez's sister were heading to meet the women at the airport. They did
not bringing Elian along, and Spencer Eig, an attorney for the Miami relatives,
said they were told the grandmothers had no interest in meeting with the
great-uncles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian is disappointed,'' Eig said. ``I know the grandmothers are
disappointed. The situation is heartbreaking for the Gonzalezes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of Churches, who
sponsored the women's trip, said the grandmothers were scared to come to Miami
because of protests by Cuban-Americans who want Elian to stay in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were frightened. They see the thousands of people here in Miami
marching and protesting and you can imagine as very simple, loving, caring
grandparents that they would be frightened to come,'' Edgar said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami relatives have been caring for Elian since he was found clinging
to an inner tube off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving. His mother and 10 other
Cubans died in their ill-fated attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled that Elian must be sent
back to Cuba to live with his father, but the Miami family is suing in federal
court to block the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   And on Monday, the first day of the new congressional session, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott and Florida lawmakers introduced a bill to give Elian
U.S. citizenship, which would free him from INS jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers, who flew from Cuba to New York on Friday, had asked
Attorney General Janet Reno over the weekend to arrange a meeting with Elian.
Reno backs the INS decision to return Elian to Cuba, and the Justice Department
tried to arrange for a neutral site for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to the INS, an attorney for the Miami family said a dinner at
the home of Lazaro Gonzalez -- Mrs. Quintana's brother-in-law and Elian's
great-uncle -- would let the grandmothers ``see and feel for themselves how well
Elian is doing and how much he wishes to remain in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian had spoken by telephone with his father in Cuba and was excited as he
prepared for his grandmothers' arrival, family spokesman Armando Gutierrez said.
The family had bought cameras so Elian could take pictures of his grandmothers,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez said the family would only allow the meeting to take place at the
home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is where they live. This is where Elian lives,'' Gutierrez said. ``No
budging on that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The family had planned to welcome the grandmothers with a dinner of roast
pork, mixed black beans and rice and breaded chicken cutlets, Gutierrez said.
Boxes of flowers brought into the home. About 300 people gathered outside
holding flowers and signs welcoming the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
	   On NBC's ``Today'' show, Ms. Rodriguez asked Congress not to give the boy
U.S. citizenship and to let him return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be more painful if he gets the citizenship,'' she said, speaking
in Spanish through an interpreter. ``I'm asking the congresspeople and people of
the United States that have supported us to stop all this. Please, don't make us
suffer any longer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although they said they have not spoken to the boy in five days, Mrs.
Quintana said Elian has told her over the telephone that ``he's crazy to go back
to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He misses everything there. His school, his classmates, everybody -- his
father's love. To be able to hug and kiss his father. He tells us every day,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Rodriguez denied that her daughter wanted to come to the United States
and have Elian live here. She said Elian's mother was pressured to make the trip
by her boyfriend, ``a very violent person.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's grandmothers planned to meet Tuesday in Washington with members of
Congress, including Sen. Christopher Dodd, the senator's aides announced. The
Connecticut Democrat is a sponsor of legislation introduced every year to ease
the trade embargo with Cuba that has been in effect for four decades.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Favors Curbs on Tobacco Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- A federal judge has rejected a claim that the state's ban on
outdoor tobacco advertising near schools violates the tobacco industry's free
speech rights.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge William G. Young on Monday upheld state regulations that
prohibit outdoor ads for cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and cigars within 1,000
feet of schools and playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Young also upheld a state requirement that cigar packages bear health
warnings.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a great victory in our effort to combat underage smoking in
Massachusetts," Attorney General Tom Reilly said in a written statement. "The
goal of these regulations is to reduce the influence of tobacco advertising on
children."
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco industry officials could not immediately be reached for comment late
Monday. When Young made an earlier ruling in the case last month, a spokesman
for Philip Morris Inc. said the company was considering an appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Young ruled in December that federal tobacco laws didn't prohibit the state
from placing its own restrictions on tobacco advertising. But Young at that time
did not address the industry's claim that such state bans violated the
industry's right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Then-Attorney General Scott Harshbarger established the advertising
restrictions in January 1999 under the state's Consumer Protection Act. The
restrictions are scheduled to take effect next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris filed suit in federal court, arguing that the federal
government, not the states, had the right to regulate tobacco advertising. R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson Corp. and Lorillard Tobacco Co. joined
the suit.
</P>
<P>
	   Health warnings in large black-and-white lettering will be required on
packages of cigars sold in Massachusetts. They will say either: "WARNING: Cigar
Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide and Nicotine, an Addictive Drug," or "WARNING:
Cigars Are Not A Safe Alternative To Cigarettes Or Smokeless Tobacco Products."
</P>
<P>
	   California is the only other state that requires such a warning.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an important step forward in informing consumers of the serious
health risks of cigar use," Reilly said.

<HEADLINE> Rioting Breaks Out in East Timor  </HEADLINE>
   By HEATHER PATTERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Gangs of youths wielding machetes and clubs rioted
Tuesday in Dili's main marketplace, eyewitnesses said. At least four people were
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign peacekeeping troops stopped the fighting, which broke out between
two gangs of local youths. A short time later, peacekeepers and civilian police
were guarding about 30 young men sitting in the street, some still holding
knives.
</P>
<P>
	   The riot was believed to be the result of escalating tension between rival
groups in Dili and a perceived lack of policing of petty crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said up to 80 people were involved in the fighting. Authorities
confiscated weapons including machetes and clubs, which were piled in the back
of at least one vehicle.
</P>
<P>
	   Troops from the international peacekeeping force in East Timor were
conducting a house-to-house search of an area around the market, in central
Dili.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said they heard two shots fired. Ambulances took at least four
people from the scene. Witnesses said one man had serious head injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   One gang member, Ajuro, said the territory's fledgling government, known as
the CNRT, was not doing enough to protect people in the market.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every day there are problems in the market, we are not getting any
protection from the CNRT,'' Arujo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Violence in Dili has been rising recently, as the United Nations settles
into its transitional administration of the territory.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 14, East Timorese scrambling to apply for jobs offered by the United
Nations threw rocks at a small group of international peacekeepers and U.N.
civilian police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Unemployment is chronic in East Timor after its devastation last year by
militia gangs who opposed independence from Indonesia. Tens of thousands of East
Timorese live in tents and makeshift huts without money to rebuild their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   East Timor overwhelming voted in an Aug. 30 U.N.-supervised referendum to
break away from Indonesia, which invaded it in 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations took over the administration of the territory, a former
Portuguese colony, after the peacekeepers arrived on Sept. 20.

<HEADLINE> Storm Knocks Out Power to Thousands  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Even with a fire in the fireplace, it was a chilly 47
degrees in Bernadette Martin's house Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   And like the more than 100,000 other Georgians still without power after an
ice storm over the weekend, she was worried about temperatures dropping even
lower and the possibility that the electricity may not be turned back on until
Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Martin kept telling her 4-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter, bundled
in winter coats as they played in the living room, that they were on a glorified
camping trip. Outside, the power line drooped next to the driveway, where it
fell after a tree branch knocked it down over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hate to leave the house in case everything freezes,'' Mrs. Martin said.
``But we might have to get a hotel for the kids to keep them warm, if we can
find one of those that has power.''
</P>
<P>
	   The storm spread snow, ice and rain and cut off electricity across much of
the Southeast. More than a half-million customers lost power in Georgia, and
thousands also were blacked out in Alabama and the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Red Cross opened 10 shelters in Georgia for people without heat, and
Gov. Roy Barnes declared a state of emergency in 20 counties. Schools from
Atlanta north were closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia got more snow Monday, and the forecast called for temperatures to
plunge into the teens and 20s Monday night. Another round of frozen rain is
expected Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Carolinas also were hit with a new round of snow and ice Monday, with
more than 8 inches falling in some areas. An estimated 44,000 customers remained
without power in South Carolina and three traffic deaths in that state were
blamed on the weather.
</P>
<P>
	   About 3,000 Georgia Power Co. workers have toiled almost around the clock
since the storm hit late Saturday. Yet 100,000 customers -- most of them in the
Atlanta area -- still had no electricity Monday afternoon. An additional 25,000
customers of electric membership cooperatives were without service.
</P>
<P>
	   The effort to restore power was hampered by fallen trees and limbs blocking
streets. In some neighborhoods, one street had power and the next was dark.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Knowing what the weather is going to do stimulates us even more to get the
power back on as quickly as possible,'' said Georgia Power spokeswoman Lisa
Frederick. ``But with the sheer number of people impacted by this and the sheer
size of the area, it's going to take time.''
</P>
<P>
	   The storm and power outages didn't interfere with preparations for Sunday's
Super Bowl, which will be played at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The majority of visitors will be here Thursday or Friday,'' said Andrew
Vedlitz, vice president of marketing for the Super Bowl host committee. ``We may
have had some bars or restaurants without power, but they should be up and
running when we get the big rush.''
</P>
<P>
	   Those still without power struggled to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta resident Amber Vann braved sleet to buy firewood at her neighborhood
grocery store, where all the perishable-goods shelves were empty and the store
was running on a generator.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I got the last bundle, and we need it,'' said Ms. Vann, carrying both the
firewood and her 18-month-year-old daughter. ``I think it's colder inside my
house than it is out here, and I've got four layers on her. I've been everywhere
looking for firewood.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Mellow Mushroom, an Atlanta pizza parlor, fired up its generator and
sold about 300 pizzas in five hours Sunday night, then switched the power source
to the TV so patrons could watch the end of one of the football playoff games.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We might as well be here, because we're still without power at home,''
said Linda Livingston, who owns the Mellow Mushroom with her husband. ``It's not
too bad at home, though, with all the stuff I had left over in case of Y2K that
everyone scoffed at me for.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Win Iowa Caucuses  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush won
the Iowa caucuses Monday night, validating their front-runner status in the
opening contest of the 2000 presidential election season. Gore won big over Bill
Bradley while Bush overcame a strong second-place showing by conservative
publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can't wait to get to New Hampshire,'' Gore told The Associated Press as
he thanked Iowa Democrats and looked ahead to next week's more dramatic
showdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and Forbes both expressed satisfaction with the Republican results.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a solid victory and I'm grateful,'' the Texas governor told AP,
calling the victory a ``record-shattering'' validation of his compassionate
conservative agenda. Forbes said, ``we vastly overperformed the polls and have
emerged as a conservative candidate'' going into New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign of the tit-for-tat to come, Gore accused Bradley of ``going
negative'' in the final days of the Iowa race -- and said the tactic backfired.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it was a mistake for his campagn to go to the so-called negative
approach but I'm not complaining,'' Gore said. ``But based on what I've heard
from from the voters out here they didn't expect that and didn't like it.'
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, Gore was running about two-to-one against Bradley according to
sample precincts.
</P>
<P>
	   The caucuses were expected to draw no more than 100,000 voters from each
party, concluding a lengthy runup of debates, fund raising and grass-roots
campaigning here. Iowa launches the presidential race into a frantic six-week
stretch, with the New Hampshire primary a week away.
</P>
<P>
	   With results from 80 percent of Iowa's counties, Bush had support from 41
percent of the caucus participants and Forbes 30 percent. Former Amb. Keyes was
a respectable third at 14 percent, with Gary Bauer at 9 percent, John McCain 5
and Orrin Hatch just 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes mounted, and funded, a particularly vigorous campaign here, calling
on fundamentalist and conservative support to the more moderate Bush. Sen. John
McCain declined to campaign here, but the Arizona Republican was still listed on
ballots. Keyes bested Bauer in the drive for support from conservative social
activists. Hatch never gained a constituency and was sure to review his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democratic race, Gore's victory blunted Bradley's challenge going
into New Hampshire next week where Bradley has polled even with Gore, or even
ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowans were attending caucuses at 2,100 sites across the sprawling state. In
a display of basic grass-roots politics, voters here brave the winter weather
and visit classrooms, libraries, fire stations, church basements, grain co-ops
and even a few private homes to play their unique role in the American political
system.
</P>
<P>
	   The process will yield 47 delegates to the Democratic convention and 25
delegates to the GOP convention, a tiny fraction of the total a candidate needs
to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   An AP analysis showed that Bush was likely to earn 11 delegates of Iowa's 25
nominating delegates, compared to seven for Forbes, four for Keyes, two for
Bauer and one for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview, Bush said, ``I am humbled and honored about the outpouring
of support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a record-shattering victory tonight. I'm grateful for the
outpouring of support my message of compassionate conservatism has received, and
I'm looking forward to taking it to the state of New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush noted that the highest percentage achieved by a GOP victor in Iowa was
37.4, when eventual nominee Bob Dole beat Pat Robertson in 1988. Robertson's
24.6 percent was a surprise, and it staggered the candidacy of then-Vice
President George Bush, who came in third.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley faltered in his effort to propel his challenge to Gore on the
Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours before the voting, Forbes said he would ``feel good about a good,
strong second.'' Bradley indicated he was in for the long haul: ``The longer the
competition goes, the better chance that candidate is going to have ... in the
fall.''
</P>
<P>
	   En route to the early contests, Republicans squabbled over taxes and
abortion, courting religious conservatives who make up a third of the
caucus-going population. Bush carefully calibrated his antiabortion views to
make clear his opposition to the Supreme Court ruling. Democrats were poised to
campaign on the issue if Bush were to win the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Bradley differed in tone more than substance. They wrestled
primarily over alternative approaches to federal health insurance policy. While
Bradley promised to provide big ideas to solve a few big problems. Gore said the
next president should not limit himself to a handful of issues.
</P>
<P>
	   After a ragged start, Gore led Bradley by more than 20 percentage points in
most pre-caucus polls. A string of setbacks, including recurrence of a minor
heart condition, threw Bradley off track in the final week.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, Bush's totals tracked his showing in pre-caucus
polls. Forbes did better than polling had suggested, siphoning off votes from
three other conservatives competing for the same pool of votes. Entrance polls
showed that one third of voters who identified themselves as conservative
Christians supported Forbes, another third supported Bush and the remainder were
split among the other candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's only two trips to the state were for debates. He leads in New
Hampshire polls, but didn't discourage Iowans from lending support. He and
Bradley emerged as significant challengers for 2000, their fund raising
dramatically boosted, after they began drawing substantial support in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   It was one of the most expensive caucuses in history, with millions spent on
TV alone. Forbes spent far more than anyone -- about $3.2 million, according to
aides from the Forbes and Bush campaigns. Bush spent at least a million dollars
less.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democrats spent about $1.5 million each -- closer to $2 million for
Bradley, according to the Gore camp.
</P>
<P>
	   The parties conducted their caucuses in slightly different ways.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats elect county convention delegates reflecting their presidential
preferences, discuss platform issues and elect precinct leaders. Republicans
elect precinct leaders, hold a straw poll for president, elect delegates to the
county conventions and consider platform issues.
</P>
<P>
	   After Iowa and New Hampshire, Democrats turn their attention to an
unprecedented mountain of primaries from New York to California on March 7.
Republicans will compete in several states before March 7, including Delaware on
Feb. 8, South Carolina on Feb. 19 and Arizona and Michigan on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Most candidates see Iowa as a tempting jumping-off point.
</P>
<P>
	   Jimmy Carter was a little-known Georgia governor when his 1976 Iowa campaign
catapulted him onto the national scene and put the caucuses on the political
map.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, Iowa has been an important but often unreliable barometer of
presidential mettle. For every eventual nominee who has won Iowa -- Republican
Bob Dole in 1996 and Democrat Walter Mondale in 1984 -- the state has yielded
many more surprises.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronald Reagan lost in 1980, and his foe George Bush declared he had ``Big
Mo'' heading into New Hampshire. But Bush's momentum dissipated in a high-stakes
debate there and Reagan went on to the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, heading for a last-place finish in Iowa in 1988, left the state to
campaign elsewhere, dismissing the caucuses as ``a real arcane procedure that
produces crazy results.''

<HEADLINE> Philly To Provide for Hepatitis C  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The city will provide millions of dollars to help
firefighters and paramedics who have contracted the deadly hepatitis C virus,
the mayor said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor John F. Street said the city is committing enough money to treat up to
200 firefighters and paramedics a year, at a cost of about $3 million this
fiscal year. Street said the city is prepared to assume long-term treatment
costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The union representing the firefighters and paramedics said 130 of them have
hepatitis C, and that the number suggests it is a job-related condition. The
disease can remain dormant up to 20 years, so many emergency workers could have
contracted the disease before masks and gloves became standard gear, the union
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus of the liver that can be fatal if
untreated.
</P>
<P>
	   Risk factors include the use of injected drugs, blood transfusions, organ or
tissue transplants prior to 1990, unsafe sexual practices and getting a tattoo
or body piercing under unsanitary conditions.

<HEADLINE> Thai Forces Storm Besieged Hospital  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW PENNINGTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RATCHABURI, Thailand (AP) -- Ending a 22-hour standoff, Thai security forces
stormed a hospital Tuesday and killed nine heavily armed Myanmar rebels who had
held hundreds of patients, visitors and staff hostage.
</P>
<P>
	   The approximately 900 people who were in the walled, six-acre compound when
the ordeal began Monday morning were either freed, had escaped or were rescued
during the siege Tuesday morning, said Lt. Gen. Thaweep Suwannasingha, regional
Thai army commander.
</P>
<P>
	   No hostages were injured, but two police officers were.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a successful operation,'' Thaweep said.
</P>
<P>
	   Once Thai troops secured the front of the hospital, a fleet of ambulances
drove in and began ferrying exhausted survivors -- some weeping -- to another
hospital for medical checks.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels belong to God's Army, a fringe group who took the hostages to
pressure the government to help their beleaguered movement.
</P>
<P>
	   The group is from the ethnic Karen minority and is led by twin 12-year-old
boys believed to have magical powers. The twins were not involved in the
takeover.
</P>
<P>
	   Like many Karens, the followers of God's Army are fundamentalist Christians
in a predominantly Buddhist country. They accuse Myanmar's military regime of
widespread murder, rape and arson.
</P>
<P>
	   Thai media reported that a tenth gunman was hunted down and killed, but that
report could not be immediately confirmed. Thaweep discounted earlier government
reports that there were 16 gunmen.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the siege began, shooting erupted and police and soldiers armed with
M-16 assault rifles on foot and in trucks sped into the walled, six-acre
hospital compound.
</P>
<P>
	   Automatic weapons fire and explosions thudded in the night, possibly from
grenades, bombs or mines that the hostage-takers had rigged around the hospital.
The pre-dawn assault lasted for an hour.
</P>
<P>
	   After the area was secured, explosives experts with mine detectors combed
the compound seeking booby-traps.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostage-takers had been in control of the five-story central
administration and emergency room buildings, but couldn't keep a grip over eight
outlying buildings. Many patients and staff there escaped Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   It was never known how many people they held at gunpoint during the siege,
though officials guessed it might have been 200.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostage-takers included at least one member of a faction of exiled
Myanmar students, the Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors, who seized their
country's embassy in Bangkok last year, said Interior Minister Sanan
Kachornprasart.
</P>
<P>
	   Myanmar's military regime was outraged when Thailand allowed the embassy
captors, whom they considered terrorists, to go free under a deal to release
their dozens of hostages unharmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Myanmar closed the border for two months in retaliation. Relations warmed
after Thailand vowed to arrest them if it got the chance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We tried the soft way before,'' Thaweep said Tuesday, explaining the
decision to launch the assault. ``We were concerned about patients in the
hospital and other innocent people. We had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The students, who said they were fighting for democracy against a military
dictatorship that has ruled their country, also known as Burma, had holed up
with God's Army.
</P>
<P>
	   The groups came under attack inside Myanmar from government forces last week
in fighting that has driven 1,000 refugees into Thailand. Thai forces shelled
their positions to deter rebels from coming across.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostage-takers demanded Monday that Thailand grant refuge to civilians
and combatants and stop shelling their positions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bush Hopes Iowa Win Carries in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush pronounced himself ``humbled and
honored'' by his hard-fought Iowa victory and relished the New Hampshire fight
just ahead in his quest for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Publisher Steve Forbes, powered by a well-financed campaign and strong
organization, scored a strong second in the precinct caucuses and declared
himself ``a very happy man.'' John McCain saved his powder for New Hampshire,
where most polls put him even with Bush or ahead. ``We can really do this,''
McCain assured his supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel great,'' Bush said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``I'm
humbled and honored about the outpouring. ... I'm grateful for the outpouring of
support my message of compassionate conservatism has received and I'm looking
forward to taking it to the state of New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes, a former State Department official and radio talk show host, was
running a respectable third while conservative activist Gary Bauer and Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah trailed far behind with McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   An AP analysis of the straw poll results showed that Bush's support was
likely to translate into 10 delegates, compared to eight for Forbes, four for
Keyes, two for Bauer and one for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   With 80 percent of precincts counted, Bush had 30,136 votes or 41 percent,
Forbes 22,153 or 30 percent, Keyes 10,391 or 14 percent, Bauer 6,376 or 9
percent, McCain 3,424 for 5 percent and Hatch 763 for 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Sitting on his campaign bus in New Hampshire as the television networks
declared Bush the winner in the Iowa caucuses, McCain nodded. Asked whether the
results affirmed his strategy to sit out the caucuses and focus on New
Hampshire, the Arizona senator said: ``In my view, the game is here.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain told supporters at an evening Dartmouth College rally: ``The playoffs
start tomorrow and we're going to win those playoffs. We are in for a
history-making seven days.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said of his second-place showing: ``I'll take more losses like that
and I'll win the nomination.'' In an interview with The AP, he cast himself as
``a conservative versus two moderates'' in the campaign fight ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes said his third-place show was a reward for his firm stance on moral
issues -- including opposing abortion -- and his energetic performance in the
Republican debates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that's really important because when we get down to the general
election, we're not just going to have somebody out there taking a stand,''
Keyes said. ``It's going to have to be someone who can defend that stand and who
can persuade the American people to support it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Showing his confidence as he prepared for the next battleground, Bush took
time out from a campaign stop in Ames to tape a TV ad that will appear in New
Hampshire. It recounts his record as governor and recaps his positions as a
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iowa voting held great stakes for Forbes, the publisher making his
second bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's voters identified moral values and taxes as their top issues, and
said they voted for Bush because they believe he can win in November. Among
Forbes voters, the top issue was taxes and the top quality was that Forbes
stands up for what he believes in.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes did better than Bush among voters who said that representing
conservative values was the most important quality, and among those who said
standing up for what he believes in was most important. Those two groups
represented half of Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush team hoped that a strong victory Monday and an intense focus in New
Hampshire over an eight-day period would shut down McCain's challenge and winnow
the field.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush plans to focus next on education, arguing that he has a strong plan for
improving schools and McCain does not, according to Bush aides.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The time advantage Senator McCain has enjoyed is gone as of 2 a.m.,'' said
Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes, alluding to the governor's expected arrival time
in Manchester, N.H., after a late-night departure from Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, was focusing on portraying himself as more qualified to
lead than Bush, running a television ad in New Hampshire that touted his war
record and Senate experience in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the first votes were cast, four Republican candidates had quit
the race: John Kasich, Dan Quayle, Lamar Alexander and Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch said in advance of the vote, ``I don't get discouraged. If you get
discouraged in this business, you don't get a lot done.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Dip Moderately  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen Tuesday morning in light
trading ahead of a key speech by the Federal Reserve chief. Japanese stocks fell
following sharp drops on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 105.56 yen at late morning, up 0.64 yen from late Monday
in Tokyo but lower than its level of 105.68 yen late Monday in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 63.44 points, or 0.33
percent, to 18,993.27 at the end of the morning session. On Monday, the average
closed up 178.62 points, or 0.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 2.11 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,645.85. The TOPIX closed up
20.82 points, or 1.28 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar would move in a narrow range
amid a lack of new incentives and ahead of a speech by Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan before the Senate Budget Committee later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said the dollar was supported somewhat as G7 finance ministers made
tepid remarks about bringing down the yen after the weekend meeting in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   Zembei Mizoguchi, chief of the international bureau at Japan's Finance
Ministry said Tuesday morning that the yen's tendency to strengthen in foreign
exchange markets is still in place, and that the ministry is maintaining its
vigilance.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would be beneficial to the Japanese economy if this (yen strengthening)
trend was corrected," Mizoguchi said.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese officials fear that a strong yen could hamper the nation's economy
as its struggles to recover from its worst slowdown in 50 years. A higher yen
makes Japanese exports more expensive.

<HEADLINE> Age Raise for Handguns Defeated  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN K. PAULSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- A bill supporters said could have prevented violence like the
Columbine High School massacre was defeated by a Senate committee Monday,
despite the tearful pleas of a 16-year-old girl who escaped the carnage.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would have required safe storage of firearms and raised the legal
age for handgun possession from 18 to 21, two of the gun-control measures
supported by Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   Erin Flynn, a sophomore at Columbine, told lawmakers she was lucky to escape
during the April 20 shooting when two schoolmates went on a rampage, fatally
shooting 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of her friends were killed and a third was badly injured.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm testifying today because I don't want anyone else to suffer,'' she
said, clutching a photo of a classmate wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no reason for a high school student to have a gun. I don't know
if this would have prevented Columbine, but I do know it would make it more
difficult to get a gun,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Senate Judiciary Committee defeated the bill on a 4-4 vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee chairwoman Dottie Wham, a Democrat from Denver, said it will be
tough getting any gun control bills through the Republican-controlled
Legislature, despite the Columbine shootings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's going to be very hard. I think there are individuals who are
very much swayed by people who want no constraints on their ability to have
guns,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers leave Miami without seeing the boy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MIAMI (AP) - Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers flew to Miami on Monday in
hopes of meeting with their 6-year-old grandson before they return to Cuba, but
the women left town without seeing the boy because of a dispute over the site of
the get-together.
<P>
	   The boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, and paternal grandmother,
Mariela Quintana, shunned an invitation to have dinner Monday night at the home
of Elian's relatives in Miami, who insisted the meeting take place there.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers wanted to meet privately with Elian at a neutral site.
After flying in from New York, they spent about five hours at the airport before
getting back on the plane and taking off for Washington, where they planned to
meet with members of Congress on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers left while a group including Elian's two great-uncles and
Ms. Rodriguez's sister were heading to meet the women at the airport. They did
not bringing Elian along, and Spencer Eig, an attorney for the Miami relatives,
said they were told the grandmothers had no interest in meeting with the
great-uncles.
</P>
<P>
	   "Elian is disappointed," Eig said. "I know the grandmothers are
disappointed. The situation is heartbreaking for the Gonzalezes."
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of Churches, who
sponsored the women's trip, said the grandmothers were scared to come to Miami
because of protests by Cuban-Americans who want Elian to stay in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were frightened. They see the thousands of people here in Miami
marching and protesting and you can imagine as very simple, loving, caring
grandparents that they would be frightened to come," Edgar said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami relatives have been caring for Elian since he was found clinging
to an inner tube off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving. His mother and 10 other
Cubans died in their ill-fated attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled that Elian must be sent
back to Cuba to live with his father, but the Miami family is suing in federal
court to block the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   And on Monday, the first day of the new congressional session, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott and Florida lawmakers introduced a bill to give Elian
U.S. citizenship, which would free him from INS jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers, who flew from Cuba to New York on Friday, had asked
Attorney General Janet Reno over the weekend to arrange a meeting with Elian.
Reno backs the INS decision to return Elian to Cuba, and the Justice Department
tried to arrange for a neutral site for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to the INS, an attorney for the Miami family said a dinner at
the home of Lazaro Gonzalez - Mrs. Quintana's brother-in-law and Elian's
great-uncle - would let the grandmothers "see and feel for themselves how well
Elian is doing and how much he wishes to remain in the United States."
</P>
<P>
	   Elian had spoken by telephone with his father in Cuba and was excited as he
prepared for his grandmothers' arrival, family spokesman Armando Gutierrez said.
The family had bought cameras so Elian could take pictures of his grandmothers,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez said the family would only allow the meeting to take place at the
home.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is where they live. This is where Elian lives," Gutierrez said. "No
budging on that."
</P>
<P>
	   The family had planned to welcome the grandmothers with a dinner of roast
pork, mixed black beans and rice and breaded chicken cutlets, Gutierrez said.
Boxes of flowers brought into the home. About 300 people gathered outside
holding flowers and signs welcoming the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
	   On NBC's "Today" show, Ms. Rodriguez asked Congress not to give the boy U.S.
citizenship and to let him return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be more painful if he gets the citizenship," she said, speaking in
Spanish through an interpreter. "I'm asking the congresspeople and people of the
United States that have supported us to stop all this. Please, don't make us
suffer any longer."
</P>
<P>
	   Although they said they have not spoken to the boy in five days, Mrs.
Quintana said Elian has told her over the telephone that "he's crazy to go back
to Cuba."
</P>
<P>
	   "He misses everything there. His school, his classmates, everybody - his
father's love. To be able to hug and kiss his father. He tells us every day,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Rodriguez denied that her daughter wanted to come to the United States
and have Elian live here. She said Elian's mother was pressured to make the trip
by her boyfriend, "a very violent person."
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's grandmothers planned to meet Tuesday in Washington with members of
Congress, including Sen. Christopher Dodd, the senator's aides announced. The
Connecticut Democrat is a sponsor of legislation introduced every year to ease
the trade embargo with Cuba that has been in effect for four decades.

<HEADLINE> Fiery Keyes Has Strong Iowa Showing  </HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN STOCUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Striking a chord with his oratory against abortion
and sinking moral values, Alan Keyes posted a third-place finish in the Iowa
caucuses to claim some bragging rights against Republican rivals with more
money, exposure and experience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's a good jumping off point,'' said Keyes, a conservative
talk-show host and former foreign service officer in the Reagan administration.
``I'm sure our supporters will take heart from this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, the only black presidential candidate in either major party,
outpolled Gary Bauer, a longtime activist on social conservative issues, as well
as Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and John McCain of Arizona. McCain is placing his
early hopes in New Hampshire and did not campaign in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, making his second run for the nomination, credited the frequent
debates with offering him a platform to become better known -- a chance he
seized with relish, appealing with fiery rhetoric for fellow conservatives to
join him in a moral crusade.
</P>
<P>
	   He had little campaign organization in Iowa, but his crowds had grown in the
days leading up to Monday's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes scored well with Iowa Republicans concerned about abortion and moral
values, according to interviews conducted at caucus sites by Voter News Service,
a consortium of The Associated Press, ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes was shut out of some debates during the 1996 Republican nomination
battle, leading him to threaten a hunger strike and to get briefly arrested when
he tried to crash a forum in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, Keyes' support moved up into the double digits, roughly doubling
his showing in Iowa from four years ago when he came sixth in an eight-man
field. Keyes faded in New Hampshire in 1996 and his campaign never caught on.
</P>
<P>
	   This time he got off to a better start.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When we get down to the general election, we're not just going to have
somebody out there taking a stand,'' Keyes said. ``It's going to have to be
someone who can defend that stand and who can persuade the American people to
support it.''

<HEADLINE> Streakers Hit Rockefeller Center  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two women -- naked except for their black bikini bottoms --
disrupted a fashion show Monday night by steaking on to the ice at the
Rockefeller Center skating rink to protest people wearing fur.
</P>
<P>
	   Melynda Duval and Anna West donned skates, the bikini bottoms, painted-on
leopard spots and smiles. They carried a paper sign stretched between them
saying: ``Only Animals Should Wear Fur.''
</P>
<P>
	   Their streak momentarily disrupted the Montreal Fashions on Ice Show,
featuring designers Angela Bucaro, Hilary Radley, and Oscar Leopold. Security
staff led the women off the ice after about a minute.
</P>
<P>
	   Kristie Sigmon, of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said both
Ms. Duval and Ms. West were members of the organization. All three women are
from Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Duval has streaked for the cause before, once disrupting the
Thanksgiving Day parade sponsored by Macy's, Ms. Sigmon said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Something like this, it's fun, it's uplifting and it gets people talking
about the issue,'' she said. ``We do have a good sense of humor.''

<HEADLINE> Galveston Jail Battles Spiders  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS FLETCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- A ``swat team'' combed nooks and crannies of the Galveston
County Jail on Monday, hoping to wipe out a gang of eight-legged perpetrators
who have terrorized inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   Capt. Mike Henson, the assistant jail administrator, said 33 of the jail's
inmates have been bitten by brown recluse spiders since Oct. 1. Eight inmates
have been bitten this month alone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're taking all the precautions we can to eliminate and exterminate these
spiders,'' Henson said.
</P>
<P>
	   An entomologist and two jail employees destroyed three small brown recluse
spiders and one web with egg sacs found during their sweep Monday. Jail
officials also will change pesticide treatments to find one more effective.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown recluse bites are rarely fatal and frequently go undetected for days,
but they can be serious if left untreated, said John Jackman, a professor and
extension entomologist for Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
	   The bitten area reddens and develops a ring-like mark, Jackman said. It may
develop into an open wound that oozes, is slow to heal and leaves scar tissue.
</P>
<P>
	   An allergic reaction in some people may cause shock, but none of the inmates
has suffered severe symptoms from the bites, Henson said. All were treated with
antibiotics by the jail's medical staff or the University of Texas Medical
Branch.

<HEADLINE> Overnite Sues Teamsters for $5.2M  </HEADLINE>
    By AMY GREEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A trucking company being picketed by the Teamsters
union filed a federal lawsuit Monday accusing Teamsters president James P. Hoffa
and other union leaders in a string of violence and illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit filed by Overnite Transportation Co. in Jackson accuses the
Teamsters of devising a scheme to "put Overnite out of business if ... its
employees do not agree to collective bargaining representation by the Teamster
International ... and to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement proposed
by the Teamster International."
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit alleges a pattern of violent activities, including 57 acts of
attempted murder and 131 acts of extortion. It seeks damages in excess of $5.2
million.
</P>
<P>
	   Dave Cameron, a national coordinator for the Teamsters, said the lawsuit is
Overnite's "desperate" attempt to draw public attention away from its own
illegal activities, including the alleged harassment and illegal firing of its
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   "This sounds like a public relations stunt. This company has been famous for
their legal machinations," Cameron said. "To try to connect the Teamsters to
these activities is baseless and without foundation."
</P>
<P>
	   The Teamsters launched a strike Oct. 24 at Overnite terminals in seven
states, five weeks after talks on a new contract broke off with the Richmond,
Va.-based company.
</P>
<P>
	   The Teamsters and Overnite have been trying for several years to negotiate a
contract for 22 terminals where the union represents Overnite workers. Both
sides say pensions have been the major area of disagreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have said at least five shootings appear related to the strike. The
most serious came Dec. 1, when driver William Wonder of Evansville, Ind., was
shot in the stomach as he drove from the Memphis hub.
</P>
<P>
	   Overnite officials say 95 percent of the pickets have been non-Overnite
workers who are Teamsters from union companies. They say its 22
union-represented locations account for 14 percent of the company's 13,000
employees in 166 terminals in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and
Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit seeks damages for security expenses, property damage and costs of
replacing workers who "missed work due to the lawlessness."
</P>
<P>
	   A subsidiary of Omaha, Neb.-based Union Pacific, Overnite competes in the
less-than-truckload industry, in which the trucking company coordinates and
consolidates small shipments of less than a truckload for pickup and
delivery.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Win Iowa Caucuses  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Opening the presidential election season,
Republican George W. Bush won Iowa's caucuses in a closer-than-expected race
against conservative publisher Steve Forbes. Vice President Al Gore breezed to a
Democratic victory over Bill Bradley and declared, ``I can't wait to get to New
Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' showing set the stage for a three-way showdown in New Hampshire's
Feb. 1 primary. Sen. John McCain of Arizona holds a slight lead in most GOP
polls in that state, and hoped to sustain it even after bypassing Iowa where
Forbes took advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush described the caucus results as ``a record shattering'' validation of
his compassionate conservative agenda. ``It's a solid victory and I'm humbled,''
he told AP as the presidential campaigns but the best-possible spins on their
finishes.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said, ``we vastly overperformed the polls and have emerged as the
conservative candidate'' going into New Hampshire. He told AP, ``I'll take more
losses like that, and I'll win the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
	   With results from 86 percent of Iowa's counties, Bush had 41 percent of the
caucus vote and Forbes 30 percent. Former Amb. Alan Keyes was a respectable
third at 14 percent, with Gary Bauer at 9 percent, John McCain 5 and Orrin Hatch
just 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes mounted, and funded, a particularly vigorous campaign here, calling
on fundamentalist and conservative support to the more moderate Bush. McCain
declined to campaign here, showing up in the state only for two debates. Keyes
bested Bauer in the drive for support from conservative social activists. Hatch
never gained a constituency and was sure to review his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Democrats, Gore was winning 66 percent of the state's 47 Democratic
nominating delegates, compared to 33 percent for Bradley, according to results
from sample precincts.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's big margin blunted Bradley's challenge going into New Hampshire next
week where Bradley has polled even with Gore, or even ahead. A relative said
Bradley viewed his defeat as just ``a bump in the road.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign of the tit-for-tat to come, Gore accused Bradley of ``going
negative'' in the final days of the Iowa race -- and said the tactic backfired.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it was a mistake for his campagn to go to the so-called negative
approach but I'm not complaining,'' Gore said. ``But based on what I've heard
from from the voters out here they didn't expect that and didn't like it.'
</P>
<P>
	   The caucuses were expected to draw no more than 100,000 voters from each
party, concluding a lengthy runup of debates, fund raising and grass-roots
campaigning here. Iowa launches the presidential race into a frantic six-week
stretch, with the New Hampshire primary a week away.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowans were attending caucuses at 2,100 sites across the sprawling state. In
a display of basic grass-roots politics, voters here brave the winter weather
and visit classrooms, libraries, fire stations, church basements, grain co-ops
and even a few private homes to play their unique role in the American political
system.
</P>
<P>
	   The process will yield 47 delegates to the Democratic convention and 25
delegates to the GOP convention, a tiny fraction of the total a candidate needs
to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   An AP analysis showed that Bush was likely to earn 11 delegates of Iowa's 25
nominating delegates, compared to seven for Forbes, four for Keyes, two for
Bauer and one for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview, Bush said, ``We have a record-shattering victory tonight.
I'm grateful for the outpouring of support my message of compassionate
conservatism has received, and I'm looking forward to taking it to the state of
New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush noted that the highest percentage achieved by a GOP victor in Iowa was
37.4, when eventual nominee Bob Dole beat Pat Robertson in 1988. Robertson's
24.6 percent was a surprise, and it staggered the candidacy of then-Vice
President George Bush, who came in third.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours before the voting, Bradley indicated he was in for the long haul:
``The longer the competition goes, the better chance that candidate is going to
have ... in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
	   En route to the early contests, Republicans squabbled over taxes and
abortion, courting religious conservatives who make up a third of the
caucus-going population. Bush carefully calibrated his antiabortion views to
make clear his opposition to the Supreme Court ruling. Democrats were poised to
campaign on the issue if Bush were to win the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Bradley differed in tone more than substance. They wrestled
primarily over alternative approaches to federal health insurance policy. While
Bradley promised to provide big ideas to solve a few big problems. Gore said the
next president should not limit himself to a handful of issues.
</P>
<P>
	   After a ragged start, Gore led Bradley by more than 20 percentage points in
most pre-caucus polls. A string of setbacks, including recurrence of a minor
heart condition, threw Bradley off track in the final week.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, Bush's totals tracked his showing in pre-caucus
polls. Forbes did better than polling had suggested, siphoning off votes from
three other conservatives competing for the same pool of votes. Entrance polls
showed that one third of voters who identified themselves as conservative
Christians supported Forbes, another third supported Bush and the remainder were
split among the other candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's only two trips to the state were for debates. He leads in New
Hampshire polls, but didn't discourage Iowans from lending support. He and
Bradley emerged as significant challengers for 2000, their fund raising
dramatically boosted, after they began drawing substantial support in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   It was one of the most expensive caucuses in history, with millions spent on
TV alone. Forbes spent far more than anyone -- about $3.2 million, according to
aides from the Forbes and Bush campaigns. Bush spent at least a million dollars
less.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democrats spent about $1.5 million each -- closer to $2 million for
Bradley, according to the Gore camp.
</P>
<P>
	   The parties conducted their caucuses in slightly different ways.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats elect county convention delegates reflecting their presidential
preferences, discuss platform issues and elect precinct leaders. Republicans
elect precinct leaders, hold a straw poll for president, elect delegates to the
county conventions and consider platform issues.
</P>
<P>
	   After Iowa and New Hampshire, Democrats turn their attention to an
unprecedented mountain of primaries from New York to California on March 7.
Republicans will compete in several states before March 7, including Delaware on
Feb. 8, South Carolina on Feb. 19 and Arizona and Michigan on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Most candidates see Iowa as a tempting jumping-off point.
</P>
<P>
	   Jimmy Carter was a little-known Georgia governor when his 1976 Iowa campaign
catapulted him onto the national scene and put the caucuses on the political
map.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, Iowa has been an important but often unreliable barometer of
presidential mettle. For every eventual nominee who has won Iowa -- Republican
Bob Dole in 1996 and Democrat Walter Mondale in 1984 -- the state has yielded
many more surprises.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronald Reagan lost in 1980, and his foe George Bush declared he had ``Big
Mo'' heading into New Hampshire. But Bush's momentum dissipated in a high-stakes
debate there and Reagan went on to the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, heading for a last-place finish in Iowa in 1988, left the state to
campaign elsewhere, dismissing the caucuses as ``a real arcane procedure that
produces crazy results.''

<HEADLINE> Streakers Hit Rockefeller Center  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two women -- naked except for their black bikini bottoms --
disrupted a fashion show Monday night by streaking on to the ice at the
Rockefeller Center skating rink to protest people wearing fur.
</P>
<P>
	   Melynda Duval and Anna West donned skates, the bikini bottoms, painted-on
leopard spots and smiles. They carried a paper sign stretched between them
saying: ``Only Animals Should Wear Fur.''
</P>
<P>
	   Their streak momentarily disrupted the Montreal Fashions on Ice Show,
featuring designers Angela Bucaro, Hilary Radley, and Oscar Leopold. Security
staff led the women off the ice after about a minute.
</P>
<P>
	   Kristie Sigmon, of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said both
Ms. Duval and Ms. West were members of the organization. All three women are
from Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Duval has streaked for the cause before, once disrupting the
Thanksgiving Day parade sponsored by Macy's, Ms. Sigmon said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Something like this, it's fun, it's uplifting and it gets people talking
about the issue,'' she said. ``We do have a good sense of humor.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Savors His Iowa Victory  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Flashing a thumb's up, Vice President Al Gore
savored his Iowa caucus victory Monday night and sounded a battle cry to Bill
Bradley: ``We've just begun to fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tipper and I can't wait to get to New Hampshire,'' Gore said in a
telephone call to the state's governor, Jeanne Shaheen, and supporters watching
Iowa returns.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore told reporters that New Hampshire will be ``fought on its own terms.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not derivative of any other contest,'' he said of the
first-in-the-nation primary on Feb. 1 in New Hampshire. ``It stands on its
own.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was leading Bradley 66 percent to 33 percent, according to Voter News
Service, a consortium of the AP and television networks.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, undaunted, said he is prepared for a long road to the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tonight is not an end, but a beginning,'' Bradley said on CNN. ``I'm also
trying to do this in a different way, and that takes time. I'm proud of where we
are tonight.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's aunt, Hardeman Bond, said the boy who was called ``Mr. President''
ever since high school would not be stopped by the Iowa disappointment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a little bump in the road,'' said the elderly Bond, who traveled
from Bradley's Crystal City, Mo., hometown to be with her nephew. ``He'll step
over it and go on.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley began the day hoping for a surprise, as he told a raucous rally of
mostly students at Iowa State University in Ames. A poster there on the wall
summed up the core of his candidacy: ``When was the last time we had a president
we could be proud of?''
</P>
<P>
	   No matter the results in Iowa, Bradley said he had the bankroll to fight on
for the nomination in next week's New Hampshire primary and in the cluster of
state primaries on March 7, which he called the first ``national primary.''
</P>
<P>
	   House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, a Gore booster, voiced some
concern about a protracted nomination fight. ``For the sake of winning the
House, we would like to coalesce as soon as possible, coalesce resources. But I
would never tell any candidate that they should get out,'' said Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore showed confidence in his win in the final days before voting. At his
last pre-caucus rally, Gore looked like a star quarterback taking the field, his
fists aloft, as he hustled down a chute of high school cheerleaders to take the
floor at the University of Iowa gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, consistently trailing in polls here, pumped as much as $2 million
into the state and spent most of the month here. But he did not begin drawing
real crowds -- comparable to the 400 or 500 that greeted Gore at every turn --
until the final days.
</P>
<P>
	   Precious days in the final week were consumed by questions about Bradley's
heartbeat irregularity and whether he had tarnished his ``non-politician''
appeal by going after Gore on decades-old tobacco votes and Gore's tactics in
his failed 1988 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, Bradley campaigned here on the pillars of his campaign:
universal access to health insurance, alleviation of child poverty, gun control
and campaign finance reform. He said he wanted to ``restore some honor and trust
to the system.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Edwards, a Des Moines-area computer programmer, said he favored Bradley
because he ``seems more of an anti-politician than Gore, who's been in the thick
of it for the last eight years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Medical student Erin Roylance, waiting outside Gore headquarters for a
glimpse of the candidate and his wife, Tipper, said Gore's time in the White
House ``gives him name recognition and makes him the best Democratic candidate
to win for us'' in November.
</P>
<P>
	   It was in the thick of Clinton's impeachment that Gore launched his race and
then publicly stumbled as he sought distance from the president, a meaningful
message, a loyal staff, an appealing wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore acknowledged his rocky start. ``Total immersion in this process is
something that I think has been very good for me. I have been able to
communicate more effectively because of what I've learned from the people of
Iowa and New Hampshire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The past few days brought dozens of White House aides and former aides onto
the campaign trail to pitch in for Gore. Officials said the government workers
were in Iowa on personal vacation time.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, Gore sought to turn his resume from the White House, and from
the Senate and House before that, to his advantage. At the same time, he sought
to paint Bradley as a quitter in Democratic fights (he resigned his Senate seat
amid Clinton's battles with the Republican Congress) and a leader who would
focus only on his pet priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I haven't turned my back or walked away from any fight over the past seven
years,'' he said.

<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- A failed bet on a "Star Wars" craze in Britain has left a
publisher with 10 million unsold books and a vacancy for the post of chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
	   British children's books publisher Dorling Kindersley announced Monday that
its chief executive has resigned because of "a seriously misjudged"
overinvestment in books tied to the launch of the latest movie in the saga,
"Star Wars: Episode I, The Phantom Menace."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Caucuses Have Home on Cable TV  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Political junkies intrigued by the Iowa caucuses found
comfortable homes on television Monday. So did the people who wanted to avoid
them.
</P>
<P>
	   CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC provided nonstop, prime-time coverage of the
2000 presidential campaign's first official contest, blanketing airtime with
sound bites, analysis and predictions.
</P>
<P>
	   The major broadcasters essentially stuck to game shows, movies and comedies
-- interrupting only for quick political updates.
</P>
<P>
	   That pattern is consistent with a campaign so far waged largely on cable. A
study last week found that ABC, CBS and NBC evening news programs were spending
far less time on the presidential contest than they did four years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, this marks the first presidential primary season with
three competing cable news programs. Each has drawn strong ratings so far with
debates, and they treated Monday as opening day of their favorite season.
</P>
<P>
	   The cable networks used entrance polling to declare Vice President Al Gore
and Texas Gov. George W. Bush the winners, then struggled for secondary stories:
Did Republicans Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes exceed expectations? Is Bill Bradley
in an unrecoverable tailspin? Is Orrin Hatch out of the race before most
Americans knew he was in it?
</P>
<P>
	   On MSNBC, Lisa Myers noted that it's a game of survival for everyone but
Gore and Bush, who hope to essentially close out the campaign by next week's New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
	   With speculation about who could survive Iowa and who could not, CNN's Judy
Woodruff said, in effect, ``whoa.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't want to make it seem like the whole election's over with,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although analysts were good at reminding viewers that Arizona Sen. John
McCain was effectively not participating in the GOP caucus, there was little
historical context about Iowa's shaky record in picking eventual presidents.
</P>
<P>
	   The expectation game was in full swing, and often a little confusing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Where is the bar about what makes it a moral victory'' for Bradley, Fox
News Channel's Shepard Smith asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Wherever it was, he hadn't reached it, said CNN's Jeff Greenfield. ``There
ain't no way to spin that as anything but bad news for Bill Bradley,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The much-traveled analyst Bill Kristol, who was canned from ABC's ``This
Week'' last month and has since shown up on CBS and NBC's Sunday morning
political talk shows, appeared Monday on Fox News Channel.
</P>
<P>
	   The broadcast stars -- Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather -- all
anchored the evening news from Iowa. Sometimes it seemed their hearts weren't in
it.

<HEADLINE> For the Democrats: Iowa picks fighter Gore over Bradley's fresh  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Flashing a thumb's up, Vice President Al Gore
savored his Iowa caucus victory Monday night and sounded a battle cry to Bill
Bradley: "We've just begun to fight."
<P>
	   "Tipper and I can't wait to get to New Hampshire," Gore said in a telephone
call to the state's governor, Jeanne Shaheen, and supporters watching Iowa
returns.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore told reporters that New Hampshire will be "fought on its own terms."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not derivative of any other contest," he said of the
first-in-the-nation primary on Feb. 1 in New Hampshire. "It stands on its own."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was leading Bradley 66 percent to 33 percent, according to Voter News
Service, a consortium of the AP and television networks.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, undaunted, said he is prepared for a long road to the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tonight is not an end, but a beginning," Bradley said on CNN. "I'm also
trying to do this in a different way, and that takes time. I'm proud of where we
are tonight."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's aunt, Hardeman Bond, said the boy who was called "Mr. President"
ever since high school would not be stopped by the Iowa disappointment.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a little bump in the road," said the elderly Bond, who traveled
from Bradley's Crystal City, Mo., hometown to be with her nephew. "He'll step
over it and go on."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley began the day hoping for a surprise, as he told a raucous rally of
mostly students at Iowa State University in Ames. A poster there on the wall
summed up the core of his candidacy: "When was the last time we had a president
we could be proud of?"
</P>
<P>
	   No matter the results in Iowa, Bradley said he had the bankroll to fight on
for the nomination in next week's New Hampshire primary and in the cluster of
state primaries on March 7, which he called the first "national primary."
</P>
<P>
	   House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, a Gore booster, voiced some
concern about a protracted nomination fight. "For the sake of winning the House,
we would like to coalesce as soon as possible, coalesce resources. But I would
never tell any candidate that they should get out," said Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore showed confidence in his win in the final days before voting. At his
last pre-caucus rally, Gore looked like a star quarterback taking the field, his
fists aloft, as he hustled down a chute of high school cheerleaders to take the
floor at the University of Iowa gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, consistently trailing in polls here, pumped as much as $2 million
into the state and spent most of the month here. But he did not begin drawing
real crowds - comparable to the 400 or 500 that greeted Gore at every turn -
until the final days.
</P>
<P>
	   Precious days in the final week were consumed by questions about Bradley's
heartbeat irregularity and whether he had tarnished his "non-politician" appeal
by going after Gore on decades-old tobacco votes and Gore's tactics in his
failed 1988 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, Bradley campaigned here on the pillars of his campaign:
universal access to health insurance, alleviation of child poverty, gun control
and campaign finance reform. He said he wanted to "restore some honor and trust
to the system."
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Edwards, a Des Moines-area computer programmer, said he favored Bradley
because he "seems more of an anti-politician than Gore, who's been in the thick
of it for the last eight years."
</P>
<P>
	   Medical student Erin Roylance, waiting outside Gore headquarters for a
glimpse of the candidate and his wife, Tipper, said Gore's time in the White
House "gives him name recognition and makes him the best Democratic candidate to
win for us" in November.
</P>
<P>
	   It was in the thick of Clinton's impeachment that Gore launched his race and
then publicly stumbled as he sought distance from the president, a meaningful
message, a loyal staff, an appealing wardrobe.	   Gore acknowledged his rocky
start. "Total immersion in this process is something that I think has been very
good for me. I have been able to communicate more effectively because of what
I've learned from the people of Iowa and New Hampshire," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The past few days brought dozens of White House aides and former aides onto
the campaign trail to pitch in for Gore. Officials said the government workers
were in Iowa on personal vacation time.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, Gore sought to turn his resume from the White House, and from
the Senate and House before that, to his advantage. At the same time, he sought
to paint Bradley as a quitter in Democratic fights (he resigned his Senate seat
amid Clinton's battles with the Republican Congress) and a leader who would
focus only on his pet priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   "I haven't turned my back or walked away from any fight over the past seven
years," he said.

   FORT PAYNE, Ala. (AP) -- Sheriff's deputies who stopped a car during a
hit-and-run investigation said the driver had a young woman's mutilated body
strapped into the front passenger's seat.
</P>
<P>
	   Hayward Bissell of Norwalk, Ohio, was stopped after the Sunday afternoon
accident and remained in custody Monday.

<HEADLINE> Storm Knocks Out Power to Thousands  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Even with a fire in the fireplace, it was a chilly 47
degrees in Bernadette Martin's house Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   And like the more than 100,000 other Georgians still without power after an
ice storm over the weekend, she was worried about temperatures dropping even
lower and the possibility that the electricity may not be turned back on until
Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Martin kept telling her 4-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter, bundled
in winter coats as they played in the living room, that they were on a glorified
camping trip. Outside, the power line drooped next to the driveway, where it
fell after a tree branch knocked it down over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hate to leave the house in case everything freezes,'' Mrs. Martin said.
``But we might have to get a hotel for the kids to keep them warm, if we can
find one of those that has power.''
</P>
<P>
	   The storm spread snow, ice and rain and cut off electricity across much of
the Southeast. More than a half-million customers lost power in Georgia, and
thousands also were blacked out in Alabama and the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
	   Preliminary damage estimates in Georgia were $25 million, according to state
Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine.
</P>
<P>
	   The Red Cross opened 10 shelters in Georgia for people without heat, and
Gov. Roy Barnes declared a state of emergency in 20 counties. Schools from
Atlanta north were closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia got more snow Monday, and the forecast called for temperatures to
plunge into the teens and 20s Monday night. Another round of frozen rain is
expected Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Carolinas also were hit with a new round of snow and ice Monday, with
more than 8 inches falling in some areas. An estimated 44,000 customers remained
without power in South Carolina and three traffic deaths in that state were
blamed on the weather.
</P>
<P>
	   About 3,000 Georgia Power Co. workers have toiled almost around the clock
since the storm hit late Saturday. Yet 51,000 customers -- most of them in the
Atlanta area -- still had no electricity Monday afternoon. An additional 21,000
customers of electric membership cooperatives were without service.
</P>
<P>
	   The effort to restore power was hampered by fallen trees and limbs blocking
streets. In some neighborhoods, one street had power and the next was dark.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Knowing what the weather is going to do stimulates us even more to get the
power back on as quickly as possible,'' said Georgia Power spokeswoman Lisa
Frederick. ``But with the sheer number of people impacted by this and the sheer
size of the area, it's going to take time.''
</P>
<P>
	   The storm and power outages didn't interfere with preparations for Sunday's
Super Bowl, which will be played at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The majority of visitors will be here Thursday or Friday,'' said Andrew
Vedlitz, vice president of marketing for the Super Bowl host committee. ``We may
have had some bars or restaurants without power, but they should be up and
running when we get the big rush.''
</P>
<P>
	   Those still without power struggled to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta resident Amber Vann braved sleet to buy firewood at her neighborhood
grocery store, where all the perishable-goods shelves were empty and the store
was running on a generator.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I got the last bundle, and we need it,'' said Ms. Vann, carrying both the
firewood and her 18-month-year-old daughter. ``I think it's colder inside my
house than it is out here, and I've got four layers on her. I've been everywhere
looking for firewood.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Mellow Mushroom, an Atlanta pizza parlor, fired up its generator and
sold about 300 pizzas in five hours Sunday night, then switched the power source
to the TV so patrons could watch the end of one of the football playoff games.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We might as well be here, because we're still without power at home,''
said Linda Livingston, who owns the Mellow Mushroom with her husband. ``It's not
too bad at home, though, with all the stuff I had left over in case of Y2K that
everyone scoffed at me for.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-W. Va. State Senator Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- A former Democratic state senator was sentenced
Monday to 18 months in prison for accepting a $2,725 bribe to steer West
Virginia Turnpike business toward a towing service.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Charles Haden ordered James Randy Schoonover to
surrender to the federal Bureau of Prisons by Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I apologize to you and the state of West Virginia,'' Schoonover told
Haden.
</P>
<P>
	   At the conclusion of his 18-month sentence, Schoonover will have to serve
two years of supervised release, Haden said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 18-month sentence was the minimum allowed under federal sentencing
guidelines. Schoonover pleaded guilty Sept. 29 to a single count of violating
federal anti-bribery statutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Schoonover attorney Mary Lou Newberger said her client was lured into the
scheme by Steve LeRose, a former mayor of Summersville and former chairman of
the West Virginia Republican Party. LeRose and his brothers pleaded guilty to
unrelated federal charges last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Schoonover resigned his seat the same day federal prosecutors accused him of
accepting the money.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- "Beverly Hills, 90210" will be marked "canceled" after
10 seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   The drama about youngsters living in the upscale Southern California enclave
will wrap up at the end of this season, Fox Broadcasting Co. said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The network had considered airing new summer episodes and bringing the
series back for an 11th season, but apparently was swayed by the cost, now $2.2
million per episode, Daily Variety reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennie Garth, Ian Ziering, Brian Austin Green and Tori Spelling are the
remaining cast members of the ensemble drama that has moved from a high school
setting to post-college as its characters aged.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The tug-of-war over Elian Gonzalez will be the subject
of a four-hour CBS miniseries.
</P>
<P>
	   The network said Monday it hired Craig Anderson, the producer of CBS'
upcoming "Sally Hemings" miniseries about Thomas Jefferson and his slave, for
the story of 6-year-old Elian. No air date has been set.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, rescued off the Florida coast Nov. 25 after his mother and 10 others
drowned attempting to flee Cuba, is involved in a custody battle between his
father in Cuba and relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The network had no comment on how the politically charged story would be
approached, spokesman Chris Ender said. But he called Anderson a
"well-credentialed" producer.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson said he wants to film part of the miniseries in Cuba and hopes
Elian's relatives there and in the United States will cooperate on the project.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tears flowed on the "Donny &AMP; Marie" show as entertainer
Marie Osmond discussed her marital woes.

	   "No outside parties or influences" prompted her to separate from music
producer Brian Blosil, her husband of 13 years, Miss Osmond said at the
beginning of the syndicated TV show Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Although she called the separation "a very private family issue," she said
she didn't want to be secretive about it.
</P>
<P>
	   Donny Osmond, her brother and co-host, cried as he told his sister he loves
and supports her. Miss Osmond fought back tears when she spoke of her seven
children.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, she revealed that after having a baby in July, she left her
family for a few days in a bout of postpartum depression.

day's top business stories, she reminded viewers that her network was also owned
by Time Warner.

<HEADLINE> Bush Certifies Front-Runner Role  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis
By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush emerges from Iowa the certified Republican
presidential front-runner, but Steve Forbes won the role he sought as the
ranking conservative alternative. Al Gore's runaway victory sends him into the
New Hampshire primary trying to bounce past Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's win in the lead-off event of the presidential campaign was a robust
one -- he was gaining about 40 percent of the vote in a six-way field.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor read the results as an ``outpouring of support for my
message of compassionate conservatism,'' yet polling conducted among
caucus-goers suggested he has work yet to do to reach out to some core GOP
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   According to surveys of caucus-goers, Forbes outpolled the Texas governor
strongly among Republicans who cited abortion as their top issue, and more
narrowly among GOP voters who cited taxes as their biggest concern.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's strength came from Republicans who cited moral values and protecting
Social Security and Medicare. Bush commanded the field among voters who said
that the most important quality in a candidate was the ability to win in
November.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' emergence -- he was running second with roughly 30 percent of the
vote -- came at the expense of Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer, as well as Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah, openly contemplating a campaign withdrawal after a last-place
finish.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We vastly defeated the polls and have emerged as the conservative
candidate,'' Forbes said. ``So we've got a big boost going into New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' second-place finish spells trouble, as well, for Sen. John McCain.
The Arizonan sat out the Iowa caucuses, and had hoped for a one-on-one shot at
Bush next week in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   That's unlikely to happen now, given Forbes' strong second-place showing in
Iowa, his limitless pocketbook and his heavy investment in an organization in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   By the numbers, Gore's triumph was bigger than Bush's, roughly 30 percentage
points, and rivaled the beating that President Jimmy Carter inflicted on Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy two decades ago. In Iowa's tortured game of political
expectations, Bradley set that as the standard for the defeat he could absorb.
</P>
<P>
	   By their votes, Iowans reset the clock for next week's New Hampshire
primary. The polling has shown close races between Gore and Bradley on the
Democratic side; and Bush and McCain among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   If history is a guide, the dynamic will change, beginning tomorrow, when the
candidates converge on the Granite state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The playoff,'' McCain called it, as he awaited his rivals in New
Hampshire. In some respects the next eight days are the most intense of the
nominating season, as campaign entourages literally bump into one another.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was careful to say that a win in Iowa didn't mean a win in New
Hampshire, a judicious comment, given the latter state's history of taking
front-runners down a peg. ``I think the New Hampshire primary is unique and not
derivative of any other contest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Gore wins there by even one point, I think it's a big victory for
Gore,'' said House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, who traveled to Iowa during
the day to show support for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   Win or lose in New Hampshire, Bradley has promised to stay in the race until
March 7, the night that the race becomes a fight for delegates as well as
campaign momentum. And since Democrats allocate delegates proportionally on the
basis of the popular vote, and Bradley has several million dollars in the bank,
he is a threat to carry the campaign well into the nominating season.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes had his own spin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll take more losses like that and I'll win the nomination,'' he said as
the Iowa vote was tallied.
</P>
<P>
	   No, he won't.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike Democrats, Republicans allocate their national convention delegates
winner-take-all, based on the popular vote in congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Many more victories like this one, and Bush will be the winner by far, and
soon.

<HEADLINE> Voters: Bush Is Best on Moral Values  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iowa Republicans who backed George W. Bush in Monday
night's Iowa caucuses said he would restore the nation's moral values and viewed
him as a strong leader who can win in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes won the most support of those who thought taxes was the top
issue. He had more than a 3-to-1 edge among those who picked abortion -- but
only 1 in 10 called that their top issue.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Democrats, key groups such as older voters, union members and those
with lower incomes supported Al Gore over Bill Bradley, according to entrance
polls.
</P>
<P>
	   REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
	   Despite Forbes' attempts to paint himself as the choice of conservatives,
Bush got the most support from those who described themselves as very
conservative and somewhat conservative. Commentator Alan Keyes got the support
of a fifth of the self-described very conservative group.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes led among the 25 percent of caucus-goers who thought taxes were the
top issue, getting half while Bush was close behind with the backing of four of
10.
</P>
<P>
	   Moral values were chosen as the top issue by a third of Iowa voters at the
Republican caucus. Behind taxes, tied for third were abortion and Social
Security and Medicare, a group where Bush led Forbes by more than 20 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes fared better than Bush among voters who said the most important
candidate qualities were standing up for beliefs, caring about the average
American and best represents conservative values. Bush got the support of
virtually all the roughly 10 percent of voters who said the most important
quality was being able to win in November.
</P>
<P>
	   DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
	   Gore built his winning coalition with a more than a 4-to-1 lead among the
fifth of voters in the Democratic caucus who thought strong and decisive
leadership was the top quality. He also won more than 90 percent among another
fifth of voters who thought having the right experience was most important.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president won the support of a broad range of voters, with a 3-to-1
edge among voters 60 and older, and almost a 4-to-1 edge among those who
approved of President Clinton's job performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey, fared best among voters who made
more than $75,000. He split with Gore among the one in seven who described
themselves as independents, and among the nearly half who had an unfavorable
view of Clinton as a person.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley led by more than 2-to-1 among those who disapproved of Clinton's job
performance, but fewer than a sixth of voters in the Democratic caucuses held
that view.
</P>
<P>
	   The entrance polls were conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of The
Associated Press, ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox and NBC. VNS surveyed 1,621 voters in the
GOP caucuses and 1,011 voters in the Democratic caucuses as they headed into
precincts Monday night. The poll had an error margin of plus or minus 4
percentage points for the overall Democratic sample and 3 percentage points for
Republicans, larger for subgroups of each.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Raid Finds Fake Documents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- More than a million fake documents, including Social
Security cards and drivers' licenses, were seized during a raid of a
self-storage business, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service said the raid late Friday led to
the arrest of five people who are being held without bail.
</P>
<P>
	   The seizure was related to 1998's ``Operation Fine Print,'' in which 11
people were arrested and pleaded guilty in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan San German, a 34-year-old Mexican citizen, was sentenced to a 6
1/2-year prison sentence earlier this month for running a counterfeiting ring
that supplied illegal immigrants with fake identity documents throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   The counterfeit documents included Resident Alien, or so-called ``green
cards'' issued by the INS.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have dealt another significant blow to the counterfeiting industry,''
said Tom Schiltgen, INS Los Angeles district director. ``This operation will
have a ripple effect as the would-be recipients of these documents are also put
out of business.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Welcomes Foes With Blunt Ad  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LEBANON, N.H. (AP) -- John McCain prepared a blunt welcome for the
Republicans rivals coming to New Hampshire: a new TV ad in which he portrays
himself as the ``one man running for president who knows the military and
understands the world.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I didn't think I was better prepared than Governor Bush, then I
wouldn't be contesting the election,'' McCain, who is even with or leading
George W. Bush in most polls in the state, told reporters Monday aboard his
campaign bus. ``I think I am better prepared than any of the other candidates.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain had New Hampshire to himself for the last time as the other
contenders competed in the Iowa caucuses, a contest he sat out.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain pronounced himself unconcerned about Steve Forbes' strong
second-place showing against Texas Gov. George Bush in Iowa, instead making hay
of the fact that some Iowans supported him despite his decision not to campaign
there.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very happy that 5 percent of Iowans came out and voted for me,''
McCain said on MSNBC. ``Brave souls.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the spotlight falls on New Hampshire, where voters will decide
the nation's first Democratic and Republican primaries in a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Greeting the arriving Republicans will be McCain's 30-second ad, entitled,
``Commander,'' which will be seen an average of six or seven times per viewer,
according to consultant Mike Murphy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``International tensions, hot spots and uncertainties around the globe,''
intones the announcer. ``There's only one man running for president who knows
the military and understands the world: John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
	   The narrator says of McCain, ``As a Navy pilot and POW, he's seen the
horrors of war. As a senator, he's already one of the nation's leaders in
knowing how to keep the peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also took issue with Bush's characterization of them as ``friends.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I won't say that we're 'friends,' but we're friendly,'' McCain told
reporters. ``I can't say that we've had a real deep relationship.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added that Bush is qualified to be president, ``but I feel I am more
qualified.'' Asked why, McCain said: ``my life experiences, my knowledge of the
issues, my grasp of the challenges of the next century.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, still in Iowa, taped his own commercial to run in New Hampshire this
week. Aides said it would remind voters here of his overall record as governor.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also showed that he is not prepared to cede the military issue
to McCain, even though the senator was a Navy pilot and prisoner of war in
Vietnam while Bush served stateside as a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
	   As he has daily in the past 10 days, Bush emphasized his commitment to the
military during his standard stump speech.
</P>
<P>
	   His proposed budget includes $1 billion for a military pay raise, and he
pledges to develop lighter, more lethal weapons, reduce foreign deployments and
ensure that no soldiers have to take food stamps or other public aid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I understand this about morale,'' Bush told an audience at a high school
in Perry, Iowa. ``It's important to have a commander-in-chief who respects the
men and women in uniform and a commander-in-chief who in turn earns the respect
of the men and women in uniform, and that's what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain left no doubt that he would remain in the race at least until March
7, when more than a dozen states, including New York and California, will hold
presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   He expressed no regrets over his strategy of not campaigning in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People of New Hampshire don't pay a great deal of attention to what
happens in Iowa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was already making plans to fly out of New Hampshire hours after the
polls close here Feb. 1. The campaign is working on a South Carolina rally for
the wee hours of the following day, possibly around 2 a.m., a senior campaign
official said.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign also started a new ad in that state Monday featuring Rep. Mark
Sanford Jr., R-S.C., calling McCain a ``conservative reformer'' like Ronald
Reagan and a leader in fighting special interests.

<HEADLINE> Why Iowans Voted As They Did  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A look at why Iowans voted as they did: DEMOCRATS:
</P>
<P>
	   ON THE ISSUES: Social Security/Medicare and education were the most popular
issues, and Vice President Al Gore won support from both groups. He did
particularly well with the former group, taking 75 percent of those votes.
</P>
<P>
	   HEALTH CARE: Bill Bradley has made health care a centerpiece of his
campaign, but just 16 percent of voters said this was the most important issue.
Even among them, Gore took about 60 percent of the votes to Bradley's 36
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   QUALITIES: Bradley made a strong showing among voters who cared most about
having a candidate with new ideas, winning 78 percent of those votes. But just 7
percent of Democrats thought that was the most important quality for a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Most voters were concerned with electing someone who is a ``strong and
decisive leader,'' who has the ``right experience'' or who ``stands up for what
he believes.'' Gore took the majority of each of these groups, though it was
close among those who cared most about standing up for beliefs.
</P>
<P>
	   CLINTON FATIGUE: Those who are tired of President Clinton were more likely
to fall into Bradley's camp. Thirteen percent of Democratic voters said they
disapproved of the job Clinton is doing; of them, 62 percent voted for Bradley.
Nearly half the Democratic voters disapproved of Clinton as a person, and this
group split its votes between Bradley and Gore. Those who approved of Clinton
overwhelmingly supported his vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   LIBERALS: Bradley did better among those who consider themselves liberals
than he did with moderates and conservatives. But Gore still took 60 percent of
the liberal vote.
</P>
<P>
	   INDEPENDENTS: Bradley and Gore split votes of those who considered
themselves to be independents. But those were just 16 percent of voters, and
Gore trounced Bradley among Democrats, winning two-thirds of those votes.
</P>
<P>
	   AGE: Bradley had his best showing among the youngest voters, with 39 percent
of those ages 18 to 29 supporting him. His support weakened as voters aged, with
Gore taking 76 percent of votes among those aged 65 and up.
</P>
<P>
	   INCOME: Bradley did best among those with the highest incomes. About half of
those earning more than $75,000 supported Bradley vs. 39 percent for Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ------ REPUBLICANS:
</P>
<P>
	   ON THE ISSUES: The most important issue to GOP voters was ``moral values,''
which was named by 33 percent of those surveyed. George W. Bush won 41 percent
of their votes, according to early entrance polls. Alan Keyes took a strong 26
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes trounced Bush among those who said taxes or abortion was the
most important issue, but there were not enough of these people to overcome
Bush's advantage on moral and other issues.
</P>
<P>
	   LOOKING FOR A WINNER: Bush trounced the field among voters who said the most
important quality in a candidate was the ability to win in November. Just 12
percent of voters cited this as the most important quality, but Bush took
virtually all of their votes.
</P>
<P>
	   VALUES AND BELIEFS: Forbes did better than Bush among voters who said that
representing conservative values was the most important quality (33 percent for
Forbes vs. 26 percent for Bush), and among those who said standing up for what
he believes in was most important (36 percent vs. 24 percent). Those two groups
represented half of Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
	   AGE: Bush did particularly well with older voters, capturing 55 percent of
the votes of those 65 and over and 65 percent of those over age 75.
</P>
<P>
	   The entrance poll was conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of the
AP and television networks ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN.

<P>
	   AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Students at Iowa State University had a caucus-day choice
that voters elsewhere might envy. On one side of the student union was a rally
for Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush. Across the hall, was a
similar turnout for Democratic contender Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying to turn out the vote, and gain a win in the first voting of the 2000
campaign, Bush implored the students to attend their caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   One student, Adam Manett, a political science major from Brooklyn, Iowa,
said he favored Bush over rival Sen. John McCain because the Arizonan had
decided to skip the state and focus instead on next week's New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm an Iowan -- I was raised here,'' Manett explained. ``He's decided that
Iowa isn't important to the process and that's an insult to me.''
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush was shaking hands after his speech, the two campaigns intersected
for a moment. Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey, who is backing Bradley, came over.
</P>
<P>
	   He wasn't looking for trouble; he just wanted to shake hands and say hello
to the Texas governor.

assuring Vice President Al Gore that he would receive her vote, and that of her
husband Dan Hatka.

	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   THIS DATE FOUR YEARS AGO
</P>
<P>
	   As Republican rivals increased their attacks on Steve Forbes, the publisher
ripped into ``chicken littles and fear mongers'' targeting his flat tax
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking in Waterloo, Iowa, Forbes -- whose personal wealth had been
estimated at more than $400 million -- also discounted the impact a flat tax
would have on his own finances.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me be candid,'' Forbes told a Republican breakfast club. ``Steve
Forbes has been blessed in life. I will do all right if you don't change the tax
code. I will do all right if you do change the tax code.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   MONDAY'S ROUNDUP:
</P>
<P>
	   Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush won the Iowa caucuses,
validating their front-runner status in the first contest of the presidential
election season.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Gore won big over Bill Bradley, while Bush overcame a strong
second-place showing by conservative publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Republican field, Former Amb. Alan Keyes finished third, followed by
Gary Bauer, Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Bradley dismissed suggestions that a poor showing might
be reason to step aside, while Al Gore said what set him apart was that he was a
``fighter.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, saying he was used to the ``great expectations'' surrounding his
campaign, added he was ``taking nothing for granted.'' Forbes declared he would
``feel good about a good, strong second'' in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   TUESDAY'S TRAIL:
</P>
<P>
	   After Monday's Iowa caucuses, every presidential candidate was heading to
New Hampshire for the final stretch to the Feb. 1 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush speaks to the Manchester Chamber of Commerce in early evening. McCain
holds a series of town halls in Conway, Plymouth and Keene. Forbes visits a
factory in Hooksett and attends a rally in Portsmouth. Bauer speaks to the
Nashua Chamber of Commerce and attends rallies and town meetings across the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats Bradley and Gore also visit New Hampshire. Bradley will make a
speech in Hudson and attend an event in Manchester. Gore will be in Manchester
and Nashua.

<HEADLINE> Philly Sports Writers Honor Rose  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN BERGER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With a standing ovation and a wisecrack for baseball,
Pete Rose accepted the "living legend" award Monday night from the Philadelphia
Sports Writers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Rose, a member of the Phillies team that won the 1980 World Series, thanked
the city's fans and media for their honesty and had a punchline for the sport
that banned him for life following a gambling investigation in 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   "Allen Iverson didn't make the Olympic team. I've got that figured out,"
Rose said. "Baseball must have selected that team."
</P>
<P>
	   When a cell phone rang during Rose's brief acceptance speech, he said,
"Quick, answer that. It's probably Bud Selig calling me."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, there was some news regarding Rose's bid for reinstatement.
According to Rose's agent, Warren Greene, the commissioner's office has proposed
several dates next month for a meeting between Rose attorney Roger Makley and
baseball lawyer Bob DuPuy. Rose applied for reinstatement in 1997, but has
received no formal response.
</P>
<P>
	   "All we want is a dialogue," Greene said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also among those honored at the association's 96th annual banquet were
former NBA star Charles Barkley (career achievement), NBA scoring leader Iverson
(pro athlete of the year) and golfer Jay Sigel (most courageous athlete.)
</P>
<P>
	   Rose received support from several speakers, including current Phillies
manager Terry Francona, who played with Rose in 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think a baseball player could ever hope to have a better teammate
than Pete Rose," Francona said. "Pete, whatever you hope for in the future, I
hope you get it man. You've got a fan right here."
</P>
<P>
	   Philadelphia 76ers coach Larry Brown added, "Any athlete in any sport could
appreciate what he's done. We all hope we have players who play hard, play the
right way and respect the game. I think that's the way you played, Pete."
</P>
<P>
	   Rose, joined by former Phillies teammates Bob Boone, Tug McGraw and Larry
Christenson, did not directly address his bid to be reinstated. He did make an
unfortunate reference to gambling.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wanted to come here," Rose said of signing with the Phillies. "I could
have went to Atlanta, I could have went to Kansas City, I could have went to St.
Louis. In Pittsburgh, they offered me race horses. You can bet, if I was
negotiating today and somebody offered me a casino, I'd be right there."
</P>
<P>
	   The banquet included a poignant moment when Philadelphia Flyers coach Roger
Neilson was introduced. Neilson, being treated for bone marrow cancer, got a
rousing ovation as he walked to the podium for a brief speech.
</P>
<P>
	   "You guys over there," Neilson said, gesturing toward the side of the stage
where Rose was sitting. "You've got to have cancer to get a hand like that."
</P>
<P>
	   Selina Gross, Chamberlain's sister, also received an ovation when she
accepted her brother's athlete of the century award.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll leave you with something that he probably would have said," Gross
said. "Do the best you can, while you can, and hopefully you'll be around to
receive your accolades."

<HEADLINE> Senators 3, Maple Leafs 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TORONTO (AP) -- Igor Korolev scored twice as the Toronto Maple Leafs rallied
from a two-goal deficit to tie the Ottawa Senators 3-3 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Korolev, who scored the tying goal early in the third period, has six goals
in his last six games. Mike Johnson also scored for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
	   Daniel Alfredsson, Wade Redden and Marian Hossa scored for Ottawa, which
outshot Toronto 41-28, including 27-10 during the second and third periods.
</P>
<P>
	   Toronto's Mats Sundin had the best chance in overtime, but he couldn't
corral a loose puck in the crease. The Leafs then had to kill off a penalty
assessed to Sundin.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfredsson opened the scoring at 8:15 of the first, putting a blast from the
top of the circle over the glove hand of Toronto goalie Curtis Joseph, who made
38 saves.
</P>
<P>
	   Redden made it 2-0 at 11:25, banging in Yves Sarault's rebound from a sharp
angle.
</P>
<P>
	   The Leafs got on the board at 17:35 when Korolev converted Bryan Berard's
pass from the point on the power play.
</P>
<P>
	   Toronto outshot Ottawa 16-10 in the first, but it took almost nine minutes
to register a shot on Senators goalie Ron Tugnutt in the second.
</P>
<P>
	   By that time, it was 3-1 for Ottawa after Hossa slipped through Toronto's
defense and scored on a rebound 44 seconds into the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Toronto narrowed it to 3-2 late in the second period when Jonas Hoglund
batted the puck out of mid-air to Johnson, who batted it past Tugnutt.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senators lost four defensemen for stretches in the first and second
periods. Chris Phillips fell awkwardly into the boards in the first; Janne
Laukannen needed to rest in the second period because of flu symptoms; Patrick
Traverse had a puck deflect off his face; and Jason York took a stick on the
chin in the second.
</P>
<P>
	   All returned except for Traverse, who was taken to hospital for examination.
Laukannen didn't play in the third period, leaving the Senators with just four
defensemen.
</P>
<P>
	   Toronto left wing Sergei Berezin and defenseman Alexander Karpovtsev
returned to the lineup after extended absences. Berezin missed five games with a
strained hamstring, and Karpovtsev missed four with a broken hand.

Gore, Bush Win Iowa Caucuses
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Opening the presidential election season,
Republican George W. Bush won Iowa's caucuses in a closer-than-expected race
against conservative publisher Steve Forbes. Vice President Al Gore breezed to a
Democratic victory over Bill Bradley and declared, "I can't wait to get to New
Hampshire." Forbes' showing set the stage for a three-way showdown in New
Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary. Sen. John McCain of Arizona holds a slight lead in
most GOP polls in that state, and hoped to sustain it even after bypassing Iowa
where Forbes took advantage. Bush described the caucus results as "a record
shattering" validation of his compassionate conservative agenda.

Fiery Keyes Has Strong Iowa Showing
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Striking a chord with his oratory against abortion
and sinking moral values, Alan Keyes posted a third-place finish in the Iowa
caucuses to claim some bragging rights against Republican rivals with more
money, exposure and experience. "I think it's a good jumping off point," said
Keyes, a conservative talk-show host and former foreign service officer in the
Reagan administration. "I'm sure our supporters will take heart from this."
Keyes, the only black presidential candidate in either major party, outpolled
Gary Bauer, a longtime activist on social conservative issues, as well as Sens.
Orrin Hatch of Utah and John McCain of Arizona.

Grandfathers Rally for Elian
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandfathers were the guests of honor at a
Havana rally for the return of the 6-year-old as his grandmothers sought to meet
with him in the United States. The event occurred today as Elian's grandmothers,
Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana, flew to Miami in hopes of meeting with
the boy, who has been in the United States since Nov. 25, when he was rescued
from a shipwreck that killed his mother and 10 other people. However they left
Miami without seeing Elian due to a dispute over where the meeting was to take
place.

Age Raise for Handguns Defeated
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- A bill supporters said could have prevented violence like the
Columbine High School massacre was defeated by a Senate committee today, despite
the tearful pleas of a 16-year-old girl who escaped the carnage. The bill would
have required safe storage of firearms and raised the legal age for handgun
possession from 18 to 21, two of the gun-control measures supported by Gov. Bill
Owens, a Republican. Committee chairwoman Dottie Wham, a Democrat from Denver,
said it will be tough getting any gun control bills through the
Republican-controlled Legislature, despite the Columbine shootings.

Storm Knocks Out Power to Thousands
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Thousands of Georgians braved another day without power
after an unexpected ice storm walloped the southeast th weekend. Georgia got
more snow today, and the forecast called for temperatures to plunge into the
teens and 20s Monday night. Another round of frozen rain is expected Friday. The
Red Cross opened 10 shelters in Georgia for people without heat, and Gov. Roy
Barnes declared a state of emergency in 20 counties. However, the storm and
power outages didn't interfere with preparations for Sunday's Super Bowl, which
will be played at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.

Thai Forces Storm Besieged Hospital
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   RATCHABURI, Thailand (AP) -- Ending a 22-hour standoff, Thai security forces
stormed a hospital Tuesday and killed nine heavily armed Myanmar rebels who had
held hundreds hostage. The rebels belong to God's Army, a fringe group who took
the hostages to pressure the government to help their beleaguered movement. The
group is from the ethnic Karen minority and is led by twin 12-year-old boys
believed to have magical powers. The twins were not involved in the takeover.

Japan Stocks Fall in Early Trading

	   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen early Tuesday in light

225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 63.44 points to 18,993.27 at the end of the
morning session. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 11,008.17, its
steepest loss since Jan. 4, when it lost 359 points.

No. 4 Syracuse Beats No. 6 UConn 88-74
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- The fourth-ranked Orangemen remained the nation's
only unbeaten team with an 88-74 victory over No. 6 Connecticut today.
Connecticut (13-4, 2-3) was the first ranked team for Syracuse and the Orangemen
responded with an emphatic win. Ryan Blackwell had 18 points and 12 rebounds for
Syracuse, which finished with a 47-31 rebound advantage, while Etan Thomas had
15 points and 11 rebounds. Jake Voskuhl had 19 points for Connecticut, while
Kevin Freeman had 14 and Khalid El-Amin nine.

<TEXT>
<P>
    KENT, Ohio (AP) -- Julie Studer scored 25 points, including a layup that
started Kent on a decisive surge late in the second half, as the Golden Flashes
beat No. 25 Virginia 85-74 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Kent's Bob Lindsay became the first women's basketball coach in Mid-American
Conference history to win 200 games.
</P>
<P>
	   With its first victory over a ranked opponent, Kent (14-4) ran its winning
streak to 11 games. Kent has won 27 in a row at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Three Virginia players fouled out, and Kent was 31-for-36 from the free
throw line. Studer made all 11 of her foul shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Schuye LaRue paced the Cavaliers with 19 points, but Virginia (14-5) saw its
10-game winning streak snapped. LaRue scored 17 of her points in the second half
after playing just four minutes of the first half because of foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   Dawn Zerman scored 21 for Kent.
</P>
<P>
	   Telisha Quarles and Svetlana Volnaya each added 18 points for Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   LaRue's two free throws tied it at 68 with 4:56 left. Studer's layup about
20 seconds later put Kent ahead and Zerman followed with a 3-pointer. Alana
Bader's layup and free throw completed an 8-0 run.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia narrowed Kent's advantage to 78-74 with 1:10 left, but Kent's
points after that all came at the line.

<HEADLINE> Bush 'Humbled, Honored' in Iowa Win  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush pronounced himself ``humbled and
honored'' by his hard-fought Iowa victory and relished the New Hampshire fight
just ahead in his quest for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Publisher Steve Forbes, powered by a well-financed campaign and strong
organization, scored a strong second in the precinct caucuses and said he was
``a very happy man.'' John McCain saved his powder for New Hampshire, where most
polls put him even with Bush or ahead. ``In my view, the game is here,'' he told
supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel great,'' Bush said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``I'm
humbled and honored about the outpouring. ... I'm grateful for the outpouring of
support my message of compassionate conservatism has received and I'm looking
forward to taking it to the state of New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in remarks to supporters in a hotel ballroom, Bush declared: ``The
Americans who began choosing our next president tonight took a stand for a
leader who unites and an agenda that inspires. A messenger committed to bringing
people together, and a message meant for every American.''
</P>
<P>
	   Taking aim at the partisanship of Washington, he added: ``If you are tired
of the bitterness that poisons our politics, come join us. If you think that
government should be less partisan and more practical, come join us. If you are
weary of polls and posturing, of scandals and alibis, come join us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes, a former State Department official and radio talk show host, was
running a respectable third while conservative activist Gary Bauer and Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah trailed far behind with McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   An AP analysis showed that Bush's support was likely to translate into 10
delegates, compared to eight for Forbes, four for Keyes, two for Bauer and one
for McCain. They represent the first of 1,034 delegates needed to clinch the GOP
nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   With 92 percent of precincts counted, Bush had 34,208 votes or 41 percent,
Forbes 25,178 or 30 percent, Keyes 11,861 or 14 percent, Bauer 7,089 or 9
percent, McCain 3,909 for 5 percent and Hatch 857 for 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain declared at an evening Dartmouth College rally: ``The playoffs start
tomorrow and we're going to win those playoffs. We are in for a history-making
seven days.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We really can do this,'' he assured supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, in an interview with The AP, cast himself as ``a conservative versus
two moderates'' -- Bush and McCain -- in the campaign fight ahead. ``I can't
wait,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes said his third-place show was a reward for his firm stance on moral
issues -- including opposing abortion -- and his energetic performance in the
Republican debates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that's really important because when we get down to the general
election, we're not just going to have somebody out there taking a stand,''
Keyes said. ``It's going to have to be someone who can defend that stand and who
can persuade the American people to support it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Showing his confidence as he prepared for the next battleground, Bush took
time out from a campaign stop in Ames to tape a TV ad that will appear in New
Hampshire. It recounts his record as governor and recaps his positions as a
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's voters identified moral values and taxes as their top issues, and
said they voted for Bush because they believe he can win in November, according
to interviews conducted at caucus sites by Voter News Service, a consortium of
The Associated Press, ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN. Among Forbes voters, the top issue
was taxes and the top quality was that Forbes stands up for what he believes in.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes did better than Bush among voters who said that representing
conservative values was the most important quality, and among those who said
standing up for what he believes in was most important. Those two groups
represented half of Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush team hoped that a strong victory Monday and an intense focus in New
Hampshire over an eight-day period would shut down McCain's challenge and winnow
the field. Bush plans to focus next on education, arguing that he has a strong
plan for improving schools and McCain does not, according to Bush aides.
</P>
<P>
	   One Bush supporter was unimpressed with the governor's Iowa showing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Given that Forbes finished so high and Keyes did well, it's kind of turned
it into a three-person race. I think it could affect him going into New
Hampshire,'' said Monty Lockyear of West Des Moines. ``Didn't Gore beat Bradley
by better than 2-to-1?'' Lockyear said, referring to Democratic rivals Al Gore
and Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, was focusing on portraying himself as more qualified to
lead than Bush, running a television ad in New Hampshire that touted his war
record and Senate experience in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   He said of the other candidates: ``I look forward to having them join me in
New Hampshire, where we can continue to debate my conservative reform agenda to
save Social Security, cut taxes, pay down the national debt and restore pride in
the House and our government again.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch issued a brief statement saying he'd be back in New Hampshire this
week. He promised ``a more complete statement'' on the Iowa results Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the first votes were cast, four Republican candidates had quit
the race: John Kasich, Dan Quayle, Lamar Alexander and Elizabeth Dole.

<HEADLINE> Why Iowans Voted As They Did  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A look at why Iowans voted as they did: DEMOCRATS:
</P>
<P>
	   ON THE ISSUES: Social Security/Medicare and education were the most popular
issues, and Vice President Al Gore won support from both groups. He did
particularly well with the former group, taking 75 percent of those votes.
</P>
<P>
	   HEALTH CARE: Bill Bradley has made health care a centerpiece of his
campaign, but just 16 percent of voters said this was the most important issue.
Even among them, Gore took about 60 percent of the votes to Bradley's 36
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   QUALITIES: Bradley made a strong showing among voters who cared most about
having a candidate with new ideas, winning 78 percent of those votes. But just 7
percent of Democrats thought that was the most important quality for a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Most voters were concerned with electing someone who is a ``strong and
decisive leader,'' who has the ``right experience'' or who ``stands up for what
he believes.'' Gore took the majority of each of these groups, though it was
close among those who cared most about standing up for beliefs.
</P>
<P>
	   CLINTON FATIGUE: Those who are tired of President Clinton were more likely
to fall into Bradley's camp. Thirteen percent of Democratic voters said they
disapproved of the job Clinton is doing; of them, 62 percent voted for Bradley.
Nearly half the Democratic voters disapproved of Clinton as a person, and this
group split its votes between Bradley and Gore. Those who approved of Clinton
overwhelmingly supported his vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   LIBERALS: Bradley did better among those who consider themselves liberals
than he did with moderates and conservatives. But Gore still took 60 percent of
the liberal vote.
</P>
<P>
	   INDEPENDENTS: Bradley and Gore split votes of those who considered
themselves to be independents. But those were just 16 percent of voters, and
Gore trounced Bradley among Democrats, winning two-thirds of those votes.
</P>
<P>
	   AGE: Bradley had his best showing among the youngest voters, with 39 percent
of those ages 18 to 29 supporting him. His support weakened as voters aged, with
Gore taking 76 percent of votes among those aged 65 and up.
</P>
<P>
	   INCOME: Bradley did best among those with the highest incomes. About half of
those earning more than $75,000 supported Bradley vs. 39 percent for Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ------ REPUBLICANS:
</P>
<P>
	   ON THE ISSUES: The most important issue to GOP voters was ``moral values,''
which was named by 33 percent of those surveyed. George W. Bush won 41 percent
of their votes. Alan Keyes took a strong 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes trounced Bush among those who said taxes or abortion was the
most important issue, but there were not enough of these people to overcome
Bush's advantage on moral and other issues.
</P>
<P>
	   LOOKING FOR A WINNER: Bush trounced the field among voters who said the most
important quality in a candidate was the ability to win in November. Just 12
percent of voters cited this as the most important quality, but Bush took
virtually all of their votes.
</P>
<P>
	   VALUES AND BELIEFS: Forbes did better than Bush among voters who said that
representing conservative values was the most important quality (34 percent for
Forbes vs. 24 percent for Bush), and among those who said standing up for what
he believes in was most important (32 percent vs. 24 percent). Those two groups
represented half of Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
	   AGE: Bush did particularly well with older voters, capturing 54 percent of
the votes of those 65 and over and 62 percent of those over age 75.
</P>
<P>
	   The entrance poll was conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of the
AP and television networks ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN.

<HEADLINE> After Iowa: On to New Hampshire  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMPTON, N.H. (AP) -- Unlike Iowa, New Hampshire has presidential races on
both the Republican and Democratic sides that are too close to call -- thanks to
independent voters and effective appeals from well-funded insurgents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's going to be very close,'' contended Arizona Sen. John McCain on
Monday after two-fisting his way through doughnuts, coffee and gummy bears
toward his 100th town hall-style meeting, this one in Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls suggest McCain is right. Both he and former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley pose strong challenges in the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primaries -- to
Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore respectively -- in part because
they have spent so much time here and have surged in raising money overall.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore won in a romp over Bradley in the Iowa caucuses on Monday while Bush
took the Republican contest there, although he faced an unexpectedly strong
challenge from Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   Most polls find McCain is tied with or even leading Bush in New Hampshire.
Bush, the Texas governor, has spent more time in Iowa and other states.
</P>
<P>
	   But Forbes, trailing in recent New Hampshire polls, is hoping to turn his
strong second-place finish against Bush in Iowa into a bounce in the nation's
first primaries. ``I'm going to do in New Hampshire what I did in Iowa,'' he
vowed.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's camp was betting that his return to New Hampshire would cut into
McCain's ``time advantage'' because, aides said, their polls point to a rise in
Bush's popularity when he is in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been fighting on multiple fronts and now we won't have to any
more,'' said Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire has a tight Democratic nomination fight as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who has the edge according to several recent polls, will build on his
argument that Bradley would be a bad steward of the economy. The vice president
also will emphasize his own role in Clinton administration successes and pledge
to ``do even better.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Bradley's laid-back style and promise to tackle big problems such as
health care still play well in New Hampshire, which has a history of backing
underdogs. The tone will change this week: Bradley's advisers say he plans to
sharpen his rhetoric against Gore, working harder than ever to draw distinctions
on politics and policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He will talk about it very forcefully and the differences will be very
clear,'' adviser Anita Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa and New Hampshire are potential momentum machines for candidates
looking for traction in coming primary states. This year, the sprint is
especially intense because about three-quarters of the parties' national
convention delegates will be chosen by March 15.
</P>
<P>
	   Granite State voters have a tradition of independence and they want to meet
the candidates in person. Results here don't necessarily foretell an eventual
victory: Pat Buchanan won New Hampshire in the 1996 GOP campaign and Paul
Tsongas won it in the 1992 Democratic race, but both lost the nomination
contest.
</P>
<P>
	   Tsongas' widow, Niki, is featured in a new Bradley ad, telling New Hampshire
voters he is like her husband in supporting working people and ``big ideas.''
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire allows voters to leave their party affiliation undeclared
until they walk into the polling place. It also allows them to change back to
undeclared before they leave.
</P>
<P>
	   The result is more unattached voters than there are registered members of
either major party -- roughly 274,000 undeclared to 265,000 Republicans and
197,000 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Such independence requires the candidates to switch from building
county-by-county organizations in Iowa to running more of a footrace from voter
to voter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We look more at the man than the party,'' said Scott King, 47, a
landscaper in Holderness who used to live in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain skipped campaigning in Iowa in part because he lacked a strong
organization there. He has stayed mostly in New Hampshire, meeting small groups
of voters. A year ago, those meetings drew a few dozen; his 100th Monday brought
out some 400.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is switching from bickering with Bush over taxes to making the case
in a new television ad that he is the only candidate qualified to be
commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush took a break in Iowa to tape an ad for New Hampshire that underscores
his record. Up next for him: a lot more handshaking, especially in the vote-rich
southern tier of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it's all designed to remind people ``elections are not won by polls,
but by people going to the polls.''

<HEADLINE> No. 13 Tulsa 84, Centenary 44  </HEADLINE>
    By KELLY KURT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Tulsa once again put up big numbers -- this time on
defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The No. 13 Golden Hurricane had 13 steals, 12 blocks and forced 25 turnovers
in beating Centenary 84-44 Monday night for its best start in school history.
</P>
<P>
	   Letting up simply isn't in coach Bill Self's vocabulary, his players said.
</P>
<P>
	   "You let up, you're coming out," David Shelton said. "Defense is the only
focus of this team. There is no other focus."
</P>
<P>
	   Shelton scored 18 points for Tulsa (19-1, 4-0 Western Athletic Conference).
Tony Heard had 12 points, all on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Centenary (7-12) shot only 27.9 percent against a team enjoying its highest
national ranking since February 1985, when it was 12th. Centenary's leading
scorer, Ronnie McCollum, who had averaged 24.4 points per game, led the Gents
with 17.
</P>
<P>
	   "From the beginning of the game, coach made us keep in mind that you can't
take anyone lightly," Heard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tulsa sank five 3-pointers in the first five minutes to quickly outdistance
the Gents with a 17-1 run. Centenary's first field goal didn't come until 6 1/2
minutes into the game and the Gents managed only one more over the next seven
minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Golden Hurricane didn't let up after building a 26-point halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Self said the win means nothing unless his team continues to do well.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've got our work cut out this week," he said, as Tulsa plays at UTEP and
Fresno State. "The schedule really begins this week."
</P>
<P>
	   No Tulsa basketball team had ever won 19 of its first 20 games. Tulsa beat
the old record set in 1921 when the team went 18-1 before losing its final game.
</P>
<P>
	   With the victory, the Golden Hurricane extended its winning streak to 12
games, two shy of matching the school record set by Nolan Richardson's squad 15
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Tulsa had averaged 83 points and outscored opponents by 20 points in 11
previous games. Its streak includes five wins at home, four on the road and
three in neutral sites, including an 88-68 victory over 11th-ranked Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   Tulsa's only loss came to crosstown rival Oral Roberts.
</P>
<P>
	   Centenary coach Kevin Johnson said Tulsa's defensive play is the reason for
the Golden Hurricane's 19-1 record, something he isn't looking to face again
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not a Top 25-caliber team and we're playing one," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bulls 83, Pacers 82  </HEADLINE>
    By RICK GANO AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls smothered old nemesis Reggie Miller,
holding him to six points Monday night. And with Elton Brand scoring 28 points
and Toni Kukoc hitting a go-ahead free throw, they stunned the slumping Indiana
Pacers 83-82.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Carr, playing on his second 10-day contract, scored all 17 of his
points in the second half as the Bulls rallied from a 14-point halftime deficit
for just their eighth victory of the season, but certainly one of the most
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pacers, who have lost four of their last five games and four straight on
the road, got a final shot to win, but Rik Smits' short jumper was way short
just before the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   Jalen Rose led the Pacers with 18 points and Mark Jackson and Sam Perkins
had 13 each. But Miller, who has burned the Bulls repeatedly during his career
with last-second shots and big games, matched his season low, hitting just
3-of-14 shots -- mostly against the tight defense of Randy Brown.
</P>
<P>
	   Kukoc, who had 15 points, hit one of two free throws after a flagrant foul
on Dale Davis with 1:59 to play, giving the Bulls an 83-82 lead they didn't
surrender. The Bulls might have taken control earlier had they not missed 14 of
30 foul shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson missed a driving shot with 39 seconds to go before Kukoc misfired on
a jumper with 17 seconds left. The Pacers rebounded and took a timeout with 11.3
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller fumbled a pass, got control and threw the ball to Jackson, who then
fed cross court to Smits, whose short jumper in front of Kukoc was a foot short
of the rim just before the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   Carr rebounded to seal the victory, Chicago's sixth in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Carr scored 11 points and the Bulls went on a 29-14 run in the third quarter
to wipe out the halftime deficit. Brown's defense on Miller threw the Pacers out
of synch and Indiana made only 4-of-22 field goal attempts in the third period
as the Bulls took a 66-65 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller managed just two baskets in nine attempts in the first half but the
Pacers, behind 53 percent shooting and 12 points from Rose, took a 51-37 lead,
despite 18 points from Brand.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bulls missed nine of 14 first-half free throw attempts.

<HEADLINE> Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers leave Miami without seeing the boy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MIAMI (AP) - Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers flew to Miami on Monday in
hopes of meeting with their 6-year-old grandson before they return to Cuba, but
the women left town without seeing the boy because of a dispute over the site of
the get-together.
<P>
	   The boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, and paternal grandmother,
Mariela Quintana, shunned an invitation to have dinner Monday night at the home
of Elian's relatives in Miami, who insisted the meeting take place there.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers wanted to meet privately with Elian at a neutral site.
After flying in from New York, they spent about five hours at the airport before
departing for Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The two women arrived late Monday in Washington where they were scheduled to
meet Tuesday with several members of Congress. The private Lear jet was met on
the Washington airport tarmac and the two women were whisked away in cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of Elian's Miami relatives were planning to travel to Washington as
well.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers left Miami while a group including Elian's two great-uncles
and Ms. Rodriguez's sister were heading to meet the women at the airport. They
did not bring Elian along, and Spencer Eig, an attorney for the Miami relatives,
said they were told the grandmothers had no interest in meeting with the
great-uncles.
</P>
<P>
	   "Elian is disappointed," Eig said. "I know the grandmothers are
disappointed. The situation is heartbreaking for the Gonzalezes."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of Churches,
who sponsored the women's trip, said the grandmothers were scared to come to
Miami because of protests by Cuban-Americans who want Elian to stay in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were frightened. They see the thousands of people here in Miami
marching and protesting and you can imagine as very simple, loving, caring
grandparents that they would be frightened to come," Edgar said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edgar said the women were willing to return to Miami, or go anywhere else,
to meet with Elian as long as there is agreement on a neutral location for a
visit.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami relatives have been caring for Elian since he was found clinging
to an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25. His mother and 10 other
Cubans died in their ill-fated attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled that Elian must be sent
back to Cuba to live with his father, but the Miami family is suing in federal
court to block the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   And on Monday, the first day of the new congressional session, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott and Florida lawmakers introduced a bill to give Elian
U.S. citizenship, which would free him from INS jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers, who flew from Cuba to New York on Friday, had asked
Attorney General Janet Reno over the weekend to arrange a meeting with Elian.
Reno backs the INS decision to return Elian to Cuba, and the Justice Department
tried to arrange for a neutral site for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to the INS, an attorney for the Miami family said a dinner at
the home of Lazaro Gonzalez - Mrs. Quintana's brother-in-law and Elian's
great-uncle - would let the grandmothers "see and feel for themselves how well
Elian is doing and how much he wishes to remain in the United States."
</P>
<P>
	   Elian had spoken by telephone with his father in Cuba and was excited as he
prepared for his grandmothers' arrival, family spokesman Armando Gutierrez said.
The family had bought cameras so Elian could take pictures of his grandmothers,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez said the family would only allow the meeting to take place at the
home.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is where they live. This is where Elian lives," Gutierrez said. "No
budging on that."
</P>
<P>
	   The family had planned to welcome the grandmothers with a dinner of roast
pork, mixed black beans and rice and breaded chicken cutlets, Gutierrez said.
Boxes of flowers were brought into the home. About 300 people gathered outside
holding flowers and signs welcoming the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
	   On NBC's "Today" show, Ms. Rodriguez asked Congress not to give the boy U.S.
citizenship and to let him return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be more painful if he gets the citizenship," she said, speaking in
Spanish through an interpreter. "I'm asking the congresspeople and people of the
United States that have supported us to stop all this. Please, don't make us
suffer any longer."
</P>
<P>
	   Although they said they have not spoken to the boy in five days, Mrs.
Quintana said Elian has told her over the telephone that "he's crazy to go back
to Cuba."
</P>
<P>
	   "He misses everything there. His school, his classmates, everybody - his
father's love. To be able to hug and kiss his father. He tells us every day,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Rodriguez denied that her daughter wanted to come to the United States
and have Elian live here. She said Elian's mother was pressured to make the trip
by her boyfriend, "a very violent person."
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's grandmothers planned to meet Tuesday in Washington with members of
Congress, including Sen. Christopher Dodd, the senator's aides announced. The
Connecticut Democrat is a sponsor of legislation introduced every year to ease
the trade embargo with Cuba that has been in effect for four decades.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Geothermal Energy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration hopes to spur the growth of the
fledgling geothermal energy industry with $4.8 million in research grants.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite its abundance, geothermal energy has so far failed to capture much
of the electricity market.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announced the modest series of grants
Monday for research in California, Nevada, Utah, Texas and North Dakota aimed at
finding and producing the electricity more cheaply. The goal was to have
geothermal energy account for 10 percent of the West's electricity by 2020.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a clean, reliable and renewable energy resource available in all
western states,'' Richardson said. ``I think in the western United States this
is a bonanza.''
</P>
<P>
	   Geothermal energy is generated from water or steam heated by the earth's
magma. The process pollutes less than gasoline or even natural gas typically
used to generate electricity. But the costs of finding drill sites and building
electrical plants have hindered exploration and development so far.
</P>
<P>
	   It is available beneath 17 western states, but is only developed in
California, Nevada, Utah and Hawaii. About 2,500 megawatts of the country's
2,800 megawatts of geothermal power is generated in California. A city of about
200,000 people consumes about 100 megawatts.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Win Iowa Caucuses  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush scored a
closer-than-expected victory Monday night in the Iowa presidential caucuses,
besting Steve Forbes to set the stage for a high-stakes three-way race in the
New Hampshire primary. Democrats gave Al Gore a big win over Bill Bradley who
said he had ``a little more humility'' and vowed to push his challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can't wait to get to New Hampshire,'' was Gore's battle cry and he said
he'd be campaigning Tuesday at dawn.
</P>
<P>
	   The results set the stage for a dramatic week in New Hampshire, first in a
furious flurry of primary elections that could determine the presidential
nominations by March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush described the caucus results as validation of his compassionate
conservative agenda. ``It's a solid victory and I'm humbled,'' he told AP as the
presidential campaigns but the best-possible spins on their finishes. The Texas
governor roused supporters with the vow, ``tonight is the beginning of the end
of the Clinton era.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said, ``we vastly overperformed the polls and have emerged as the
conservative candidate'' going into New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was outpolling Bradley 63 percent to 35 percent, and the former New
Jersey senator said, ``Tonight I have a little more humility but no less
confidence that I can win and do the job.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Bradley were locked in a tie in Granite state polls, and Forbes'
surprise showing makes for a three-way GOP race. Sen. John McCain of Arizona
holds a slight lead in most New Hampshire GOP polls, and he hoped to sustain it
even after bypassing Iowa where Forbes took advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   With results from 93 percent of Iowa's counties, Bush had 41 percent of the
caucus vote and Forbes 30 percent. Former Amb. and talk show host Alan Keyes was
a respectable third at 14 percent, with Gary Bauer at 9 percent, John McCain 5
and Orrin Hatch just 1 -- not even 1,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
	   The process will yield 47 delegates to the Democratic convention and 25
delegates to the GOP convention, a tiny fraction of the total a candidate needs
to win the nomination. Gore won 30 out of the 47 delegates at stake, compared to
17 won by Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   An AP analysis showed that Bush was likely to earn 10 nominating delegates,
compared to eight for Forbes, four for Keyes, two for Bauer and one for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was winning 63 percent of the Democratic vote compared to 35 percent
for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes mounted, and funded, a particularly vigorous campaign here, calling
on fundamentalist and conservative support to challenge the more moderate Bush.
McCain passed up the contest to focus on more independent-oriented New
Hampshire. Keyes bested Bauer in their duel for GOP social activists. Hatch
never gained a constituency and was sure to review his candidacy; he planned a
news conference in Washington on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Advisers said Bauer was deeply disappointed by his showing. Spokesman Tim
Goeglein said the conservative planned to campaign in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's big margin blunted Bradley's challenge going into New Hampshire where
Bradley has polled even with Gore, or even ahead. The former senator from New
Jersey was mum Monday night; a relative said Bradley viewed his defeat as just
``a bump in the road.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign of the tit-for-tat to come, Gore accused Bradley of ``going
negative'' in the final days of the Iowa race -- and said the tactic backfired.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it was a mistake for his campagn to go to the so-called negative
approach but I'm not complaining,'' Gore said. ``But based on what I've heard
from from the voters out here they didn't expect that and didn't like it.'
</P>
<P>
	   The caucuses were expected to draw no more than 100,000 voters from each
party, concluding a lengthy runup of debates, fund raising and grass-roots
campaigning here. Iowa launches the presidential race into a frantic six-week
stretch, with the New Hampshire primary a week away.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowans were attending caucuses at 2,100 sites across the sprawling state. In
a display of basic grass-roots politics, voters here brave the winter weather
and visit classrooms, libraries, fire stations, church basements, grain co-ops
and even a few private homes to play their unique role in the American political
system.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview, Bush said, ``I'm grateful for the outpouring of support my
message of compassionate conservatism has received, and I'm looking forward to
taking it to the state of New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   in Iowa, Bush voters identified moral values and taxes as their top issues,
and said they voted for Bush because they believe he can win in November. Among
Forbes voters, the top issue was taxes and the top quality was that Forbes
stands up for what he believes in. These findings resulted from pre-caucus
interviews conducted by Voter News Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours before the voting, Bradley indicated he was in for the long haul:
``The longer the competition goes, the better chance that candidate is going to
have ... in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
	   Enroute to the early contests, Republicans squabbled over taxes and
abortion, courting religious conservatives who make up a third of the
caucus-going population. Bush carefully calibrated his antiabortion views to
make clear his opposition to the Supreme Court ruling. Democrats were poised to
campaign on the issue if Bush were to win the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Bradley differed in tone more than substance. They wrestled
primarily over alternative approaches to federal health insurance policy. While
Bradley promised to provide big ideas to solve a few big problems. Gore said the
next president should not limit himself to a handful of issues.
</P>
<P>
	   After a ragged start, Gore led Bradley by more than 20 percentage points in
most pre-caucus polls. A string of setbacks, including recurrence of a minor
heart condition, threw Bradley off track in the final week.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, Bush's totals tracked his showing in pre-caucus
polls. Forbes did better than polling had suggested, siphoning off votes from
three others competing for the same pool of conservative votes. Entrance polls
showed that one third of voters who identified themselves as conservative
Christians supported Forbes, another third supported Bush and the remainder were
split among the other candidates.

</P>
<P>
	   Some of Elian's Miami relatives were planning to travel to Washington as
well.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers left Miami while a group including Elian's two great-uncles
and Ms. Rodriguez's sister were heading to meet the women at the airport. They
did not bring Elian along, and Spencer Eig, an attorney for the Miami relatives,
said they were told the grandmothers had no interest in meeting with the
great-uncles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian is disappointed,'' Eig said. ``I know the grandmothers are
disappointed. The situation is heartbreaking for the Gonzalezes.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of Churches,
who sponsored the women's trip, said the grandmothers were scared to come to
Miami because of protests by Cuban-Americans who want Elian to stay in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were frightened. They see the thousands of people here in Miami
marching and protesting and you can imagine as very simple, loving, caring
grandparents that they would be frightened to come,'' Edgar said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edgar said the women were willing to return to Miami, or go anywhere else,
to meet with Elian as long as there is agreement on a neutral location for a
visit.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami relatives have been caring for Elian since he was found clinging
to an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25. His mother and 10 other
Cubans died in their ill-fated attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled that Elian must be sent
back to Cuba to live with his father, but the Miami family is suing in federal
court to block the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   And on Monday, the first day of the new congressional session, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott and Florida lawmakers introduced a bill to give Elian
U.S. citizenship, which would free him from INS jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers, who flew from Cuba to New York on Friday, had asked
Attorney General Janet Reno over the weekend to arrange a meeting with Elian.
Reno backs the INS decision to return Elian to Cuba, and the Justice Department
tried to arrange for a neutral site for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to the INS, an attorney for the Miami family said a dinner at
the home of Lazaro Gonzalez -- Mrs. Quintana's brother-in-law and Elian's
great-uncle -- would let the grandmothers ``see and feel for themselves how well
Elian is doing and how much he wishes to remain in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian had spoken by telephone with his father in Cuba and was excited as he
prepared for his grandmothers' arrival, family spokesman Armando Gutierrez said.
The family had bought cameras so Elian could take pictures of his grandmothers,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez said the family would only allow the meeting to take place at the
home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is where they live. This is where Elian lives,'' Gutierrez said. ``No
budging on that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The family had planned to welcome the grandmothers with a dinner of roast
pork, mixed black beans and rice and breaded chicken cutlets, Gutierrez said.
Boxes of flowers were brought into the home. About 300 people gathered outside
holding flowers and signs welcoming the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
	   On NBC's ``Today'' show, Ms. Rodriguez asked Congress not to give the boy
U.S. citizenship and to let him return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be more painful if he gets the citizenship,'' she said, speaking
in Spanish through an interpreter. ``I'm asking the congresspeople and people of
the United States that have supported us to stop all this. Please, don't make us
suffer any longer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although they said they have not spoken to the boy in five days, Mrs.
Quintana said Elian has told her over the telephone that ``he's crazy to go back
to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He misses everything there. His school, his classmates, everybody -- his
father's love. To be able to hug and kiss his father. He tells us every day,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Rodriguez denied that her daughter wanted to come to the United States
and have Elian live here. She said Elian's mother was pressured to make the trip
by her boyfriend, ``a very violent person.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's grandmothers planned to meet Tuesday in Washington with members of
Congress, including Sen. Christopher Dodd, the senator's aides announced. The
Connecticut Democrat is a sponsor of legislation introduced every year to ease
the trade embargo with Cuba that has been in effect for four decades.

<HEADLINE> Falwell Sues White House, FBI  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) -- The Rev. Jerry Falwell has sued the White House and
the FBI for denying a request for information about him that he contends is kept
in a ``secret'' Justice Department database about religious and anti-abortion
leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, filed last week in U.S. District Court, contends the database
is used to keep information intended for use in smear tactics. Falwell sought
the information last summer under the Freedom of Information Act after being
told of the alleged database by Judicial Watch, a conservative Washington group
that said it learned of the material through an anonymous source.
</P>
<P>
	   Falwell contends that keeping information about him in the database is a
violation of the Privacy Act, which makes it illegal for the government to keep
a file on a person without a lawful reason.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Falwell and several organizations he
founded or has affiliations with, including Liberty University, the Moral
Majority and the Old-Time Gospel Hour.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All of this is to see if any of my father's organizations are in the
database,'' Jerry Falwell Jr., who serves as the senior Falwell's attorney, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI and the White House, in documents filed with Falwell's lawsuit, have
questioned the existence of the database. The documents were responses to
Falwell's FOIA requests.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter regarding Falwell's request, Meredith E. Cabe, an associate
counsel to President Clinton, wrote, ``FOIA does not establish a statutory right
to the records Dr. Falwell has requested from the White House, if such records
exist.''
</P>
<P>
	   Likewise, the FBI's response said a search of its automated records, dating
to 1958, found no information relevant to Falwell's request.

<HEADLINE> Gore Savors His Iowa Victory  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Flashing a thumb's up, Vice President Al Gore
savored his Iowa caucus victory Monday night and sounded a battle cry to Bill
Bradley: ``We've just begun to fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tipper and I can't wait to get to New Hampshire,'' Gore said in a
telephone call to the state's governor, Jeanne Shaheen, and supporters watching
Iowa returns.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley congratulated Gore for a strong showing, but professed to be
undaunted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tonight, I have a little more humility, but no less confidence that I can
win and do the job,'' he told supporters. As for Gore, ``I will be seeing a lot
of him in the coming weeks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said New Hampshire will be ``fought on its own terms'' when the state
holds its first-in-the-nation primary on Feb. 1. ``It stands on its own.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was leading Bradley 63 percent to 35 percent. He claimed 30 of the 47
delegates at stake.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president won support among those who care most about popular
Democratic mainstays -- education, Social Security and Medicare, according to a
survey of caucus goers.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior citizens overwhelmingly responded to Gore's argument that Bradley
would jeopardize Medicare by failing to shore up the program for the baby boom's
retirement. Gore took 75 percent of the votes among those concerned most about
programs for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixteen percent of caucus-goers were independents and, despite Bradley's
direct appeals to this group, he and Gore split Iowa independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had begun the day hoping for a surprise, as he told a raucous rally
of mostly students at Iowa State University in Ames. A poster on the wall there
summed up the core of his candidacy: ``When was the last time we had a president
we could be proud of?''
</P>
<P>
	   No matter the results in Iowa, Bradley said he had the bankroll to fight on
for the nomination in next week's New Hampshire primary and in the cluster of
state primaries on March 7, which he called the first ``national primary.''
</P>
<P>
	   House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, a Gore booster, voiced some
concern about a protracted nomination fight. ``For the sake of winning the
House, we would like to coalesce as soon as possible, coalesce resources. But I
would never tell any candidate that they should get out,'' said Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore showed confidence in his win in the final days before voting. At his
last pre-caucus rally, Gore looked like a star quarterback taking the field, his
fists aloft, as he hustled down a chute of high school cheerleaders to take the
floor at the University of Iowa gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley pumped as much as $2 million into the state and spent most of the
month here. But he did not begin drawing real crowds -- comparable to the 400 or
500 that greeted Gore at every turn -- until the final days.
</P>
<P>
	   Precious days in the final week were consumed by questions about Bradley's
heartbeat irregularity and whether he had tarnished his ``non-politician''
appeal by going after Gore on decades-old tobacco votes and Gore's tactics in
his failed 1988 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, Bradley campaigned here on the pillars of his campaign:
universal access to health insurance, alleviation of child poverty, gun control
and campaign finance reform. He said he wanted to ``restore some honor and trust
to the system.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Edwards, a Des Moines-area computer programmer, said he favored Bradley
because he ``seems more of an anti-politician than Gore, who's been in the thick
of it for the last eight years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Medical student Erin Roylance, waiting outside Gore headquarters for a
glimpse of the candidate and his wife, Tipper, said Gore's time in the White
House ``gives him name recognition and makes him the best Democratic candidate
to win for us'' in November.
</P>
<P>
	   It was in the thick of Clinton's impeachment that Gore launched his race and
then publicly stumbled as he sought distance from the president, a meaningful
message, a loyal staff, an appealing wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore acknowledged his rocky start. ``Total immersion in this process is
something that I think has been very good for me. I have been able to
communicate more effectively because of what I've learned from the people of
Iowa and New Hampshire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The past few days brought dozens of White House aides and former aides onto
the campaign trail to pitch in for Gore. Officials said the government workers
were in Iowa on personal vacation time.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, Gore sought to turn his resume from the White House, and from
the Senate and House before that, to his advantage. At the same time, he sought
to paint Bradley as a quitter in Democratic fights (he resigned his Senate seat
amid Clinton's battles with the Republican Congress) and a leader who would
focus only on his pet priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I haven't turned my back or walked away from any fight over the past seven
years,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Favors Curbs on Tobacco Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- A federal judge has rejected a claim that Massachusetts's ban
on outdoor tobacco advertising near schools violates the tobacco industry's free
speech rights.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge William G. Young on Monday upheld state regulations that
prohibit outdoor ads for cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and cigars within 1,000
feet of schools and playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Young also upheld a state requirement that cigar packages bear health
warnings. But he struck down a restriction on tobacco ads inside retail stores.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a great victory in our effort to combat underage smoking in
Massachusetts," Attorney General Tom Reilly said in a written statement. "The
goal of these regulations is to reduce the influence of tobacco advertising on
children."
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco companies had already agreed to pull billboard ads nationwide to
settle litigation brought by states over the costs of treating smoking-related
illnesses. But the Massachusetts regulations also included a ban on tobacco ads
facing the street from stores near schools.
</P>
<P>
	   John Sorrells, a spokesman for Philip Morris Inc., said the company's
attorneys would study the opinion and decide whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe in commercial free speech -- and that was the reason we
challenged these regulations," he said. "We agree with Attorney General Reilly
that kids shouldn't smoke nor should they have access to tobacco products. But
we also believe strongly that we should have the right to communicate with our
adult consumers."
</P>
<P>
	   Young ruled in December that federal tobacco laws didn't prohibit the state
from placing its own restrictions on tobacco advertising. But Young at that time
did not address the industry's claim that such state bans violated the
industry's right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
	   In January 1999, then-Attorney General Scott Harshbarger launched an attempt
to restrict tobacco advertising under the state's Consumer Protection Act. The
restrictions are scheduled to take effect next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris filed suit in federal court, arguing that the federal
government, not the states, had the right to regulate tobacco advertising. R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson Corp. and Lorillard Tobacco Co. joined
the suit.
</P>
<P>
	   Health warnings in large black-and-white lettering will be required on
packages of cigars sold in Massachusetts. They will say either: "WARNING: Cigar
Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide and Nicotine, an Addictive Drug," or "WARNING:
Cigars Are Not A Safe Alternative To Cigarettes Or Smokeless Tobacco Products."
</P>
<P>
	   California is the only other state that requires such a warning.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an important step forward in informing consumers of the serious
health risks of cigar use," Reilly said.

<HEADLINE> Bush 'Humbled, Honored' in Iowa Win  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush pronounced himself ``humbled and
honored'' by his hard-fought Iowa victory and relished the New Hampshire fight
just ahead in his quest for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Publisher Steve Forbes, powered by a well-financed campaign and strong
organization, scored a strong second in the precinct caucuses and said he was
``a very happy man.'' John McCain saved his powder for New Hampshire, where most
polls put him even with Bush or ahead. ``In my view, the game is here,'' he told
supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel great,'' Bush said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``I'm
humbled and honored about the outpouring. ... I'm grateful for the outpouring of
support my message of compassionate conservatism has received and I'm looking
forward to taking it to the state of New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in remarks to supporters in a hotel ballroom, Bush declared: ``The
Americans who began choosing our next president tonight took a stand for a
leader who unites and an agenda that inspires. A messenger committed to bringing
people together, and a message meant for every American.''
</P>
<P>
	   Taking aim at the partisanship of Washington, he added: ``as I travel this
land, I'm going to have this call to Americans: If you are tired of the
bitterness that poisons our politics, come join us. If you think that government
should be less partisan and more results oriented, come and join us. If you are
weary of polls and posturing, of scandals and alibis, come and join us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes, a former State Department official and radio talk show host, was
running a respectable third while conservative activist Gary Bauer and Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah trailed far behind with McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   An AP analysis showed that Bush's support was likely to translate into 10
delegates, compared to eight for Forbes, four for Keyes, two for Bauer and one
for McCain. They represent the first of 1,034 delegates needed to clinch the GOP
nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   With 92 percent of precincts counted, Bush had 34,208 votes or 41 percent,
Forbes 25,178 or 30 percent, Keyes 11,861 or 14 percent, Bauer 7,089 or 9
percent, McCain 3,909 for 5 percent and Hatch 857 for 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain declared at an evening Dartmouth College rally: ``The playoffs start
tomorrow and we're going to win those playoffs. We are in for a history-making
seven days.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We really can do this,'' he assured supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, in an interview with The AP, cast himself as ``a conservative versus
two moderates'' -- Bush and McCain -- in the campaign fight ahead. ``I can't
wait,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes said his third-place show was a reward for his firm stance on moral
issues -- including opposing abortion -- and his energetic performance in the
Republican debates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that's really important because when we get down to the general
election, we're not just going to have somebody out there taking a stand,''
Keyes said. ``It's going to have to be someone who can defend that stand and who
can persuade the American people to support it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Showing his confidence as he prepared for the next battleground, Bush took
time out from a campaign stop in Ames to tape a TV ad that will appear in New
Hampshire. It recounts his record as governor and recaps his positions as a
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's voters identified moral values and taxes as their top issues, and
said they voted for Bush because they believe he can win in November, according
to interviews conducted at caucus sites by Voter News Service, a consortium of
The Associated Press, ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN. Among Forbes voters, the top issue
was taxes and the top quality was that Forbes stands up for what he believes in.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes did better than Bush among voters who said that representing
conservative values was the most important quality, and among those who said
standing up for what he believes in was most important. Those two groups
represented half of Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush team hoped that a strong victory Monday and an intense focus in New
Hampshire over an eight-day period would shut down McCain's challenge and winnow
the field. Bush plans to focus next on education, arguing that he has a strong
plan for improving schools and McCain does not, according to Bush aides.
</P>
<P>
	   One Bush supporter was unimpressed with the governor's Iowa showing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Given that Forbes finished so high and Keyes did well, it's kind of turned
it into a three-person race. I think it could affect him going into New
Hampshire,'' said Monty Lockyear of West Des Moines. ``Didn't Gore beat Bradley
by better than 2-to-1?'' Lockyear said, referring to Democratic rivals Al Gore
and Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, was focusing on portraying himself as more qualified to
lead than Bush, running a television ad in New Hampshire that touted his war
record and Senate experience in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   He said of the other candidates: ``I look forward to having them join me in
New Hampshire, where we can continue to debate my conservative reform agenda to
save Social Security, cut taxes, pay down the national debt and restore pride in
the House and our government again.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch issued a brief statement saying he'd be back in New Hampshire this
week. He promised ``a more complete statement'' on the Iowa results Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the first votes were cast, four Republican candidates had quit
the race: John Kasich, Dan Quayle, Lamar Alexander and Elizabeth Dole.

<HEADLINE> No. 12 Kansas 89, Colorado 74  </HEADLINE>
    By STEVE BRISENDINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Freshman forward Nick Collison scored 15 points and
grabbed 14 rebounds Monday night as No. 12 Kansas rebounded from its worst loss
since 1990 with an 89-74 win over Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   Center Eric Chenowith's 18 points led Kansas (16-3, 5-1 Big 12 Conference),
which was coming off an 81-59 upset loss Saturday at Missouri.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jayhawks won despite going nearly five minutes without a basket midway
through the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Buffaloes (11-7, 2-4) cut Kansas' 16-point halftime lead to 59-55 on
Jamahl Mosley's basket from the lane with 11:07 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Jayhawks responded with an 8-0 run, in which Kenny Gregory hit two
free throws and broke Kansas' field goal drought with a thundering dunk less
than a minute later, to pad its lead back to 67-55 with 8:34 left.
</P>
<P>
	   After that, Colorado was unable to get the margin below double figures.
</P>

	   Mosley and Jacquay Walls led Colorado with 19 points each. Walls, the Big

games.
</P>
<P>
	   Luke Axtell had 12 points and freshman Drew Gooden finished with 11 for the
Jayhawks.

<P>
	   Kansas led 48-32 after a sloppy first half in which the Jayhawks committed

</P>
<P>
	   The Buffaloes led 18-17 on Mosley's leaner from the lane with 11:11 left in
the half. But they missed their next six shots as Kansas went on an 8-0 run,
part of a 19-5 surge that gave the Jayhawks a 36-23 lead with 4:59 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   That surge closed with another 8-0 run, capped by Kirk Hinrich's 16-foot
jumper.

<HEADLINE> Titans Limp Into Superbowl City  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans limped into the Super Bowl city Monday
night with one starter out, another doubtful and quarterback Steve McNair
hobbled by an aching toe.
</P>
<P>
	   Free safety Marcus Robertson fractured his left leg just above the ankle in
the second quarter of the Titans' 33-14 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars in
the AFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
	   He will be replaced by Anthony Dorsett for Sunday's game against the St.
Louis Rams, coach Jeff Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Receiver Yancey Thigpen, who has a hairline fracture in his right foot,
hopes to play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll list him as doubtful right now," Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   McNair was wearing a plastic walking brace on his left foot, which has been
bothering him for the past two months. He nursed his foot for most of last week
after playing on artificial turf in the second-round victory over Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
	   McNair said his foot is not as sore as it was last week. But he will likely
sit out practice Wednesday to give the foot a little more time to heal.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully, it will get better each day," McNair said. "I don't want to
aggravate it during in the course of the week."
</P>
<P>
	   The surprising Titans are in their first Super Bowl after a 75-yard kickoff
return known as the Music City Miracle and a favorable instant replay call in
the victory over the Colts.
</P>
<P>
	   Pure luck? Maybe. Destiny? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
	   Either way, the Tennessee Titans are in the Super Bowl -- something they
never managed to do in their previous life as the Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a very blessed season that's all I can say," running back Rodney
Thomas said. "Everybody prays for a win, but not everybody gets it."
</P>
<P>
	   Remember, this is the franchise that specialized in losing whether home was
Jeppesen Stadium, Rice Stadium or the Astrodome in Houston, the Liberty Bowl in
Memphis, or Vanderbilt Stadium in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
	   Oilers fans still think officials stole a touchdown from Mike Renfro in the
1979 AFC Championship against the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
	   They went 8-8 the previous three seasons thanks to blown leads and debacles
such as a game against Seattle on Nov. 3, 1996. The Oilers needed only Al Del
Greco's last-second field goal for a victory when Michael McCrary blocked the
kick, setting up a 61-yard TD return. Final score: Seattle, 23-16. In 1998, Del
Greco wasn't even on the field when the Chicago Bears beat Tennessee on a
botched field goal.
</P>
<P>
	   This season, playing as the Titans, things were very different. They
finished 16-3 through the playoffs, a franchise record, and went 9-0 in their
first year at Adelphia Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has come full circle," tackle Kenny Holmes said. "It seems like we're
getting all the breaks."
</P>
<P>
	   It has taken the Titans most of the season to buy into the idea that the
gods aren't against them anymore. Winning five of six games in the final two
minutes during the regular season didn't do it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans trailed 16-15 when they prepared to take a kickoff from the
Buffalo Bills on Jan. 8 in the wild-card game with 16 seconds remaining. Then
Frank Wycheck tossed the ball back to Kevin Dyson, who ran untouched 75 yards
for the winning TD.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas called it divine intervention; others called it luck.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Terrence Wilkins returned a punt to the Tennessee 3 with the Colts
trailing 16-9 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "When the punt return happened, you kind of had that feeling, 'Golly, here
we go again,' " safety Marcus Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Del Greco was yelling on the sideline that Wilkins had stepped out a
couple of times, the first at the Colts' 33. Officials checked the replay and
agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Something would've been wrong with the camera angle the year before,"
Holmes said. "Everything has been going our way. I can't say enough about how
hard we've worked for things to go our way. We create luck. It isn't just
something that happens."
</P>
<P>
	   McNair doesn't buy into the luck theory or that the Titans are a team of
destiny. It's preparation meeting opportunity, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dyson, who scored that miracle touchdown in his first time out with the
return unit, isn't a big believer in luck, either.
</P>
<P>
	   "You start relying on that too much, you end up losing," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maybe not the way this season is going.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy Bill Filed in Congress  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress bestowed American citizenship on Winston
Churchill and Mother Teresa, and awarded it posthumously to Raoul Wallenberg,
the Swedish diplomat who saved tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews in World War
II. But the extraordinary power has been used rarely -- and never for a minor
child against a parent's wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and a group of Florida
lawmakers put in motion a process to give citizenship to 6-year-old Cuban
refugee Elian Gonzalez, without his father's consent.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile the boy's two grandmothers arrived in Washington late Monday from
Miami where they had waited five hours, but were unsuccessful in their quest to
meeting with their grandson.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriquez, and paternal grandmother,
Mariela Quintana, were to meet with several members of Congress on Tuesday. A
number of the boy's Miami relatives also planned to travel to Washington on
Tuesday to present their side of the story.
</P>
<P>
	   The two grandmothers arrived in a private Lear jet late Monday night and
were quickly rushed from the airport in cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott, R-Miss., told the Senate the bill ``to grant citizenship to this young
boy'' could come up for debate as soon as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors hoped to whisk it through Congress quickly, largely to remove the
case from the jurisdiction of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which
has ruled that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba. Passage would
also render moot a federal court appeal of the INS ruling by Elian's
great-uncle, sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This moves the decision-making out of the hands of the INS and into the
hands of the (state) courts,'' Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., the chief Senate
sponsor, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Monday, Mack formally introduced the measure in the Senate, and Lott
invoked a parliamentary procedure designed to bring it before the chamber as
early as Wednesday for debate. A vote Wednesday was possible, but both sides
said they doubted final action would occur until next week at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart declined to say what President
Clinton would do if Congress passed the bill -- sign it or veto it -- but said
the White House would consider the matter after Congress acts. The president has
indicated he does not believe Congress should get involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a real danger here that this can become a political issue, that
this young boy will be a political football,'' Lockhart said. ``And I think the
president has made it very clear to everyone that they ought to stay away from
politics here and stick to what the facts and the law dictate.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Mack said, ``There has been political influence even from the beginning
in the case,'' including rallies in Havana that Mack said were orchestrated by
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Senate Judiciary Committee's top
Democrat, denounced the legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the Congress to grant citizenship to a young boy over the father's
objection makes a mockery of family values, and it hands Castro yet another
reason to portray the United States as the enemy,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Elian's grandmothers, who flew Monday from New York to Miami in
hopes of seeing their 6-year-old grandson, planned to meet Tuesday afternoon in
Washington with Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the senator's aides announced.
Dodd is a sponsor of legislation introduced every year to ease the trade embargo
with Cuba in effect for four decades.
</P>
<P>
	   They also were scheduled to meet with Rep. Joseph Moakley, D-Mass.,
according to the congressman's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the high-profile examples of Churchill, Mother Teresa and
Wallenberg, Congress has used this power rarely and selectively. Its involvement
in individual immigration cases has declined sharply over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about half a dozen private immigration bills are introduced each year,
but most of them deal with advancing a pending case, trying to prevent a
deportation or helping an American employed overseas retain citizenship. Some
examples:
</P>
<P>
	   --In July 1997, Swiss bank guard Christoph Meili won permanent residency
status. He had lost his job after saving Holocaust-era bank documents from a
shredder.
</P>
<P>
	   --In 1968, three men -- from Italy, Ireland and Germany -- who died while
fighting with American units in Vietnam, posthumously received U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   --In December 1975, Mrika Mrnacaj, a 111-year-old Albanian immigrant who
wanted to vote in a U.S. election before she died, won citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   --In 1988, Michael Wilding, the son of actress Elizabeth Taylor and a former
stepson of Sen. John Warner, R-Va., won citizenship. The British subject had
renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1971, and the bill blocked a possible
deportation on a marijuana possession conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   --In that same year, 1988, Congress rejected legislation that would have let
tennis star Ivan Lendl bypass the five-year waiting period for American
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining Mack and Lott in sponsoring the bill for Elian Gonzalez were Sens.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., and Bob Graham, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   In the House, Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas; and several Florida
lawmakers co-sponsored a similar bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Reps. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., and Peter
Deutsch, D-Fla, introduced a rival bill to grant Elian permanent residency
status.
</P>
<P>
	   And Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., introduced a resolution -- co-sponsored by
nine Democrats and one Republican -- urging that Elian be reunited with his
father.

<P>
    TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Peppi Browne converted a three-point play with 27
seconds remaining as No. 9 Duke held off Florida St. 59-54 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blue Devils (17-2, 6-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) have beaten Florida
State (8-9, 1-6) 12 consecutive times.
</P>
<P>
	   Browne, who had a game-high 18 points and six assists, scored on a drive to
the basket and was fouled by Florida State's Shinikki Whiting. Brown made the
free throw to push Duke's lead to 57-54.
</P>
<P>
	   After Florida State missed on its last possession, Duke's Rochelle Parent
made two free throws with two seconds left to account for the final score.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seminoles trailed 54-48 with 3:12 remaining, but scored six straight
points to tie the game at 54 with 1:35 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State then had possession and a chance to take the lead with 48
seconds left, but forward Latavia Coleman turned the ball over when Duke's
Lauren Rice forced a jump ball.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Stevens Charged  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM SALTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- After a night in jail, Kevin Stevens of the New York
Rangers was charged Monday with carrying several grams of crack and was released
on bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens, who could face up to three years in prison on the felony
drug-possession charge, was arrested with a prostitute at a motel early Sunday
in suburban St. Louis after the Rangers played the Blues.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said they found crack cocaine, drug paraphernalia and about $3,000 in
cash in the motel room. The 34-year-old former All-Star, who is married with two
children, was placed in the NHL's substance-abuse program.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not sure how long it will take or when this will be over," said Rangers
general manager Neil Smith, who visited Stevens at the Collinsville, Ill., jail
Sunday. "I just want him to rejoin his wife and kids. That is what's most
important."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the felony charge, Stevens faces misdemeanor charges of
soliciting a prostitute and possessing drug paraphernalia. He was released on
$1,500 bail and is due back in the court in Madison County, Ill., on Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, teammates and Rangers officials offered their support.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anybody who knows Kevin knows he's a quality person," Rangers goalie Mike
Richter said in Atlanta, where the Rangers played the Thrashers Monday night.
"It hits you right in the heart. It's a very tough thing to comprehend."
</P>
<P>
	   Smith wasn't sure when Stevens would rejoin the team. It was not immediately
clear whether he returned to the New York area following his release from jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Pamela Velia, 27, told police Stevens was smoking crack with a glass pipe
when she got into a cab with him. She said Stevens gave her $500 and bought
another $500 worth of cocaine from a street dealer in East St. Louis, Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   The cab driver then took Stevens and the woman to a motel, where the two
continued to smoke crack together, police were told. Police showed up at the
motel after someone reported a disturbance.
</P>
<P>
	   Velia, the cab driver and another man suspected of being the woman's pimp
were also charged with felony drug possession Monday, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just unfortunate this happened," Rangers forward Theo Fleury said.
"All I want is for him to get help."
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens, a winger, has played little recently but was in the lineup against
St. Louis on Saturday night. He has three goals and five assists in 38 games.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-time All-Star helped Pittsburgh to Stanley Cup titles in 1991 and
1992. He scored 54 goals for Pittsburgh in 1991-92 and had 55 in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
	   He has 318 goals and 371 assists in 13 seasons with Pittsburgh, Boston, Los
Angeles and New York.

<HEADLINE> Bush Certifies Front-Runner Role  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis
By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush emerges from Iowa the certified Republican
presidential front-runner, but Steve Forbes won the role he sought as the
ranking conservative alternative. Al Gore's runaway victory sends him into the
New Hampshire primary trying to bounce past Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Thank-you Iowa,'' exulted Bush, and by any standards, his win in the
lead-off event of the presidential campaign was a robust one -- about 40 percent
of the vote in a six-way field.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor read the results as an ``outpouring of support for my
message of compassionate conservatism,'' yet polling conducted among
caucus-goers suggested he has work yet to do to reach out to some core GOP
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   According to surveys of caucus-goers, Forbes outpolled the Texas governor
strongly among Republicans who cited abortion as their top issue, and more
narrowly among GOP voters who cited taxes as their biggest concern.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's strength came from Republicans who cited moral values and protecting
Social Security and Medicare. Bush commanded the field among voters who said
that the most important quality in a candidate was the ability to win in
November.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People of New Hampshire, I'm, on my way,'' he said, looking ahead to next
week's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' emergence -- he was running second with roughly 30 percent of the
vote -- came at the expense of Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer, as well as Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah, openly contemplating a campaign withdrawal after a last-place
finish.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We vastly defeated the polls and have emerged as the conservative
candidate,'' Forbes said. ``So we've got a big boost going into New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' second-place finish spells trouble, as well, for Sen. John McCain.
The Arizonan sat out the Iowa caucuses, and had hoped for a one-on-one shot at
Bush next week in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   That's unlikely to happen now, given Forbes' strong second-place showing in
Iowa, his limitless pocketbook and his heavy investment in an organization in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   By the numbers, Gore's triumph was bigger than Bush's, roughly 30 percentage
points, and rivaled the beating that President Jimmy Carter inflicted on Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy two decades ago. In Iowa's tortured game of political
expectations, Bradley set that as the standard for the defeat he could absorb.
</P>
<P>
	   By their votes, Iowans reset the clock for next week's New Hampshire
primary. The polling has shown close races between Gore and Bradley on the
Democratic side; and Bush and McCain among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   If history is a guide, the dynamic will change, beginning tomorrow, when the
candidates converge on the Granite state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The playoff,'' McCain called it, as he awaited his rivals in New
Hampshire. In some respects the next eight days are the most intense of the
nominating season, as campaign entourages literally bump into one another.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was careful to say that a win in Iowa didn't mean a win in New
Hampshire, a judicious comment, given the latter state's history of taking
front-runners down a peg. ``I think the New Hampshire primary is unique and not
derivative of any other contest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Gore wins there by even one point, I think it's a big victory for
Gore,'' said House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, who traveled to Iowa during
the day to show support for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   Win or lose in New Hampshire, Bradley has promised to stay in the race until
March 7, the night that the race becomes a fight for delegates as well as
campaign momentum. And since Democrats allocate delegates proportionally on the
basis of the popular vote, and Bradley has several million dollars in the bank,
he is a threat to carry the campaign well into the nominating season.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes had his own spin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll take more losses like that and I'll win the nomination,'' he said as
the Iowa vote was tallied.
</P>
<P>
	   No, he won't.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike Democrats, Republicans allocate their national convention delegates
winner-take-all, based on the popular vote in congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Many more victories like this one, and Bush will be the winner by far, and
soon.

<HEADLINE> Bush 'Humbled, Honored' in Iowa Win  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush pronounced himself humbled by his
hard-fought Iowa victory and relished the New Hampshire fight just ahead in his
quest for the GOP presidential nomination. He offered himself as ``a leader who
unites'' with ``an agenda that inspires.''
</P>
<P>
	   Publisher Steve Forbes, powered by a well-financed campaign and strong
organization, scored a strong second in the precinct caucuses and said he was
``a very happy man.'' John McCain saved his powder for New Hampshire, where most
polls put him even with Bush or ahead. ``In my view, the game is here,'' he told
supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel great,'' Bush said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``I'm
humbled and honored about the outpouring. ... I'm grateful for the outpouring of
support my message of compassionate conservatism has received and I'm looking
forward to taking it to the state of New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in remarks to supporters in a hotel ballroom, Bush declared: ``The
Americans who began choosing our next president tonight took a stand for a
leader who unites and an agenda that inspires. A messenger committed to bringing
people together, and a message meant for every American.''
</P>
<P>
	   Taking aim at the partisanship of Washington, he added: ``as I travel this
land, I'm going to have this call to Americans: If you are tired of the
bitterness that poisons our politics, come join us. If you think that government
should be less partisan and more results oriented, come and join us. If you are
weary of polls and posturing, of scandals and alibis, come and join us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes, a former State Department official and radio talk show host, was
running a respectable third while conservative activist Gary Bauer and Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah trailed far behind with McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   An AP analysis showed that Bush's support was likely to translate into 10
delegates, compared to eight for Forbes, four for Keyes, two for Bauer and one
for McCain. They represent the first of 1,034 delegates needed to clinch the GOP
nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   With 92 percent of precincts counted, Bush had 34,208 votes or 41 percent,
Forbes 25,178 or 30 percent, Keyes 11,861 or 14 percent, Bauer 7,089 or 9
percent, McCain 3,909 for 5 percent and Hatch 857 for 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain declared at an evening Dartmouth College rally: ``The playoffs start
tomorrow and we're going to win those playoffs. We are in for a history-making
seven days.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We really can do this,'' he assured supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, in an interview with The AP, cast himself as ``a conservative versus
two moderates'' -- Bush and McCain -- in the campaign fight ahead. ``I can't
wait,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes said his third-place show was a reward for his firm stance on moral
issues -- including opposing abortion -- and his energetic performance in the
Republican debates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that's really important because when we get down to the general
election, we're not just going to have somebody out there taking a stand,''
Keyes said. ``It's going to have to be someone who can defend that stand and who
can persuade the American people to support it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Showing his confidence as he prepared for the next battleground, Bush took
time out from a campaign stop in Ames to tape a TV ad that will appear in New
Hampshire. It recounts his record as governor and recaps his positions as a
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's voters identified moral values and taxes as their top issues, and
said they voted for Bush because they believe he can win in November, according
to interviews conducted at caucus sites by Voter News Service, a consortium of
The Associated Press, ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN. Among Forbes voters, the top issue
was taxes and the top quality was that Forbes stands up for what he believes in.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes did better than Bush among voters who said that representing
conservative values was the most important quality, and among those who said
standing up for what he believes in was most important. Those two groups
represented half of Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush team hoped that a strong victory Monday and an intense focus in New
Hampshire over an eight-day period would shut down McCain's challenge and winnow
the field. Bush plans to focus next on education, arguing that he has a strong
plan for improving schools and McCain does not, according to Bush aides.
</P>
<P>
	   One Bush supporter was unimpressed with the governor's Iowa showing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Given that Forbes finished so high and Keyes did well, it's kind of turned
it into a three-person race. I think it could affect him going into New
Hampshire,'' said Monty Lockyear of West Des Moines. ``Didn't Gore beat Bradley
by better than 2-to-1?'' Lockyear said, referring to Democratic rivals Al Gore
and Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, was focusing on portraying himself as more qualified to
lead than Bush, running a television ad in New Hampshire that touted his war
record and Senate experience in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   He said of the other candidates: ``I look forward to having them join me in
New Hampshire, where we can continue to debate my conservative reform agenda to
save Social Security, cut taxes, pay down the national debt and restore pride in
the White House and our government again.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer acknowledged he was disappointed with his showing but promised to push
ahead in New Hampshire. ``I wasn't raised to be an quitter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch issued a brief statement saying he, too, would be back in New
Hampshire this week, but promised ``a more complete statement'' on the Iowa
results Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the first votes were cast, four Republican candidates had quit
the race: John Kasich, Dan Quayle, Lamar Alexander and Elizabeth Dole.

    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Pat Garrity hit a 3-point shot with 13.5
seconds left as the Orlando Magic snapped an eight-game losing streak by beating
the Vancouver Grizzlies 85-82 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tariq Abdul-Wahad and Chucky Atkins scored 16 points each as the Magic won
for only the second time in 15 games -- both wins coming against the Grizzlies.
Ben Wallace had nine points and 11 rebounds, and secured the victory by blocking
Shareef Abdur-Rahim's 3-point attempt at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando, now 7-1 all-time against the Grizzlies, has defeated Vancouver in
six straight meetings, including a 116-96 win earlier this month in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdur-Rahim led the Grizzlies with 16 points and 10 rebounds, while Othella
Harrington and Michael Dickerson also had 16 points. Vancouver has now lost five
straight overall and seven in a row at home.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grizzlies overcame a 79-70 deficit, cutting Orlando's lead to 81-80 on
Abdur-Rahim's eight-foot jumper with 52.6 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando responded on its next possession when Darrell Armstong fed a
wide-open Garrity, who sank a 25-footer.
</P>
<P>
	   After a layup by Dickerson, Armstrong hit one of two free throws to put
Orlando up 85-82 with 3.6 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Atkins, who averages just 8.3 points per game, scored all 16 of his points
in a seven-minute span in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando scored on each of Vancouver's 11 first-half turnovers. Vancouver
eventually committed 24 turnovers, which led to 37 Orlando points.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Ron Mercer scored 24 points, all in the second half, and the
Denver Nuggets snapped a six-game losing streak with a 110-98 win over the
Vancouver Grizzlies on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   In a duel of teams with losing skids, the Grizzlies dropped their sixth
straight game.
</P>
<P>
	   Mercer also had six assists, four rebounds, three blocked shots and one
steal.
</P>
<P>
	   Nick Van Exel added 18 points and nine assists, Raef LaFrentz had 17 points
and 10 rebounds, and Antonio McDyess finished with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Shareef Abdur-Rahim led Vancouver with 24 points and 13 rebounds. Mike Bibby
contributed 18 points and nine assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Mercer, who went 0-for-4 in the first half, scored 20 points in the third
quarter alone on 8-of-11 shooting as the Nuggets built a 10-point lead by the
end of the period.
</P>
<P>
	   With LaFrentz and McDyess on the bench for most of the period with foul
trouble, Mercer took control.
</P>
<P>
	   He scored 10 points in the first 4:52 of the quarter, making a three-point
play for a 66-57 lead and then hitting a 3-pointer for a 69-59 lead with 7:08
left in the period. Mercer's fastbreak layup made it 84-71, and the Nuggets
carried an 86-76 lead into the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver got no closer than eight points after that.
</P>
<P>
	   LaFrentz scored eight points in the final period as Denver built a lead that
reached 17 points on George McCloud's 3-pointer with 1:54 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver lost backup point guard Chris Herren with a strained left knee midway
through the second quarter. He was scheduled to have an MRI on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver opened the game by missing its first six shots and 11 of its first
12, but the Nuggets didn't take advantage. Denver led only 14-13 before James
Posey hit a 3-pointer and two free throws during a 7-0 run, helping the Nuggets
take a 21-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver shot 55 percent compared to Vancouver's 36 percent in the period, but
led only 27-23 at the end of the first.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nuggets went on a 9-2 run to start the second quarter, opening up a
36-25 lead. But Abdur-Rahim and Lopez each had eight points in the quarter,
helping the Grizzlies draw even at 48. McCloud's 20-foot jumper gave Denver a
50-48 lead at intermission.

<HEADLINE> Voters: Bush Is Best on Moral Values  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iowa Republicans who backed George W. Bush in Monday
night's Iowa caucuses said he was the best candidate to restore the nation's
moral values and viewed him as a strong leader who can win in November.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Democrats, key groups such as older voters, union members and those
with lower incomes supported Al Gore over Bill Bradley, according to entrance
polls. And although Bradley made health care a centerpiece of his campaign, Gore
beat him almost 2-to-1 among Democrats who cared most about that issue.
</P>
<P>
	   REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes won the most support of those who thought taxes was the top
issue. He had more than a 3-to-1 edge among those who picked abortion -- but
only 1 in 10 called that their top issue. Forbes also scored well among people
on a number of candidate qualities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Steve Forbes will be an absolute pit bull when it comes to downsizing
government,'' said Sharlene Dunlap, 33, of Des Moines at the Forbes party. ``In
international affairs, I think he knows all the issues and all the players.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite Forbes' attempts to paint himself as the choice of conservatives,
Bush got the most support from those who described themselves as very
conservative and somewhat conservative. Commentator Alan Keyes got the support
of a fifth of the self-described very conservative group.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes led among the 25 percent of caucus-goers who thought taxes were the
top issue, getting half while Bush was close behind with the backing of four of
10.
</P>
<P>
	   Moral values were chosen as the top issue by a third of Iowa voters at the
Republican caucuses, and more than a third of the voters in that group chose
Bush. Keyes was chosen by almost three out of 10, twice the number who chose
Forbes and Gary Bauer. Behind taxes, tied for third were abortion and the
entitlements Social Security and Medicare. Bush led Forbes by more than 20
points among people who were most worried about Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes fared better than Bush among voters who said the most important
candidate qualities were standing up for beliefs, caring about the average
American and representing conservative values.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bush got the support of almost all of the roughly 10 percent of voters
who said the most important quality was being able to win in November. And he
got the support of more than half of the 13 percent who said being a strong
leader was most important.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought he'd do better,'' Bush supporter Monty Lockyear of West Des
Moines said as he sipped a beer and watched a big-screen TV at a Bush party.
</P>
<P>
	   DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
	   Gore built his winning coalition with a more than a 4-to-1 lead among the
fifth of voters in the Democratic caucuses who thought strong and decisive
leadership was the top quality. He also won more than 90 percent among another
fifth of voters who thought having the right experience was most important.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president won the support of a broad range of voters, with a 3-to-1
edge among people 60 and older, and almost a 4-to-1 edge among those who
approved of President Clinton's job performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey, fared best among voters who made
more than $75,000. He split with Gore among the one in seven who described
themselves as independents, and among the nearly half who had an unfavorable
view of Clinton as a person.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley led by more than 2-to-1 among those who disapproved of Clinton's job
performance, but fewer than a sixth of voters in the Democratic caucuses held
that view.
</P>
<P>
	   He also had a strong showing among voters who cared most about having a
candidate with new ideas, winning four out of five of those votes. But just 7
percent of Democrats thought that was the most important quality for a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   About 16 percent of Democrats said health care was the most important issue.
Among them, Gore took about 60 percent of the votes to Bradley's 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The most popular issues were Democratic mainstays -- education, Social
Security and Medicare. Those who picked these issues also were more likely to
vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The entrance polls were conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of The
Associated Press, ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox and NBC. VNS surveyed 1,700 voters in the
GOP caucuses and 1,078 voters in the Democratic caucuses as they went into
precincts Monday night. The poll had an error margin of plus or minus 4
percentage points for the overall Democratic sample and 3 percentage points for
Republicans, larger for subgroups of each.

<HEADLINE> Titans Limp Into Superbowl City  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans limped into the Super Bowl city Monday
night with one starter out, another doubtful and quarterback Steve McNair
hobbled by an aching toe.
</P>
<P>
	   Free safety Marcus Robertson fractured his left leg just above the ankle in
the second quarter of the Titans' 33-14 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars in
the AFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
	   He will be replaced by Anthony Dorsett for Sunday's game against the St.
Louis Rams, coach Jeff Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Receiver Yancey Thigpen, who has a hairline fracture in his right foot,
hopes to play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll list him as doubtful right now," Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   McNair was wearing a plastic walking brace on his left foot, which has been
bothered by turf toe for the past two months. He nursed his foot for most of
last week after playing on artificial turf in the second-round victory over
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's like a bad tooth ache sometimes," he said. "It swells and aggravates
you at night."
</P>
<P>
	   But McNair said his foot is not as sore as it was last week. He will likely
sit out practice Wednesday to give the foot a little more time to heal.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully, it will get better each day," McNair said. "I don't want to
aggravate it during in the course of the week."
</P>
<P>
	   The surprising Titans are in their first Super Bowl after a 75-yard kickoff
return known as the Music City Miracle and a favorable instant replay call in
the victory over the Colts.
</P>
<P>
	   Pure luck? Maybe. Destiny? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
	   Either way, the Tennessee Titans are in the Super Bowl -- something they
never managed to do in their previous life as the Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a very blessed season that's all I can say," running back Rodney
Thomas said. "Everybody prays for a win, but not everybody gets it."
</P>
<P>
	   Remember, this is the franchise that specialized in losing whether home was
Jeppesen Stadium, Rice Stadium or the Astrodome in Houston, the Liberty Bowl in
Memphis, or Vanderbilt Stadium in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
	   Oilers fans still think officials stole a touchdown from Mike Renfro in the
1979 AFC Championship against the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
	   They went 8-8 the previous three seasons thanks to blown leads and debacles
such as a game against Seattle on Nov. 3, 1996. The Oilers needed only Al Del
Greco's last-second field goal for a victory when Michael McCrary blocked the
kick, setting up a 61-yard TD return. Final score: Seattle, 23-16. In 1998, Del
Greco wasn't even on the field when the Chicago Bears beat Tennessee on a
botched field goal.
</P>
<P>
	   This season, playing as the Titans, things were very different. They
finished 16-3 through the playoffs, a franchise record, and went 9-0 in their
first year at Adelphia Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has come full circle," tackle Kenny Holmes said. "It seems like we're
getting all the breaks."
</P>
<P>
	   It has taken the Titans most of the season to buy into the idea that the
gods aren't against them anymore. Winning five of six games in the final two
minutes during the regular season didn't do it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans trailed 16-15 when they prepared to take a kickoff from the
Buffalo Bills on Jan. 8 in the wild-card game with 16 seconds remaining. Then
Frank Wycheck tossed the ball back to Kevin Dyson, who ran untouched 75 yards
for the winning TD.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas called it divine intervention; others called it luck.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Terrence Wilkins returned a punt to the Tennessee 3 with the Colts
trailing 16-9 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "When the punt return happened, you kind of had that feeling, 'Golly, here
we go again,' " safety Marcus Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Del Greco was yelling on the sideline that Wilkins had stepped out a
couple of times, the first at the Colts' 33. Officials checked the replay and
agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Something would've been wrong with the camera angle the year before,"
Holmes said. "Everything has been going our way. I can't say enough about how
hard we've worked for things to go our way. We create luck. It isn't just
something that happens."
</P>
<P>
	   McNair doesn't buy into the luck theory or that the Titans are a team of
destiny. It's preparation meeting opportunity, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dyson, who scored that miracle touchdown in his first time out with the
return unit, isn't a big believer in luck, either.
</P>
<P>
	   "You start relying on that too much, you end up losing," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maybe not the way this season is going.

<HEADLINE> Gore Savors His Iowa Victory  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Pounding music lyrics proclaimed Al Gore ``better
than all the rest,'' as the vice president savored his Iowa caucus victory
Monday night and sounded a battle cry to Bill Bradley: ``We've just begun to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's on to New Hampshire!'' Gore, grinning and sweaty, declared at his
victory party. He wrapped bear hugs around his wife, Tipper, and two Iowa
officials largely credited with helping Gore's turnout -- Sen. Tom Harkin and
Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley congratulated Gore for a strong showing, but professed to be
undaunted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tonight, I have a little more humility, but no less confidence that I can
win and do the job,'' he told supporters. As for Gore, ``I will be seeing a lot
of him in the coming weeks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore zipped straight from the Des Moines fairgrounds to Air Force Two for a
midnight flight to New Hampshire, whose first-in-the-nation primary on Feb. 1
will be ``fought on its own terms,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was leading Bradley 63 percent to 35 percent. He claimed 29 of the 47
delegates at stake. President Clinton telephoned his congratulations from the
White House residence.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley ``asked the question here in Iowa: 'Are you better off than you were
seven years ago?' And the answer is clearly yes,'' Gore said, aiming for his
share of credit from the nation's prosperity during the Clinton-Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The question now, Gore said, ``is can we do even better? And the answer is
yes.''
</P>
<P>
	   State worker Debra Moore, hoisting a campaign poster to the beat of Tina
Turner's ``You're simply the best,'' enthused at Gore's rally that he had scored
an overwhelming win.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bradley was making great inroads in the state, but Gore pulled it off. On
a one-on-one basis, Gore just made the better argument,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president won support among those who care most about popular
Democratic mainstays -- education, Social Security and Medicare, according to a
survey of caucus goers.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior citizens overwhelmingly responded to Gore's argument that Bradley
would jeopardize Medicare by failing to shore up the program for the baby boom's
retirement. Gore took 75 percent of the votes among those concerned most about
programs for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixteen percent of caucus-goers were independents and, despite Bradley's
direct appeals to this group, he and Gore split Iowa independents.
</P>
<P>
	   No matter the results in Iowa, Bradley said he had the bankroll to fight on
for the nomination in next week's New Hampshire primary and in the cluster of
state primaries on March 7, which he called the first ``national primary.''
</P>
<P>
	   House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, a Gore booster, voiced some
concern about a protracted nomination fight. ``For the sake of winning the
House, we would like to coalesce as soon as possible, coalesce resources. But I
would never tell any candidate that they should get out,'' said Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton telephoned his congratulations from the White House
residence at about 10 p.m. to congratulate the vice president on his showing in
Iowa, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley pumped as much as $2 million into the state and spent most of the
month here. But he did not begin drawing real crowds -- comparable to the 400 or
500 that greeted Gore at every turn -- until the final days.
</P>
<P>
	   Precious days in the final week were consumed by questions about Bradley's
heartbeat irregularity and whether he had tarnished his ``non-politician''
appeal by going after Gore on decades-old tobacco votes and Gore's tactics in
his failed 1988 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, Bradley campaigned here on the pillars of his campaign:
universal access to health insurance, alleviation of child poverty, gun control
and campaign finance reform. He said he wanted to ``restore some honor and trust
to the system.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Edwards, a Des Moines-area computer programmer, said he favored Bradley
because he ``seems more of an anti-politician than Gore, who's been in the thick
of it for the last eight years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Medical student Erin Roylance, waiting outside Gore headquarters for a
glimpse of the candidate and his wife, Tipper, said Gore's time in the White
House ``gives him name recognition and makes him the best Democratic candidate
to win for us'' in November.
</P>
<P>
	   It was in the thick of Clinton's impeachment that Gore launched his race and
then publicly stumbled as he sought distance from the president, a meaningful
message, a loyal staff, an appealing wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore acknowledged his rocky start. ``Total immersion in this process is
something that I think has been very good for me. I have been able to
communicate more effectively because of what I've learned from the people of
Iowa and New Hampshire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The past few days brought dozens of White House aides and former aides onto
the campaign trail to pitch in for Gore. Officials said the government workers
were in Iowa on personal vacation time.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, Gore sought to turn his resume from the White House, and from
the Senate and House before that, to his advantage. At the same time, he sought
to paint Bradley as a quitter in Democratic fights (he resigned his Senate seat
amid Clinton's battles with the Republican Congress) and a leader who would
focus only on his pet priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I haven't turned my back or walked away from any fight over the past seven
years,'' he said.

night and sounded a battle cry to Bill Bradley: "We've just begun to fight."
<P>
	   "It's on to New Hampshire!" Gore, grinning and sweaty, declared at his
victory party. He wrapped bear hugs around his wife, Tipper, and two Iowa
officials largely credited with helping Gore's turnout - Sen. Tom Harkin and
Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley congratulated Gore for a strong showing, but professed to be
undaunted.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tonight, I have a little more humility, but no less confidence that I can
win and do the job," he told supporters. As for Gore, "I will be seeing a lot of
him in the coming weeks."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore zipped straight from the Des Moines fairgrounds to Air Force Two for a
midnight flight to New Hampshire, whose first-in-the-nation primary on Feb. 1
will be "fought on its own terms," the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was leading Bradley 63 percent to 35 percent. He claimed 29 of the 47
delegates at stake. President Clinton telephoned his congratulations from the
White House residence.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley "asked the question here in Iowa: 'Are you better off than you were
seven years ago?' And the answer is clearly yes," Gore said, aiming for his
share of credit from the nation's prosperity during the Clinton-Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The question now, Gore said, "is can we do even better? And the answer is
yes."
</P>
<P>
	   State worker Debra Moore, hoisting a campaign poster to the beat of Tina
Turner's "You're simply the best," enthused at Gore's rally that he had scored
an overwhelming win.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bradley was making great inroads in the state, but Gore pulled it off. On a
one-on-one basis, Gore just made the better argument," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president won support among those who care most about popular
Democratic mainstays - education, Social Security and Medicare, according to a
survey of caucus goers.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior citizens overwhelmingly responded to Gore's argument that Bradley
would jeopardize Medicare by failing to shore up the program for the baby boom's
retirement. Gore took 75 percent of the votes among those concerned most about
programs for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixteen percent of caucus-goers were independents and, despite Bradley's
direct appeals to this group, he and Gore split Iowa independents.
</P>
<P>
	   No matter the results in Iowa, Bradley said he had the bankroll to fight on
for the nomination in next week's New Hampshire primary and in the cluster of
state primaries on March 7, which he called the first "national primary."
</P>
<P>
	   House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, a Gore booster, voiced some
concern about a protracted nomination fight. "For the sake of winning the House,
we would like to coalesce as soon as possible, coalesce resources. But I would
never tell any candidate that they should get out," said Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton telephoned his congratulations from the White House
residence at about 10 p.m. to congratulate the vice president on his showing in
Iowa, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley pumped as much as $2 million into the state and spent most of the
month here. But he did not begin drawing real crowds - comparable to the 400 or
500 that greeted Gore at every turn - until the final days.
</P>
<P>
	   Precious days in the final week were consumed by questions about Bradley's
heartbeat irregularity and whether he had tarnished his "non-politician" appeal
by going after Gore on decades-old tobacco votes and Gore's tactics in his
failed 1988 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, Bradley campaigned here on the pillars of his campaign:
universal access to health insurance, alleviation of child poverty, gun control
and campaign finance reform. He said he wanted to "restore some honor and trust
to the system."
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Edwards, a Des Moines-area computer programmer, said he favored Bradley
because he "seems more of an anti-politician than Gore, who's been in the thick
of it for the last eight years."
</P>
<P>
	   Medical student Erin Roylance, waiting outside Gore headquarters for a
glimpse of the candidate and his wife, Tipper, said Gore's time in the White
House "gives him name recognition and makes him the best Democratic candidate to
win for us" in November.
</P>
<P>
	   It was in the thick of Clinton's impeachment that Gore launched his race and
then publicly stumbled as he sought distance from the president, a meaningful
message, a loyal staff, an appealing wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore acknowledged his rocky start. "Total immersion in this process is
something that I think has been very good for me. I have been able to
communicate more effectively because of what I've learned from the people of
Iowa and New Hampshire," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The past few days brought dozens of White House aides and former aides onto
the campaign trail to pitch in for Gore. Officials said the government workers
were in Iowa on personal vacation time.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, Gore sought to turn his resume from the White House, and from
the Senate and House before that, to his advantage. At the same time, he sought
to paint Bradley as a quitter in Democratic fights (he resigned his Senate seat
amid Clinton's battles with the Republican Congress) and a leader who would
focus only on his pet priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   "I haven't turned my back or walked away from any fight over the past seven
years," he said.

Bush, Gore Victorious in Iowa
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush scored a
closer-than-expected victory Monday night in the Iowa presidential caucuses,
besting Steve Forbes to set the stage for a high-stakes three-way race in the
New Hampshire primary. Democrats gave Al Gore a big win over Bill Bradley who
said he had "a little more humility" and vowed to push his challenge. "I can't
wait to get to New Hampshire," was Gore's battle cry and he said he'd be
campaigning Tuesday at dawn. Bush described the caucus results as validation of
his compassionate conservative agenda. The Texas governor roused supporters with
the vow, "tonight is the beginning of the end of the Clinton era."

New Hampshire Awaits Candidates
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CAMPTON, N.H. (AP) -- Unlike Iowa, New Hampshire has presidential races on
both the Republican and Democratic sides that are too close to call -- thanks to
independent voters and effective appeals from well-funded insurgents. "It's
going to be very close," contended Arizona Sen. John McCain on Monday after
two-fisting his way through doughnuts, coffee and gummy bears toward his 100th
town hall-style meeting, this one in Plymouth. Polls suggest McCain is right.
Both he and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley pose strong challenges in the
Feb. 1 New Hampshire primaries.

Falwell Sues White House, FBI
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) -- The Rev. Jerry Falwell has sued the White House and
the FBI for denying a request for information about him that he contends is kept
in a "secret" Justice Department database about religious and anti-abortion
leaders. Falwell sought the information last summer under the Freedom of
Information Act after being told of the alleged database by Judicial Watch, a
conservative Washington group that said it learned of the material through an
anonymous source. Falwell contends that keeping information about him in the
database is a violation of the Privacy Act, which makes it illegal for the
government to keep a file on a person without a lawful reason.

Cuban Boy Bill Filed in Congress
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of Florida lawmakers put in motion Monday a
process to give citizenship to 6-year-old Cuban refugee Elian Gonzalez, without
his father's consent. Meanwhile the boy's two grandmothers arrived in Washington
late Monday from Miami where they had waited five hours, but were unsuccessful
in their quest to meeting with their grandson. Sponsors hoped to whisk the
request through Congress, largely to remove the case from the jurisdiction of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which has ruled that the boy should
be returned to his father in Cuba. Passage would also render moot a federal
court appeal of the INS ruling by Elian's great-uncle.

White House Backs Geothermal Energy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration hopes to spur the growth of
the fledgling geothermal energy industry with $4.8 million in research grants.
Despite its abundance, geothermal energy has so far failed to capture much of
the electricity market. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announced the modest
series of grants Monday for research aimed at finding and producing the
electricity more cheaply. Geothermal energy is generated from water or steam
heated by the earth's magma. The process pollutes less than gasoline or even
natural gas typically used to generate electricity. But the costs of finding
drill sites and building electrical plants have hindered exploration and
development so far.

Forces Storm Besieged Thai Hospital

	   RATCHABURI, Thailand (AP) -- Thai security forces stormed a hospital Tuesday
and killed nine heavily armed Myanmar rebels who had held hundreds hostage,
ending a 22-hour standoff. The rebels belong to God's Army, a fringe group who
took the hostages to pressure the government to help their beleaguered movement.
The group is from the ethnic Karen minority and is led by twin 12-year-old boys
believed to have magical powers. The twins were not involved in the takeover.

	   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen Tuesday in light trading
ahead of a key speech by the U.S. Federal Reserve chief. The Nikkei Stock
Average shed 63.44 points to 18,993.27 at the end of the morning session. The
Dow Jones industrial average lost 243.54 points to close at 11,008.17, its
steepest loss since Jan. 4, when it lost 359 points.

Bulls Beat Pacers 83-82
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls smothered old nemesis Reggie Miller,
holding him to six points Monday night and stunning the slumping Indiana Pacers
83-82. Chris Carr, playing on his second 10-day contract, scored all 17 of his
points in the second half as the Bulls rallied from a 14-point halftime deficit
for just their eighth victory of the season, but certainly one of the most
satisfying. The Pacers, who have lost four of their last five games and four
straight on the road, got a final shot to win, but Rik Smits' short jumper was
way short just before the buzzer
