LAWSUIT ON BEHALF OF BANK ROBBER TO GO FORWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ A federal judge refused to dismiss a civil
rights lawsuit Tuesday that accuses Los Angeles police of allowing
one of the North Hollywood bank robbers to bleed to death after a
ferocious gun battle Feb. 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Opening statements and testimony could begin today in a case
that questions whether police acted with vengeance or believed it
was unsafe for paramedics to treat Emil Matasareanu.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for the dismissal, an attorney for one of the accused
officers claimed the attorney who brought the lawsuit on behalf of
Matasareanu's two children has no evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``By his own admission, he said he had no facts. It would be
manifestly unfair to let him proceed with the trial,'' said Bradley
Gage, who is representing former Officer John Futrell.
</P>
<P>
   Matasareanu's attorney, Stephen Yagman, told the judge the
deadline for the dismissal had expired, and that he has evidence to
support his claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an absurd, baseless motion,'' Yagman said after the
hearing. ``And I don't even know why it was made.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Christina A. Snyder said she might reconsider the motion
to dismiss, but only after hearing some of Yagman's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to see what evidence comes forward,'' Snyder
said.
</P>
<P>
   Matasareanu died after he and accomplice Larry Phillips Jr.
wounded 17 people while trying to rob a Bank of America. Phillips
died after shooting himself and being hit by police bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses former Officers James Vojtecky and Futrell
of allowing the hulking bank robber to bleed to death and thereby
violating his civil rights. Also named in the lawsuit is the city
of Los Angeles and former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who Yagman
contends encouraged misconduct in the department.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder also declined Tuesday to allow the gag order Yagman had
requested, saying the attorneys were free to speak publicly during
the trial, which is expected to take three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yagman said he plans to call 13 witnesses, including Futrell and
Vojtecky. It remained unresolved Tuesday whether Yagman's first
scheduled witness, Los Angeles Times photographer Carolyn Cole,
would testify. In taking pictures, she got near Matasareanu as he
lay bleeding and saw how police treated him, Yagman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I know of what she saw, she is absolutely the best
witness to set forth all the facts of what happened, Yagman said.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder is expected to announce today the extent to which Cole
can be compelled to testify. Gage said he wants jurors to see
Cole's photograph, which seems to show Futrell standing over
Matasareanu.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows a man of compassion,'' Gage said. ``He wanted to make
sure he comforts the guy and lets him know an ambulance is on the
way.''

FREE THROWS AREN'T
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's nothing the struggling UCLA Bruins do
worse than shoot free throws. They're embarrassingly bad _ and
getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   A 9-of-21 performance Sunday at Syracuse dropped their season
percentage to 58.2. That's 11 percent below the Pac-10 average and
an astounding eight percent below the ninth-ranked team, Oregon
State. Put another way: The Bruins could make 100 in a row and
they'd still trail OSU.
</P>
<P>
   The only player shooting better than 70 percent from the line is
out for the season (JaRon Rush). The starters are shooting 59.4
percent, the reserves 53.5. Even sharpshooter Jason Kapono is
guilty; he's missed seven of his last 14.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Steve Lavin has no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With some guys it's technique, with some it's confidence, with
some it's touch, and with some it's concentration,'' said Lavin,
whose team shot 59.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we shoot between drills. Sometimes we run and shoot.
There are a million philosophies. Dean Smith said don't talk about
(free throws). Some coaches like to (teach players to) visualize.
Some like to bring in shot doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, the crime has cost the Bruins dearly. Three
losses are directly attributable to poor foul shooting:
</P>
<P>
   __ They were 9 of 19 from the line in a one-point loss at
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   __ They were 18 of 27 from the line in a three-point loss to
Cal.
</P>
<P>
   __ They shot 42.9 percent from the line in Sunday's four-point
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shot 200 (per player) before we got on the plane Friday and
we're going to shoot 200 more every day in practice,'' Lavin said.
``We have to keep trying to bring our percentage up. . . . If we're
three or four percentage points better, that could be the
difference in a one- or two-point game.''
</P>
<P>
   Because free throws are tougher on the road and because the
Bruins must win at least one road game to secure an NCAA Tournament
berth, their season depends on accurate free-throw shooting
Thursday at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a comforting thought for a team shooting 51 percent
in conference road games.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rush update: After consulting with Rush's lawyers, UCLA
submitted its appeal of his 29-game suspension last week and hopes
to hear any day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were anticipating a response Friday or Monday and got
none,'' UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis said. ``We left a
message with the person (who oversees the NCAA sub-committee on
appeals) and still didn't get a response.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Up and down: Reserves Ray Young and Matt Barnes can't seem to
play well at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Young, a guard, emerged from a slump to contribute against USC
and Syracuse. Barnes, a forward who played well a few weeks ago,
has struggled lately. He scored 12 points in 26 minutes against
Stanford. In the three games since, he has made one basket and
played 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't done anything wrong,'' Lavin said. ``But because
we're keeping Dan (Gadzuric) and Jerome (Moiso) out of foul
trouble, there are less minutes to go around. As a result, Matt
isn't getting as much playing time.''

FROM MILD BANTERING TO FLORID BULLYING, WITH KEYES IN THE MIDDLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With REPUBS-DEBATE) 
(sw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ For the first 15 minutes, Gov. George W. Bush
and Sen. John McCain exuded all the aggression of a pair of
dowagers at a late-afternoon tea party.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 15 minutes, they made like professional wrestlers,
and were it not for the fortunate positioning of Alan Keyes between
them, they might well have started body-slamming.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in an instant, this transition of the Republican
presidential debate here on Tuesday night from mild bantering to
florid bullying, from cool discourse to contact sport. And it
traced, in miniature, the arc of the Republican presidential race,
once so sedately respectful, now anything but.
</P>
<P>
   Did Bush and McCain ever really get along? If so, it was
difficult to remember as they traded an encyclopedia of facial
expressions, from carefully muted glares to undisguised sneers, and
a bevy of wounded and wounding words.
</P>
<P>
   ``He questioned my trustworthiness,'' the Texas governor said of
the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be ashamed,'' the Arizona senator said to the Texas
governor. ``You should be ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   That was about the tenor of things, and it was left to Keyes,
usually the iconoclast, to articulate what was undoubtedly on the
minds of most observers: Was the nastiness really necessary?
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, referring to the worldwide television audience for the
event, said, ``I really am sitting here wondering, because I said
we were going out to 202 countries, and is this kind of pointless
squabbling really what we want them to see?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about electing the president of the United
States,'' Keyes admonished and reminded his two rivals.
</P>
<P>
   It was perhaps because those rivals, unlike Keyes, actually have
a chance of winning that office that they came to the debate with
such full bags of tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Each claimed a similar dramatic moment by burrowing into his
pocket and pulling out . . . a sheet of paper!
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's case, the document was a flier meant to show that
McCain had not lived up to a recent renunciation of negative
campaigning. In McCain's case, it was a copy of the abortion plank
of the platform from the Republican Party's 1992 convention, and it
was intended to expose bits of fuzziness or internal
inconsistencies in Bush's position.
</P>
<P>
   But the details mattered less than the gesture, which carried
its own message: I am about to reveal what a sham my opponent
really is, and here is the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   What was remarkable, in the course of it, was how alike the two
men came to seem: a bit petty, a bit self-pitying, more than a bit
smug. They brought out the worst in each other, including a shared
distaste for being interrupted or cut short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just finish up, O.K.?'' McCain complained at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just say, let me just say,'' Bush stuttered moments
later.
</P>
<P>
   Like teen-agers, they ridiculed each other's friends as uncool.
McCain noted that Bush had hung out on the campaign with a Vietnam
veteran with a record of mean statements about Bush's own father.
Bush noted that McCain was tight with former Sen. Warren Rudman,
who Bush said had once called members of the Christian Coalition
bigots.
</P>
<P>
   Getting in on the action, the moderator, Larry King, chimed in:
``You're not popular in the Senate.'' The comment was directed at
McCain, and it rendered the ``Clueless'' atmosphere complete.
</P>
<P>
   There were seemingly clueless moments as well. Bush seemed to
forget that the Republican nominee gets formally selected in
August. ``I intend to try to win the nomination in the fall as
well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Metaphors were ripe for the taking: A group of Bush's aides were
in a room at the fairgrounds, just across the street, to watch the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, an interactive research group called SpeakOut.com
had assembled 46 South Carolina voters and given them little dials
with which to register their positive or negative feelings about
the candidates as the debate progressed.
</P>
<P>
   News flash: the dial jockeys liked Keyes the best, seemingly
endorsing his midstream review of the event and all the negativity
between Bush and McCain that preceded and surrounded it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people need to start thinking about whether this is
the kind of spectacle that actually characterizes a serious
political process,'' Keyes said, ``because I don't think it is.''

SOME BUMPER CROP DOWN ON THIS FARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Don't be surprised if right there on Riviera
Country Club's practice greens, Stanford's fraternity, Phi Beta
Birdies, convenes for its five-year reunion this week.
</P>
<P>
   Three members of the Cardinal's 1994-95 golf team are entered in
the Nissan Open: Notah Begay III, Casey Martin and Tiger Woods.
Together they account for 19 victories on PGA Tour courses and one
monumental victory against the PGA Tour in court.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford doesn't boast the only golfing honors fraternity on
tour. The top-300 register includes five UCLA Bruins who played
together in the early 1980s (Jay Delsing, Steve Pate, Corey Pavin,
Tom Pernice and Duffy Waldorf). Stanford sticks out because, until
recently, its golfing Greeks were largely lost among the computer
geeks and SAT freaks. Woods gets credit for putting Stanford golf
on the map, though anybody who buys that ought to brush up on his
geography.
</P>
<P>
   That's so silly, it's like saying there was no rock and roll
before the Beatles, no exposed midriffs before Britney Spears, no
reason for watching the NBA before Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the Farm produced a pretty fair golfer by the name of
Tom Watson. Twenty-three years later, the Cardinal would arrive on
the national intercollegiate scene right before Woods did.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993-94 squad won the NCAA team title. The next year, with
Woods leading the charge, the Cardinal settled for second after
losing a one-hole playoff to Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man,'' Begay kidded Woods at the time, ``you come here and we
get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, playing on a withered right leg rendered nearly brittle
by a birth defect, was the squad's inspirational leader. Begay and
Woods both can recall bunking with Martin on the road at various
times during the school year and being shaken into silence when
they got a glimpse of Martin's enduring reality.
</P>
<P>
   The three of them would talk about reuniting one day on the PGA
Tour, but, privately, they all wondered if Martin's leg would stand
in his way.
</P>
<P>
   The sports world is filled with players who fold when adversity
has them in a headlock. Martin is not one of them. He pinned self-
pity by earning his PGA playing privileges last fall. Martin
finished 14th on the Nike Tour money list to secure his touring
card after successfully suing the PGA Tour for the right to ride a
cart during competitive rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Until Woods came along, Begay held sway as Stanford's best
player. He shot a 10-under-par 62 at Stonebridge Country Club,
outside Dallas, during the 1994 NCAA Tournament to set the existing
single-round record (and presage his 59 on the Nike Tour).
</P>
<P>
   The three-time All America selection was the one player from
that NCAA championship squad whose game seemed preordained for the
PGA Tour. It was written in his name, for goodness sakes, Notah
meaning ``almost there''in Navajo.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Begay, 28, took the long way to Stanford. A full-
blooded Native Ameican (he is part San Felipe Pueblo, Navajo and
Isleta Pueblo), Begay came from a broken home and grew up in an
austere adobe house on the Isleta Pueblo Reservation in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he got to college, Begay had played through
countless hazards, poverty and prejudice chief among them.
</P>
<P>
   He could have resented the only child of the doting parents from
the comfortable, middle-class background who was tearing up the
junior golf circuit. The sports world is filled with prima donnas
who'd sooner quit than relinquish the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Begay is not one of them; he recruited Woods hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Man, you've got to go to Stanford,' '' Begay
recalled. ``I told him if he got there, it was going to be
something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods didn't require much arm twisting. Stanford coach Wally
Goodwin had been corresponding with Woods since the golfer wrote to
him in the seventh grade asking, ``What do I have to do to go to
Stanford?''
</P>
<P>
   By his senior year at Anaheim's Western High, Woods had narrowed
his college choices to UNLV, Arizona State and Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   He visited all three campuses. Stanford rolled out a sleeping
bag but no red carpet. Woods slept on the floor of a golfer's dorm
room during his stay, same as any other recruit.
</P>
<P>
   The sports world is filled with prima donnas who would have
balked at being denied special treatment and would have run for the
campus where the boy could be King.
</P>
<P>
   Not Woods. He chose Stanford specifically because he could blend
into a student body where amazing is average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't a celebrity at Stanford,'' he has said. ``That's why
I loved the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 24, carried his teammates' bags as a freshman, per a
longstanding tradition, and also carried the team. He won 11
tournaments in two years, capping his collegiate career, as it
were, with the 1996 NCAA indvidual crown. He was the second
Stanford player to take individual NCAA honors, after Frank Tatum
Jr. in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped out of Stanford to turn pro before his junior year.
Woods left the program in good hands, with Joel Kriebel carrying on
the legacy Woods helped champion and passing it on, torch-like, to
Ron Won, who last year broke Woods's high school CIF single-round
mark.
</P>
<P>
   When Martin, Begay and Woods get together now, they have tons to
talk about. The Cardinal's basketball team is No. 2 in the country,
the football team is the reigning Pacific-10 champion, the baseball
team was rankedNo. 1 in the preseason. It makes them exceedingly
proud to know that for all they have accomplished individually,
they are part of something much, much bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of like Tiger is setting the standard out here,'' Begay
said, ``Stanford is setting the standard for [collegiate] academic
and athletic excellence. It's a magical place.''

JONES, KOBE FINALLY TO MEET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In the half-dozen years they've known each other, Kobe
Bryant and Eddie Jones have gone head to head hundreds of times.
Just not in a game that counted in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   That changes tonight, when the Lakers play in Charlotte and
former teammates Bryant and Jones will be guarding each other every
step of the way. It's the second matchup of the year between the
Lakers and Hornets, but Jones was injured for the last one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be fun, man. It's going to be interesting to
watch,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a challenge playing against E.J.,'' Bryant
said. ``It's a challenge I look forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair have known each other since Jones was at Temple and
Bryant at nearby Lower Merion High in Philadelphia, and they became
close friends when Bryant joined Jones on the Lakers in 1996. Then
the friendly battles began, everyday at practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won all of them,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Responded Bryant: ``Y'all know Eddie likes to lie a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   So who won the majority of the time?
</P>
<P>
   ``I did,'' Bryant said. ``I used to pound Eddie. The way Eddie
would beat me is his mental game was so much tougher than mine.
He's a very smart defender, he's very heady. He can fool you into
doing things that you really don't want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers traded Jones and Elden Campbell to Charlotte last
March for Glen Rice, and Bryant and Jones have played each other
just once since _ in Sunday's All-Star Game. But that was hardly a
serious affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just fun,'' Bryant said. ``I told him I forgot how much
he likes to reach. Every time he goes by me, he's reaching for the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones looks forward to seeing Bryant but said he won't have any
emotions facing his old team for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``None whatsoever,'' he said. ``It's just another game, just
like I was playing Cleveland or whoever. Of course I want to win. I
may put a lot more into that game, but it's just going to be
another game for me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Slowdown: Coach Phil Jackson continues to keep an eye on Ron
Harper's 36-year-old legs, and he hopes to keep his minutes down in
the second half of the season to preserve him for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to see how Ron plays,'' Jackson said. ``If he
plays well, he's got to play, because the nights that he moves
right, he's a great player for us. And if his legs are bothering
him or he's not altogether there, then I start to make
substitutions. But he's held us together for a lot of games and
I've got to watch him a little bit down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Bull played just 22 minutes Tuesday night in his
first return to Chicago and got six rebounds and five assists but
struggled with his shot, going 1 for 7 for three points.

BUSH, McCAIN EXCHANGE JABS ON NEGATIVE TACTICS 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
and R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ George W. Bush and John McCain, sniping their
way through a crucial debate Tuesday night, hammered each other's
negative campaign tactics in a heated assault.
</P>
<P>
   Both leading candidates for the Republican presidential
nomination objected to being likened to President Clinton by the
other's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't equate my integrity and trustworthiness to Bill
Clinton's.'' Bush told McCain early in the 90-minute exchange.
``That's about as low a blow as you can give in the Republican
primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was referring to a McCain television ad, which the Arizona
senator dropped as the negative tit-for-tat boiled over last week.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was ``beat up very badly'' by Bush surrogates,
``called Clinton, called Clinton-Lite ..., called a hypocrite.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the almost evangelical style he has adopted over the
last week, Bush was more assertive in stating positions and holding
his own than he had been in previous debates. Except when the issue
was negative campaigning, McCain seemed as if he were trying to
appear more placid and mature _ once using ``grown up'' to contrast
one of his positions to that of the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   The nationally televised debate came four days before the
critical South Carolina Republican primary in which Bush needs a
victory to redeem himself after the trouncing McCain gave him in
New Hampshire. McCain needs to win to show that his 19-point
victory in the Granite State was not a fluke. The debate was the
only major joint appearance for the two candidates between the New
Hampshire vote and the first Southern test of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won the opening caucuses in Iowa and Delaware's primary
Feb. 8, contests in which McCain did not actively campaign. After
South Carolina's vote, the race moves quickly to other regions,
with primaries Tuesday in Michigan and Arizona, states where Bush
had led earlier in the campaign but where polls now show McCain
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent polls of likely voters in South Carolina gave Bush a
narrow lead. In a Los Angeles Time poll published Monday, Bush and
McCain were in a statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   Former Reagan administration official Alan Keyes also
participated in the debate, although polls indicate he is not a
major factor in the Republican race at this point. Keyes' principal
role was as a Greek chorus, tsk-tsking against McCain's and Bush's
``kind of pointless squabbling.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes criticized Bush for kicking off his South Carolina
campaign by appearing at Bob Jones University in Greenville and not
condemning the school's policy against interracial dating. Bush
denounced the policy only when asked about it later by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, a black man married to a woman from India, noted that he
used his speech at the school to denounce its ``demons of racial
bigotry and religious bigotry.'' He said confronting the issue on
an ``if asked'' basis was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he had not been invited to speak at Bob Jones, but
contended that if he had spoken there, he would have vocally
opposed the ban and was prepared to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, what you're doing in this ban on interracial dating is
stupid, it's idiotic and it is incredibly cruel to many people,''
said McCain, pointing out he has an adopted daughter from
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   The debate covered a range of issues. Bush described _ and
McCain faulted _ the governor's plan on campaign-finance reform
unveiled earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When the debate first turned to negative campaigning, Bush
blamed himself for not answering McCain quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of smiled my way through the early primaries, and I got
defined,'' Bush said. ``I'm not going to get defined.''
</P>
<P>
   As the exchange continued, McCain grew more agitated, saying
that ``what really went over the line'' was Bush sponsoring a
campaign event at which a member of ``a fringe veterans' group''
said McCain had abandoned veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I don't know if you can understand this, George, but that
really hurts,'' said McCain, who was a POW for almost six years in
Hanoi. ``You should be ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain repeated his objections to political phone calls being
made in South Carolina for which he would not directly blame Bush.
When McCain said he had withdrawn negative ads, Bush brandished a
flier that he said was from McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an attack piece,'' Bush said of the ad, which says:
``When it comes to keeping Social Security, George Bush's figures
simply do not add up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not by my campaign,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says paid for by John McCain,'' Bush replied tartly,
provoking laughter from the audience. The sponsorship line on a
copy of the flier given to reporters by the Bush campaign read:
``Paid for by McCain 2000, Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, McCain conceded the fliers were printed by his
campaign but contended they had not been distributed in several
weeks. Bush said it was found on windshields of cars at a rally of
his Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The face-off was the first since the New Hampshire vote Feb. 1
and the subsequent withdrawals from the race by publisher Steve
Forbes and Reagan administration official Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute debate was sponsored by CNN, whose talk-show host
Larry King was the moderator, and the South Carolina Business and
Industry Political Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Before the debate, Bush, who by bringing in $69 million in
contributions has raised more money than any presidential primary
candidate in U.S. history, sought to undercut McCain on the
campaign finance issue by proposing several reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Heading the list was a ban on contributions from lobbyists to
members of the House and Senate while Congress is in session. The
proposal is based on a provision in the Texas Constitution that
bans anyone from contributing to statewide officeholders or
legislators from 30 days before until the conclusion of a regular
legislative session.

BUSH AND MCCAIN CLASH OVER NEGATIVE REFERENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Subs for rewriting throughout) 
 (sw) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE and ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ In a barely controlled debate that revealed the
depth of their mutual anger, Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John
McCain lashed into each other's negative campaign tactics on
Tuesday night, with McCain lecturing Bush that he ``should be
ashamed'' that a surrogate had accused McCain of abandoning
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush refused McCain's demand that he apologize, instead
insisting that McCain stop impugning his integrity. In seething,
indignant accusations, each man tried to portray himself as the
victim of gutter politics, with McCain saying he had been called
everything but a fascist.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're putting out stuff that is unbelievable, George, and
it's got to stop,'' he said. ``And your ads have got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate, the last before Saturday's crucial South Carolina
primary, was by far the most freewheeling and intense of the
Republican contest so far, and reflected the sense of both camps
that it could help determine the outcome of the vote. The arguments
ranged across nearly every issue that has come up in the race,
along with a few new ones.
</P>
<P>
   With only Alan Keyes sitting between them, the two leading
candidates argued forcefully over abortion, policy toward Russia,
taxes, Social Security, the don't-ask-don't-tell policy on gays in
the military and the reform of the campaign finance law.
</P>
<P>
   The field for the first time was reduced to just three
candidates, allowing a series of far more direct confrontations
than any previous debates. Keyes' often-hectoring interjections
heightened the incendiary tone of the evening, particularly
regarding Bush's campaign event at Bob Jones University, a center
of Christian conservatism that does not allow interracial dating.
While Bush looked skyward, Keyes unleashed a scathing attack on him
for speaking there and not condemning its dating policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does leadership consist of going into Bob Jones University
where serious questions, in fact, do exist about religious bigotry
and racial bigotry?'' Keyes asked. ``Going in, taking the applause,
risking nothing because you refuse to raise the issues? That's what
G.W. Bush did.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush retorted that he did not support the university's policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the most personal exchanges came early in the 90-minute
debate at a Columbia catering hall, when the moderator, Larry King,
asked about the conduct of the campaign. Bush immediately accused
McCain of being first to break a promise not to run negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shook hands, and unfortunately he ran an ad that equated me
to Bill Clinton,'' Bush said, sounding exasperated. ``You can
disagree on issues. We'll debate issues. But whatever you do, don't
equate my integrity and trustworthiness to Bill Clinton. That's
about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, steely but furious, immediately responded by citing an
event early this month in Sumter, S.C., in which J. Thomas Burch
Jr., chairman of the National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans
Committee, complained that McCain had opposed measures dealing with
Agent Orange and gulf war syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can understand this, George, but that
really hurts,'' McCain said. ``You should be ashamed. You should be
ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, who had been expected to spend the evening criticizing
McCain, instead worked to appear above the fray and condemned both
of his opponents, saying there were more important issues to
discuss than campaign tactics. King also tried to change the
subject, but McCain pressed on, demanding to tell the story of the
negative telephone calls being made to South Carolina voters by the
Bush campaign. Bush then pulled out a McCain campaign fliers
criticizing his tax cut plan, accusing McCain of continuing his
attacks despite a new vow to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not by my campaign,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it says paid for by John McCain,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not by my campaign,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain 2000,'' Bush said. ``John, well then somebody's putting
stuff out.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the earlier debates among the Republican
contenders, a significant portion of this one involved foreign
policy. The candidates were asked what aspects of the nation's
foreign policy they would change. Both Bush and Keyes criticized
American policy toward China.
</P>
<P>
   McCain urged a particularly aggressive approach toward what he
called rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd institute a policy that I call rogue state rollback,'' he
said. ``I would arm, train, equip, both from without and from
within, forces that would eventually overthrow the governments and
install free and democratically elected governments.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Until those governments are overthrown, they will
pose a threat to U.S. national security.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain also tangled over when it was appropriate for
the United States to intervene in foreign conflicts. Bush said he
would authorize the use of armed forces when it is the ``nation's
strategic interests.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Europe is in our national strategic interests. The
Far East is in our national strategic interests. Our own hemisphere
is in our national strategic interests. The Middle East _
protecting Israel is in our national strategic interest. And I'll
give you one clear example in our own hemisphere. If for whatever
reason somebody tries to block passage through the Panama Canal, as
president of the United States I will make sure the Panama Canal
remains open for trade. It's in our interests to have a hemisphere
that is peaceful and open for trade.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain told Bush his analysis ``wasn't that simple,'' saying
``There are times when our principles and our values are so
offended that we have to do what we can to resolve a terrible
situation. If Rwanda again became a scene of horrible genocide, if
there was a way that the United States could stop that and
beneficially affect the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``But we can never say that a nation driven by
Judeo-Christian principles will only intervene where our interests
are threatened, because we also have values. And those values are
very important.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also discussed Bush's refusal to meet with the
Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group. McCain said, ``I as president
of the United States and as nominee of my party will meet with, not
necessarily agree with, every member of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   All three tried to make the most forceful case for their
candidacy. Bush emphasized his executive experience as governor of
Texas saying of his two opponents, ``These are good men. Don't get
me wrong. But I've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was the one to reconstitute the Reagan coalition
of Republicans, independents and Democrats. Keyes scoffed at both
men as not forceful enough, saying ``I question their ability to
articulate on the moral issues of our time.''

HOLLYWOOD STARTS CITYHOOD DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  Hollywood, Calif. _ Adding some razzle-dazzle to the cityhood
movement, Hollywood secessionists launched their petition effort
Tuesday, and honorary mayor Johnny Grant was the first resident to
sign.
</P>
<P>
   The man who welcomes new stars to the Hollywood Walk of Fame and
hosts the annual Christmas parade lent a little star power to the
effort to include the movie capital in a study on the viability of
breaking up Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a historic day,'' Grant said after the petition
drive kickoff at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. ``It's been talked
about for years _ that Hollywood should be its own city. Most
people think it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has been part of Los Angeles for nearly a century.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Hollywood Voters Organized Toward Empowerment want to
slice a 19.5-square-mile area from Los Angeles and form a separate
city with about 200,000 residents. They contend the area's
revitalization has come despite the city's involvement, and they
want more control over issues affecting their community.
</P>
<P>
   To break away, Hollywood VOTE first must gain enough signatures
of registered voters to qualify for a study assessing the financial
viability of both the new city and the remainder of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The San Fernando Valley and San Pedro-Wilmington already are in
the study. With consultants expected to begin the work in March,
Hollywood VOTE leaders don't want to miss the opportunity to have
their territory be included.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock ticks as of today. We don't have a lot of time, but
we will do it,'' said Fares Wehbe, the group's president.
</P>
<P>
   The drive was delayed several weeks while a final map, required
on petition forms, was drawn.
</P>
<P>
   There is some overlapping of the proposed Valley city, whose
southern boundary is Mulholland Drive. But leaders of both efforts
said no conflict is brewing, and the Local Agency Formation
Commission will decide where to draw the lines.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood VOTE has six months to collect signatures from about
15,000 registered voters, 25 percent of those registered in the
area proposed as Hollywood. The group aims to collect more than
20,000 signatures in three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner the better to tie everything in together. But if
they do it within six months, they should be able to be folded in
without any problem,'' said Larry Calemine, executive officer for
the Local Agency Formation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The study has been tentatively budgeted at $2.65 million, and
LAFCO would need an additional $300,000 if the Hollywood proposal
is added to the assignment, Calemine said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said he expects data produced in the study to be
instructive not only for areas whose residents want to break away
from Los Angeles, but also for the rest of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure you'll find the feasibility report to be as
intriguing as a Hitchcock movie and as revealing as a Frederick's
of Hollywood lingerie catalog,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A cityhood vote could be held in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said support already is evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens remember the difficult times in past years, and,
along with a new sense of pride, they have a proprietary feeling
and a desire to control their community and their government on a
more local level,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE leaders said they are optimistic that Hollywood VOTE
will get enough signatures to qualify its plan for inclusion in the
study. ``It further legitimizes the concerns that were first raised
by the Valley residents. It shows there are widespread problems
that need to be addressed,'' said Richard Close, Valley VOTE
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will also help us get a majority of the entire city's
approval once it gets on the ballot in two years,'' he said.

ENGLISH SPRINGER SPANIEL WINS BEST IN SHOW AT WESTMINSTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 10:30 Tuesday night, the call went out for the
seven finalists to take the stage at the 124th annual Westminster
Kennel Club Dog Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poodle!'' shouted Peter R. Van Brunt, a vice president of the
club. ``Dobie! English springer. Bedlington. Shih Tzu. The Basset.
Corgi. Poodle, in front of the line!''
</P>
<P>
   As one trotted after the other onto the green carpet of Madison
Square Garden, primed for their chance to be top dog of 2000, the
Bedlington terrier, Ch. Willow Wind Tenure, paused to do some
business. ``Cleanup!'' a steward shouted.
</P>
<P>
   The best-in-show competition was the culmination of the most
prestigious show for dogs, as a crew of judges winnowed 2,500 dogs
in 156 breeds down to seven winners of the hound, sporting,
nonsporting, terrier, herding, toy and working groups.
</P>
<P>
   The judge of the top dog, Chester Collier, president of
Westminster, eyed the seven closely, sending them on their paces.
The crowd adored the sad-faced basset hound, Ch. Moonbeam's
Astronomer, cheering Astro's every waddle as if he were Leonardo
DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   But Collier was not swayed by the audience's momentary
infatuation. Instead, he carried the champion's silver trophy to a
cheerful English springer spaniel, Ch. Salilyn 'N Erin's Shameless,
a 5-year-old bitch whose sire, Ch. Salilyn's Condor, won best in
show in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's perfection for the standard,'' Collier said of the
winner, also known as Samantha. ``She lives up to what the standard
says. You saw her line and her energy. That was it. She just kept
moving. She wanted. And she got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Samantha's triumph was not a shock, she beat the
presumed favorite, Ch. Lakecove That's My Boy, a white standard
poodle known as Treson. The poodle was the top-ranked dog of 1999
and has won 169 best in shows in her 2-year career. Treson's
grandfather had won the 1991 best in show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed,'' said Dennis McCoy, Treson's handler.
``I loved the springer. It's a great feeling to win. I've been
there.''
</P>
<P>
   During Samantha's photo-op in the middle of the show ring, on a
lavender rug, she hopped momentarily into the silver champion's
bowl. At 42 pounds, she didn't fit as easily as last year's best in
show, a 6-pound Papillon, and quickly hopped out.
</P>
<P>
   As Samantha kibbitzed with the media surrounding her, licking
camera operators as if they were old friends, her handler, Kellie
FitzGerald, said: ``I just depended on her to give me a good show.
She showed great. I can't describe the feeling of being on the
other end of the lead. She represents so much and represents her
father so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Samantha, who is part of a breeding line that goes back 63
years, has earned 49 best-in-breed titles and 200 best in groups in
her show career. She won her breed in each of her three appearances
at Westminster and will now retire to breed.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement, she will not have to work out twice a day on her
canine treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just working, never out of control, perfect, happy and
looking at the crowd,'' FitzGerald said. ``She has heart to
spare.''
</P>
<P>
   Samantha's victory in the sporting group avenged her loss last
year to a legendary Gordon setter.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Billings, the judge of the group, said, ``As I scanned
the group, I knew the judges had really done their work. They sent
me the cream of the sporting group. It was a photo finish with the
black cocker spaniel. They were both in prime condition. But the
springer spaniel, for her breed, had a slightly better head, and
when you say that, you've said it all.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it seemed that the selection of Astro to win the
hound group might portend a truly stunning best-in-show upset,
something to really yip home about. If the dour-looking basset
could win, well, anything was possible.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-year-old native New Yorker has lived in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, for four years and exercises for a half-hour daily on a
treadmill. But mostly, Astro likes to eat, sleep and eat some more.
Astro hadn't even shown for a year, but beat the favored Saluki
bitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy!'' exclaimed Maria Elisa Martinez, who owns 12
bassets, including Astro, cherishing them for their dour visage,
their deliberate gait and their Hush Puppies shoe heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The short-legged Astro couldn't have presented a starker
contrast with the off-white, elegant Saluki, Ch. Sundown Alabaster
Treasure JC, who loped easily, his floppy ears bouncing, as his
handler, Andy Luque, showed him on Madison Square Garden's green
carpet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basset doesn't move as fast as the others, but he moves in
the right way,'' Luque said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the English springer spaniel, 2000's king of
dogs, moved the best.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No streak? No difference. Not for Tiger Woods,
whose PGA winning streak reached six _ second best in tour history
_ before Phil Mickelson ended it in a stirring duel last week at
Torrey Pines.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson's victory in the Buick Invitational stopped Woods five
wins shy of Byron Nelson's seemingly untouchable record of 11 in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   With the streak over, Woods can now concentrate on winning the
Nissan Open at Riviera Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning is what really drives me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That won't change whether this week's Nissan is for one in a row
or eight in a row. The latter looked as if it might happen when
Woods erased Mickelson's seven-shot lead to tie for the Buick lead
with five holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   After Mickelson had won, Tiger wasn't disappointed in having the
tour's longest streak since 1952 stopped, only in finishing second.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm out there playing or getting ready for a
tournament,'' he said the day before the streak ended, ``the only
time I think about the streak is when you guys bring it up. That's
the only time. I'm out there trying to win a tournament _ that's
all. And what I did last week doesn't really matter this week.''
</P>
<P>
   That immediate focus helped stretch Woods' run as much as his
will to win and his shotmaking accuracy that can border on the
unreal. On the final regulation hole of the Mercedes Championship
last month in Hawaii, Woods needed an eagle to get into a playoff
with Ernie Els for a fifth consecutive tour victory. He hit a
three-wood nearly 300 yards to within eight feet of the flagstick
and got his eagle. And he got the playoff win.
</P>
<P>
   At Pebble Beach two weeks ago, down seven strokes with seven
holes to play, Woods nearly had back-to-back eagles from the
fairway, holing his first attempt from 106 yards and leaving his
next within inches of the cup from 115 yards.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of shotmaking, in Woods' view, was the best part of
his streak. It also might be the best reason to think a future
streak is not that unlikely for the 24-year-old. In just his fourth
full season, Woods has 17 tour victories, including two majors, and
ranks first on the all-time money list.
</P>
<P>
   ``His desire has always been to be the best player who ever
lived,'' Paul Azinger said after Woods' comeback at Pebble Beach.
``I don't think anything's going to slow him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Els: ``He's not afraid to make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best I've played against in my 20 years on tour,''
said 1999 Player of the Year Mark O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   Woods remains focused:
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about the streak rather than the shots I'm hitting
or the putts I made here and there,'' Woods said last week. ``And I
think that's more important than the streak because that's what
keeps it alive.''
</P>
<P>
   When it ended on Sunday, it was as much because he had lost his
accuracy rather than Mickelson's tenacity down the stretch. Woods
was able to overcame the lapse with a wondrous short game, but he
was so off his game, he was laughing about it with his caddie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Would you just hit a fairway?' I said, `I'm trying!'
And I missed the fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' ability to enjoy himself while struggling is a change
from his early days on tour, when he often responded to misfortune
with irritation. He says it's a matter of feeling more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life changed pretty dramatically from 1996 (when he turned
pro after winning a record third consecutive U.S. Amateur title)
into '97,'' Woods said of his transition from college student to
worldwide celebrity in a span of six months.
</P>
<P>
   He attracted the spotlight by winning twice in his first eight
tour events. When he followed that with a dramatic win in the '97
tour-opening Mercedes Championship _ nearly hitting a hole-in-one
on the first playoff hole _ then won his first professional Masters
by a record 12 strokes, Woods found himself, at age 21, the most
well-known golfer in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can ever prepare you for that,'' he said. ``And I
guess, you know, I didn't handle it well at times. And at other
times I was just kind of learning as I was going.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no class for that, nothing anyone can ever say can
help you along. You have to go through it yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Woods is obviously more accustomed to celebrity and
appears comfortable with his status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a little more experienced than I was in '97 to
handle all this,'' he said to another packed media throng at the
Buick Invitational, where credential requests tripled.
</P>
<P>
   Although the streak is now history, there will likely be no
shortage of media or fans this week at Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   His opposition will likely go with the game plan endorsed by
Woods' former Stanford teammate, Notah Begay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road to any tournament,'' Begay said, ``goes through Tiger
Woods' driveway.''

EDITORIAL: THE FIREFIGHT IN SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for rewriting throughout) 
 (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Feb. 17:
</P>
<P>
   As their debate in South Carolina demonstrated on Tuesday night,
Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain are in more than a
scorched-earth battle for the Republican presidential nomination.
They are also offering different approaches to conducting and
financing campaigns. Bush sought to re-establish his presidential
stature, accused McCain of starting the mudslinging, and proclaimed
himself again a ``reformer with results.'' McCain tried to be
even-tempered while blaming the governor for shameful negative
attacks and being a come-lately to campaign finance reform. He cast
himself as the one Republican who could rebuild the Reagan
coalition by pulling Democrats and independents into the Republican
fold, while Bush insisted he was the only Republican who could
``end the Clinton era.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the 90-minute debate was Bush's attempt to grab
the label of reformer away from McCain. Before the debate, he even
announced his own version of the campaign finance cleanup advocated
by the Arizona senator. The Texas governor's insistence that his
approach constituted reform had a hollow ring on Tuesday night,
however. His proposal was designed to gain attention without really
removing special-interest money from politics.
</P>
<P>
   Like McCain, Bush would ban unlimited ``soft money'' donations
to political parties by unions and corporations. But unlike McCain,
he would let wealthy individuals make contributions as big as they
want, on the specious ground that curbs on the size of individual
donations are an unconstitutional infringement of free speech. Far
from reforming the system, Bush's proposal is an attempt to confuse
voters and enhance the power of wealthy interests. McCain correctly
condemned the Bush plan as leaving ``a billion-dollar loophole.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate, in Charleston, was often muddled, in part because of
the tirades of Alan Keyes, the third candidate, and weak management
by Larry King. Much of it bogged down as McCain and Bush accused
each other of starting what has become a junkyard campaign of
smears and attacks in the Lee Atwater tradition.
</P>
<P>
   McCain appeared dignified and determined, but he did not get the
knockout he surely desired as a follow-up to his New Hampshire
landslide. He adopted a wounded tone in discussing the negative
telephone calls, mailings and campaign ads that may be causing his
own standing in the polls to slip. He again called on Bush to
follow his lead in abandoning negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   Bush gave an energetic rebuttal to the senator's appeal, warning
McCain not to question his trustworthiness and not to compare him
to Bill Clinton _ ``about as low a blow as you can give.'' The
governor's more combative style and his vow not to be ``defined''
by his adversaries could win sympathy in a state more accustomed
than most to tough politicking and one that is also essential to
the survival of his candidacy. Bush's flooding of the state with
negative attack ads could hurt him down the road by draining his
campaign machine of money, but he is clearly betting that the low
road will work in the low country.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also tried to take the high road on foreign policy. Like
Bush, he assailed the Clinton administration for coddling China and
said that the United States had too readily deployed troops around
the world. But he said that moral factors would weigh more heavily
with him in deciding whether to intervene in certain trouble spots,
indicating that genocide in Rwanda might well be such a case. Bush
disagreed, saying he would not send troops to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was at his best in defending his record on education in
Texas, and McCain on reconstituting the Republican Party and
curbing its addiction to special-interest money. If McCain can win
without mud or push polls, he could elevate the entire process for
the rest of the year. He has also redefined the nature of
campaigning by subjecting himself to more questioning from regular
voters and from reporters on his campaign bus than any leading
presidential candidate in decades. But this debate, with its dogged
performance from a more confident Bush, showed that the next four
days in South Carolina will see a free-swinging battle whose
outcome cannot yet be predicted.

COMMENTARY: FIGHTING THE WIMP FACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for changes throughout) 
 (sw) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AIKEN, S.C. _ George Bush fighting the wimp factor? That rings a
bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it, but I think Bush's problem is that he's
wimpy, he seems to dilly-dally,'' confided Barbara Looney, a
retired gift-wrapper at Macy's who lives in North Augusta, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend Lois Marable, a fellow retiree, agreed: ``I do not
like the way he looks on television. He looks like a wimp.''
</P>
<P>
   The two John McCain fans had come to the University of South
Carolina here to see their man. After he spoke, he called on Mrs.
Marable during the question period. She had only one question: Was
he nuts?
</P>
<P>
   While the Arizona senator must persuade South Carolinians that
he's not too coiled, Bush must persuade them that he's coiled
enough.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Saluda on Monday, Bush acknowledged,
after his flaccid performance in New Hampshire, that South
Carolinians had been pressing him about whether he was tough enough
to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, people do that all the time,'' he said. Asked why, he
replied: ``I guess because they think I'm such a nice fellow, you
know? I don't know. 'Cause they want to win in November, they want
to figure out who can go toe-to-toe.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is why he has been talking louder and faster in
speeches here, and came out swinging, determined to dominate, with
an aggressive and well-coached debate performance on Tuesday night,
even as McCain tried to appear calm and avuncular.
</P>
<P>
   So now it was W. who was coiled, and McCain who was too detached
as he overplayed the adult card. ``It's not the Washington
mentality,'' the senator said of his plan to stress debt reduction
over tax cuts. ``It's the grown-up mentality. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   It must have been a nightmarish, Groundhog Day experience for W.
to be forced, as his father once was, to defend his toughness, when
he expected to simply swagger in and avenge the family name.
</P>
<P>
   W.'s campaign has imitated his dad's playbook, which may be
sorely out of date: pandering to the religious right, splashing mud
on foes while promising to inspire Americans' ``better angels.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was one way the son was never supposed to be like the
father. His supporters never thought W. would get tagged with the
``W'' word. He would never be called wimp. He was, they whispered,
more like Ronald Reagan. He had that cock-of-the-walk way about
him. He seemed more peppery Texan than flighty preppy.
</P>
<P>
   The 1987 Newsweek cover with the headline ``Fighting the Wimp
Factor'' was a searing experience for Vice President Bush, a war
hero, and his hyper-loyal son. The story said many Republicans were
worried that George Bush might not be ``strong enough or tough
enough for the challenges of the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   W., still a hothead in those days, called the magazine's White
House correspondent to inform him: ``Newsweek's been cut off.
You're out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   In September 1988, the vice president was still so peeved that
Katharine Graham, the publisher of Newsweek, had to meet with him
to appease him. He had even counted the number of times the word
``wimp'' had been used in the story.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, W. still sometimes needles Newsweek reporters about
the wimp war.
</P>
<P>
   So he must loathe the position he now finds himself in, locked
in an unexpectedly scorching battle with a gritty war hero who
treats him as a callow squirt.
</P>
<P>
   Why was that ``W'' word popping up with this W.?
</P>
<P>
   Was it the bad luck of drawing this particular opponent, someone
who can speak knowingly about self-sacrifice to spoiled boomers,
while W. can only embrace such notions as distant ideals? Was it
the consequence of Bush's own diffidence about the race, which has
clearly been more grueling than he expected? Or did his attempt to
mimic everything McCain does _ including his risible,
loophole-laden campaign finance ``reform'' package _ leave him
looking like an insecure adolescent?
</P>
<P>
   Louise Hendley, 77, who swooned over McCain at a campaign event
at the Beth Shalom Synagogue in Columbia on Tuesday, said she
really liked Bush. ``But he just doesn't give me the feeling that
he could be in charge in an emergency,'' she said. ``He's just a
cute little boy to me, a cute little puppy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of praise that would make a candidate's blood
run cold.

INVECTIVE FLIES IN S.C. DEBATE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Palmetto State's primary election just three days away,
Arizona Sen. John McCain and Texas Gov. George W. Bush had one
last, raucous scrap on national televi sion, with each accusing the
other of negative campaigning even as they sparred on issues like
tax policy and campaign reform.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute debate, carried live on CNN, was characterized by
a series of testy exchanges about the increasingly nasty tone the
Republican race has taken.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's GOP primary in South Carolina is viewed as an
important milestone, with the winner expected to grab the coveted
momentum as the cam paigns head into the Super Tues day primary
sweepstakes March 7.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has closed on Bush here in recent weeks, hopes to
keep the race tight by defusing a series of negative Bush ads that
have been saturating the air waves all week. Pundits say Mc Cain
might have a chance to beat Bush here if turnout is high in
Saturday's contest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ads blast McCain on a series of issues from campaign
finance to personal integrity, and it was Bush who accused McCain
during the debate of triggering the barrage with an ad that
compared Bush to President Clin ton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not question my trustwor thiness, and do not compare me to
Bill Clinton,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   During a heated finger-point ing session, McCain retorted that
he had pulled the ad last week. He chided the Texas governor for
continuing the attacks and em bracing campaign surrogates who, he
said, are bent on sullying McCain's reputation, particularly with
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the nastiest campaign people have seen in a
long time,'' McCain said to Bush. ``You should be ashamed of your
self.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, McCain told report ers that South Carolina voters
were tiring of the hostilities. He predicted Bush will suffer the
consequences at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's already beginning to be a backlash against it,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, made it clear what voters can expect through the
end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand by my ads,'' Bush said. ``I stand by what I'm trying
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although arguments over the conduct of the campaign often
dominated the debate, the candi dates also tried to contrast posi
tions on sensitive issues like taxes and campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   Wedged between McCain and Bush, and often trying to steer the
debate back to issues, was Republican Alan Keyes, running a distant
third in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot more impor tant things,'' Keyes said. ``And
all I'm doing is listening to these guys go on about their ads?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush tried to stake out new turf on campaign finance reform, a
subject McCain has pushed hard for months and appears to be
resonating with voters, partic ularly independents and Demo crats
who could cross over to vote in Saturday's open primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed limits on soft-money contributions to political
parties by corporations and unions as well as limits on cam paign
contributions from lobby ists while Congress is in session. Bush
used stump speeches this week to tout his plan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, called the reform plan fatally flawed. Be cause
it allows unlimited soft-money donations by individuals, McCain
said, it's ``a billion-dollar loophole.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain tried to distinguish himself on fiscal policy, saying he
would seek to balance tax cuts for middle-income Americans with
spending to shore up the Social Security trust fund and reduce the
national debt. Bush stood by his proposal for deep tax cuts that
would target wealthy taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet I'll cut taxes at the top; that'll encourage entrepre
neurship,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Moderator Larry King led the candidates onto some unfamiliar
ground as well, asking at one point whether they would sup port a
moratorium on the death penality in light of advances in DNA
testing that have exoner ated some death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Bush answered bluntly, defending Texas' record of exe
cutions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that the develop ments ``would provoke a review,
clearly, of cases that are ques tionable,'' but that he would not
ban the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death penalty is an ap propriate penalty for certain
crimes,'' he said. &QL;

 DNA EVIDENCE STUDY SHOWS HOW 62 INNOCENT MEN WERE FOUND GUILTY  &HT;     By ERIN HALLISSY 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A newly released study of 62 inmates exonerated by DNA evidence
shows that mistaken eyewitness identification played a role in 84
percent of the wrongful convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Whites were more likely to misidentify blacks as their
attackers, according to DNA experts and authors Barry Scheck and
Peter Neufeld.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, who gained nationwide fame working on O. J.
Simpson's defense during his murder trial, run the Innocence
Project at a New York City law school. Their study, presented in a
book written with New York Daily News writer Jim Dwyer, ``Actual
Innocence: Five Days to Execution and Other Dispatches from the
Wrongfully Convicted,'' was released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Scheck and Neufeld have scheduled a meeting at the Boalt Hall
School of Law at the University of California at Berkeley to
discuss setting up a similar Innocence Project there.
</P>
<P>
   Several universities nationwide are part of what Scheck calls
the Innocence Network, doing investigative and legal work for
inmates claiming that DNA evidence could prove that they were
wrongfully convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of network is what really makes a difference in
improving the system,'' Scheck said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Scheck, a Boalt Hall graduate, said he would love to have
students at UC-Berkeley working with the network.
</P>
<P>
   Boalt Hall Professor Charles Weissenberg,cq &LR;  who is meeting with
Scheck next Tuesday, said he's intrigued by the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want to hear more of how this project would work,''
he said. ``I think whether or not we do it is going to depend upon
interest, the possibility of attracting outside funding and a
decision about whether the cases we could do are really good
teaching and training classes for our students.''
</P>
<P>
   DNA evidence has been used to exonerate 63 male inmates in the
United States, including Kevin Green, an Orange County man who was
freed in 1996 after 16 years locked up for a crime he didn't
commit. It is also expected to free a Riverside man who was
sentenced to 45 years for rape and robbery in 1998. Recently
completed tests done by a Richmond lab reportedly have shown that
he could not have committed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   DNA technology has become a growing issued in California, with
California Attorney General Bill Lockyer saying his top priority
this year is to improve the state's DNA databank in Berkeley. As
reported by The Chronicle last October, the databank of convicted
murderers, sex offenders and spouse abusers has a backlog of more
than 100,000 untested samples.
</P>
<P>
   The man who actually committed the murder that Green was
imprisoned for was identified through the database for that crime,
along with a series of others.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer has pushed for more than $5.4 million in additional
funding for the lab this year, on top of $10 million already
allocated between 1999 and 2001 for hiring additional staff members
and processing more samples. The databank, which now has about
45,000 profiles of convicted offenders, should have more than
200,000 by June 2001, Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Scheck is a supporter of DNA databanks, saying the genetic tests
are the most important forensic tool to convict the guilty and free
the innocent. The study that he, Neufeld and Dwyer released Tuesday
shows that a number of factors were behind the wrongful convictions
of the freed inmates, including fraudulent science and police and
prosecutorial misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Their book examines 62 of the 63 cases in which there were
exonerations. The authors said they were most disturbed by racial
misidentification in the conviction of black men, especially in
cases that involved white victims.
</P>
<P>
   According to the authors, whites misidentified African Americans
35 percent of the time, compared to African Americans
misidentifying African Americans 24 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known for some time that cross-racial identification is
a troubling problem,'' Scheck said.
</P>
<P>
   The book notes that Illinois and New York, the only two states
with laws authorizing postconviction DNA testing, led the country
in the number of inmates exonerated through the technology.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, introduced legislation
last month to allow postconviction DNA testing if the evidence or
technology for testing that evidence was not available to the
defendant at the time of trial.
</P>
<P>
   Scheck said most Americans believe that DNA testing should be
available to defendants who say it could exonerate them, and
therefore states should not impose limitations on postconviction
testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The testing doesn't cost that much money, much less that it
costs to keep someone in jail,'' said Scheck. He said the tests
cost about $3,000 to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a simple matter of justice,'' Scheck said.

   President Clinton asked for a review Tuesday that could lead to
permanent protection of more than 400,000 acres of California's
giant sequoia trees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton directed Agriculture Secretary Daniel Glickman to
consult with members of Congress, California officials and others
to see if it is ``appropriate'' to designate the sequoias as a
national monument.
</P>
<P>
   About 33 groves of giant sequoia trees are in Sequoia National
Forest, bordering Sequoia National Park and Kings Canyon National
Park, not far from Fresno. The groves are already on federal land
but are still subject to periodic, limited logging.
</P>
<P>
   Besides these groves, Clinton is considering whether to add
protections to two groves in Sierra National Forest and one grove
in Tahoe National Forest. Clinton has already asked for federal
money to purchase another grove of giant sequoias on private land
adjacent to Sequoia National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Glickman, Clinton said he is considering using
the Antiquities Act of 1906 to redesignate the groves. The
president has used the Antiquities Act several times, most recently
last month to give permanent protection to land adjacent to the
Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to ensure that these majestic cathedral groves, which
John Muir called `Nature's masterpiece,' are protected for future
generations to study and enjoy,'' Clinton wrote the agriculture
secretary, whose department includes the U.S. Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he wants a recommendation from Glickman within 60
days. It is possible Clinton could create a sequoia national
monument within days of receiving Glickman's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have campaigned to protect the sequoia
groves for many years. About 70 giant sequoia groves are located in
Central California, close to the Sierra. Approximately 25 of those
groves are in Yosemite and other national parks and are protected
from logging and other encroachments. The remaining groves are in
Sequoia National Forest and surrounding areas and are not
permanently protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people would be surprised that more than half of these
trees are managed according to a forest plan that talks about
sustainable harvest of the sequoias,'' said George Frampton,
chairman of the president's Council on Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   Frampton said Clinton is considering protecting between 330,000
and 440,000 acres of land, or about a third of the Sequoia National
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club, praised
Clinton's letter, but the California Forestry Association, a timber
industry lobbying group, complained that the sequoia groves don't
need more protection.
</P>
<P>
   Another lobbying group said that Clinton's directive was partly
political.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he uses (the Antiquities Act) excessively, partly to
score political points for Al Gore,'' said Michael Klein, spokesman
for the American Forest &AMP; Paper Association.

EXCERPTS FROM DEBATE OF 3 REPUBLICAN CONTENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With REPUBS-DEBATE) 
(sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the debate of the Republican
presidential candidates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Alan Keyes
and Sen. John McCain of Arizona Tuesday night on ``Larry King
Live'' on CNN, as recorded by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   KING: All right, governor, what do you make of all these past
two weeks, the charges and countercharges? You go and then the
senator.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Well, it's kind of politics and John and I shook hands and
we said we weren't going to run ads and I kind of smiled my way
through the early primaries and got defined. I'm not going to let
it happen again. And we shook hands and unfortunately he ran an ad
that equated me to Bill Clinton. He questioned my trustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   KING: Are you saying he broke the agreement with you?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I'm just saying, you can disagree on issues. We'll debate
issues. But whatever you do, don't equate my integrity and
trustworthiness to Bill Clinton. That's about as low a blow as you
can give in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   KING: And that's what got you mad to sort of fight back.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Well, I stand by my ads.
</P>
<P>
   KING: You wouldn't change any?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: No. I stand by what I'm trying to do. I mean, when the man
says that I'm spending all the surplus on tax cuts and it's not
true, I'm going to define what reality is.
</P>
<P>
   KING: Senator McCain, did you break a promise?
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: Well, let me tell you what happened. There was a ad run
against me, we ran a counter ad in New Hampshire. Governor Bush
took the ad down and then I was beat up very badly by all of his
surrogates, called Clinton, called Clinton-like, called a hypocrite
_
</P>
<P>
   KING: In New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: No, here in South Carolina. You've seen it. Turn on the
radio, turn on the television and unfortunately now, pick up the
telephone and you'll hear a negative attack against John McCain.
But let me tell you what really went over the line. Governor Bush
had a event and he paid for it and stood next to a spokesman for a
fringe veterans' group. That fringe veteran said that John McCain
had abandoned the veterans. Now, I don't know if you can understand
this, George, but that really hurts. That really hurts. And so five
United States senators, Vietnam veterans, heroes, some of them
really incredible heroes, wrote George a letter and said apologize.
You should be ashamed. You should be ashamed.
</P>
<P>
   KING: Is he responsible for what someone else says?
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: Well, this same man, he stood next to him. It was his
event. This same man that attacked his father viciously. It was
remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Let me speak to that.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: So _ so, I'd be glad to tell you the rest of the story
if you'd let me when it's appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   KING: Well, let him respond on that point.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Let me answer, let me answer that.
</P>
<P>
   KING: Alan, you come in, too.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: You should be ashamed, you should be ashamed _
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Let, let me say something _
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: of sponsoring an event with that man there, who had
attacked your own father.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Let me finish. John, I believe that you served our country
nobly. And I've said it over and over again, that man wasn't
speaking for me. He may have a dispute with you _
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN
</P>
<P>
   Did you _
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Let me finish please. Please.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: He's listed as your _
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Let me finish. Let me finish.
</P>
<P>
   KING: All right, let him finish.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: The man was not speaking for me. If you want to know my
opinion about you, John, you served our country admirably and
strongly. And I'm proud of your record, just like you are. And I
don't appreciate what he said about my dad either. But let me say
something, if you're going to be _ hold me responsible for what
people for me say, I'm going to do the same for you. And let me
give you one example. Warren Rudman, the man who you had as your
campaign man in New Hampshire, said about the Christian Coalition
that they're bigots. He talked about the Christian Coalition in a
way that was incredibly strong. I know you don't believe that, do
you?
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: George, he's entitled to his opinion on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Well, so is this man.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: You paid for an event.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: So is this man.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: You paid for an _
</P>
<P>
   KING: Please don't. . . . But I want Alan to give me one thing.
If you have a surrogate making a speech for you today, are you
responsible for what he says?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: If he's at your event _
</P>
<P>
   KEYES: Larry, I'm sorry. I _ I _ I _ I really am sitting here
wondering, because I said we were going out to 202 countries, and
is this kind of pointless squabbling really what we want them to
see? We're _ we're talking about electing the president of the
United States. . . .
</P>
<P>
   KEYES: Does leadership consist in going into Bob Jones
University where serious questions, in fact, do exist about
religious bigotry and racial bigotry? Going in, taking the
applause, risking nothing because you refuse to raise the issues?
That's what G.W. Bush did. . . .
</P>
<P>
   KING: Why didn't you speak against bigotry at Bob Jones?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I was asked the question do I support his policy of no
interracial dating. I said of course not. Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   My little brother, Jeb, the governor of Florida, married a girl
named Columba from Mexico. A fabulous part of our family, a great
person. So please don't insinuate in any shape _ way, shape or form
that I _
</P>
<P>
   KING: But, they couldn't date a _
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Well, that's fine, but I walked in and talked about how
our conservatives cause must be compassionate. That's what I talked
about, I talked about how the principles of conservatism can lift
the spirit of America. How we can improve peoples lives, that's
what I talked about.
</P>
<P>
   KEYES: In your _
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: That's what I _ you didn't hear my speech. . . .
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: Look, I was not invited to attend Bob Jones. I
understand that it's a fine academic school. If I had been invited,
I would have gone and I would've started by saying, as I have gone
to other places that people are not in favor of me, and I would
have said: Look, what you're doing, in this ban on interracial
dating, is stupid, it's idiotic and it is incredibly cruel to many
people.
</P>
<P>
   I also happen to have an adopted daughter who's from Bangladesh.
And I don't think that she should be subjected to those kinds of
things. In fact, I will stand up and fight against those. And so,
look _
</P>
<P>
   KING: You would have gone and said that but you weren't invited?
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: If I'd been invited, of course. Because you've got to
bring the message to get these people in to the modern times. . . .
</P>
<P>
   KING: So if you have gays working for you, that's fine and you
don't have a problem _ you'd appoint gays in the Cabinet and so
forth.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Well, I'm not going to ask what their sexual orientation
is.
</P>
<P>
   KING: Oh, so you wouldn't know.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I'm going to put conservative people in the cabinet. It's
none of my business what somebody _ now, when somebody makes it my
business, like on gay marriage, I'm going to stand up and say I
don't support gay marriage. I support marriage between men and
women.
</P>
<P>
   KING: So therefore if a state were voting on gay marriage, you
would suggest to that state not to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: The state can do what they want to do. Don't try to trap
me in this state's issue, like you're trying to get me. . . .
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: George, do you believe in the exemption _ in the case of
abortion _ for rape, incest, and life of the mother?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: Yeah, I do. I do.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: Then, you know, it's interesting, you were talking about
printed material that's mailed out? Here's one that says that
George W. Bush supports the pro-life plank.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I do.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: Yeah, so, in other words, your position is that you
believe there's an exemption for rape, incest and the life of the
mother, but you want the platform that you're supposed to be
leading to have no exemption. Help me out there, will you?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I will, I will. The platform talks about _ it doesn't talk
about what specifically should be in the constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: It doesn't have the exemptions in it and you know that
very well.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: John, let me finish, let me finish. The platform speaks
about a constitutional amendment. It doesn't refer to how that
constitutional amendment ought to be defined.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN : George.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: John.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: If you read the platform, it has no exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: John, I think we need to keep the platform the way it is.
This is a pro-life party _
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: Then you are contradicting your platform.

BUSH HAS SOME CALIFORNIANS FEELING LEFT BEHIND
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
With just three weeks to go before the California primary, GOP
front-runner George W. Bush has riled some California Republicans
by suggesting he may not attend the only debate scheduled in the
state before voters go to the polls on March 7.
<P>
   Some GOP insiders say they're now worried that the Texas
governor may be taking the state for granted, and that not debating
in California could hurt his campaign for the Republican
presidential nomination _ as well as the GOP cause in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something counterintuitive about not showing up to
campaign in the biggest state in the nation,'' said Don Casper,
chairman of the San Francisco Republican Party and a pledged
delegate for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all realize that a candidate can't be everywhere he wants
to be. But given California's importance and its peculiar open
primary, it would seem prudent of Gov. Bush to make a series of
appearances _ or at least one major appearance _ before the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate between Republican presidential candidates, sponsored
by CNN and the Los Angeles Times, is scheduled for March 2 in Los
Angeles, and organizers insisted this week that Bush had informally
committed to appearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's top state campaign officials this week said the GOP
presidential hopeful never agreed to the event and may not be
there. They said the governor's schedule was fluid after South
Carolina's primary on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign's debate announcement raised concerns from
some state GOP activists, who noted that the governor has skipped
the past three state conventions _ the most recent this month _ and
hasn't visited the state since November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush keeps sending out mixed messages. He keeps saying he's
going to compete vigorously in California, but he needs to back
that up with some action,'' said GOP consultant Matt Cunningham,
the former state spokesman for the Forbes campaign. ``It would send
a discouraging message to Republicans to skip the Los Angeles
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The suggestions that Bush could be a no-show at the California
debate also drew a bemused response from the campaign of GOP rival
John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For California Republicans, this is the ghost of presidential
campaigns past,'' said Dan Schnur, communications director for the
McCain campaign. ``George Bush Sr. blew off the state entirely, Bob
Dole didn't campaign here until it was too late, and now Gov. Bush
is telling the people that this isn't a priority for him either.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain believes it's important for the people of
California to see and hear the candidates talk about the issues,''
said Schnur. ``Thirty-three million Californians are worth that
attention ... and we'll be there, either way.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign had another reason to be happy about its
prospects. The Associated Press reported last night that California
Secretary of State Bill Jones, the state's highest-ranking
Republican, will endorse McCain at a news conference Wednesday in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   CNN and the Los Angeles Times scheduled the California debate
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has told us informally that he is planning on
attending,'' Maryanne McNellis, president of the Times' National
Edition told Chronicle columnist Debra J. Saunders. McNellis said
Bush has assured Times staffers on the campaign trail that he'd be
there, and added, ``We are expecting him. ... We'd hate to see his
campaign represented by an empty chair.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, there have been reports that GOP candidates
could appear at another California debate _ one planned by the
Technology Network, a Silicon Valley advocacy group _ possibly
using the Internet as a venue.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellen Stroud, spokeswoman for the group, ruled that out
yesterday, saying negotiations had been under way, but ``we decided
not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That left state Republicans debating the fallout yesterday
should Bush pass up the the only scheduled debate in California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush holds a three-point lead over McCain in California in the
latest Public Policy Institute of California poll.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign said the governor will be no stranger to his
supporters in California before voters go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush is going to campaign vigorously throughout the
state of California leading up to the primary in the coming
weeks,'' Alixe Mattingly of Bush's California campaign said
yesterday. ``He has devoted much time to California. He has an
unprecedented grassroots organization throughout the state which is
enthusiastically working on his behalf now and in the coming
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one leading Republican state consultant noted that with
Bush holding the lead in crucial primaries in South Carolina and
Michigan, McCain has little to lose by making an issue of the
California debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course John McCain will come out here and do every free
appearance he can. He needs the earned media,'' the consultant
said.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, the strategist said, may have more to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he decides to take a pass on it because there are other
ways to get the message out, that's a strategic decision,'' said
the consultant. ``We've got to take a serious look, as any campaign
would, on where (the) soft spots are. You have to be very shrewd in
your targeting. The open primary dynamic has changed the
fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   State GOP officials declined to take sides in the dustup, saying
that whatever happens, March 7 will be good for Republicans here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about the debate that's occurring between the
Republican presidential candidates _ it has excited Republicans
from Del Norte to San Diego,'' said Stuart DeVeaux, spokesman for
the state GOP. ``If anything, we're waiting for Bradley to start
beating up on Gore.''

MIRAMAX'S `CIDER HOUSE' SUCCESS MAKES RIVALS GROUCHY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GLENN WHIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ For Miramax, it was a day to celebrate. For
other studios, the good news was tempered with a mixture of fear
and loathing.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's Oscar nominations produced several story lines: the
large number of first-time nominees, the absence of favorites both
perennial (Tom Hanks) and otherwise (Jim Carrey) and the academy's
propensity to reward mainstream films over more inventive fare.
</P>
<P>
   For industry insiders, however, one topic dominated above all
others: Miramax had somehow done it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules,'' the pleasant adaptation of John
Irving's novel, received seven Oscar nominations, tying it with
``The Insider'' for second place behind favorite ``American
Beauty,'' which won eight nods.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Cider House'' nominations seemed to come a bit out of left
field. The film didn't win any critics prizes and was shut out last
month at the Golden Globes. It hasn't proved to be a favorite with
audiences, either, taking in only $22 million since its December
release, the least of any of the best picture nominees.
</P>
<P>
   That figure is about to change, now that academy voters have
spoken. Get ready to be bombarded (again) with television and
newspaper ads for a movie that many people have been more than
happy to ignore for the past three months. The studio plans to
almost double the number of theaters showing the film, from about
800 screens to 1,500 by the end of the month. That gives Miramax a
month to market it to moviegoers and academy voters before the
Oscars are handed out March 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get seven nominations for that film is unbelievable,'' a
rival studio executive groused. ``But that's Miramax. That's the
way they play. They'll spend whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds another studio exec: ``Miramax isn't in the movie business.
They're in the Oscar business.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaints echo gripes heard last year when Miramax's
``Shakespeare In Love'' scored an upset victory over DreamWorks'
highly touted war film, ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Rivals charged
that Miramax used ``strong-arm tactics'' to coerce voters and that
it distorted the process by spending up to $15 million on
``Shakespeare's'' advertising campaign. Miramax denied both
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Twentieth Century Fox studio chief Bill Mechanic went so far as
to write a column in the Hollywood Reporter, decrying rampant Oscar
campaign spending, saying `'the academy advertising process, which
began as a way of reminding us of movies to consider, has turned
into a sledgehammer system of overwhelming voters into thinking
they'd be foolish not to vote for the `designated choice.'''
</P>
<P>
   While celebrating their victories Tuesday, Miramax executives
were quick to point out that their Oscar campaign for ``Cider
House'' was no more excessive than those run for ``American
Beauty,'' ``The Green Mile'' or even ``The Hurricane,'' a movie
that was all but ignored in the nominations, save for a lone nod to
lead actor Denzel Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Swartz, Miramax's in-house awards consultant who ran
this year's ``Cider House'' campaign, says the seven Oscar nods
came as no surprise to anyone at the studio, particularly given the
fact that the movie also received nominations from the producers,
directors, writers and sound guilds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You add those votes up and you get a best picture
nomination,'' Swartz says.
</P>
<P>
   She added that ``Cider House'' is the latest in a long line of
Miramax Oscar contenders that combine ``great word of mouth,
audience appeal and expert craftsmanship ... the kinds of things
that the academy tends to look for.'' Past Miramax movies that fit
that description: ``The English Patient,'' ``Life Is Beautiful,''
``Il Postino'' and ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran Oscar consultant defends Miramax: ``They spend a
lot, but you can't buy an Oscar. At least, not yet. Anyway, look at
`The Sixth Sense.' They barely ran a campaign and they got six
nominations, including best picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds a rival studio executive: ``Their campaigns aren't any
different from other studios _ only more successful.''
</P>
<P>
   And that may be what rankles people the most. Even in years that
Miramax doesn't have an obvious Oscar contender, it manages to
almost conjure one out of thin air.
</P>
<P>
   Can the long-shot ``Cider House'' pull off an upset and beat
``American Beauty,'' which, like ``Saving Private Ryan,'' was made
by DreamWorks?
</P>
<P>
   Common sense says no. History indicates otherwise.

LAWYER LOSES BID TO SUE FOUR AREA CASINOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Kansas City lawyer who said he lost more
than $95,000 gambling at ``illegal'' area riverboats since 1994 has
lost an appeal to save his proposed class-action federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen B. Small filed the claim in 1997, based on a Missouri
Supreme Court decision that said some off-river casinos were
operating illegally. Small appealed a federal district judge's
dismissal of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Small alleged that defendants Harrah's North Kansas City Casino
&AMP; Hotel, Argosy Riverside Casino, Station Casino Kansas City and
the Flamingo Hilton Casino had ``reaped hundreds of millions of
dollars in receipts from the conduct of land-based or
non-Missouri-River-based gambling games ... (which the Supreme
Court has declared) unconstitutional gambling activities in the
state of Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday upheld the
dismissal, ruling that the casinos hold valid state gambling
licenses and that Missouri voters in November 1998 retroactively
legalized games of chance aboard casinos moored off-river.
</P>
<P>
   Small had sought to have himself appointed administrator of a
fund that would have been established by the court with casino
revenue to pay back ``persons who conveyed money ... in unlawful
gambling games of chance'' at the four casinos.

KANSAS MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO CHARGES FROM WRECK THAT SERIOUSLY
INJURED WOMAN

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ From the moment his pickup veered into
oncoming traffic and collided with a woman's car, severely injuring
her, Larry R. Watson II has taken responsibility for what happened.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday he made it official, pleading guilty in Johnson
County, Kan., District Court to aggravated battery and driving
under the influence of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Olathe, Kan., man faces 34 months in prison if
the judge follows plea negotiations. Sentencing is April 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all my fault. I shouldn't have been drinking,'' Watson
told one of the first witnesses to reach the wreck Sept. 29, said
Lannie Ornburn, an assistant district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's attorney, William Grimshaw, said Watson would not
request probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been Mr. Watson's position that he is responsible
and should pay the penalty,'' Grimshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Kelleher, 30, was in a coma for several days after the
collision near 153rd Street and Lindenwood Drive in Olathe, Kan.,
Ornburn said.
</P>
<P>
   She was in the hospital until Oct. 12 and spent two more months
in a rehabilitation center. She still requires twice-weekly
rehabilitation sessions, and doctors say she may never fully regain
her motor skills, Ornburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's blood-alcohol level was measured after the wreck at
0.14 percent, Ornburn said, almost twice the legal limit of 0.08.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also estimated that his truck was going 58 mph
when he began braking and 45 mph at impact. The speed limit is 30
mph on that part of Lindenwood, Ornburn said.

WARRENSBURG TRAGEDY LEAVES TOWN IN SHOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TANYANIKA SAMUELS and LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARRENSBURG, Mo. _ As Maj. Randy Vick drove down a rural highway
Monday morning, the words of the 911 dispatcher echoed in his head:
A family had been shot at 75 Southeast 501 Road.
</P>
<P>
   It hit him: He knew this family, the Woods, from church.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling his Johnson County sheriff's car onto the gravel
driveway, Vick saw Raymond Wood standing calmly, his parents
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Vick ordered his friend onto the ground, and a deputy handcuffed
him. Before the day ended, Raymond Wood would be charged in the
deaths of his wife and four of their children. He made his first
court appearance Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours earlier, it was becoming all too clear to Vick
exactly what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   He saw Jared, 10, lying face down just outside the Woods'
below-ground home. Joshua, 8, lay on a nearby hill.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Vick found the baby, 1-year-old Catlin, toddling around
in bloodied clothes. On the floor lay her sisters, Emily, 7, and
Moriah, 3.
</P>
<P>
   Back outside the home, Vick saw their 31-year-old mother, Tina
Wood, inside the family van, which had crashed into an embankment.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Wood's father, Gerald, told Vick that 5-year-old Hannah
was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Vick went back into the house, where he found her curled up
underneath a bed, lying on a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   He felt for a pulse.
</P>
<P>
   There was none.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible,'' Vick said, ``as horribly shocking as
anything could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputies took Raymond Wood to the Johnson County Jail. He later
was charged with killing Tina Wood and four of their children:
Jared, Joshua, Emily and Hannah. He also was charged with
assaulting the two other children, who survived.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, 36, was formally charged Tuesday morning with five counts
of first-degree murder, two counts of first-degree assault and
seven counts of armed criminal action. A public defender was
appointed for him.
</P>
<P>
   Wood will return to court this afternoon, when his attorney will
be present.
</P>
<P>
   He is being held in the Johnson County Jail on $2 million bond.
Authorities said Wood, who went through bouts of crying Tuesday,
was being watched closely because authorities feared he might
attempt suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The two surviving children were still being cared for late
Tuesday at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City. Moriah was in
critical condition, and Catlin was in fair condition, a hospital
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The two children were placed in the custody of the Missouri
Division of Family Services. A division official said the children
would likely live with relatives or a foster family after leaving
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The family's home is in unincorporated Johnson County, about
four miles east of Warrensburg. There, they lived just yards away
from Wood's parents, Gerald and Carol.
</P>
<P>
   The children's maternal grandparents live in Alaska, where Tina
and Raymond Wood both grew up, relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   The Woods had lived outside of Warrensburg for about 12 years,
Vick said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw the Wood family every Sunday at a Restoration
church in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration churches are an offshoot of the Reorganized Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. When the RLDS church began
ordaining women, some church members broke off to start their own
congregations, called Restoration, church officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Woods spent much of the week at their new house, an ``earth
contact'' home they completed last year. Vick said Raymond Wood
didn't want to live in a traditional house because he was afraid of
tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Wood worked with his father in a chimney repair
business, and Tina Wood home-schooled the four older children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tina was a wonderful mother, very talented,'' Vick said. ``She
taught them everything, piano, singing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tina Egan Wood, who graduated from Lathrop High School in
Fairbanks, Alaska, also taught piano to neighborhood children.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Wood did not want to talk about the killings Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do anything now to make it better,'' she said. ``We
still have two grandchildren, and we're going to concentrate on
them.''

   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Detroit's Grant Hill and Jerry Stackhouse, the NBA's
second-highest-scoring twosome, spent the weekend dunking and
2balling and showing off in the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Shandon Anderson and Cuttino Mobley were relatively hard to find
when the league shined its spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   If you looked closely enough, you could spot Mobley either
playing in the rookie game or tossing a pass to Steve Francis in
the dunk contest. Anderson had a comfy seat in front of a big
screen in Atlanta. NBC declined to feature either in a commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Then the real games started up again Tuesday night, and the
Rockets twosome threw themselves into the teeth of the Pistons and
carried Houston to a 107-102 win.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Rockets (21-30) a home record better than
.500 for the first time this season. They are 14-13 at Compaq
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Mobley combined for 46 points to give the Rockets
all they would need and were more than the Pistons, the league's
highest-scoring team, could handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was really important that they just didn't have a
one-sided game,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``I thought
we pushed it at them pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson led the Rockets with 25 points, adding six rebounds and
four assists. It marked the sixth time this season he has led the
Rockets in scoring, and the Rockets have won all six.
</P>
<P>
   It was also one of many games in which Anderson took on a high
scorer _ Allen Iverson, Ron Mercer, Penny Hardaway and now Hill _
and had one of his best offensive nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to score against anybody,'' Anderson said with a laugh.
``I always want to go at somebody, but especially against those
guys. They're the core of their team. They both got more than 20
shots up tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it was just Anderson's fifth game with at least 20
points, Tomjanovich described it as typical of Anderson's style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shandon was great,'' Tomjanovich said. ``He's all over the
place. It was one of those Shandon games where he's finding a way
to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we'll see more and more of that. He's the kind of
guy who finds holes in the defense. When you've got a guy who plays
so hard and the effort is always there, good things are going to
happen. He's going to have games like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley added 21 points, including 14 in the second quarter, when
he drove the Rockets to an 18-point lead. But unlike Anderson, who
said he purposely sought to step up his offensive game to make Hill
and Stackhouse work defensively, Mobley said he was simply in his
usual role as a scorer off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just go out and play, and it doesn't matter if it's against
them or anybody else,'' Mobley said. ``I've played against guys
like that since I was 16.''
</P>
<P>
   Stackhouse and Hill had their usual high-scoring games and then
some. But neither could maintain any control of the game.
Stackhouse led all scorers with 29 points, but he made just 10 of
26 shots, including four of 12 in the second half and one of five
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Hill had 23 points, 11 rebounds and six assists. But he also had
a season-high eight turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wears you down chasing us around instead of going down
there relaxing,'' Anderson said. ``If we make those guys run
around, when they come back down they're breathing hard, and it's
hard to get your legs under your shots. Sometimes your best defense
is your offense.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Pistons picked themselves up nicely, knocking all but
two points off that 18-point second-quarter deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Rockets lost their composure with their lead fading
so rapidly, they found themselves almost as soon as the fourth
quarter started.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even talk about it,'' Mobley said. ``We just kept
playing. We stayed aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   It took two minutes to push what was a five-point lead going
into the quarter to 10. Later, with one more strong two-minute
push, they built it back to 14.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon scored on a drive, and when Pistons coach Alvin
Gentry, the NBA leader in technical fouls, complained about that
drive, he drew a technical foul. Mobley made the free throw for a
92-79 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After a Hill drive, the Rockets had another three-point
possession. Steve Francis hit a free throw, then grabbed the
rebound of his miss.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon scored on a turnaround jumper to push the lead to 95-81
with seven minutes left. The Rockets were still up by 12 with two
minutes left when Gentry cleared his bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense is nonexistent,'' Stackhouse said. ``Houston got
too many easy opportunities, and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hill: ``It's amazing we have above a .500 record (25-24)
considering where our defense is.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the Rockets' offensive sources _ six players scored
in double figures _ they cited their defensive effort for slowing
the prolific Pistons offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against a really athletic team, I thought we did a good job
defensively, especially in the first half,'' Tomjanovich said. ``In
the second half, they really got it going. They're tough to guard.
They really are.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, so were a Rockets twosome, even if they might not
yet star in NBA productions or soft-drink commercials.

CHICAGO REMINDED OF WHAT IT'S MISSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In a town where every Bulls game used to be Super Bowl
Sunday, Tuesday night was as good as it gets these days.
</P>
<P>
   The United Center was packed, not just for the return of coach
Phil Jackson, but for Shaq and Kobe and the only Bulls game that
has mattered since Michael Jordan retired two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls tried to play down Jackson's return, but their gritty
88-76 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers suggested otherwise. This is a
team with only 10 victories and looking at a whole lot of bad
before it gets good.
</P>
<P>
   There was a pregame ovation for Jackson in remembrance of the
six NBA titles he helped bring to this city. When the game started,
the Lakers played like a victory was only a matter of time. The
Bulls played as if every trip down the court was their last.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gone now,'' said Bulls forward Elton Brand, the No.e pick
in last year's draft. ``We didn't play well because of him. We have
to plot our own course.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a slow process, but with 7:08 left Monday and the
score tied at 67, a playoff game broke out, probably the only one
this building will host for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal moved into the paint and was taken down by Will
Perdue, a center on three of Jackson's championships in Chicago.
There was a brief scuffle and Perdue was given a flagrant foul.
</P>
<P>
   But the real damage for the Bulls came when O'Neal sank both
free throws, then came back and hit a six-foot hook shot.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the buzz of a sellout crowd, the game ended right
there. It was the Lakers' first victory in Chicago since March 11,
1995. But the theater was far from over.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal called Perdue a bum. Perdue mentioned his four
championship rings, including one last year with the Spurs, and
asked how many Shaq was carrying In a flash, the attention moved
off Jackson and onto O'Neal, who sank 11 of 12 free throws despite
a sore shoulder. Shaq entered the game shooting 48 percent from the
line this season and 54 percent for his career.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, he hit his first nine. Perdue said if that
continues, the NBA season could be over for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers fans should be ecstatic about the possibilities. Perdue
said he was proud of his young teammates, who said they were not
overwhelmed by all the Jackson hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great story, Phil's first visit back,'' Perdue
said. ``There were a lot of people who came out tonight who haven't
been here all year and I want to thank him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson arrived in town Monday but got the town buzzing at last
weekend's All-Star Game with not-so-subtle jabs at his former
bosses Jerry Reinsdorf and Jerry Krause. During his final years in
Chicago, Jackson and Krause often battled over decision-making with
the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson did not see Krause and Reinsdorf but caught up with many
old friends.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after he left the Bulls and sat out the season, the
Bulls honored Jackson in a ceremony that included hoisting a banner
to remember his 545 victories with the club.
</P>
<P>
   At the morning shootaround, Lakers guard Kobe Bryant kidded
Jackson about seeing the coach's name in the rafters with Jordan
and former Bulls greats Bob Love and Jerry Sloan, now the coach in
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the number of wins?'' Bryant asked. ``And what did
Jerry Sloan do for this organization?''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson admitted there was plenty of emotion when he received a
loud ovation from the sellout crowd of 23,208. There were a few
empty seats, a sign that all is not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for all the photographers,'' he said. ``I couldn't
see any of the people and there were a lot of them out there. It
was a warm welcome, a very friendly welcome. I thanked the Bulls
for not doing anything extraordinary. I might have broke down and
cried.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other bench, Bulls rookie Ron Artest didn't know what to
make of the applause. He knows the history. It hangs high above the
floor and resides in the hearts of every Bulls fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard a lot of cheering here but never that loud for
someone on the other team,'' he said. ``We want to keep those for
us.''

BUSH HAS SOME CALIFORNIANS FEELING LEFT BEHIND
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
With just three weeks to go before the California primary, GOP
front-runner George W. Bush has riled some California Republicans
by suggesting he may not attend the only debate scheduled in the
state before voters go to the polls on March 7.
<P>
   Some GOP insiders say they're now worried that the Texas
governor may be taking the state for granted, and that not debating
in California could hurt his campaign for the Republican
presidential nomination _ as well as the GOP cause in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something counterintuitive about not showing up to
campaign in the biggest state in the nation,'' said Don Casper,
chairman of the San Francisco Republican Party and a pledged
delegate for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all realize that a candidate can't be everywhere he wants
to be. But given California's importance and its peculiar open
primary, it would seem prudent of Gov. Bush to make a series of
appearances _ or at least one major appearance _ before the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate between Republican presidential candidates, sponsored
by CNN and the Los Angeles Times, is scheduled for March 2 in Los
Angeles, and organizers insisted this week that Bush had informally
committed to appearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's top state campaign officials this week said the GOP
presidential hopeful never agreed to the event and may not be
there. They said the governor's schedule was fluid after South
Carolina's primary on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign's debate announcement raised concerns from
some state GOP activists, who noted that the governor has skipped
the past three state conventions _ the most recent this month _ and
hasn't visited the state since November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush keeps sending out mixed messages. He keeps saying he's
going to compete vigorously in California, but he needs to back
that up with some action,'' said GOP consultant Matt Cunningham,
the former state spokesman for the Forbes campaign. ``It would send
a discouraging message to Republicans to skip the Los Angeles
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The suggestions that Bush could be a no-show at the California
debate also drew a bemused response from the campaign of GOP rival
John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For California Republicans, this is the ghost of presidential
campaigns past,'' said Dan Schnur, communications director for the
McCain campaign. ``George Bush Sr. blew off the state entirely, Bob
Dole didn't campaign here until it was too late, and now Gov. Bush
is telling the people that this isn't a priority for him either.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain believes it's important for the people of
California to see and hear the candidates talk about the issues,''
said Schnur. ``Thirty-three million Californians are worth that
attention ... and we'll be there, either way.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign had another reason to be happy about its
prospects. The Associated Press reported last night that California
Secretary of State Bill Jones, the state's highest-ranking
Republican, will endorse McCain at a news conference Wednesday in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   CNN and the Los Angeles Times scheduled the California debate
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has told us informally that he is planning on
attending,'' Maryanne McNellis, president of the Times' National
Edition told Chronicle columnist Debra J. Saunders. McNellis said
Bush has assured Times staffers on the campaign trail that he'd be
there, and added, ``We are expecting him. ... We'd hate to see his
campaign represented by an empty chair.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, there have been reports that GOP candidates
could appear at another California debate _ one planned by the
Technology Network, a Silicon Valley advocacy group _ possibly
using the Internet as a venue.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellen Stroud, spokeswoman for the group, ruled that out day,
saying negotiations had been under way, but ``we decided not to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That left state Republicans debating the fallout Tuesday should
Bush pass up the the only scheduled debate in California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush holds a three-point lead over McCain in California in the
latest Public Policy Institute of California poll.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign said the governor will be no stranger to his
supporters in California before voters go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush is going to campaign vigorously throughout the
state of California leading up to the primary in the coming
weeks,'' Alixe Mattingly of Bush's California campaign said
yesterday. ``He has devoted much time to California. He has an
unprecedented grassroots organization throughout the state which is
enthusiastically working on his behalf now and in the coming
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one leading Republican state consultant noted that with
Bush holding the lead in crucial primaries in South Carolina and
Michigan, McCain has little to lose by making an issue of the
California debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course John McCain will come out here and do every free
appearance he can. He needs the earned media,'' the consultant
said.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, the strategist said, may have more to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he decides to take a pass on it because there are other
ways to get the message out, that's a strategic decision,'' said
the consultant. ``We've got to take a serious look, as any campaign
would, on where (the) soft spots are. You have to be very shrewd in
your targeting. The open primary dynamic has changed the
fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   State GOP officials declined to take sides in the dustup, saying
that whatever happens, March 7 will be good for Republicans here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about the debate that's occurring between the
Republican presidential candidates _ it has excited Republicans
from Del Norte to San Diego,'' said Stuart DeVeaux, spokesman for
the state GOP. ``If anything, we're waiting for Bradley to start
beating up on Gore.''

POLICE COMMISSION GIVEN FIRST CHANCE TO INVESTIGATE RAMPART
SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Six months after the Rampart Division scandal
erupted, Los Angeles officials stood together for the first time
Tuesday and supported the LAPD investigation and Police Commission
review process in the face of calls for independent probes of the
LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are seeing is a landmark event in the history of Los
Angeles,'' Mayor Richard Riordan said at a news conference after
appearing before the City Council with Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks and Police Commission President Gerald Chaleff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are standing together to support the Christopher Commission
reforms and an independent civilian investigation by our Police
Commission.''
</P>
<P>
   As Riordan was making his rare appearance before the council,
the chorus of demands for appointment of an independent blue-ribbon
commission to investigate the Rampart scandal was reaching a
crescendo.
</P>
<P>
   But the council, on a 15-0 vote, chose to heed the call and
agreed to provide the Police Commission with whatever resources it
needs _ estimated at somewhere in the range of $1 million _ to hire
staffers to analyze the Los Angeles Police Department's Board of
Inquiry report, due within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro and other council leaders then joined Riordan, Parks and
Chaleff at the news conference in an unusual show of unity.
</P>
<P>
   It was an extraordinary day of official Los Angeles moving from
the Police Commission to the City Council to contain the
investigation prompted by statements from former Officer Rafael
Perez that he and members of the anti-gang Community Resources
Against Street Hoodlums unit beat and shot suspected gang members,
planted evidence on them and testified falsely to get them
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Among the developments:
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he will release his several-hundred-page Board of
Inquiry report to the Police Commission by March 1. He said it
contains more than 100 recommendations for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said criminal investigators are prepared to move beyond
the testimony of Perez and look at other officers who might be
involved in misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Joel Wachs called for an independent panel of
jurists, civil and religious leaders to examine what happened at
the Rampart Division and what can be done to avert future problems.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Laura Chick called for a review of the LAPD's
Internal Affairs group to explore whether a more independent unit
is needed to ferret out corrupt cops or unjustified shootings.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles, said he is looking at
filing a federal civil rights lawsuit against the LAPD to control
the anti-gang CRASH units, as well as asking for federal and state
investigators to oversee whatever findings come from the LAPD. He
also joined a call by the American Civil Liberties Union of
Southern California to have an independent panel review the Board
of Inquiry report.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan spoke out strongly in favor of keeping the investigation
in the hands of the Police Commission as the first test of the
Christopher Commission reforms adopted after the March 1991 police
beating of African-American motorist Rodney King.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a system in place for civilian oversight and we should
use that,'' Riordan told the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also complained about the slow pace at which the
District Attorney's Office is moving on information provided by the
LAPD on potential criminal filings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you seek perfection and it's not there,'' Riordan
said. ``The seeking of perfection can sometimes delay things until
they never get done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Inquiry Report, originally scheduled to be released
in November or December, took a look at the entire Police
Department's operating structure and into how failures could occur,
leading to what allegedly happened in the Rampart Division. It is
separate from the criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is blame, it goes from the newest officer on the
street up to the chief of police,'' Parks said. ``There is enough
blame to go around for all of us in the Police Department. Our
systems fell apart and we are all facing responsibility for this
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us likes this. None of us likes waking up and reading
what we're reading. I've been in this department 35 years and I
will not let Rafael Perez be the symbol of the LAPD.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting also gave City Council members an opportunity to
vent their frustration over the scandal, the length of time the
inquiry has taken and what it has done to the image of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an outrage and an insult to the people of this city,''
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter said. ``It's like someone has stuck a
thumb in the eye of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Rita Walters said it appeared to be ``a serial
eruption of crises'' involving the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Hernandez said he was concerned the council and
the city were losing sight of the real problems in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my district of Westlake-Pico Union, people there are more
concerned about reducing crime,'' Hernandez said. ``Yes, there is
concern over this, but there is concern over crime rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan noted it was the department itself that caught Perez for
stealing drugs from a police evidence locker and eventually got him
to talk in exchange for leniency.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he believes the report by the Board of Inquiry,
conducted by command officers, and the subsequent review by the
Police Commission will end up restoring public confidence in the
LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the end, public confidence will be restored by how we
do our job every day,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Wachs, a candidate for mayor, said he believes public confidence
will be restored only with an independent review.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rampart scandal may well be the most serious man-made
disaster our city has ever faced,'' Wachs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about the horrors. People killed, framed, imprisoned and
beaten by the very people we've entrusted to protect us from such
criminal behavior. The Rampart scandal has scarred the city and
tarnished the reputations of an internationally renowned
department.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachs wants all aspects of the scandal examined, including how
such a disregard for the law and the truth could develop, whether
there is a culture within the LAPD to cover up such incidents, and
whether the District Attorney's Office and City Attorney's Office
failed to act properly.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the proposal will not be formally discussed until
next week, Councilman Mike Feuer said he would oppose such a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should let our system work,'' Feuer said. ``Doing this
would be a diminution of the Police Commission and its authority.''

LAKE TAHOE STUDY FINDS ALARMING RISE IN RUNOFF, ALGAE, AIR 
 POLLUTION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ An unprecedented study of environmental
troubles in the Lake Tahoe Basin gives the fabled Sierra region as
little as 10 more years of healthy life unless strong measures are
taken to control water runoff and air pollution.
<P>
   The 1,200-page Lake Tahoe Watershed Assessment being released
Wednesday compiles 20 years of scientific data with the results of
a two-year crash research program and is designed to avert what
could be one of the West's worst ecological disasters _ one that
also would have dire economic consequences for the tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a decade or two left to do something or we lose the
water quality of Lake Tahoe forever,'' said study co-author Charles
Goldman, emeritus professor at the University of California at
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   That projected life expectancy of the lake was based on current
rates of phosphorous and nitrogen runoff, among other pollutants
contributing to algae blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Already, floating mats of algae are seen in some areas as the
lake loses water clarity at the rate of about one foot a year.
Unless the trend is stopped in time, scientists said, the damage
will be irreversible, putting Lake Tahoe on track to become as dead
and dark as Clear Lake _ one of California's more notable
foul-water disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Tahoe's troubling loss of water clarity was traced to a thicket
of tough problems, including:
</P>
<P>
   -- Water that runs off the roads each spring, carrying road salt
and other fine materials into streams that empty into the lake.
</P>
<P>
   -- Building activity in the Tahoe watershed, which disturbs
soils and adds to the natural runoff of clay.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fire suppression, which prevents natural small-scale fires
from clearing brush and downed timber. That leads to more damaging
catastrophic fires and unhealthy forests, adding to the lake's
woes.
</P>
<P>
   The study resulted from a multiagency effort begun in 1997 at
the behest of President Clinton's administration after a
presidential tour of the famed blue jewel of the Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   It outlines a complicated mix of air, water and
forest-management woes _ and sets the stage for a new era of
environmental study and protection efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from UC Davis, the University of Nevada at Reno and
the nonprofit Desert Research Institute participated in the study,
and plan future cooperative scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   A formal announcement was scheduled for today, when the full
report will be released. Plans call for the institutions to share
existing laboratories in the Tahoe region in a so-called Tahoe
Environmental Science System, as well as new labs planned by the
two universities. A $5 million grant is being sought from the
National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Tahoe's environmental champions and regulatory watchdogs said
the study did not answer some of the most critical questions,
however, including the exact source of the phosphorous runoff that
is clouding crystalline waters made famous by Mark Twain and
millions of travelers who followed in his footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the study, for all its dry prose and rows of estimated
effluent tonnages, represents a ``great stride forward'' in terms
of breaking the bureaucratic infighting that has long stymied
protection efforts, said Chris Knopp, natural resource staff
officer at the U.S. Forest Service Tahoe Basin Management Unit.
</P>
<P>
   One of the report's central findings is that environmental
protection will go nowhere in Lake Tahoe unless the impact on human
activities is taken into full account.
</P>
<P>
   ``No realistic solution will arise from the environmental
perspective without paying attention to the socioeconomic
consequences,'' Knopp said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cahill, a UC Davis atmospheric scientist and physicist, said
one of the study's take-home messages is that Lake Tahoe in
prehistoric times was quite different than it is today. For one
thing, the air was much smokier in the summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically there was an average of 30 acres of the Tahoe basin
burning every day from May to October,'' Cahill said. ``And that
was a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the forests have grown weedy with small pines and too many
fast-growing trees and scrub, far more than can be justified by the
region's natural cycle of growth and decay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tahoe has three times as many trees as can be supported,''
Cahill said. ``We have the wrong kind of trees and too many
trees.''
</P>
<P>
   The stately Jeffrey pines that used to dominate the area stored
their nitrogen in the needles, and were protected from the periodic
small fires that raged at their roots. Today, thickets of greenery
create a constant threat of devastating fires that can cook
streams, eradicate amphibians _ and release tons of algae-feeding
nutrients into the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone levels in the area are getting worse despite cleaner fuels
and two decades of air-pollution controls that have delivered
clearer air to most other regions of the state. Scientists traced
that problem to traffic tie-ups on Interstate 80 and Highway 50.
</P>
<P>
   Even if all current runoff were eliminated, Knopp said, it would
take another 20 to 30 years before visible benefits are seen
because so much lake sediment is roiled to the surface with
seasonal changes in water temperature.
</P>
<P>
   And there is little chance of any immediate consensus to stop
the runoff, given some striking gaps in scientific knowledge
unearthed by the new study. Most notable was the study's failure to
pinpoint just where the bad stuff is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   Phosphorous, for example, is pouring into the lake at the
estimated rate of 45.7 metric tons a year. But scientists said the
source of the phosphorous that does the most damage is unclear, as
is the most effective way to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Possible sources include such disparate sources as wood-burning
stoves, residual discharge of old underground tanks and vehicle
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mystery, however, about the result. At current
rates, the lake will lose about 30 feet of clarity by 2030 _
despite all the past efforts to keep Tahoe clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we're still losing the lake,'' Cahill said.

   A leak in a steam generator at the Indian Point 2 nuclear
reactor in Westchester County, N.Y., released a small amount of
radiation from the plant Tuesday night, forcing officials to shut
it down and declare an alert.
</P>
<P>
   The plant's owner, Consolidated Edison, stressed that the leak
was what it called ``momentary'' and that there was no danger to
residents of the surrounding area or to employees of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   But the declaration of the alert _ the second level of four
categories of nuclear emergency _ was the first issued by Con
Edison since it began generating nuclear energy in 1974. Con Ed
officials said Tuesday night that they did not know what caused the
leak.
</P>
<P>
   The leak in the 1,000-megawatt plant, in Buchanan, about 35
miles north of New York City, occurred at about 7:30 p.m., said
Michael Spall, a Con Ed spokesman. It allowed hot, radioactive
water, which is supposed to be kept isolated, to mix with clean
water that flows out of the reactor's containment dome into a
turbine that spins to generate electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The leak of radioactive gas into the air occurred because the
plant has a system for ejecting air from the steam loop in order to
limit corrosion, Spall said. He added, however, that ``several
seconds later'' the system diverted the air back to the containment
dome, limiting the amount of radioactive gas released.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any releases would have posed no threat to the safety of plant
personnel or the general public,'' he added. ``While this is a
serious event, it is not one that threatens public health and
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   There are four categories of nuclear event: a notification, an
alert, a site area emergency, and a general emergency, which is
what occurred at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The company quickly sent monitoring teams to the plant's
perimeter, but they found radiation to be normal, Spall said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plant produces about one-seventh of the power used
by Con Ed's 3 million customers, officials said there was no power
shortage, nor would there be one because of backup systems.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Michalski, a spokesman for the New York State Emergency
Management Office, said that Con Edison followed all the proper
safety procedures, and alerted the state agency's office in 15
minutes. He added that the leak ``occurred within the generating
structure, but they shut off the valve so none of that steam left
the facility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission received a report from Con
Edison at 8:07 p.m., within the one-hour reporting time limit.
Spall said the leak was in a steam generator, which is a heat
exchanger inside the containment dome. The leak opened a path for
mildly radioactive water to flow out of containment and into the
turbine hall, from which ``a small amount'' was released to the
environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Point's steam generators, four of them for each reactor,
are towering metal vessels, filled with thin-walled metal tubes, in
the shape of an upside-down U. The tubes are filled with water that
flows through the nuclear core to the steam generators and then
back to the core, carrying heat away from the reactor so it can be
used to make electricity. This water gradually picks up radioactive
contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the tubes there is clean, nonradioactive water, which is
pumped in and boils. The steam flows out through giant pipes,
through the heavy concrete and steel wall of the containment dome
to the turbine hall, which is used to spin a turbine and make
electricity. This nonradioactive steam is then run through a big
metal cooling box called a condenser, where it is turned back into
water. The condenser is kept cool with water from the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   The alert was the first in the plant's operating history, said
Spall. Indian Point 2 opened in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, Spall said that operators had shut off the flow of
steam from the steam generator, and shut off the flow of water that
is boiled into steam. And they had reduced pressure in the reactor
to 1,000 pounds per square inch, he said. Normal operating pressure
is above 2,000 pounds per square inch. But bringing the reactor to
cold shutdown _ when it is cool enough to open up without the
cooling water boiling away _ was still several hours away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other reactors of similar design, called pressurized water
reactors, have had steam generator problems.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Point 3, which is owned by the New York Power Authority,
had corrosion and cracking problems with its steam generators, and
replaced them. But Con Edison said it did not need to, perhaps
because it paid closer attention to water chemistry, to limit
corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester Gas &AMP; Electric's Robert E. Ginna reactor suffered a
steam generator tube rupture in January 1982. Many plants have been
closed for months by steam generator tube problems.
</P>
<P>
   With the economic value of nuclear plants much diminished by
changes in technology and in utility rules, it was not clear
whether it would pay to replace the steam generators, if that were
to become necessary. Like an old car that needed a new
transmission, a severe steam generator problem could lead to
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison said earlier this month that it would offer the
reactor for sale this year.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Point 2 has had a spotty history in recent years. In
1994, the plant broke the world record for longest continuous
operation _ 19 months _ of a light-water reactor, the kind used in
the United States and most of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But in December 1996, a minor chemical spill forced the plant to
shut down. In 1998, the plant was closed again, this time for
several months, because of safety concerns. And last September, the
plant was temporarily shut down after a series of electrical
problems that caused the system to misread temperature and pressure
readings and throw the plant into shutdown.

 HEARST CORP. REPORTS THAT EXAMINER HAS SEVERAL POTENTIAL BUYERS  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Political consultant and onetime mayoral
candidate Clint Reilly, who filed a lawsuit to block the Hearst
Corp. from purchasing The San Francisco Chronicle, emerged Tuesday
as one of several potential buyers of the rival San Francisco
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst had set a deadline of Tuesday afternoon for offers to be
submitted by potential buyers. Reilly's lawyer, Joseph M. Alioto,
told the Associated Press that his client had been invited by
Hearst to submit a proposal for the 112-year-old paper and
subsequently did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did make a proposal,'' Alioto was quoted as saying. ``He's
an unusual guy, and he's willing to do this and put up his money to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, a millionaire political consultant, spent more than $3.5
million trying to unseat San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Reilly attended a meeting at the Examiner and ended up
with a broken ankle following a dust-up with Executive Editor Phil
Bronstein. He subsequently filed an assault-and-battery suit, which
was settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly is currently overseas on business and could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst said Tuesday only that it had received several
``indications of interest'' from potential buyers of the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are presently engaged in the process of reviewing and
evaluating the proposals,'' said Debra Shriver, a Hearst
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   She also said no time limit exists for the company to make a
final decision on which suitor, if any, will be chosen to purchase
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner has been for sale since August, when Hearst said it
intended to purchase the Chronicle for $660 million. If no buyer
for the Examiner emerges, Hearst has said it would close the paper
and merge its staff with that of The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect that Hearst is now gnashing its teeth in
disappointment,'' said Stephen Barnett, a law professor at the
University of California at Berkeley and newspaper antitrust
expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the last thing they wanted to happen,'' he
said. ``A sale would mean competition for the Chronicle. The last
thing Hearst wants is competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Justice is investigating Hearst's purchase of
The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto also told the Chronicle Tuesday that Hearst asked Reilly
late last week to postpone a March 9 hearing on his lawsuit until
March 23.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto said he filed Tuesday for the delay ``based upon written
assurances that they would not consummate any deal until that
date'' or would give 10 days' notice before a sale is made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not expect them to be doing anything before the
hearing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, which had originally placed a ``for sale'' sign only on
the Examiner's name and subscription list, sweetened the deal last
month by including a printing plant, the Examiner office building,
trucks and other assets.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department and city officials had complained that Hearst
was not making a sincere effort to find a buyer for the paper.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, even the new-and-improved sale terms do not include
the joint operating agreement under which the Examiner and
Chronicle have shared resources _ and revenue _ for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Without a continuation of the agreement, which expires in any
case in 2005, critics have charged that Hearst is not serious about
finding a new owner for the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   UC Berkeley's Barnett said any sale would probably have to
include at least a temporary extension of the joint operating
agreement to make the change in ownership a smooth one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether the Justice Department will look over
Hearst's shoulder to make sure they make a reasonable deal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst offered no clues Tuesday as to who might be interested in
purchasing the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Fang, publisher of San Francisco's Independent newspaper,
has been frequently mentioned as a potential buyer. He could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential buyer is the Knight Ridder chain, based in San
Jose. Chief executive Tony Ridder has said in the past that he
would not be interested in purchasing the Examiner unless it
includes the joint operating agreement with the Chronicle. He
declined to comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Singleton, whose Alameda Newspaper Group publishes the
Oakland Tribune and other newspapers, said in a statement last
month that he has ``no interest in purchasing the San Francisco
Examiner under any circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim White, publisher of the Examiner, said staff members had not
been expecting earth-shattering news Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's sort of a presumption that today, tomorrow and the
next day aren't going to be very climactic,'' he said. ``It feels
as though things are going to be dragging on for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   He had no comment on the report that Reilly had submitted a
proposal for the paper.
</P>
<P>
   One Examiner reporter said the mood was fairly low-key in the
newsroom and that ``people are just wandering around telling
jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bronstein, the Examiner's executive editor,
``People here have done remarkably well given the possibility of
distraction. They've been very professional.''

JACKSON'S RETURN: OVATION AND VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The revered icon walked again across the city's
hallowed ground, and the masses doused him with glorious warmth and
applause. Just as advertised, the return of Phil Jackson was
treated like the Second Coming.
</P>
<P>
   But even sports gods need some assistance from an apostle or
two, and fortunately for Jackson, he still makes a living coaching
the NBA's most dominant player.
</P>
<P>
   He left with Michael, returned with Shaq. And O'Neal made
certain the return was a successful one, leading Jackson's Lakers
to an 88-76 victory over the Chicago Bulls at the sold-out United
Center on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   For the 23,208 adoring fans, it was a chance to again thank
Jackson for six Bulls championships. For Jackson, it was an equally
rewarding reunion and he smiled widely during the brief moment
before tipoff when his mere stroll to the visitors' bench evoked a
hearty roar.
</P>
<P>
   But once tipoff came, it was just two teams playing ugly
basketball after the five-day All-Star break. And it took an
extraordinary effort from O'Neal to get the win _ 29 points, 20
rebounds and an 11-for-12 night from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's special for me,'' Jackson said of the win, ``and it was
special for Shaq. He was really glad to help contribute to that
win. And I thanked him for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox also came through, scoring all 11 of his points in the
fourth quarter, as the Lakers fought back from a surprising
five-point deficit and won their fourth game in a row.
</P>
<P>
   It was a key win to kick off this six-game road trip but
required a little more stress than anticipated against the 10-38
Bulls. The Lakers shot 40.2 percent from the field and didn't pull
away until midway through the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, nursing a strained right rotator cuff, played 47 minutes
and took a beating from the Bulls' rotation of foul-happy centers,
including a fourth-quarter tackle by Will Perdue. But he was happy
to win this one for Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I know how it feels to leave and come back to a place
that you really like,'' said O'Neal, referring to Orlando, his
former NBA home, ``but you always need to get that first one. We
just wanted to get it for him.''
</P>
<P>
   A composed O'Neal calmly sank his first nine free throws before
missing No. 10, then hit his last two. He was 7 for 8 in the fourth
quarter. The performance follows a 15-for-20 free-throw outing
against Minnesota, just prior to the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just take it one game a a time, and the last two games I've
been shooting them well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal appears to have settled into a new pattern for shooting
free throws, balancing the ball briefly in his right hand before
moving his left over to it and shooting. But he won't say what has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't tell you my secret,'' he said. ``I'm just making them. I
always shoot them the same. I've just been doing what I've been
doing in practice, and once I've developed some consistency, it'll
be all over. It's already all over, but it will be all over.''
</P>
<P>
   It was almost all over for the Lakers, before Fox got hot. He
and O'Neal combined for 20 points in a 21-5 Laker run in the fourth
that turned a deficit into an 11-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, Glen Rice again sat the fourth quarter, replaced
by Fox in what has become a pattern the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think I'm going to play the players that are
hot,'' Jackson said. ``And it's not going to be any pattern _ if
Glen's going great tomorrow night, I'll be more than happy to play
him. But Rick just got going, looked like he was playing well, he
played (Toni) Kukoc well in the first half. His defense was strong
and I felt comfortable with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice finished with 13 points in 25 minutes. Kobe Bryant added 21
points on 8-of-14 shooting, with five steals and one throbbing knee
after a frightening midair collision with Dickey Simpkins in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty sore,'' he said. But the knee didn't hamper him
and Bryant said afterward, ``It's pretty cool.''

 UC, STANFORD CLAIM PART OF OLD RENO  &HT;     By CARL NOLTE and BILL WORKMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the strangest land title cases in the history of the
West, the University of California and Stanford University are
laying claim to streets in the heart of Reno's downtown gambling
district.
</P>
<P>
   The issue came up when the city of Reno started going through
some dusty 131-year-old deeds and records. The city was trying to
collect money from several big casinos that had built skyways over
the downtown streets so gamblers could walk from casino to casino.
</P>
<P>
   The casinos disputed the city's claim that it owned the streets,
but when the city dug around, it found that UC and Stanford might
have title, based on deeds that went back to 1868.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is kind of strange,'' said Mike Chapman, an attorney who
represents Reno. ``No case in the country has been like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The city thought it would contact the two universities, who
inherited claims owned by the 19th century railroad moguls known as
the Big Four. The city had filed an action to quiet title to the
streets; instead, it stirred a dusty old hornets' nest.
</P>
<P>
   The universities, said Chapman, ``are taking kind of a hard line
on it.'' Indeed, they are. Both Stanford and UC say they have
rights in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made arguments in favor of our interests in the
property, and we intend to pursue this,'' said UC counsel Lloyd
Lee. ``We can't just give away assets that have substantial
value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an obligation to the trust (that established
Stanford), and we need first to qualify if there are any assets and
find their value,'' said Stanford acting general counsel Debra
Zumwalt. ``Even with something as strange as this, we have got to
look into it first.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Flanagan, a Reno lawyer UC and Stanford have retained to
represent them in Nevada, says he thinks the two universities have
a good case; he believes that Charles Crocker, one of the Big Four
and the owner of the Reno town site, never ceded the streets to the
city. Flanagan says he has some old deeds to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   The city says it has some old deeds to prove the opposite.
``Stanford and UC do not own anything,'' Chapman said.
</P>
<P>
   All of this arises out of those swashbuckling days of
yesteryear, when the West was open for the taking. A man named
Myron Lake founded a town on the banks of the Truckee River and
named it Reno, for a Civil War general.
</P>
<P>
   Silver was found in huge quantities nearby, making Reno
important. And in 1868, the Central Pacific railroad came through,
linking the little town to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Crocker ran the construction crews that built the railroad and
bought up Lake's land. He had railroad surveyors lay out streets
and a town, and sold lots. Crocker signed all the deeds himself.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Crocker land in this part of Nevada came under
the control of a firm called the Pacific Improvement Co., which, in
turn, was controlled by all of the Big Four _ Crocker, Collis P.
Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Leland Stanford. The four men were the
richest in the West.
</P>
<P>
   When they died, Hopkins and Huntington left their interests to
UC. Stanford and his wife, Jane, founded a university, which
inherited the Stanford interests.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth party, the Crocker interests, belonged to the Crocker
Estate Co., said Charles Crocker, the great-great-grandson of the
original Charles Crocker. He said that portion was sold to Foremost
McKesson Corp. in 1968. It was unclear whether McKessonHBOC, as the
company is now known, would have a claim against Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting historical footnote,'' Crocker said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the facts are shrouded in history,'' said Flanagan.
</P>
<P>
   The city thinks the universities are out to get money from the
city. How much, Chapman does not know. He says he does not even
know how much the casinos were paying the city for air rights over
the disputed streets. ``Under a million a year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear that the rights to the streets of Reno are worth
many millions.
</P>
<P>
   The city's defense is that so much time has elapsed that the
universities have no further interest in something that occurred
more than 130 years ago. ``It is the doctrine of acquiescence,''
said Chapman, who alleges, in effect, that a claim that has been
quiet for 130 years should remain quiet. ``We have a very strong
case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have deeds signed by Crocker.''
</P>
<P>
   The universities also have deeds signed by Crocker and, Flanagan
says, they show he never intended to deed the streets of Reno to
the city of Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be decided by Judge Steven Kosach in Washoe County
District Court. He has received briefs and is considering the
matter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Where have all the knotholes gone? In the old
days, when lives and minds were simpler, there were holes in the
plywood walls around construction sites, and people would stop and
watch the modern world being built.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are no holes. WillieWorld is alive with digging and

   It's a dandy model, but there is no room for it in the Steamship

 AT SOUTH CAROLINA DEBATE, CHARGES OF DIRTY POLITICS FLY  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Reflecting an increasingly hostile battle for
the Republican presidential nomination, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
and Arizona Sen. John McCain each accused the other of engaging in
dirty politics Tuesday night during their final showdown before
this state's critical Saturday primary.
</P>
<P>
   The escalating fight over campaign tactics has begun to dominate
the final days of the South Carolina contest, which polls suggest
is still up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Consistent with statements made in campaign rallies throughout
this conservative state, the 90-minute forum included broad
agreement on policy matters ranging from support for the death
penalty, a national missile defense, banning abortions and moving
the Israeli capital to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But the nationally televised debate was marked by indignant
clashes over tactics as Bush, McCain and former State Department
official Alan Keyes tried to portray the other a perpetrator of
old-style politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can understand this, George, but that
really hurts,'' McCain said at the onset of the debate, alluding to
Bush's appearance beside an army colonel who had questioned
McCain's commitment to veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be ashamed,'' McCain said, citing his 17-year
record in Congress on veterans affairs. ``You should be ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Bush shot back with his own barb aimed at a
McCain commercial that suggested Bush twists words, like President
Clinton. McCain pulled the ads off the air last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, you can disagree with me on issues, John, but do not
question _ do not question _ my trustworthiness. And do not compare
me to Bill Clinton. That's about as low a blow as you can give in a
Republican primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, the only other Republican in the race, frequently
interrupted their sparring from his seat between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This debate is being broadcast in 202 countries,'' Keyes said
at one point. ``Is this really pointless squabbling what we want
them to see?''
</P>
<P>
   Without fundamental disagreements over issues, the closely
contested GOP campaign has turned into a bitter tit-for-tat over
who is the purveyor of politics as usual _ and who is the reform
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina residents can hardly turn on their radios without
hearing a Bush ad calling McCain ``just another Washington
insider,'' while McCain branded Bush last night as the candidate of
the Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by CNN's Larry King, the debate took on added
significance coming just four days before South Carolina votes in a
contest that has become critical to each candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush held a enormous lead here for many months. But McCain's 18
percentage point victory in New Hampshire turned the race on its
head as the two candidates have twice traded places atop the polls.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released Tuesday by CNN /USA Today/Gallup showed Bush
with a seven-point lead. The survey of 552 likely voters has a
margin of error of five points.
</P>
<P>
   Since his defeat in New Hampshire, Bush has adopted a more
aggressive style, playing off McCain's role as a political maverick
by calling himself a ``reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of smiled my way through the early primaries and I got
defined,'' Bush said. ``I am not going to let that happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's assertiveness was on display in the debate as he
forcefully answered questions on foreign policy, saying that China
should be treated as a competitor, not a partner, and insisting
that the United States should use force only ``when it is in our
national strategic interest.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain took issue with the last point, telling Bush: ``It's not
that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when our principles and values are so
offended, we must take action,'' McCain said, citing the recent
genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Most of their policy disagreements involved nuances. McCain said
he supports a permanent ban on Internet taxes; Bush supports a ban
until the issue is studied more. McCain supports changing the
Republican Party's platform to reflect his belief that abortions
ought to be legal in the case of rape, incest or when the mother's
life is at stake. Bush supports the exceptions to an abortion ban,
but does not feel the platform should be changed.
</P>
<P>
   The pair also fought over who best deserves the mantle of
political outsider _ McCain, a 17-year veteran of Congress, or
Bush, the son of the former president.
</P>
<P>
   ``My zip code is Austin, Texas,'' boasted Bush. ``Both John and
Alan have Washington zip codes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a point McCain refused to yield.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fair to say that once again I have not won Miss
Congeniality in the U.S. Senate. The Republican Party has lost its
way,'' McCain said, referring to Bush's early status as the
front-runner. ``They have selected an establishment candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, who was excluded from a similar debate four years ago in
South Carolina _ and was led away in handcuffs while protesting his
exclusion the following week _ made an appeal to conservative South
Carolina voters to follow their heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here, because I articulate _ perhaps better than anyone
else in the country _ what's on the heart of Republicans and real
conservatives around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes did not shy away from making his own attacks, at one point
accusing McCain's campaign of boosting its crowd at a late-night
rally by providing beer to underage residents.
</P>
<P>
   In a curious exchange about race, King asked Bush to defend his
position to speak at South Carolina's Bob Jones University, which
bans interracial dating. When Bush said it displayed leadership to
talk to such groups even when he does not agree with all of their
beliefs, King asked why Bush would not meet with gay Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded that the Log Cabin Republican Club _ the group he
refused to meet _ had already endorsed McCain, something that was
not true when he refused their invitation for a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain said that if he had been invited to speak at
Bob Jones University, he would have criticized their dating policy
as ``stupid, idiotic and incredibly cruel.''
</P>
<P>
   When King began to question Bush about how he would handle
abortion issue if one of his 17-year-old daughters got pregnant,
Bush quickly cut him off, telling him that while he was
anti-abortion, ``I'm not going to drag my daughter into this
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes took a similar tact with McCain, scolding him for saying
several weeks ago that if his daughter got pregnant, it would be a
family decision whether she got an abortion. The reference prompted
an indignant response from McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen enough killing in my lifetime _ a lot more than you
have,'' said McCain, who spent five and a half years in a North
Vietnamese Prisoner of War camp. ``I will not listen to your
lectures about how I should treat this. ... Do not, please, bring
my daughter into this.''
</P>
<P>
   Between barbs, McCain and Bush each praised the other as being a
``good man.''
</P>
<P>
   And all three candidates found common ground in their criticism
of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do is to nominate someone to end the
Clinton era,'' Bush said at the conclusion of the debate.

RADIATION LEAK PROMPTS SHUTDOWN OF N.Y. NUCLEAR REACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite portions of 3rd, 4th and 9th grafs for
precision.)  
(mk) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN with MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A leak in a steam generator at the Indian Point 2 nuclear
reactor in Westchester County, N.Y., released a small amount of
radiation from the plant Tuesday night, forcing officials to shut
it down and declare an alert.
</P>
<P>
   The plant's owner, Consolidated Edison, stressed that the leak
was what it called ``momentary'' and that there was no danger to
residents of the surrounding area or to employees of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   But the declaration of the alert _ the second level of four
categories of nuclear emergency _ was the first issued by Con
Edison since the Indian Point 2 plant opened in 1974. Con Ed
officials said Tuesday night that they did not know what caused the
leak.
</P>
<P>
   The leak in the 1,000-megawatt plant, in Buchanan, about 35
miles north of New York City, occurred at about 7:30 p.m., said
Michael Spall, a Con Ed spokesman. It allowed hot, radioactive
water, which is supposed to be kept isolated, to mix with clean
water that is boiled into steam. The steam then flows out of the
reactor's containment dome into a turbine that spins to generate
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The leak of radioactive gas into the air occurred because the
plant has a system for ejecting air from the steam loop in order to
limit corrosion, Spall said. He added, however, that ``several
seconds later'' the system diverted the air back to the containment
dome, limiting the amount of radioactive gas released.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any releases would have posed no threat to the safety of plant
personnel or the general public,'' he added. ``While this is a
serious event, it is not one that threatens public health and
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   There are four categories of nuclear event: a notification, an
alert, a site area emergency, and a general emergency, which is
what occurred at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Con Ed quickly sent monitoring teams to the plant's
perimeter, but they found radiation to be normal, Spall said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plant produces about one-seventh of the power used
by Con Ed's 3 million customers, officials said there was no power
shortage, nor would there be one because other plants in the region
would supply the power.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Michalski, a spokesman for the New York State Emergency
Management Office, said that Con Edison followed all the proper
safety procedures, and alerted the state agency's office in 15
minutes. He added that the leak ``occurred within the generating
structure, but they shut off the valve so none of that steam left
the facility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission received a report from Con
Edison at 8:07 p.m., within the one-hour reporting time limit.
Spall said the leak was in a steam generator, which is a heat
exchanger inside the containment dome. The leak opened a path for
mildly radioactive water to flow out of containment and into the
turbine hall, from which ``a small amount'' was released to the
environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Point's steam generators, four of them for each reactor,
are towering metal vessels, filled with thin-walled metal tubes, in
the shape of an upside-down U. The tubes are filled with water that
flows through the nuclear core to the steam generators and then
back to the core, carrying heat away from the reactor so it can be
used to make electricity. This water gradually picks up radioactive
contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the tubes there is clean, nonradioactive water, which is
pumped in and boils. The steam flows out through giant pipes,
through the heavy concrete and steel wall of the containment dome
to the turbine hall, which is used to spin a turbine and make
electricity. This nonradioactive steam is then run through a big
metal cooling box called a condenser, where it is turned back into
water. The condenser is kept cool with water from the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   The alert was the first in the plant's operating history, said
Spall. Indian Point 2 opened in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, Spall said that operators had shut off the flow of
steam from the steam generator, and shut off the flow of water that
is boiled into steam. And they had reduced pressure in the reactor
to 1,000 pounds per square inch, he said. Normal operating pressure
is above 2,000 pounds per square inch. But bringing the reactor to
cold shutdown _ when it is cool enough to open up without the
cooling water boiling away _ was still several hours away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other reactors of similar design, called pressurized water
reactors, have had steam generator problems.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Point 3, which is owned by the New York Power Authority,
had corrosion and cracking problems with its steam generators, and
replaced them. But Con Edison said it did not need to, perhaps
because it paid closer attention to water chemistry, to limit
corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester Gas &AMP; Electric's Robert E. Ginna reactor suffered a
steam generator tube rupture in January 1982. Many plants have been
closed for months by steam generator tube problems.
</P>
<P>
   With the economic value of nuclear plants much diminished by
changes in technology and in utility rules, it was not clear
whether it would pay to replace the steam generators, if that were
to become necessary. Like an old car that needed a new
transmission, a severe steam generator problem could lead to
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison said earlier this month that it would offer the
reactor for sale this year.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Point 2 has had a spotty history in recent years. In
1994, the plant broke the world record for longest continuous
operation _ 19 months _ of a light-water reactor, the kind used in
the United States and most of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But in December 1996, a minor chemical spill forced the plant to
shut down. In 1998, the plant was closed again, this time for
several months, because of safety concerns. And last September, the
plant was temporarily shut down after a series of electrical
problems that caused the system to misread temperature and pressure
readings and throw the plant into shutdown.

BOGEY'S TREE COULD CAUSE PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Bogey's Tree,'' a stately old sycamore that
predates Riviera Country Country Club, is the sentinel of the 12th
green. According to legend, the tree is named after Humphrey
Bogart, who hung out in the shade of its canopy sipping from a
Thermos filled with Jim Beam during Los Angeles Opens past.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, it's been a benign moniker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bogey's Tree'' has turned few away as the surgeons of the PGA
Tour routinely carved the 12th hole to pieces, wielding a 3-wood
like a scalpel and short iron to suture things up.
</P>
<P>
   Noted architect George C. Thomas, who designed Riviera, would
not be pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Now the tree may finally live up to its nickname during the 2000
edition of the Nissan Open, which will be played this week.
</P>
<P>
   Riviera is fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   Come Sunday, a few competitors may be thinking about attacking
number 12 with a chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   As part of some not-so-subtle tweaking of Riviera, a new tee box
was built, extending the par-4 hole to 479 yards from the tips.
This week the pros will play it at 460 yards, 50 more than they did
last year.
</P>
<P>
   And now, ``Bogey's Tree'' is back in play.
</P>
<P>
   With approach shots from farther back in the fairway, the small
green will look even smaller and the deep bunker in front more
daunting. And the longer walk will give players more time to ogle
Mel Brooks' stunning white estate along the left side of the
fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Yoshitake, Riviera's head professional, said that playing
the hole to its full length might have been too much to thrust on
the PGA this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, most of the pros hit a 3-wood and a 9-iron. Now most
will hit driver and have something like a 6-iron or 7-iron, maybe
even a 5-iron,'' he said. ``It's now a tough target to hit. It's
changed the hole completely.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, will the scores. Yoshitake thinks they will be going
up.
</P>
<P>
   Driving accuracy will be rewarded, since Riviera's notorious
gnarly rough is going to be up a bit this year. Drives into the
long grass most often will arrive at the green sans spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem now is hitting the fairway on that hole,'' said
Yoshitake.
</P>
<P>
   This is just one of several not-so-subtle changes at the
venerable old course.
</P>
<P>
   Number nine, a beautiful hole with a green framed by the
majestic clubhouse sitting high on the hill, will also play
tougher.
</P>
<P>
   It has been lengthened by 38 yards, to 458 yards, which does not
sound like much in this age of titanium.
</P>
<P>
   But the added distance brings a yawning fairway bunker back into
play.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshitake says a drive must stay airborne 290 yards to carry the
bunker and leave a short iron into the green. In tournaments past,
the players gave this bunker little respect since it could be
carried with a drive of 255 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the (hole) will now play as it was meant to play. The
pros can attempt to carry it, but it will take a good poke,''
Yoshitake said. ``Basically the pros are faced with the same hazard
that the members have to play every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Laying up short of the bunker will leave a shot of about 200
yards to the green.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes, under the direction of the Tom Fazio Group, are
also planned.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation is being done out of respect for Thomas, not out
of spite for the skills of today's athletes. ``Basically, the
intent is to return the course back to the original George Thomas
design and the provide the shot values that he wanted for the pros.
It's a classic. There is nothing fancy about it. It's a real simple
design, it's easy to walk and it changes every day with the wind
patterns,'' Yoshitake said.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Ernie Els is not put off by Riviera's new
look. And he acknowledges that yes, technology has rendered some
classic golf courses obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riviera is one of the classic golf courses around the globe.
Ben Hogan made it famous. It's highly regarded by both the pros and
the public. It's a great course,'' Els said. ``The (classic)
courses do play a little easier. In the old days, they used
persimmon drivers, which went as far as we hit 3-woods today.''
</P>
<P>
   So this week there just might be trouble lurking in the shade of
``Bogey's Tree.''

GAME CAN THANK ITS LUCKY STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Star power.
</P>
<P>
   The Haig and Hogan had it and so also, obviously, does Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   It's the indefinable but unmistakable ingredient that can turn
professional golf tournaments into compelling theater. In the
process, it has steadily raised the wage scale for all pro players
since Horace Rawlins defeated nine other pros and one amateur at
the first U.S. Open in 1885.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson acknowledged the impact of star power, even as he
ended Tiger Woods' streak of consecutive victories at six Sunday in
the Buick Invitational:
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Tiger has played the last six events and prior to that
has generated a lot of interest for the game of golf,'' Mickelson
said. ``There are galleries that were so large this week (165,000),
they didn't expect it _ they couldn't accommodate it parking-wise.
And I'm a beneficiary of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purses increase, I'm making more money because Tiger is
helping increase those purses. He is creating more excitement in
the game of golf. All the players are beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is perhaps the brightest but also only the latest in a
long and illustrious line of tour players with the power to pack in
the crowds _ as he most certainly will do again for this week's
Nissan Open at Riviera Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   From the dapper Walter Hagen and his four consecutive PGA
championships in the Roaring '20s through Gene Sarazen and his
miracle double-eagle at the 1935 Masters to `Slammin' Sammy Snead
to Byron Nelson's 11 consecutive wins in 1945 to Ben Hogan's three
major championships in 1953, the American pro game did not lack for
megastar power in its pre-television era.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Palmer raised the ante when his patented charges and his
Arnie's Army of faithful followers sparked increased national
interest with the emergence of televised golf in the mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   And about the time folks were thinking there had never been a
star quite like Arnie, along came Jack Nicklaus, who would duel
Palmer throughout the '60s, then wage epic showdowns with Lee
Trevino, Johnny Miller and Tom Watson en route to a career total of
18 major professional titles.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is Woods, young (24), charismatic and with a game for
the ages, attracting fans wherever and whenever he plays. He drew a
crowd of nearly 200 for a 6:15 a.m. practice round at last week's
Buick Invitational _ ``I definitely wouldn't get out that early to
watch me play,'' he joked _ and helped pack in 45,000 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Woods packs the press rooms as well, swelling the Buick
Invitational media ranks from 100 to 300 in a one-day surge last
week, after he made up seven strokes in his final seven holes at
Pebble Beach to win a sixth straight title _ the most since Hogan
won six in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt an onslaught like I did after he made that
(winning) putt,'' said Rick Schloss, who handles media requests for
the Buick Invitational and includes a Super Bowl in his 25 years of
sports projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro golf has always been star-driven,'' Schloss said. ``But
Tiger is in another world with this stuff. He just transcends so
many things. He's articulate, people can relate to him _ if they
can't relate to the game he plays. He's the ambassador of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   His streak is over, but Woods' drawing power is as strong as
ever going into this week's play at Riviera, where PGA Tour
Director of Information Dave Lancer expects another huge Woods
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (PGA Tour) don't keep attendance figures. We never have.
But it's obvious to anyone following golf that crowds are bigger
with Tiger,'' Lancer said. ``And the people coming out to
tournaments are far more mainstream than they once were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, he has had an impact on the tour. We've always had
the core fans, but Tiger draws fans who weren't traditional fans.
People are coming out to the game to see the phenomenon.''

STARS FAN RETALIATES OVER SABRES' CRIES OF FOUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every action creates a reaction, especially in the bitter Dallas
Stars-Buffalo Sabres rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   While it has taken nearly eight months, a Stars fan finally has
fired a shot in defense against a bitter Sabres fan who created
Nogoal.com to openly complain about Dallas' game-winning goal in
Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   It's called Starsrule.com.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Key of Lone Oak, Texas, recently launched Starsrule.com as
a counterstrike to Nogoal.com, a site created by Sabres fan Jeff
Spring two days after the Stars' controversial triple-overtime
victory in June.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than be repulsed by Nogoal.com's shots at the Stars and
the NHL, Key said he was inspired. But Key didn't want
Starsrule.com to be obsessed with the controversial goal like
Nogoal.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to change gears and not focus on the poor
sportsmanship of the Buffalo fans, but to focus on extolling the
greatness of the Dallas Stars,'' Key said.
</P>
<P>
   Starsrule.com isn't as comprehensive as Nogoal.com _ in fact,
other Stars fans sites offer a better tribute to the team _ but
it's much more visual with an animated introduction that requires a
browser plug-in. And in honor of the Stanley Cup's reported dip
into a pool at the hands of the Stars' Guy Carbonneau, Key also has
a Javascript application that shows what the trophy looks like
underwater.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Starsrule.com is more flash than substance. But by
summer, Key plans a player database, a message forum and updates on
the new American Airlines Center.
</P>
<P>
   Spring, who works at a Buffalo, N.Y., bookstore selling Sabres
merchandise, has pulled together an impressive site with bitterness
spewing from nearly every feature.
</P>
<P>
   On his site, Spring has rounded up NHL rule points, articles
about the controversy, Nogoal.com merchandise and message boards.
His merchandise even drew a threatening letter from the NHL about
copyright infringement for use of the image of the Stanley Cup and
team logos of the finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Spring said the NHL figured that the threat would make him pull
his site.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you're committed to something like this, you don't
quit until you get what you want,'' Spring told the ``Boston
Globe.'' ``And what we want is an apology'' from the league.

PAYTON SCORES CAREER-HIGH 41 AS SONICS ROUT WIZARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ About the only time Gary Payton seemed to show any
emotion Tuesday night was when a 3-pointer rolled around the rim
and out in the third quarter. It was a rare moment when one of
Payton's shots did not fall.
</P>
<P>
   So he stopped, then glared at the basket as if it had violated
him.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence was a minor blip on a night the Sonics point guard
exhibited the most explosive scoring performance of his career. He
scored a career-high 41 points in the Sonics' 114-85 rout of the
Washington Wizards at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   But mention to Payton that he is unquestionably playing his best
basketball in 10 NBA seasons, and he seems numb to the fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just playing basketball. It's just something that
happened,'' Payton said, re-emphasizing what has become a patented
line despite scoring, rebounding and assist averages that are
personal bests.
</P>
<P>
   This is clearly a much different, more dominating Payton.
</P>
<P>
   It took just 30 minutes for Payton to make 14 of his 21 shots.
It didn't even take that long for the Sonics to dispatch the
hapless Wizards. The Sonics took an 8-0 lead, and Payton scored 11
of the team's first 19 points just five minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics led by 17 at that point, and demoralized the Wizards
with strong defense and 3-point shooting. Washington shot 36.6
percent from the field and turned the ball over 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who made 7 of 12 3-pointers, did not play in the fourth
quarter. That's because the Sonics built a 27-point first-half
advantage and later led by 34 points behind Payton's unmatched
energy.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4 guard scored 29 points by halftime and played at
warp speed, making the Wizards look lost in slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   So laughable was the rout that Brent Barry took a sip of a
woman's drink after chasing a ball out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   So dangerous was Payton that he probably could have made baskets
from the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just in a rhythm,'' Payton said, showing no sign of
being tired from participating in All-Star weekend. ``You just keep
shooting the ball and if it keeps going in, it goes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton had scored 30 or more points eight times this season. His
previous career-high was 38 points, March 24, 1996, at Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after tying his previous career high, Payton tossed in a
3-pointer over Washington's Chris Whitney to set the new scoring
mark with 1:42 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think a guy that's been as good as he's been for so
long would have had a game or two along the way,'' Sonics coach
Paul Westphal said of Payton eclipsing 40 points. ``I think he'll
have more.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton could have scored more than 50 points had he remained in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's disrespectful to the other team,'' Payton said. ``Why
should I be in the game when we're up 30 points? I didn't want to
go through all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   After shooting 1-for-8 for the Western Conference in the
All-Star Game last weekend, Payton intended to get his team off to
a good start after the break.
</P>
<P>
   Once Payton made his first five shots, four of which were
3-pointers, his teammates picked up the groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't say it but he felt he had a little something to prove
by not starting in the All-Star Game,'' center Horace Grant said.
``He's playing with that attitude and I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   An impressive start to the second half of the regular season
came at the expense of a wayward Wizards team. Washington suffered
its fourth consecutive loss and 12th in a row on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal was afforded the rare opportunity to give his starters
extended rest.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, who suffered from the flu, benefited the most, playing
just 15 minutes. Greg Foster started the second half in place of
Grant and the Sonics didn't miss a beat.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Payton was still on the court.
</P>
<P>
   TIP-INS: Grant's twin brother Harvey was in attendance. Harvey
has yet to be picked up by an NBA team after being cut by the
Orlando Magic. ... Barry, who injured his left knee in the Feb. 9
game against Dallas, played 28 minutes with it heavily bandaged.
... Because the Sonics scored at least 110 points, fans were
eligible to receive free Taco Bell chalupas.

COMPANY OWNED BY CRAWFORD'S BENEFACTOR HAS A SPORTS ARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS and TED MILLER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle business executive Barry Henthorn is listed as
operating ``a sports management service'' as part of his
telecommunications business, according to recent documents filed
with Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, a Wall Street information service company.
</P>
<P>
   But Henthorn said Tuesday the sports management component of his
business refers only to the company's work with hydroplane racing
and is not an attempt to establish a sports agency to promote
University of Michigan basketball player Jamal Crawford or any
other athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn, 33, is being investigated by the NCAA and the
university for his relationship with Crawford, a former Rainier
Beach High School star. Henthorn contends his only venture into
sports was a hydroplane boat sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Henthorn said, his company managed a boat and its
driver, ``Freeway'' Jimmy Ablott.
</P>
<P>
   ``It no longer falls under our corporate umbrella,'' Henthorn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Innovative Technologies' Internet site claims its director
of operations ``implemented ICT's 1999 national marketing/sales
tour integrating Innovative Cellular's National Hydroplane Race
Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   The P-I could not confirm any tour sponsorship, but Henthorn's
name does show up on Ablott's boat as a sponsor. The boat raced in
about 12 events last year. Ablott could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Dun &AMP; Bradstreet listing for Henthorn's Innovative
Communications Technologies Inc. is dated Feb. 10, 2000. It also
lists his company as operating an unproduced TV game show called
``Name that Lick.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Henthorn's family members, NFL player Eric
Metcalf is listed among ICT investors. Metcalf, who grew up in
Seattle and played for the Carolina Panthers last season, is listed
as owning 12.5 percent of the capital stock in the company, but
Metcalf's agent said his client is only an investor and does not
want to comment about the association with Henthorn.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures about Henthorn's business connections could be
vital to the ongoing investigation of Crawford if they show
Henthorn was acting as more than a quasi-guardian for the player.
Crawford was suspended for six games _ five by the NCAA, one by
Michigan _ and ordered by the NCAA to repay approximately $15,000
to Henthorn after the university raised questions about a 1988
Mercedes Crawford tried to register on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Peterson, spokeswoman for Michigan, would not comment
directly about the information in the Dun &AMP; Bradstreet documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reviewed many new pieces of information over the past
few days, and we are investigating them all,'' Peterson said.
``We're just not commenting on each new piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's NCAA suspension expires Feb. 24. The university
originally planned to appeal the penalty until the
Post-Intelligencer last week revealed that Henthorn provided
additional money, jewelry and another car to Crawford, who was
still in high school at the time. The disclosures came after the
P-I reported on a lawsuit filed by Henthorn's former administrative
assistant, who claimed she was coerced into co-signing on three
loans totaling $10,097 for Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn also set up a non-profit foundation, known as the
Academic Assistance Foundation, apparently to provide additional
benefits to Crawford. Neither Henthorn's foundation nor the
existence of the other loans were part of the initial university or
NCAA investigation of Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Henthorn denied he had anything to do with a
letter Crawford belatedly sent to the NBA to make himself available
for last summer's NBA draft. The letter was received too late and
discarded, and Crawford reversed his decision and stuck with his
commitment to attend Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was aware of that, but I didn't encourage it,'' Henthorn
said of the letter. ``I didn't think it was a good idea then, and I
don't think it's a good idea this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford earlier this week was quoted in the Ann Arbor (Mich.)
News as denying a broadcast report that he was turning pro after
his freshman season at Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be back next year. It's not even a question,'' Crawford
told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn said Tuesday he has talked with the NCAA as part of the
expanded investigation. Although he wouldn't comment on his
interview with the agency, he did say he was pleased with how it
went.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely positive I will be vindicated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dun &AMP; Bradstreet report states that Innovative
Communications Technologies, which started in 1994, had sales of
$1.2 million and a worth of $2.37 million as of December 1997. It
employs 35 people, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   While the description of ICT's operation had been updated as of
last week, the financial data has not been updated since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn said he was unsure why that hasn't happened, noting it
doesn't fall under his range of duties. A spokeswoman for Dun &AMP;
Bradstreet said that because the company is privately held, it is
not obligated to provide financial information.

   COMMENTARY: Truth about nuggets hard to swallow
</P>
<P>
   By John Kelsoc. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Is anybody really surprised that chicken nuggets
are disgusting? If chicken nuggets weren't disgusting, they'd name
them after the part of the chicken that they come from, instead of
labeling them ``nuggets.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal food inspectors at two Alabama chicken processing plants
say that schoolchildren in 31 states have been fed chicken nuggets
made out of chickens with sores and such.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know why the chicken crossed the road? So he could
develop sores and become a chicken nugget.
</P>
<P>
   This is why to find chicken nuggets it helps to dine at a
restaurant that has the word ``Eats'' displayed on the side of the
building. I'm sure you've noticed that chicken nuggets generally
aren't mentioned on the chalkboard at establishments such as, say,
Jean-Pierre's Upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that these federal inspectors say that even
though some of the chickens being turned into nuggets are diseased,
the chicken nuggets won't hurt you, because people don't pick up
chicken diseases. So much for the heartbreak of pluckitis.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the real reason these chicken nuggets won't hurt you
is that they are generally breaded and cooked in hot fat.
</P>
<P>
   If you bread a possum and cook it long enough in hot fat, it
won't hurt you, either. And if you don't believe me, ask somebody
from Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, it wouldn't take a federal investigation to figure
out that a chicken nugget is a horrid little food item because,
when you look at a chicken, you can't find a nugget anywhere on it.
</P>
<P>
   If you find a nugget on a chicken, my suggestion would be to eat
around the nugget and enjoy the rest of the chicken. Save the
nugget and mail it to Ripley's Believe It -- r Not.
</P>
<P>
   The chicken nugget, like the steak finger, is one of those menu
choices that makes you suspicious because the name doesn't say what
part of the animal it comes from. Steak fingers. How is this
possible? Find me a cow with knuckles, and I'll start believing in
steak fingers.
</P>
<P>
   But the real question is this: Are these standard chicken
nuggets our schoolchildren have been served, or are they free-range
chicken nuggets?
</P>
<P>
   The other thing that gets me about this investigation is that it
has led me to learn about a new food group I was blissfully unaware
of _ binder.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. One of the federal food inspectors interviewed
about the tainted chicken nuggets said the skin of the chicken that
has sores on it is mixed with the rest of the meat, where it serves
as ``binder.''
</P>
<P>
   So that means that the three basic food groups are now fat,
breading and binder?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not paying attention to a food pyramid that mentions
``binder.''
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't eat in a restaurant that has ``binder'' on the menu.
``My name is Jason, and I will be your waiter this evening. Would
you like a little binder on your salad?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``You kids aren't leaving this table until you've finished
your binder.''
</P>
<P>
   What is binder? What is the recommended federal daily
requirement of binder? If you don't eat enough binder, does it mean
that your bellybutton comes unscrewed and your stomach falls off?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Polly, not a celebrity, but loved by all
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Lamantia means family. Polly Lamantia's life was
measured in small moments, small traditions: Sunday afternoon
socials with her close-knit brood of seven children. Annual get
togethers in Chicago with her six sisters. Card games with the
grandkids.
</P>
<P>
   Her life and death were hardly dramatic, hardly the stuff of
headlines. She appeared in the Dayton Daily News only once in
recent years, when I wrote about the family's celebration of the
25th ``birthday'' of their Five Oaks home in 1996. What sold her on
the home, she told me then, was that it would be ``an ideal place
to hide Easter baskets.'' Polly understood the symbolism of such
rituals, the way they reinforce family.
</P>
<P>
   Polly, who died last month at 69, was a not very newsworthy
citizen but her funeral packed 'em like dignitaries. ``It was the
love of family carried over into the love of neighbors, of
community, of church,'' explains her daughter, Debbie Smith of
Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years, Dick Lamantia says, his wife, Polly, ``operated on
half a heart.'' You wouldn't have known it, though, if you visited
her rambling, Swiss-chalet style home in Five Oaks. Polly was the
mother in the neighborhood all the other kids called ``Mom.'' She
was the central nervous system of one of those large Catholic
broods where the kids never quite seem to leave home, even when
they have their own children and mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Even in her last year, ``she would make it to the Sunday social
if she had to crawl there,'' Debbie recalls. If she couldn't
preside over a family get-together, Polly orchestrated them. She
informed her son, Mark Lamantia of Kettering, that he would be
hosting the family Super Bowl party. Polly died of heart disease
Jan. 27, three days before the game, but Mark knew his mother
wouldn't have considered that any kind of excuse to call off the
party.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a woman who has her priorities straight. A
meticulous housekeeper, Polly retired from housekeeping and cooking
during her last year, except, of course, when the parish priest at
Corpus Christi Church came over for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if she were saving her heartbeats for the things
that are really important, and cooking and cleaning weren't that
important to her any more,'' Debbie says.
</P>
<P>
   Family was important, and she reflected on the meaning of family
in a series of beautifully written essays. In October, only a few
months before her death , Polly wrote about getting together every
year with her sisters, also known as ``the Walsh girls'' or the
Seven Sisters Sorority: ``Where would we have gone instead? Who
would have enriched us more? Where could six married sisters and a
seventh sister, a Franciscan nun, have an opportunity to spend five
days away from home, children, husbands and phones?''
</P>
<P>
   Polly has nurtured that same spirit in her own children, just as
her mother instilled in her. ``Her mother raised those kids to the
highest standard in spite of being poverty-ridden and having a
husband who was a recovering alcoholic,'' says Dick Lamantia. ``And
Polly? She never had an alcoholic father. She never grew up in the
Depression. She had an enchanted childhood. And I bet you a dollar
to a doughnut if you went back to the great-grandmother, she would
be the same kind of woman. It's a legacy that's in their bones.''
</P>
<P>
   And now it's in the bones of her children and grandchildren, who
will continue the traditions with which she so seamlessly bound
them together . ``I told Mom I don't know how many times that our
Sunday socials will continue long into this millennium,'' Debbie
says.
</P>
<P>
   She was saving her heartbeats for the things that are really
important, Debbie said. And hers is a legacy that will be measured
not in headlines or biographies, but in the lifeblood of family, in
the heartbeats of everyday life.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Possible candidate would bring new meaning to
'White' House
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The Reform Party is about to go from weird to
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Gov. Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura and Donald ``The Ego''
Trump have bailed out of Ross Perot's Reform Party, the door now is
open for Pat ``The Foreigners Are Coming'' Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan is to America what Joerg Haider is to Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Austrians have a right to vote for for an
immigrant-bashing politician who praised Adolph Hitler's ``sound
employment policy,'' Americans have a right to vote for an
immigrant-bashing politician who supported Nazis and belittled
Holocaust reports.
</P>
<P>
   After Haider's Freedom Party won second place in Austria's
October parliamentary elections based on anti-immigrant and ethnic
purity appeals, Haider was included in a new government.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and European nations quite properly let the
Austrian government know that they will not again sit idly by while
a demagogue rallies support for an ethnic contagion that threatens
the stability of nations.
</P>
<P>
   While most Austrians do not support Haider's message, not enough
spoke up in time to prevent the son of a Nazi official from
assuming power.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps due to his father's influence, Haider once praised
Waffen SS officers as ``decent people with character who stuck to
their belief through the strongest headwinds.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider is a well-spoken, charismatic man who has apologized for
any of his statements that may have been misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian's don't like being threatened with diplomatic sanctions
because 27 percent of their voters supported Haider's Freedom
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the democratic process at work,'' Austrians say. They ask
how Americans would like it if the world threatened them with
sanctions because U.S. voters supported a politician with a history
of attacking the ethnic impurity of some of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   That's a question Americans need to consider if Buchanan is
chosen to run for president by the shattered remnants of Perot's
Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   If Buchanan isn't a racist, fascist, anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi,
nativist, isolationist bigot, then he sure appeals to people who
possess those traits.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan says his father, William Baldwin Buchanan, was a great
influence on him. The elder Buchanan was a dedicated supporter of
the America First Committee, a deplorable organization that
attempted to convert Americans to its anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi,
nativist and isolationist views.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan the son has called his previous political campaigns
America First, as has former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, whose
political campaigns share many of Buchanan's positions.
</P>
<P>
   Like Haider, Buchanan says his statements have been
misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   Also like Haider, Buchanan has praised Hitler. He once described
Hitler as ``an individual of great courage ... extraordinary
gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has expressed admiration for Spain's fascist dictator
Francisco Franco, who happened to be a favorite of the elder
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The man who wants to be America's president admired the white
supremacist ``Boer Republic'' so much that he once applied to be
ambassador to South Africa's racist government.
</P>
<P>
   Even Austria's Haider has never gone so far as to call for
putting armed troops along its borders to guard against illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan wants a bayonet curtain along America's southern border
but has invited white Canadians, who share his European heritage,
to join the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Good Austrians failed to speak out against Hitler and Haider
before they gained power. Americans should not make the same
mistake with Pat Buchanan.

 &HT;    Comfort foods warm the body and soul
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It takes only a slight dip in the
temperature to send us searching for comfort foods: hot casseroles,
pot pies and roasts with vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Three new cookbooks address this style of cooking and can help
you produce something warm and steamy from the oven.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Book of Casseroles'' by Maryana Vollstedt (Chronicle
Books, $19.95), provides 250 recipes, from the ultimate tuna-noodle
casserole to contemporary enchilada mixtures. There are a fair
number of casseroles influenced by Mexican and Latin flavors, and
old favorites such as lasagna (usually not considered a traditional
casserole, but think about it) and macaroni and cheese. Also
included are stews, chili and the mom-inspired chicken with rice
and vegetables. Any good cook could mix and match with Vollstedt's
recipes and come up with her own combinations to suit available
ingredients and the family's tastes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Clay Pot Cooking'' by Elsa Petersen-Schepelern (Time-Life
Books, $15.95), a basic chapter on using clay pots as cookware
defines the many clay pot types used around the world: tians,
tandoors, tagines, etc. The recipes for them also follow an
international route: yellow pea soup from Sweden; poule au pot, a
French classic; Mediterranean garlic lamb shanks with rosemary and
lentils; and Chinese red-cooked pork. The recipes are filled with
flavors, and they can be adapted to stainless steel or iron
cookware. ``Pot Pies'' by Diane Phillips (Doubleday, $24.95) is
divided into four main chapters_ turkey and chicken, meat, seafood
and vegetables. The diversity of flavor and ingredients is wide,
though a slight Mediterranean influence comes through. Two recipes
for stock will be helpful, but the pies don't require them every
time. The crust recipes are nontraditional and give life to old
favorites. They include cheese, pastry crust, noodles, pancakes,
focaccia and a unique topping called a rouille (red pepper pesto,
of sorts). Again, this book lends itself to variation and
substitutions at will and to taste, so while the price for a
single-subject cookbook seems high, the inspiration it provides
makes up for it.

A NEWER, LONELIER CROWD EMERGES IN INTERNET STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (bl) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The nation's obsession with the Internet is
causing many Americans to spend less time with friends and family,
less time shopping in stores and more time working at home after
hours, according to one of the first large-scale surveys of the
societal impact of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In short, ``the more hours people use the Internet, the less
time they spend with real human beings,'' said Norman Nie, a
political scientist at Stanford University who was the principal
investigator for the study.
</P>
<P>
   Nie asserted that the Internet was creating a broad new wave of
social isolation in the United States, raising the specter of an
atomized world without human contact or emotion.
</P>
<P>
   That conclusion is certain to prove controversial because of the
contention among some online enthusiasts that the Internet has
fostered alternative electronic relationships that may replace or
even enhance face-to-face family and social connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a zero-sum game,'' said Howard Rheingold, author
of ``Virtual Community: Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier.''
``People's social networks do not consist only of people they see
face to face. In fact, social networks have been extending because
of artificial media since the printing press and the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford survey, which was conducted by the university's
Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society and will be
published Wednesday, appears to offer an Internet-era parallel to
some of the findings of ``The Lonely Crowd,'' a landmark
sociological analysis of American society in 1950. The book,
written by David Riesman with Nathan Glazer and Reuel Denney,
described the changing American character and chronicled the shift
away from family and community-centered life and the ascendance of
mass media.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford study, in turn, details how the Internet is leading
to a rapid shift away from mass media. The study reported that 60
percent of regular Internet users said they had reduced their
television viewing, and one-third said they spent less time reading
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Those regular users, spending at least five hours a week online,
represented about 20 percent of those surveyed and were the group
looked at most closely. In all, the study found that 55 percent of
those polled had Internet access at home or work and that 43
percent of households were online.
</P>
<P>
   And the study found evidence that the Internet was allowing the
workplace to invade the home. A quarter of regular Internet users
employed at least part time said the Internet had increased the
time they spent working at home without reducing the time spent at
work.
</P>
<P>
   In the past Nie has been the author of studies on the decline of
American involvement in political and community organizations. He
said that while much of the public Internet debate had been focused
on the invasion of privacy, little study had been done of the
potential psychological and emotional impact of what he said would
be more people ``home, alone and anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   Nie, a co-author of the study with Professor Lutz Erbring of the
Free University of Berlin, contended that there was no evidence
that virtual communities would provide a substitute for traditional
human relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go home at 6:30 in the evening and spend the whole night
sending e-mail and wake up the next morning, I still haven't talked
to my wife or kids or friends,'' Nie said. ``When you spend your
time on the Internet you don't hear a human voice and you never get
a hug.''
</P>
<P>
   The new study was based on a sample of 4,114 adults in 2,689
households. It is the second major research project to suggest that
the advent of the Internet may have negative social consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998 researchers at Carnegie Mellon University
reported that people who spent even a few hours a week connected to
the Internet experienced higher levels of depression and
loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Carnegie Mellon study, which focused on
psychological and emotional issues, the Stanford survey is an
effort to provide a broad demographic picture of Internet use and
its potential impact on society.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is asking the obvious questions about what kind of
world we are going to live in when the Internet becomes
ubiquitous,'' Nie said. ``No one asked these questions with the
advent of the automobile, which led to unplanned suburbanization,
or with the rise of television, which led to the decline of our
political parties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we can give society a chance to talk through some of
these issues before the changes take place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans overwhelmingly use e-mail as their most common
Internet activity, according to the Stanford researchers. Moreover,
the report found that most Internet users treated the network as a
giant public library, albeit with a commercial tilt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the general perception that the Internet has become a
vast cybernetic shopping mall, the Stanford study indicates that
only 25 percent of the Internet users surveyed make purchases
online and that fewer than 10 percent do other types of financial
transactions online, like banking. The assertion that the Internet
is leading to a new form of social isolation is certain to generate
a lively discussion among social scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true by definition that if you're spending more hours
hitting the keyboard, you're not spending time with other people,''
said Amatai Etzioni, a sociologist at George Washington University.
``But people do form very strong relations over the Internet, and
many of them are relations that they could not find any other
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nie disagrees, arguing that today's patterns of Internet usage
foretell a loss of interpersonal contact that will result in the
kind of isolation seen among many elderly Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be millions of people with very minimal
human interaction,'' he said. ``We're really in for some things
that are potentially great freedoms but frightening in terms of
long-term social interaction.''

&HT;     CLINTON SEEKS WAYS TO PROTECT THE INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;     By MARK HELM and ERIC ROSENBERG

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Searching for ways to combat Internet attacks,
President Clinton turned Tuesday to America's high-tech leaders,
law enforcement officials and a hacker named Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   Although he called last week's successful assaults on several
popular Web sites ``a wake-up call'' to the country, Clinton
downplayed the damage done to Internet commerce and security.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an electronic Pearl Harbor,'' he said at a
meeting in the White House Cabinet Room with 29 industry
representatives as well as national security experts and Attorney
General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should leave here with this vast sense of
insecurity,'' Clinton said. ``We ought to leave here with a sense
of confidence that this is a challenge that was entirely
predictable. It's part of the price of the success of the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial idea of the session was to address the problem of
terrorists using cyberspace. But Clinton said a blizzard of
assaults last week that disabled some of the nation's most popular
Web sites _ among them CNN.com, eBay, Yahoo!, Amazon.com and ETrade
_ convinced him that the government needs to focus on protecting
the Internet itself.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, he promised to provide $9 million in
``start-up money'' for a high-tech security institute to study ways
to improve Internet security. But the president stressed that
security on the Internet should be improved without jeopardizing
the entrepreneurial potential of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have to keep cyberspace open and free,'' Clinton
said. ``At the same time, computer networks (must be) more secure
and resilient and we have to do more to protect privacy and civil
liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators think the cyber attacks against the Web
sites were perpetrated by one or more assailants who hacked into
computer systems including those at Stanford University and on at
least two campuses in the University of California system. The
assailants then directed those large, powerful systems to flood the
Web sites with data, causing them to fail for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Companies represented in Tuesday's meeting included America
Online, Yahoo!, 3Com, Cisco Systems, Sun Microsystems, MCI
Worldcom, IBM, AT&AMP;T, Hewlett Packard, Intel and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Another participant was Mudge, nickname for a member of a
``think tank'' of hackers who are security consultants operating
under the name Stake. Mudge refused to give his name, but the White
House released a list of participants that included an Stake
representative named Peiter Zatko of Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here because I know how the people who broke into the
those Web sites think,'' said the long-haired Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   The president emphasized that private industry should lead the
way in solving the Internet security problem with the government
playing only a ``minimal role,'' such as coordinating industry
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The industry security representatives agreed, saying they did
not want a large government presence on the Internet. Instead, they
pledged to share information ``regarding cyber attacks,
vulnerabilities, counter-measures and security practices'' on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has a lot to do, certainly by example and
education, but the private sector has to drive the security of the
Internet,'' said Charles Wang, chief executive of Computer
Associates International, a business software firm in Islandia,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge said, ``Every business on the Internet gets hurt when a
Web site is broken into because it makes people afraid of using the
Internet so it's in the interest of businesses to help each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most participants said the attacks were not
catastrophic, Thomas Noonan, CEO of the Atlanta-based Internet
Security Systems, said they signaled that ``an arms race'' was
under way, pitting the government and computer industry against
cyber-hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Noonan said he told Clinton in the closed-door meeting that it
is next to impossible to stop a cyber terrorist from launching an
attack. ``But what we can do is make sure our systems are not
vulnerable, and we can make sure that our networks are capable of
detecting and responding to any attacks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such security capability, which would ensure that U.S.
e-commerce can run smoothly and fend off attacks, will cost up to
$50 billion, Noonan said. ``We have built our new economy on a
vulnerable infrastructure. You'd never build a skyscraper on a
foundation full of holes. But that's just what we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Noonan said the group advised the president, ``For God's sake,
lead by example. The government's computers are some of the most
vulnerable out there.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a computer believed to have been used in last week's
attacks was seized by federal agents, according to Hillsboro, Ore.,
Police Sgt. Allen Zaugg, head of a group of officers trained for
high-tech cases. The FBI is now analyzing that computer, which was
seized within the last two days from a home business in the
Portland, Ore., area, a federal official in Washington said,
requesting anonymity. The computer's owner apparently was not aware
the computer was used as part of the attacks, the official said.
The FBI also was seeking to interview several hackers known by
their Internet screen names, including one who calls himself
``mafiaboy'' and another who calls himself ``coolio,'' the official
said.

CLINTON SETS INTERNET CHIEFS AT EASE ON GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Executives from the nation's leading Internet
companies told President Clinton at the White House Tuesday that
despite hacker attacks that disrupted several major Web sites last
week, they saw no need for an increase in government regulation of
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was organized months ago to discuss ways to prevent
the World Wide Web from being used for terrorism, but took on a
sudden urgency with last week's events, in which several sites were
disrupted for hours. Those sites included Amazon.com, Yahoo and
eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the industry feared that the government would cite the
hacker attacks as evidence of the need to expand its role in
regulating Internet security. But after Tuesday's meeting, many of
the two dozen executives who sat down with Clinton said they were
reassured that he had no such intention.
</P>
<P>
   ``In dealing with the challenge of security on the Internet,
private industry must take the leadership role,'' said Harris N.
Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, whose trade group represents many of the leading
information technology companies, told reporters after the two-hour
meeting that it was important that the computer industry _ not the
government _ oversee Internet security because ``the private sector
has made the Internet the vibrant and dynamic thing that it is
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Clinton administration seemed to go to great
lengths to reassure the industry participants, who included a
reformed hacker turned security consultant who went by the Internet
nickname ``Mudge'' during his hacker days, that there was no
intention to impose new regulations on them that could impede the
growth of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William Daley told reporters after the
meeting that the administration would do nothing that would damage
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government's role was to support the industry, and
that companies were properly taking the lead in enhancing security.
``It is not about the government regulating this or taking steps or
actions that would at all impede the Internet because, of course,
it is the dynamic engine that is driving our economy today and we
must keep that open.''
</P>
<P>
   David Starr, the chief information officer for 3Com Corp., said
after the meeting that ``everybody was concerned going in that the
government would use this as an excuse for more involvement in the
Internet. But we were pleasantly surprised that they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said that one of the issues discussed at the meeting was
whether the government could do anything to improve security on the
Web to ensure that last week's incidents were not repeated. ``The
answer was clearly no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton opened the meeting with a reference to last week's
cybersalvos by hackers who are still being sought by the the FBI,
saying that the attacks were ``a source of concern, but I don't
think we should leave here with this vast sense of insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to leave here with a sense of confidence that this is
a challenge that was entirely predictable,'' he said. ``It's part
of the price of the success of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not, he added, ``an electronic Pearl Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials said Tuesday that they were
seeking to interview two young computer enthusiasts who might know
about last week's attacks. But the officials cautioned that the
people were not necessarily themselves suspects and that they did
not anticipate any early arrests.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield Diffie, the corporate information officer of Sun
Microsystems Inc., who attended the meeting, said the participants
were relieved when Clinton quickly made it clear that he believed
the industry had thrived because the government had applied a light
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a general agreement on the desirability of the
industry solving our own problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diffie said the industry leaders at the meeting were intent on
letting the White House know that ``the real expertise on these
problems is in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many of the participants acknowledged that
there had been insufficient attention to security in some parts of
the industry. ``It's clear that we've got to do a better job,''
said Nicholas M. Donofrio, senior vice president for IBM's
technology group.
</P>
<P>
   He said that most of the security tools already existed to
prevent incidents like those last week, but that some companies had
not deployed them.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he said, many computers come with a
factory-installed default security system that is meant to be
changed when it is put into operation. ``We believe that a third of
them are never changed but left just the way it arrived from the
factory,'' he said. He described that as the equivalent of buying a
briefcase with a three-digit combination lock that opens when all
the numbers are at 0-0-0 and never changing the combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a wake-up call, not a crisis,'' Donofrio said,
employing a description used by several of the participants. ``The
time to fix things is now, before there is a real crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   But like his colleagues, Donofrio was firm in saying that ``this
is a problem mainly for the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the company officials said that if the industry was to
be left to solve security problems by itself, as they had urged,
there had to be greater coordination and more uniform security
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Chandron, executive vice president for Nortel Networks
Corp., said the group agreed that ``we really need to focus on
implementation now,'' including ``a massive communications effort
throughout the industry'' to make sure that other companies install
the security systems needed to avert these kinds of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   This work, he said, would most likely be coordinated by the
Information Technology Association, the trade group that
coordinated the industry participation in Tuesday's meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that his group had proposed a plan in which Internet
companies would commit to sharing information among themselves,
including how to deal with security vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The industry participants spoke regularly and politely about the
need for a continuing partnership with the government in improving
computer security. But their concept of what role the government
would or should have was decidedly limited.
</P>
<P>
   They generally wanted the government to maintain high security
for its own computers and to keep up with changing technology. ``So
that when we speak, they understand us,'' said Donofrio of IBM.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, who has been in
charge of the issue of computer security, said the government had
not done a good enough job of securing its own computer systems.
``We need to make the government a role model,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed a 16 percent increase in funding for
computer security issues, to $2 billion. Podesta said that would
include a proposal to address the problem of gifted computer
security specialists' leaving government for more lucrative
positions in private business.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is proposing a subsidy to help with education
costs for computer students who would then be obligated to serve
for a time with the government.

NET SECURITY FIRMS REAPING GAINS FROM ONLINE VANDALISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's spate of online vandalism wasn't a disaster for one
group of Internet companies _ the ones that make hardware and
software systems to keep online companies safe.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the world's most popular Web sites, including the
Yahoo Web portal and the eBay Internet auction site, were knocked
offline for hours last week. An unknown vandal used software that
sent a stream of false messages to the Web sites. So many of these
messages were sent that they overwhelmed the sites, blocking
legitimate traffic.
</P>
<P>
   To fend off such attacks, Internet companies are taking a hard
look at computer software and hardware that can detect and block
attacks before they can do any damage. And the companies that
produce such products have pounced on the opportunity to tout their
wares.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, investors bid up share prices of firms like Internet
Security Systems Inc. and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.,
which make scanning software to detect attacks. Even companies like
the data encryption firm Verisign Inc., whose products would have
done nothing to prevent last week's crisis, benefited from a surge
of interest in computer security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of security technologies to an infrastructure has
gone up very considerably,'' said Abner Germanow, an Internet
security researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller firms also moved to capitalize on the fiasco. In press
releases, media interviews, and announcements on their Web sites,
companies asserted that their products and services could have
averted the ``denial of service'' assault that shut down major
Internet sites like Yahoo, eBay, and ETrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not new for us,'' said Irv Johnson, director of
technical marketing for Acton-based Arrowpoint Communications Inc.
``We've been talking about this for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson thinks last week's assaults could help win customers
for Arrowpoint's product, a data switch designed to block the kind
of attack used by the vandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phones are sort of ringing off the hook,'' said Johnson.
``We do see this as a good thing, indirectly. . . . The fact that
these (attacks) have made an impact is going to make the industry
more diligent.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer security consultants at Boston's Zefer Corp. hope
to get a burst of new business from old customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard from some of our clients,'' said Amine Mekkaoui,
vice president of Zefer's Internet security consultancy. ``We're
sending them out additional information about what they need to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mekkaoui said Zefer consultants will be ``going
back to our clients and telling them: `This is another example that
will confirm what we've told you before, about why you should be
addressing this issue.' It's more of a confirmation to them, and a
confirmation of our value to them.''
</P>
<P>
   At Predictive Systems Inc., a New York consulting firm, vice
president of information security Steph Marr rejects the idea of
using the Internet attacks to scare his customers into paying for
new services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always hoping for an increase in business,'' Marr said.
``I would imagine that something of this nature would increase our
business. Am I actively going out and using fear as a selling
point? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Marr urges his customers to see last week's incidents
as a shot across the bow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going back to our client base and saying: `It's time to
address this issue and make sure this can't happen to you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Predictive Systems may get an additional shot of publicity if it
helps authorities track down the culprits. The company specializes
in ``digital forensics,'' the detailed inspection of computer hard
drives to recover data even after it's been deleted. Marr has
offered his firm's help free of charge to the FBI and US Justice
Department to help crack the case.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bycoff, president of Netegrity Inc., says the Waltham,
Mass. firm has focused on protecting e-commerce Web sites from
those who want to break in and steal information, like credit card
numbers. While Bycoff knew about denial-of-service attacks, he
didn't see much interest from customers in being protected from
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not been a focus,'' Bycoff said, ``because we all
guessed that the money was on the other side of this.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Bycoff expects plenty of interest in software for
fending off denial-of-service attacks, and he may add such a
product to the Netegrity line.

ON THE WEB, MAGAZINE IS ALL THE BUZZ 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAM ALLIS   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buzz snakes through our culture like millennial mist. People and
institutions rise and fall on their ability to generate the stuff.
For more than a decade, Tina Brown was the fin de siecle queen of
buzz. As editor of Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, she and her
publications dominated table talk at All The Right Places.
</P>
<P>
   But today Brown is in eclipse. The latest pretender to her
throne is David Talbot, creator of Salon.com, the randy, San
Francisco-based online magazine. Talbot's house of buzz has cooked
up a daily gumbo of news and opinion, arguably hotter than anything
on the Internet. Anchored by outstanding cultural coverage, it
presents a sexed, edgy confection that attracts readers like moths
to a back porch light.
</P>
<P>
   And it has done so in cyberspace, not on the newsstand. ``Salon
is the first really successful new media site on the Net,'' says
media critic Jon Katz. ``It is the first to figure out how to fuse
content and interactivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Its craving for attention is matched by its penchant for
controversy. Salon is in the news for its lapses in judgment as
well as its scoops. Its writing, says Washington Post media critic
Howard Kurtz, ranges from superb to sophomoric. The editorial
product can be as uneven as it is insouciant.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this unhinged approach has legs is unclear. ``Salon's
strength and weakness is that it takes all kinds of editorial
chances in an age when most publications are cautious and overly
polite,'' Kurtz says.
</P>
<P>
   When Salon is good, it is very good. Salon reporter Daniel
Forbes made headlines last month when he uncorked a story
documenting the White House Office of National Drug Control
Policy's searching of network television scripts for antidrug
messages. It was a superior piece of journalism and a clean score
for Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, Talbot ran a piece by Dan Savage, an
openly gay Seattle-based writer bent on giving then-presidential
candidate Gary Bauer the flu because of Bauer's antipathy toward
gays. Savage, who had come down with the virus, posed as a Bauer
volunteer in Iowa and fraudulently voted as a Republican there.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal readers howled about the piece, which they considered
beyond the pale even for Salon. Talbot printed a sampling of their
e-mail tirades along with an editor's note in which he stood by the
article without condoning what Savage claimed to have done. Today,
Talbot remains unchastened by l'affaire Savage: ``My only
difficulty was not to have put an editor's note on the piece when
it ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon, then, is the gifted adolescent who dazzles a crowd yet
forgets to clean up his room. And it couldn't care less about
criticism. ``There is no bad buzz,'' says David Weir, its
Washington bureau chief, updating P.T. Barnum's famous dictum.
``We're not The New York Times. We're not gatekeepers of what
should be published.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the point. Salon's sense of propriety is elastic, its
pursuit of cheek singleminded. ``The primary reason Salon exists is
because of the frustration I felt by the confines of daily
journalism,'' explains Talbot, a former arts editor of the San
Francisco Examiner. ``It has become increasingly formulaic and
focus-group driven _ simply dull. I came of age with the gonzo
journalism of Hunter Thompson in Rolling Stone. It was risk-taking,
provocative journalism. We've done that here.''
</P>
<P>
   No question about that. Salon is still recovering from the
firestorm it created in 1998 over the story it ran, on the eve of
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, about a
34-year-old extramarital affair of House Judiciary Committee
chairman Henry Hyde. All 57 journalistic organizations that were
offered the story turned it down. Salon's Washington correspondent,
Jonathan Broder, left over Talbot's decision to run it.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot was pilloried for leaky ethics and a pro-Clinton agenda.
There were bomb threats at the office and death threats at home. He
wrote at the time that ``ugly times call for ugly tactics'' and has
never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Salon is also a feast of guilty pleasures. It produces stories
as illicit in this earnest world as Godiva chocolates to a weight
watcher. High in this category are the 53 episodes of ``Nancy Chan:
Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl.'' This fictional romp catches with
a gimlet eye the lust in the Imperial City with chapters like
``Thighs Wide Shut.'' Salon also has a regular sex column. One
recent offering by Susie Bright titled ``The Randy Bellboy''
provided tips on how lonely female hotel guests can get serviced by
staff.
</P>
<P>
   But Talbot also craves serious credentials. Salon's political
reportage, notably its award-winning work on the Whitewater
scandal, has been solid. Last summer, Weir opened a Washington
bureau that will soon have nine reporters. (There are 56 on the
editorial staff, 10 in New York and the rest in San Francisco.)
</P>
<P>
   Jake Tapper, its lead political reporter, provides a steady
stream of smart, wry coverage of the presidential campaign. The day
after the New Hampshire primary, while the rest of the media herd
focused on South Carolina, Anthony York had a strong piece
detailing how the arcane rules in the California primaries will
hinder the transfer of raw votes among independents for John McCain
and Bill Bradley into convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the day, sex trumps politics at Salon.
Grown-up discussion of it is Salon's long suit and is marbled
through the 11 Salon sites, which include Arts &AMP; Entertainment,
Books, Health &AMP; Body, Media, News, Politics2000, and, Technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest is Mothers Who Think, edited by Jennifer
Foote Sweeney, devoted to intelligent exploration of real life for
women with children. Two weeks ago, it ran a piece asking, ``Is
this child pornography?'' about the trend among photo labs to call
police over film of naked children in bathtubs.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot celebrates sex because no one else does. He considers it
an effective tool to distance Salon from online competitors. ``The
question for new media operations is: What do you do that no one
else does?'' he asks. ``Most publications in America can't answer
that effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   But more fundamentally, Talbot chafes at the way sex is treated
in this country. ``The US is childish as a culture in dealing with
it,'' says Talbot, who wrote a book on the subject. ``It is treated
either in a snickering sophomoric way or a harrumphing prudish way.
I find that inexplicable.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Weir, ``I can't think of a dinner party when sex doesn't
come up along with politics, books, and movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbot started Salon in 1995 as a weekly cultural digest. Books
were its windows to the world. ``At the beginning, we concluded
that the focus on new ideas in arts and culture and politics tended
to emerge through books,'' Weir says. Salon's book section remains
a superior admixture of knowing reviews covering an eclectic range
of books and illuminating interviews with authors.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Talbot realized that Salon could not survive as a
weekly given the speed of the Internet, and in February 1997 took
it daily. ``We realized that news drives traffic,'' Weir says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, news coverage mushroomed, driven by the elections
that year and seismic events like the death of Princess Diana that
drew huge spikes in readership. Talbot sees running room covering
the entertainment industry. Because publications like Entertainment
Weekly are owned by conglomerates, he argues, they will be less
likely to pursue aggressive investigations than the independent
Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Salon had revenues of $6.2 million last year and expects to turn
a profit sometime next year. It raised $27 million in a public
offering and $15 million from private investors last year to pay
for its current hiring spree. But profits are elusive for dotcoms.
Buzz does not automatically morph into dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot hopes to open a European operation based in London later
this year. CEO Michael O'Donnell is now in Europe talking to
institutional investors. He salivates over the $800 million worth
of online ads in the United Kingdom alone last year and remains
sanguine that an American operation can thrive in a cultural
collision with the Euros.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Salon sold 10 percent of itself last year
to Rainbow Media Holdings, the holding company for the Bravo
Network, the Independent Film Channel, and American Movie Classics.
It plans to air its own television show on Bravo in late summer.
Salon Radio, accessible on its home page, is also ramping up its
audio stream of talk and music to augment the online offerings. By
the end of the year, a reader will be able to hear Salon reporters,
reviewers, and columnists read their work.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Salon readership is soaring, according to its own
figures. It claims that 3.4 million people visited it in December,
up fivefold from the 650,000 during the previous December. Slate,
the more traditional online magazine of politics and commentary run
by former New Republic editor Michael Kinsley, disputes the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This food fight is based on dueling statistics. The industry
yardstick has been Media Metrix, the New York company that projects
totals based on a sample of users. By that measurement, Salon had
1.4 million in December; Slate had 900,000.
</P>
<P>
   Salon says that the sample system grossly underestimates the
true numbers. As for Slate's charges? ``Sour grapes,'' says Patrick
Hurley, Salon's vice president for marketing. ``When's the last
time you heard someone talk about Slate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slate won't go around licking doorknobs,'' snaps Kinsley.
</P>
<P>
   But it does advertise on Salon. Even more delicious for Salon
was CNN's refusal last year to air its television ad campaign on
the grounds that an online site was a direct competitor to the TV
network.
</P>
<P>
   Love that buzz. At the end of the day, though, Salon will rise
or fall on its credibility. ``Buzz is their ideology,'' Broder
says. ``Once the fascination in the Web ends, the old rules still
apply.''

 &HT;    Despite snags, AirPort system good for wireless connections
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It almost sounds too good to be true. There's an easy
way to wirelessly connect two Macs for sharing or transferring
files or to connect several Macs from anywhere in a house through
one Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   But you can do this and more with Apple's new AirPort wireless
system. The bad news is that AirPort, as should be expected, is a
work in progress. The speed of connections is so-so, and there are
some glitches in the setup and ease of use.
</P>
<P>
   AirPort is the first wireless home system for personal
computers. It works through software, a base station, an antenna
and an installation card.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the AirPort has been incorporated in three models _
iBooks, G4s and iMac DVs. Each of these models has a special
built-in wireless antenna and special software.
</P>
<P>
   You still have to buy a $99 card that easily slips into each of
these models to enable AirPort.
</P>
<P>
   The last part of the system is a white-and-blue disc called the
AirPort base station. It serves as a wireless modem that lets up to
10 AirPort-equipped Macs connect to the Internet. And they can do
so from about 150 feet away. That means you can jump wirelessly
onto the Internet from just about anywhere in your house.
</P>
<P>
   Configuring the AirPort software is easy. There's an assistant
that walks you through the process. The software is intuitive
enough to import your existing online configuration, if you want.
</P>
<P>
   The software includes a separate control strip that runs along
the bottom of your screen. It monitors the strength of the AirPort
signal. It also lets you choose whether to connect via the base
station or with another Mac. You don't need the station to just
connect two Macs.
</P>
<P>
   One hitch is that AirPort won't work with America Online. That's
a big problem, given that AOL is the largest single provider of
Internet access. Hopefully, Apple will soon strike a deal with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that, while AirPort connections were highly
reliable, they were slow. That was especially true compared to the
standard connection, the 10BaseT Ethernet port built into most
Macs.
</P>
<P>
   The speed of the connection slows even further if more than one
Mac is using the base station.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is transferring files among Macs through AirPort speedy. It
takes two to four times longer to transfer a file wirelessly than
through an Ethernet connection.
</P>
<P>
   And a final peeve. Apple has made it cumbersome to restore a
lost connection through AirPort's current setup.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these drawbacks, AirPort is off to a good start. Surely
it will only get stronger with the inevitable upgrades. Indeed,
AirPort software upgrade 1.1 has just been released.

 &HT;    Discovery lures TV crowd to Web
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yahoo is now, and probably will be for the foreseeable
future, the country's most popular Web site. It is one of the most
recognizable brands on the Web and offers users everything from
searches to auctions, fantasy baseball, online shopping and
greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   But stand back Yahoo, traditional media are hot on your trail.
You've got serious competition from some pretty big names,
targeting an audience that may like Yahoo but really loves
television. One day, that could make all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Discovery Networks, best known for its popular cable
channels, took its Web site and turned it into a full-fledged
portal for families and fans of the Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The new site offers users information about programming on the
Discovery Channel, the Travel Channel, the Learning Network, Animal
Planet and Discovery Health Online. A second area called Web
Express is a well-designed portal site that will link users to a
variety of search engines (including Yahoo). Users can also check
stock prices, read horoscopes, chat or look up information on
everything from cars to careers or even visit a special area for
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Michela English, who heads up Discovery's online ventures, said
the evolution from a Web site simply promoting TV shows to a unique
family/portal/TV/e-commerce site was a steady process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We launched our first Web site in 1995, in support of our TV
networks,'' she said. ``Now it's a set of tools, not necessarily
focused on Discovery. The launch marks an evolution of our strategy
and our company's commitment to make the Discovery brand an
Internet brand. We say we want to help people to explore their
world, but we want to also be relevant to everyday life. Using the
Discovery brand means we can throw the weight of the TV and retail
stores behind that brand to build a family of sites under the
Discovery gateway.''
</P>
<P>
   Discovery.com wants to move the fans of the cable channels onto
the Web site, something NBC has been doing with its online
properties including the NBC Web site, the portal site Snap, the
community/home page site Xoom.com, and news and information site
MSNBC.com, a joint venture with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Media executives say the move to take a loyal TV audience and
turn it into a loyal Web audience is something at which traditional
media companies excel. They say the goal of a media company working
to establish a Web presence is to take the viewer, turn him into an
Internet user, then into a member, then a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Discover seems to be following that plan. It already has deals
with online retailers including Amazon.com., moviephone.com, CDNow
and others to add e-commerce to the site's revenue stream. The
Discovery Store online also offers a variety of gifts and goodies.
</P>
<P>
   Both NBC Interactive and Discovery.com have the right
demographics for online Web success. NBC television has a young,
hip audience that uses the Web either at home or at work and has
enough confidence in the network to check out its Web sites, which
are promoted both in programming and commercials for its various
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery also has the right demographics for Web success. Its
core audience includes everyone from hard-core science junkies to
kids looking for homework help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We draw really a broad audience,'' English says. ``We have the
hard-core science aficionados. When we follow space shots, we'll
get families and a traditional male audience that is interested in
that sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   English says the revamped Discovery site isn't limited to
science lovers and students. She wants to attract the widest
audience possible. ``We think of ourselves as family-oriented,''
she said, adding that the new users coming online _ especially
women and kids _ will want to log on to familiar brands and find
what they want with a minimum of fuss. ``We want to meet that need
to offer general interest and offer them the opportunity to
transact business or subscribe to a service,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery has no illusions it's the next Yahoo, but if it can
bring its loyal TV audience to the Web and keep it there, the
company might be on to something.

 &HT;    Desktop Translator still not as good as it should be
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Desktop Translator, in its latest version, boasts
Internet capabilities and will not only attempt to translate your
writing but your spoken words.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the attempts at translation have not
significantly improved since the last time I looked at it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps if one confines one's translating requirements to
international business, which is really what the publisher,
Transparent Language, intends the program for, it might be
acceptable. However, no one writes business letters to me in
anything but English, and they don't write them for long because I
don't answer them in any language.
</P>
<P>
   So in order to check out Desktop Translator, I must take to the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   The program can be used in a window mode, in which one pastes
the copy to be translated into one window and the translation
appears below. In this mode, the translation can also be spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Other modes for accessing the program include a toolbar and a
place on the taskbar; in these configurations Desktop Translator
can be used to translate an entire Web page, no matter which
browser you're using. Still another mode is used when the user
wants to dictate to the program.
</P>
<P>
   The program can be used to translate between English and
Spanish, French and German, and from English to Portuguese and
Italian.
</P>
<P>
   I tried Spanish to English.
</P>
<P>
   From a Spanish Web page providing a brief biography of Pablo
Picasso, I excerpt one translated paragraph from the section on his
cubist period:
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspired by the processing volumEtrico of the forms pictUricas
of Paul CEzanne, Picasso and Georges Braque they painted in 1908 a
series of landscapes inside a style that a critic described later
as if had been based on facts 'small buckets', being imposed thus
the term cubismo. Among 1908 and 1911 they worked in narrow
contribution inside this line of disorder and analysis of the
forms, developing juntos the first phase of the cubism,
acquaintance as cubism analytic.''
</P>
<P>
   While anyone with a smattering of knowledge of Picasso's work
can muddle through that to a fair degree, I certainly wouldn't want
to risk having something I wrote put through that sort of mangler.
</P>
<P>
   On the same site with the Picasso biography there was a short
biography of Salvador Dali. But instead of quoting from a
translation of that text, I bring you something more surreal than
anything Dali ever painted. It is Desktop Translator's version of
the story of ``El Largarto de la Catedral,'' which DT entitled
``The Lizard of the Cathedral.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that in a section of the Cathedral of Seville one can
find hanging from the roof ``a crocodile of natural size, a bite of
horse and a cane of command.'' The genesis of this bizarre trio, it
is said, came in the year 1260, when ``the sultan of Egypt sent an
embassy to the King Alfonso X the Wise one to ask the hand of its
daughter Berenguela.
</P>
<P>
   ``The embassy brought diverse presents, among them a beautiful
eyetooth of elephant, a crocodile of the Nile alive and a giraffe
domesticated with its setting and its brake and flanges.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso, it goes on to say, was loath to give the hand of his
daughter to this sultan, as well he should have been, I might add.
Anyone who sends me crocodiles alive and a giraffe with brake and
flanges is not apt to get my daughter's hand. Next thing you know
it might be hanging from his turret. At any rate, Alfonso sent back
gifts for the sultan, and, according to DT, ``here they remained
the crocodile and the giraffe. Past the time, and dead person the
crocodile, was dissected, and their skin fills of paja went hanging
of the Patio of the Nranjos together with the brake of the giraffe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years later, hung like remembrance the stick of the Spanish
ambassador that returned from Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no further mention of the ``bite of horse.'' Perhaps a
bite of horse is synonymous with a giraffe flange. I don't know,
and I don't think Desktop Translator is going to tell me.

 &HT;    Moms offered intellectualism
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Talk to women who left jobs to raise children, and
some say they miss the office camaraderie, the chance to talk to
someone not wearing diapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can bring the small talk and the big talk to your
home. Salon, an online magazine, has an online discussion group
called Mothers Who Think. The site, which can be reached from a
link off www.salon.com, offers several topics for discussion,
including: ``Why Marriage?,'' ``Mommy or Joseph Stalin,'' and ``Dr.
Laura is a despicable, guilt-mongering hypocrite; why would anyone
seek her opinion on anything?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more popular topics is called ``How long are you
going to do that? And other breast-feeding topics.'' A person with
the screen name of Jody2ms started the discussion in August 1998
with this post:
</P>
<P>
   ``My father in-law asked me, `When are you going to stop that
nonsense?' I replied, while nursing my 4-month-old, `I hope to have
him weaned by the time he starts college, because we would like him
to attend out of state if he wants.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Steele started this discussion thread in January:
``Stay-At-Home Moms: How do you have an intellectual life with
other women?
</P>
<P>
   ``When most of the women you meet in mothers' groups want to
talk about kids and consuming? I mean, I take care of her and
that's enough, I don't want to talk about it as well. I need to
discuss adult things when I'm around other adults. I miss the
discussion of ideas and culture I used to have with my old
co-workers ... sigh.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recent posts dealt with a book, ``The Playgroup,''
by Nina Barrett. Such as this one, from RobinM:
</P>
<P>
   `` ... I have been telling all my friends, the other moms in my
play group, and here about this book, and finally someone actually
reads it too ... I was struck by finding women who were just as
ambitious as I was/am, but rattled by how much good mothering is
important to me and how hard it is to define it. I was/am (unhappy)
that my husband didn't have to deal with the same self-doubts
regarding his work and his fatherhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon is a free online magazine. Participation in the discussion
groups requires registration, which is also free.

   RAY LEWIS' STORY, RIGHT FROM THE START
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is an interesting place.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Jan. 31, Baltimore Ravens All-Pro linebacker Ray
Lewis is jailed in connection with the slaying of two men. Three
days later, two Ravens fans in suburban Baltimore start the process
of setting up a Web site designed to get the word out to people
interested in the topic.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.freeraylewis.com, offers Free Ray Lewis T-shirts,
a brief biography of Lewis, links to news Web sites that carry
stories on the slayings and a place for people to talk about the
issue. The site also features a poll. Last Wednesday, 550 of the
612 votes were from Ravens fans. Of those, 60 percent, 367, don't
think Lewis did it.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Silberg, the 27-year-old who started the site with friend
Michael Snyder, said the meaning of the Web site address
(freeraylewis.com) is not a statement of innocence but simply a
desire that Lewis be freed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that you can only judge a person on what they've
done up to this point,'' said Silberg. ``And up to this point, he's
showed an amazing amount of determination, not only as a player but
in his personal life. We know that from hearing his story.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if he is found guilty, all bets are off. We're just trying
to create a forum so when people sit down and have a conversation
about this, they do it on facts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Silberg and Snyder are selling T-shirts but only to recover the
few thousand dollars they paid to ice

 &HT;    Take it from an old hacker: Recent fears are overblown
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the beginning of the computer age, there were
hackers. The word had a slightly different meaning back then. A
hacker was a computer hobbyist who didn't love computers because
they were useful, instead he loved them because they were
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of being a hacker was not, in those days, breaking
into computers and computer networks _ but don't let anyone kid
you, there was plenty of that going on.
</P>
<P>
   I know because I was a hacker. I wasn't a genius hacker; there
was no danger of my getting rich because of my computer knowledge.
I wasn't smart enough. Nor was there much danger that I'd someday
be the anti-hero of a movie because of my skill at breaking into
computer networks. When it came to skill and to breaking into
networks, I was no more than fair-to-middling.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe that's enough to make it easier to talk to you about
what's going on these days. It's difficult to pick up a newspaper
without finding a banner headline talking about hackers bringing
some Web site to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   When I talk to my friends, I keep hearing dark fears that
there's some sort of sophisticated international conspiracy
designed to bring the Internet down. In fact, a lot of what I hear
reminds me of the hysteria Y2K stirred. It was going to be the end
of the world as we know it, and it turned out to be less potent
than an old-fashioned ice storm.
</P>
<P>
   First, you need to know that in some ways _ despite the growth
of sophistication of security on the Net and the World Wide Web _
that hacking is easier than ever. Nowadays, a beginning hacker
doesn't have to write the computer code for a hacking program.
Instead, you can download these programs from the Web _ a nice
piece of irony in itself, since Web sites have been the primary
target. So while there are sophisticated hackers out there, the
majority are cookbook hackers, following directions found on Web
sites, using tools downloaded from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Second, keep in mind that the recent attacks on Yahoo, eBay and
CNN.com (by the time you read this there may be more _ I'll explain
why before I'm done) were denial-of-service attacks. In no case did
the hacker get secret information or break in and steal passwords
or personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they jammed up the system by trying to connect to it
from a variety of servers (computers connected to the Net). It's
really no different from a prankster tying up your phone line by
redialing it over and over. I'm not saying that hackers are
incapable of breaking into networks and performing some of the
feats that movies are written about. But that kind of hacking is
more difficult and requires entirely different skills.
</P>
<P>
   Third, despite what the experts say, I'm not sure that there is
a big and well-organized conspiracy here. Instead, that one hacking
exploit, say, bringing Yahoo to its knees, brings out the ``me,
too'' hackers who want to prove that they can do it, too.
</P>
<P>
   While there are big hacker organizations _ you can find many on
the Web by doing a search _ historically the best hackers, and the
best criminals in general, have worked alone and are as shy as a
15-year-old on a first date. These vandals want publicity; the
people you should fear most do not. But since this ``me, too''
mentality is a fact of life, you probably will see more incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, the smartest computer security experts I know are
getting rich because they are smart. They end up getting jobs with
computer networks and making a lot of money. A lot of them start
out as hackers. The good news is that the best and the brightest
generally go to work trying to stop the worst and the dullest.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not telling you that there is nothing to worry about when it
comes to hacking. But I am saying that _ when it comes to worrying
about criminal acts _ to worry about getting a good deadbolt lock
for the front door of your home and to make sure not to leave the
keys in your cars. The real world is still a more dangerous place
than cyberspace.

 &HT;    Super sci-fi fare, and shedding a little light on the subject

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Every now and then you run across a piece of
science fiction that ascends the piles of books about aliens and
space travel, stands atop and calls attention to itself. Charles
Clotfelter's We Aquatus ($27, www. area51pub.com) is such a book.
Clotfelter is a taxi driver in Las Vegas and an author on the side.
His book details a race of aliens who have been living on Earth for
thousands of years and have recently decided to announce
themselves. The book, which blends philosophy and history into a
seamless tome, is fresh, lively and thought-provoking. Especially
satisfying is the exciting denouement. This is a great fireside,
weekend read for these few days of winter we experience in Austin.
And to help you see your books while reading by the fire, might I
suggest the newest in book lights. The Fliplite Junior ($10, www.
BarnesandNoble.com) is a compact, folding book light you can take
just about anywhere. The light clips onto the back of the book and
works well with hardbacks and paperbacks. You'll also look
up-to-the-minute when you use the light: It comes in a fashionable
salmon color with a yellow plastic cover for the light.

 &HT;    Web team gets whiff of future
 &HT;    By Brian D. Crecente
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It won't be long before your computer is
stinking up the joint.
</P>
<P>
   The iSmell _ no kidding, that's its name _ is a boxy gizmo that
looks like a pencil sharpener and attaches to your computer like a
printer. Inside is a tray of scent materials, called a scent
palate, that can produce thousands of smells on command.
</P>
<P>
   That means you'll soon be able to tool the information
superhighway and stop and smell the roses, say Joel Bellenson and
Dexster Smith, founders of Oakland, Fla.-based DigiScents and
makers of the iSmell.
</P>
<P>
   Bellenson and Smith predict an entire e-world teeming with
scents: Smelly Web sites and e-mail, stinky movies, music and
advertising, and some really rank games. According to Scentworld,
DigiScents online guide to the world of smells, playing a
shoot-em-up might soon include an experience like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel helpless, and then it hits you ... a slight stream of
warm air, saturated with the stench of death and decay, drifts into
your nostrils.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellenson said racing games could use the smells of the terrain
and the vehicles to help pull users into the experience; adventure
games could use smell cues to tip a player off that a creature has
entered the room, and Web sites and e-mail could include just about
any smells you care _ or fear _ to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Movies could use smell the way they currently use soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding scent to movies will be like adding color to movies,''
Bellenson said, and despite the failure of the cruder attempts of
Smell-O-Vision, Bellenson is sure DigiScents will succeed. ``The
first movie with sound was `Jazz Singer' and it was basically a
piece of crap that people hated, but that didn't doom sound in
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Bellenson and Smith founded Pangea Systems, Inc., a
tremendously successful biotech company that is working to unravel
the mysteries of DNA. They left early retirement to found
DigiScents in February 1999. When they discovered a way to digitize
and transmit the ``language of smell'' through a computer, the
iSmell was born. The company plans to start testing it by early
spring and have it on store shelves by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Bellenson said the company is also developing software that will
allow scentographers to create smell-laden art and invent their own
scents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope our tools will give rise to a large body of people who
will try to be creative,'' he said. ``I'm sure there will be
legions of young people trying to create their own scent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the whole world might soon smell like teen spirit.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Rockstar Games is back, and the winter lineup of Playstation
games totally kicks. To start, Grand Theft Auto has
beenreincarnated as GTA2 ($50; www.gta2.com). If you played the
controversial first one, you know the drill. You play a criminal
intent on stealing cars and killing people. In the sequel, the
purpose is to endear yourself to one of three street gangs by
``offing'' members of other street gangs and doing ``errands.'' You
perform these tasks to a rocking soundtrack and smooth game play.
This overhead driver/shooter game is irreverent and violent, but
it's totally fun and worth the flak you might get from an
anti-violence group. Rockstar's other title is Thrasher: Skate and
Destroy ($50; www.skateanddestroy.com). This skating game is good
enough to brandish the name of Thrasher, the ultimate skater's mag.
In the game, you are an up and comer armed only with a skateboard
and a couple of tricks. Through the levels, you join competitions
and kickflip, nollie and tailgrab your way into other competitions
and sponsorships. This game is addictive and will make you set
aside Activision's ``Tony Hawk: Pro Skater.''
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   It's only fair to judge a game by what it hopes to accomplish,
so criticizing Slave Zero (Infogrames, $30) for a lack of depth
would be like criticizing Pokemon for being unrealistic. That
point. Zero is about living the universal childhood temper-tantrum
fantasy of being an invincible 100-foot-tall monster who stomps
mightily through an endless cityscape, crushing and smashing
anything in its way. In Zero, you're a rampaging robot with a
mission. Cars on endless interstates swerve to avoid you or smash
into 20-car pileups as tiny frightened citizens scream and cower or
run. Helicopters and buildings are shattered with one blow from
your mighty fist or a blast from your rocket launcher. On the
downside, too few weapons options, an initially confusing control
setup and maddening ammunition shortages slow the game needlessly.
And it has no multiplayer option. But once you get up to speed, the
anime-style hero, fluid movement, beautiful cityscape and furious
pace add up to tons and tons of rampaging excitement. Which is all
``Slave Zero'' ever wanted. Stomp on with your bad self.

 &HT;    Simon &AMP; Schuster encyclopedia both helpful and hard to use
 &HT;    By Joe Stafford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There are things to like about the Simon &AMP;
Schuster New Millennium Children's Encyclopedia and Home Reference
Library (Deluxe 2000 Edition; $21; www.simonandschuster.com), but
its giggly rainbow of typography and ``For Ages 8-12 Years'' on the
cover belie its hard-to-fathom interface and a dizzying array of
options that will daunt most adults and overwhelm its target
audience. The program lets the user download books and updates from
the Internet (at additional cost), organize content in dozens of
ways or study books in several languages, among many customizing
tools. Other pluses include a built-in dictionary, atlas, animal
encyclopedia and book of world cultures, all well-illustrated. But
even the handy voice-over tour of scrollbars and options can't hide
the giant learning curve required to master the interface. The
articles are written in clear, kid-friendly language and
accompanied by a fairly generous selection of illustrations, short
films and audio recordings. It's not a bad tool for kids' research
projects, but the bottom line is that without the dedicated
supervision of a librarian or other adult, this complex program
will probably just drive most children bonkers.

ETRADE FILINGS WITH SEC OMITTED DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ETrade Group, the most visited investment site on the Internet,
has spent millions of advertising dollars to build its reputation
as a company that empowers individual investors. Along the way,
however, it has been slow to provide investors with some crucial
information about itself.
</P>
<P>
   On two occasions in recent months, ETrade has excluded
information about its executives' pay packages from Securities and
Exchange Commission filings. The omissions are an apparent
violation of SEC rules, compensation experts and lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Di Chiro, an ETrade spokesman, said the company had a
strong record of disclosing information and had done nothing wrong.
One instance was ``an oversight,'' Di Chiro said, and the company
did not think it had erred in the second.
</P>
<P>
   An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on ETrade's filings,
saying the commission did not publicly discuss specific matters.
</P>
<P>
   On the first occasion, ETrade belatedly released information on
the repricing of stock options granted to top managers. On the
second, it delayed for six months releasing the terms of a new
contract for its chief executive, Christos M. Cotsakos.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, pay experts said, investors would have an unusually
hard time figuring out whether the executive pay packages would add
significantly to ETrade's losses or whether Cotsakos' contract
included a golden parachute big enough to make a future sale of the
company more likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this,'' said Graef S. Crystal, an executive-pay expert
who first noticed the missing information, ``suggests these guys
are not putting the shareholders' interests before their own.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, Cotsakos agreed to a new contract. But the company
did not include details of it in its next quarterly SEC filing in
August, as the SEC requires. The company also failed to report the
contract's details in its next quarterly filing and in its annual
proxy. ``That's definitely a no-no,'' said Judith Fischer, the
publisher of Executive Compensation Reports, a newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The proxy did mention that Cotsakos would receive a ``a special
enterprise value enhancement bonus'' if new management were to take
control of the company. But since the company did not attach a copy
of the contract to the proxy or to the earlier filings, investors
had no way to determine how big it could be.
</P>
<P>
   Di Chiro said that listing Cotsakos' salary and acknowledging
the existence of the special bonus, even without discussing its
size, was sufficient for the proxy. ``The feeling here is that we
did disclose the major terms of that agreement,'' Di Chiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation lawyers, however, noted that in 601(b)(10) of
regulation S-K, the SEC specifically requires companies to attach a
copy of a new contract for top executives to the quarterly filing
after it is signed.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade has included a copy in its most recent filing, which it
sent to the SEC on Monday, and which will be available to the
public later this week, Di Chiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Cotsakos, one of the highest-paid executives in the online
investment industry, made almost $10 million in the 12 months that
ended Sept. 30, including his salary, bonus and gains for exercised
stock options. He received option grants potentially worth tens of
millions of dollars more.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Cronrath Bamberger, an SEC spokeswoman, said that if the
commission determined that a company regularly left out required
information, it would consider taking action that could range from
a letter expressing concern to a fine. ``We take these filings very
seriously,'' Bamberger said. In the last two years, the SEC has
stepped up its enforcement against late filers, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The recent instances involving ETrade are particularly troubling
because of the kind of company it is, pay experts said. ETrade
deals with highly detailed SEC rules every day, and the company,
with $250 million in revenue in its last quarter, is one of the
more established Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not the kind of company you'd expect to be missing
pertinent disclosures,'' said Patrick S. McGurn, a vice president
at Informational Shareholder Services, which advises institutional
investors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the first of the two instances, ETrade failed to include a
chart that listed the occasions in which it repriced its
executives' stock options over the last decade, as required by SEC
rules.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, ETrade repriced more than 14 million options,
many with a strike price of $6 to $7, at $4.25. At the time, the
stock was hovering around $4, having lost more than half its value
in just four months. It has grown to $21.50 since then.
</P>
<P>
   Repricing is controversial because it allows executives to
profit from options even after they have failed to reach earlier
goals. But nobody debates whether the SEC requires a company to
publish the details of its repricings from the last decade, and
ETrade's November 29 proxy did not include a repricing table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a black-letter rule,'' McGurn said. ``When you reprice,
you do the 10-year look-back table. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after publishing its proxy, the company released the
table as an addendum, correcting what Di Chiro called an oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many investors are likely to miss the information when
they research the company. Investors who rely on the actual proxy _
printing it from the SEC's online database without noticing the
addendum, for example _ will not have the table.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate-governance experts say they are concerned that
ETrade's slow disclosures are part of a general attitude among
dot-com executives that many widely accepted management practices
are not crucial. Technology companies, for example, are among the
most generous to their executives, even when they miss financial
targets. And many, including ETrade, have relatively small boards
with a high proportion of directors who have ties to management,
McGurn said.
</P>
<P>
   Di Chiro said that ETrade had an effective board and that the
company adhered to all SEC rules. ``It's very serious business
around here,'' he said.

WORLD BANK UNIT TO JOIN IN INTERNET START-UP FINANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet, with English as its dominant language and the
United States its dominant backer and beneficiary, has created a
digital divide, with some poor nations watching from afar as the
World Wide Web transforms commerce and creates vast new sources of
wealth in the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first major efforts to bridge the gap is to be
announced Monday in Tokyo. The World Bank's International Finance
Corp. unit has teamed up with Softbank of Japan to create a $200
million fund that will finance Internet start-ups in 100 developing
countries. The International Finance Corp. will also join
Softbank's existing plan to invest $300 million in Internet
companies in China and Latin America, bringing the total amount
they are devoting to third world Internet development to $500
million.
</P>
<P>
   The new venture, named Softbank Emerging Markets, will provide
seed capital to entrepreneurs building Internet businesses in poor
countries. It will also seek to transfer successful e-commerce
business models and train managers to apply them, World Bank
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The digital divide is one of the greatest impediments to
development, and it is growing exponentially,'' the World Bank's
president, James D. Wolfensohn, said in a statement. ``We are
taking a lead in the effort to close the gap. This investment will
accelerate the inclusion of the developing countries in the
information revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Softbank is one of the most successful backers of Internet
businesses in the United States. It has provided seed capital for
Yahoo, ETrade and Buy.com, among others. The International Finance
Corp. is the for-profit investment banking arm of the World Bank,
the Washington-based institution that aims to promote economic
development in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Softbank Emerging Markets, based in Silicon Valley, plans to
make its first investments this spring. In addition to providing
capital, the fund will become a joint venture partner with
companies it finances. Some back-office and strategic planning
services will be centralized in Silicon Valley, according to a
description of the business plan provided by the World Bank and
Softbank.

DIGITAL COMMERCE COLUMN: WHAT IF A WEB NETWORK REFUSED TO PASS
DATA? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's Web site attacks were a vivid reminder that
technology's sword of individual empowerment has a wicked double
edge. But the term for the attack technique _ denial of service _
has the potential to assume an equally ominous meaning as
telecommunications giants continue to merge their large holdings.
</P>
<P>
   As we know, the Internet is a network of networks. In the
beginning of its commercial ascendancy in 1995, this meant that the
largest of the Internet service companies _ known as backbone
providers _ had to interconnect with their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Using the network access points, or NAPs, that were formerly
financed by the federal government, they built businesses
delivering data among networks. And in the early days, not much
more than a handshake between backbone engineers was needed to
ensure that these companies would pass along one another's data,
all for the greater good (and growth) of the market.
</P>
<P>
   This ``you scratch mine, I'll scratch yours'' arrangement is
known as peering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption in the old days was always, `I'm going to send
you as much data as you send me,''' says David Farber, one of the
scientists who helped build the original Arpanet _ the Internet
progenitor _ and who is now the chief technologist at the Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   And when the two main NAPs became impossibly clogged with
traffic, the busiest Internet service providers, or ISPs, formed
private peering arrangements to interconnect and exchange data
directly with one another.
</P>
<P>
   The global Internet is still defined by the exchange of data
between networks. But today, in place of back-scratchy handshakes
are book-size contracts drawn up by phalanxes of corporate lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The backbone provider with by far the largest number of physical
connections is UUNET, now owned by MCI Worldcom, which is on its
way to becoming Worldcom Sprint. In rough descending order, UUNET
is followed by Sprint; Cable and Wireless USA, which acquired MCI
Internet as a result of the 1998 MCI-Worldcom merger; GTE
Internetworking (after its acquisition of BBN Planet in 1997); and,
depending on whom you ask, either PSI Net or AT&AMP;T Network Services.
</P>
<P>
   According to prevailing wisdom, a peer is a backbone service
provider that agrees to exchange roughly equivalent amounts of data
with another provider without requiring that money change hands.
</P>
<P>
   But how exactly does one become a peer? Under what circumstances
is a peer a paying customer, and vice versa? Who decides, and how?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no rules for peering,'' says Fred Goldstein, a
network and information technology consultant with Arthur D. Little
in Cambridge, Mass. ``No one knows what the currency is. It's more
a matter of, `I'll see who blinks first.'''
</P>
<P>
   One might consider this to be an overly loose arrangement upon
which to base the New Global Economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the Internet, self-interest forced backbone
providers into peering. Back then, as Farber says, ``without the
exchange points, nobody would have any traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is scarcely true today. It may be even less true
tomorrow: upon completion of the Worldcom-Sprint merger, a single
company would control nearly half of the Internet's backbone _
making it, literally and figuratively, without peer.
</P>
<P>
   Given the furious pace and high stakes of the telecommunications
industry today, some fear that it is only a matter of time before
one big backbone provider or another refuses to exchange data
traffic with one of its peers.
</P>
<P>
   What happens then?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they would have a legitimate excuse,'' says Hal Varian,
dean of the school of information management at the University of
California at Berkeley. ``An ISP could complain, and rightly so,
that another ISP was sending them huge amounts of traffic and
putting a load on their system.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, Varian says, they could also decrease the capacity of
``their side of the network so their own traffic is getting
swamped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an excuse to say, `We can't handle this guy's packets;
we aren't going to connect with him,''' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, says Varian, is that there is no way to prove who
is zooming whom and no way to resolve such disputes outside the
courtroom. And remarkably, there is no rule that requires peers to
provide this most basic function of the Internet: what he calls
``fair, open and nondiscriminatory'' interconnection.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, says John Nakahata, a partner with the law firm Harris
Wiltshire &AMP; Grannis in Washington, the kinds of tactics Varian
describes are what led to requirements for interconnections and
rate regulations in the telephone world of yore.
</P>
<P>
   Nakahata is the former chief of staff for the FCC chairman,
William E. Kennard, and was the senior legal adviser to Kennard's
predecessor, Reed E. Hundt. Nakahata now represents one of the
smaller backbone providers living in the shadow of the proposed
Worldcom-Sprint merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is growing tremendously quickly, thus competition
is very fragile,'' he says. ``If a company can start diverting
growth through these different tactics, then it becomes a
self-perpetuating cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to fear the worst, for example, when one sees from
public filings that Sprint's original merger application to the FCC
did not include a mention of its Internet backbone business.
Because the FCC would not accept the application without that
information, Sprint has since amended and resubmitted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had already stated to Justice we'd be willing to do a
divestiture if necessary,'' says J. Richard Devlin, Sprint's
general counsel, explaining the omission. The company is now in
premerger discussions with the Justice Department about peering and
other Internet-related issues, ``helping them understand the
market,'' Devlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unsettled state of affairs, backbone regulation is
not yet on the table for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My general attitude toward regulation is that you let things
go until they require adult supervision,'' says Farber of the FCC.
``In Japanese, the idea translates to `the sacred sword of last
resort.' That's exactly it; that's its proper place.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Farber says, ``If you can't get companies to
behave in their own self-interest _ and it is good self-interest to
have a vibrant, growing Internet; none of these companies would
exist if there wasn't one _ then this sacred sword can be used if
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Growth in the Internet economy depends on robust competition.
That is a fact that many companies, particularly network companies,
which live and die by scale, conveniently seem to forget after
their urge to merge creates a behemoth or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natural structure in this industry is for there to be only
a few backbone providers,'' Varian says. ``The challenge is to see
that there are more than one.''

ONLINE SELLERS OF GIFT CERTIFICATES RELY ON BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS
SALES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many e-commerce rookies approached this post-Christmas season
with a fair measure of apprehension, given the dearth of remaining
advertising money and nagging questions about how many of their
customers would return after all the gifts had been bought.
</P>
<P>
   Few had as much to worry about, however, as those companies
whose core function was selling gift certificates online. With so
much of the business dependent on holiday shoppers, and with so
many companies crowding into this niche, even executives of the
most well-known sites felt uptight about what the new year would
bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely something we were concerned about,'' said
Robert Levitan, chief executive of Flooz.com, a site that enables
users to buy and send an online scrip _ essentially the equivalent
of gift certificates _ that can be redeemed at various stores on
its site. ``Would we have a big drop? Would our business be too
cyclical?''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly enough, Flooz and its cadre of competitors _
including GiftCertificates.com, Giftpoint.com and
800GiftCertificate.com, among others _ need not have lost sleep. So
far this year, most of these sites report that weekly revenues are
actually increasing, despite the fact that post-holiday sales to
consumers have leveled off.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like a contradiction? As it turns out, the online
gift-certificate business is benefiting from, of all things, the
nation's labor shortage. As companies struggle to attract and
retain workers, many are turning to corporate gift programs _ and
online gift certificates, they say, are a cheap easy and way to
bestow employee perquisites.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Cohen's Fashion Optical, a regional chain of
eyewear stores, rolled out a program six months ago with
800GiftCertificate.com. When they meet certain sales goals, the
company's 300 employees receive points they can redeem for gift
certificates, according to Robert Cohen, the company's chief
executive. ``Employees use them to buy books, dinners _ they're all
over the place with them,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   For management, one of the primary benefits of such a program is
that workers can log onto a page on the 800GiftCertificate site to
track points earned toward their awards. The service, Cohen said,
saves ``tons of paperwork'' and eliminates a multitude of phone
calls to the human resources manager by employees checking on their
incentive status.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dermer, chief executive of 800GiftCertificate.com, said
that roughly 70 percent of the company's sales were to
corporations, not consumers. As a result, he said, the site is
buffered from the major seasonal swings that might otherwise beset
the gift business.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fourth quarter, much of the corporate giving that
happens is about cash bonuses,'' Dermer said. As a result, the
company's corporate sales softened even as the consumer sales
jumped, resulting in less of an overall spike in holiday sales than
other types of e-commerce sites may have experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Nielsen, chief executive of Giftpoint.com, said the whole
point of the company's business-to-business initiative was that it
would provide sales stability. ``We're clearly hoping Christmas
2000 will be gigantic _ and I can't believe I'm talking about
Christmas 2000 _ but the business-to-business program will level
things off'' between now and then, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giftpoint.com offers buyers the choice of receiving gift
certificates through the mail or e-mail, many companies choose the
e-mail option ``because they want them to be more Internet savvy,''
Nielsen. ``In general, more of the business-to-business market is
moving to the online gift certificates.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitan, whose Flooz.com site has also experienced increasing
revenues in the post-holiday weeks, said corporate sales during
that time had exceeded 50 percent of the total. American Greetings,
he said, purchased 300,000 Flooz certificates for a corporate gift
program, while Starbucks also bought a large block of certificates
for its salespeople.
</P>
<P>
   Flooz.com typically makes a 5 percent commission on every sale
made through the site. Recently, however, Levitan said he had been
able to increase his take by negotiating a ``customer acquisition
fee'' from some retailers in lieu of a commission.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan would not disclose fees paid by specific retailers. But
he offered a hypothetical example. ``Instead of making $2.50 on a
purchase of $50, a store might pay, say, $20 for that customer,''
he said. ``You've got a 40 percent margin all of a sudden.''
</P>
<P>
   The company earns that acquisition fee regardless of how many,
or how few, times the customers return to the retailer through
Flooz. But that may change, Levitan said, as retailers seek to
fine-tune the fee structure.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan says Flooz can extract such fees, in part, because it
offers retailers near exclusivity within a particular category. For
instance, Flooz added Toys ``R'' Us.com, the Internet arm of Toys
``R'' Us Inc., to its store last week, he said, ``but we won't have
EToys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People might say that with time, customer acquisition costs
will go down, but it's actually getting harder to find customers,''
Levitan said. ``And I don't see that changing anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Such revenue-boosting strategies may become more important in
the coming months, analysts said, as more online gift companies and
gift certificate sites look to the so-called B-to-B _ or,
business-to-business _ sector for sales. If the economy continues
to steam ahead and the labor shortage drags on, a glut of
gift-giving companies is all but a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's approaching the B-to-B market now,'' said Ken
Cassar, an analyst with Jupiter Communications. ``Rather than
spending huge amounts of money on branding efforts to appeal to the
consumer market, they can spend that money on sales forces to court
corporate America. But because everyone's pursuing that strategy,
they're going to find their sales forces tripping over each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   And they will also be tripping on the feet of companies outside
their category. Businesses like 1800Flowers.com and Proflowers.com
are moving more aggressively into the corporate gift market, as are
gift sites like Camdens.com and RedEnvelope.com. These businesses
can provide corporations a range of gifts for their customers to
select online, analysts said, just as the gift certificate
companies do.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the gift certificate companies are not being ignored
by consumers simply because the December holidays have passed.
``There's a lot of background noise gift giving that goes on all
year,'' said Jonas Lee, chief executive of GiftCertificates.com.
``Sales are still pumping. We're seeing a lot of birthdays, thank
you's, that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Those types of gift-giving events are precisely the reason why
the chocolatier Godiva, a unit of the Campbell Soup Co., turned to
online gift certificates, and Flooz in particular, late last year.
Archie van Beuren, Godiva's chief executive, said: ``People tend to
think of Godiva around now, and around the holidays maybe. This
gives us a way to stay top-of-mind for other gift-giving times when
maybe they might not otherwise think of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Godiva had seen an increase in gift certificate
sales for Valentine's Day, van Beuren said ``sales are continuing
to build, but it's hard to tell if it's seasonal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dermer, of 800GiftCertificate.com, played down Valentine's Day
as a big holiday for his industry. There is a decided lack of
romance to receiving online scrip. ``At the end of the day, you're
still giving someone a code,'' he said, although he noted that his
company did offer an electronic gift certificate intended for
Valentines Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might work for moms and sons, maybe women buying for
husbands _ but definitely not for men to give to women,'' Dermer
said. ``I'm sure someone will try it, though, and get themselves in
a lot of trouble.''

COVERING THE CAMPAIGNS FOR THE CITIZEN-BROWSER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every reporter who has ever dreamed of a world without editors
might see Jacob Weisberg as a man who has achieved nirvana. Every
libertarian Internetophile who believes that the World Wide Web
will democratize information might see Weisberg, Slate magazine's
leading political correspondent, as the man to unlock the medium's
revolutionary potential.
</P>
<P>
   How, then, would the restless reporters feel if they knew that
Weisberg has thousands of editors _ readers who react instantly and
viscerally to his work? And how would the Net libertarians take it
if they knew that the political news media see Weisberg as one of
their own?
</P>
<P>
   Many old-media hacks, whose conventions (objectivity, anyone?)
were supposed to be exploded by the Web, read his online Ballot Box
submissions regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Slate, the liberal magazine Salon.com and the Web site of the
conservative National Review are cited regularly in The Hotline,
the Washington-based online bible of who wrote what about whom.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, said one old-media correspondent, Weisberg and
some of his online magazine competitors _ Jake Tapper, who reports
for Salon.com, and the National Review's Richard Lowry, John J.
Miller and Ramesh Ponnuru _ are using the Web to create national
alternative newspapers, which publish early and often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day to day,'' said Dan Balz, a reporter for The Washington
Post, the Web magazines offer ``the ability to be very irreverent
about all aspects'' of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, whose armies have laid waste to the conventional
beliefs of retailing, brokerage houses and help-wanted advertising,
has had a more subtle impact on political journalism so far.
</P>
<P>
   The Web's growing legions of campaign reporters have married
into the local population, spreading Web culture in a way
comparable to the way Alexander the Great's troops spread Greek
culture. They wear the local costumes: Daily dispatches on
MSNBC.com seem like wire service wrap-ups; ABCNews.com's brief,
daily reports read like campaign diaries.
</P>
<P>
   Weisberg's elegant satire and analysis would seem at home in The
New Republic. Tapper could have dominated an alternative
newspaper's cover with his dogged pursuit of Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, for example, in writing about the Republican candidate's
appearance at a fundamentalist university that bans interracial
dating.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference. If this column had been written for
the Web, for instance, by now you might have seen hot links to
everything from a map of Alexander's campaigns to the Bob Jones
University home page. If this had been written for the Web, the
writer's e-mailbox would be clogged with missives from readers
reacting to these ideas.
</P>
<P>
   As Weisberg said last week on the telephone, ``At New York
magazine'' _ where he worked before joining Slate in 1996 _ ``I had
to be finished with a story Wednesday morning that would not be
read by people until the next Monday. It was an exercise in
guessing what was going to happen, bluffing, pretending you knew
the results of things you couldn't possibly know.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, he said, ``you're unscoopable. If you have a
good idea, there is no reason not to put it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Slate's editor, Michael Kinsley, lets Weisberg post his
writing unedited. ``He has the car keys,'' Kinsley said. (Weisberg
does have old-media ties as a contributing writer for The New York
Times Magazine.)
</P>
<P>
   This year's political coverage in the online magazines is far
closer to mainstream journalism than Hunter Thompson's manic 1972
work for Rolling Stone or the blaring of talk radio in 1992. Still,
the reader-reaction ``threads'' on the Web sites have talk radio's
visceral feel.
</P>
<P>
   And both Slate and Salon.com have actively tweaked tradition
this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the New Hampshire primary, Slate flouted the media
pact to withhold exit-polling data until the polls closed; its
readers learned of projections of the lopsided win by Sen. John
McCain of Arizona in the Republican primary by 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Salon.com assigned its contributor Dan Savage to the Iowa
caucuses. He posted a piece saying that, while nursing the flu, he
had licked the doorknobs of the campaign headquarters of Gary
Bauer, the conservative Republican candidate, then licked a pen and
presented it to Bauer. Reader reaction reflected the Web's
emotionalism and ambiguity: If the account was a spoof, one person
wrote, ``it is hugely amusing and creative''; if not, he said, ``it
violates my definition of media ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web journalists do take advantage of their medium. Weisberg,
who at 35 is the dean of the lot; Tapper, 30; and the members of
the National Review's staff, who range in age from 25 (Ponnuru) to
31 (Lowry, the editor), all have their articles forwarded by e-mail
to friends, competitors and sources. All use hyperlinks, which
allow them to make a shorthand reference to an issue, then, via
links, send the reader to the appropriate position paper.
</P>
<P>
   Weisberg believes ``the format doesn't have to be as rigid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more spontaneous,'' he said. ``I was someone who never
used the personal pronoun in writing. In the Internet, your being
there is such an important part of your readers' experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As a weekly columnist for MSNBC.com, Howard Fineman, the
Newsweek columnist and political commentator, is getting to know
the Web's horde of impromptu editors. ``My byline is hot-linked,
meaning that as soon as I send my words of wisdom to the world, I
am immediately brought up short by people e-mailing me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponnuru, one of the National Review's on-again, off-again
campaign correspondents, said the medium lends itself to analysis
with attitude; it ``does scramble expectations about what one is
supposed to do and one isn't.'' On Friday, after examining Bush and
McCain's claims and counterclaims in their tax proposals, Ponnuru
and Miller wrote, ``Maybe it's a pointless exercise: McCain knows
that he can wing it and then spin his way out of trouble because
voters aren't thinking about issues. It would be nice if a few
journalists were.''
</P>
<P>
   Such barbs are hardly revolutionary. John Heilemann, who in 1996
was Hotwired.com's campaign correspondent, believes political
coverage on the Web missed its revolutionary moment, because it
transformed from an alien presence to a conventional one so fast.
</P>
<P>
   The moment may have come and gone in 1998, he said. There was no
presidential campaign then, but during the Lewinsky scandal, Matt
Drudge nipped at journalists' flanks, biting off a mixture of
gossip and fact. This time around, Drudge's Web site has been the
dog that did not bark.
</P>
<P>
   Heilemann, who is writing a book on Silicon Valley, said in an
interview, ``So much has happened in the last four years that the
Web doesn't feel avant-garde anymore. We went from the year when it
was off the charts to the year when it was mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to a point. Salon.com's Washington bureau chief, David Weir,
believes that Web-based political journalism has a new emotional
immediacy. And, he said, there is ``an accountability factor _ how
fast your audience can come back to you,'' or check a writer's
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign coverage, he said, shows that ``the whole
relationship between the journalist and the audience is undergoing
a gradual, subtle transformation. But we don't know where it all
leads.''

PACIFIC ISLANDS SEEK CONTROL OF `DOT-COM' DESIGNATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 49 residents of Pitcairn Island, a British
territory in the South Pacific, are proud descendants of the
infamous Bounty mutineers. So perhaps it is fitting that they are
now leading a mutiny of sorts on the Internet _ a rebellion of the
little guys that has already spread to one other Pacific island and
is expected to mushroom among tiny nations and territories
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   What has these mini-polities in a roil is the loss of a dot and
two letters _ the suffixes originally assigned to denote the
territories in Internet domain names.
</P>
<P>
   In Pitcairn's case, its suffix, known as a top-level domain, is
.pn, and it ended up controlled by a British company after Tom
Christian, the great-great-great-grandson of the Bounty's head
mutineer, Fletcher Christian, cut a deal with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Why are these little suffixes such hot properties? Because all
the good names that end in dot-com have been taken. So a customer
that wants, for example, a domain based on the name apple, goes to
one of dozens of renegade registrars around the globe and buys a
domain like apple.pn.
</P>
<P>
   But that practice may be about to end.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a petition signed by all but two of Pitcairn's adult
inhabitants, the U.S. government and the Internet Corp. for
Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, on Friday confiscated .pn
from the registrar company that had been passing it out and gave it
back to the island community.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unprecedented and controversial act, and Icann
officials expect it will be just the first of many showdowns
between early Internet profiteers and small countries and
territories. Because they were late to the Internet and e-commerce,
many of these tiny, often remote places are only now discovering
that the two-letter Internet addresses set aside for them in the
early 1990s have been lost to far-away companies.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Touton, Icann's vice president and general counsel, said
several small countries and territories had already made inquiries
about reclaiming their domains. He said that at its board meeting
in March, Icann, which runs the Internet's address system, expects
to consider a formal proposal to restore to all nations and
territories sovereign control of their domains.
</P>
<P>
   The next big showdown could come from another South Pacific
territory, American Samoa, whose designated country code, .as, is
similar to the English ``Inc.'' in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations that the governor of that island might have several
years ago signed it over to insiders to market at a profit in
Denmark has become a political scandal in Samoa, a cash-strapped
territory with a long history of political corruption.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, American Samoa's Legislature, or Fono, explored the
question of who gave control of .as to a Samoan man now living in
Hawaii and who was behind a partnership with a New York company
that markets it in Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
   Afoa Lutu, director of the island's Legislative Reference
Bureau, said the investigation was started out of concern that the
territory's domain was being sold ``without any benefit to the
territory in times of deep financial trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Dot-as domains are currently available for $45 a year from a New
York company, GDNS. The number already registered is not known, and
GDNS officials could not be reached for comment on Friday. In the
past, however, one source close to the operation referred to it as
a ``nice little business.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcairn's island council first began trying to reclaim its
domain in 1997, after the island realized it was seeing no
financial benefit from Christian's arrangement. The island
currently has just one satellite phone and no e-mail capabilities.
But Icann said the council wanted control of the domain both to
raise money to bring Internet connectivity to its residents and to
build a Web page with information about the island.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there are 246 ``country codes,'' all of which were
created and assigned by Jon Postel, one of the Internet's founders.
The question of whether governments should be able to make
sovereign claims to them has been brewing since the Clinton
administration in 1998 selected Icann to take over international
administration of the domain name system.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Icann's government advisory committee is expected to
deliver its policy recommendations for handling such disputes.
Officials at the Commerce Department, which helped draft the
proposal, said the document was intended to preserve the spirit of
the informal and hard to implement rules that had been followed by
Postel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope,'' said Andrew J. Pincus, general counsel for the
department, ``is that these principles can be used to craft
agreements that facilitate delegation of'' the country codes ``in a
manner that serves the interests of the relevant local community
and reduce conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal will be considered by Icann at its next board
meeting in Cairo on March 7 through 10.
</P>
<P>
   Critics assert that the document goes beyond Postel's informal
rules and gives too much power to governments and to Icann.
</P>
<P>
   ``The document, as I've seen it, is essentially a sop to Icann's
authority,'' said Antony Van Couvering, who works with a coalition
of companies that traffic in country-code domain names and opposes
giving countries sovereignty over their domain names.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in that (document) that talks about due
process for discovering if a domain has been badly managed,'' he
said. ``There's nothing in there that talks about what if it's
badly managed by a government.''
</P>
<P>
   Postel's original guidelines for country codes clearly stated
that to get control of a domain, a registrant had an
``administrative'' partner within the country or territory that
owned the suffix and that ``these designated authorities are
trustees for the delegated domain, and have a duty to serve the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Internet gold rush began, a number of companies
looking to enter the domain name registration business found codes
for islands and small countries that had not yet been assigned,
then found someone in those areas to get the domain for them.
</P>
<P>
   Those contacts were sometimes government officials, and the
agreements were not always just for profit. For example, the
profits from the sale of domains for the Cocos Islands, .cc and
.cs, have financed Internet connections for residents.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, however, the domains were set up with no formal
authorization, sometimes without the knowledge of the communities
in question. Such apparently is the case in American Samoa, where
the domain was claimed in 1997 by a man named Joseph Matua of AS
Domain Registry, whose address is a post office box in Pago Pago.
It is now being marketed by GDNS to companies in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to find out who gave permission or authority to
the private business to market the domain dot-as and what if any
benefits have been received by this private business in the
marketing of this,'' Lutu said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question here,'' he added, ``is what is the government
doing when its top domain is being used by a private company
without input, without policy guidelines _ and what benefits is the
American Samoa government receiving.''

<P>
   LONDON _ Richard Branson was fiddling with one of his new
Virgin-brand mobile telephones in the living room of his Notting
Hill town house here last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to think how it works,'' he said, staring at a
special button on the phone _ a red button, with the Virgin logo.
The button connects customers by voice to operators who also handle
distribution for the Virgin.com Web site. With such a call,
customers can order plane tickets, CD's and an assortment of other
products that Branson usually hawks by nondigital means. After
trying fitfully to explain the red-button function, he finally
conceded that he wasn't sure how it worked, and gave up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of those anti-mobile phone guys before we did Virgin
Mobile,'' he explained, referring to the cellular phone service
that he started in November and that has already signed up 300,000
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Hands-on technical savvy or not, Branson is diving head first
into the digital economy. Call it the dot-comming of the Virgin
Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Branson, the brash, 48-year-old British billionaire who founded
Virgin Atlantic Airways 15 years ago with one jumbo jet plying the
London-New York route, now owns a hodgepodge of more than 200
Virgin-branded businesses. And he intends to turn his
tarmac-and-mortar world into something a bit more virtual.
</P>
<P>
   Having slapped the Virgin logo on planes, trains, soda, vodka,
clothing, movie theaters, music stores, a radio station, a
financial services company and even a wedding coordinator, Branson
means to expand his year-old Virgin.com Web site into a worldwide
e-commerce portal that he hopes will take on some of the qualities
of Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics say he is already too late to the Internet market
and will surely stumble. ``A lot of traditional businesses have
made these kinds of plans and they've never worked out,'' said Noah
Yasskin, an analyst at Jupiter Communications in London.
</P>
<P>
   But Branson sees himself as specially suited for an
entrepreneurial leap onto the Web.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, unlike Amazon.com _ which began as a book
distributor and is now a diversified digital middleman _ the Virgin
Group has many of its own products to sell. That doesn't mean,
though, that Branson plans to hold his Web customers hostage to the
Virgin brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If British Airways is selling better products than Virgin
Atlantic, we'll sell the British Airways product,'' he said. ``If
Fidelity is offering a better financial product than Virgin Direct,
we'll recommend the Fidelity product.''
</P>
<P>
   Branson says he will not get snagged on the sticking point that
has caused other brand-name companies to stumble on their way to
cyberspace _ the fear of cannibalizing the established offline
brands. ``It's a fact of life,'' he said, ``that the Internet will
kill off some of our business and severely damage a lot of
conventional industry.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the matter of management and money, which in
the case of the privately held Virgin Group resides chiefly in one
man: Richard Branson, boss and banker, rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   Having sold 49 percent of his Virgin Atlantic unit to Singapore
Airlines for $965 million right before Christmas, Branson has cash
to burn. And unlike most dot-com's, he notes, his money is real _
not the paper wealth of newly minted Internet stock.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the advantages Branson describes, Virgin is
entering the Internet arena too late to claim the ``first mover''
edge that Web executives like to tout.
</P>
<P>
   Yasskin, the Jupiter analyst, says that most of the major
sectors of the Web are already carved up by companies like Yahoo
and Amazon.com. ``At least in the U.S. market, Virgin will have a
very hard time competing,'' he said, adding that outside the United
States ``Virgin still has a little time to grab some market
share.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Branson maintains that the Virgin brand is so
strong internationally _ the company is already Britain's biggest
advertiser _ that his relatively late Internet move will not hurt
his chances. In fact, he said his timing might present an
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not lost hundreds of millions of pounds on the Net in
the few years the Net was developing,'' he said, a not-so-veiled
reference to companies like Amazon.com that have spent and lost
large amounts of money building their clientele. ``Our approach is
to come on the Net when the amount of people who are logging on to
the Net are considerable, and where we can actually see real
profits reasonably quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks may be self-serving, but for Branson and his
privately held company, it is crucial to quickly turn a profit.
Otherwise, he may find it necessary to relinquish some control over
the Virgin Group by raising money in the public stock market _ in
order to compete for big-time capital with the likes of Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   While he says that an initial public offering is on his mind, he
has no immediate plans for one, predicting that he can break into
the European Internet market without a major cash outlay for a
brand-building campaign. But the U.S. market is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America we're well ahead in the major cities,'' he said,
speaking of Virgin's brand recognition. ``But out in the sticks,
we've still got some way to go. America will be the toughest nut to
crack. We will have to spend big bucks in America.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Unlike many of the Internet pioneers who have paid handsomely to
simply get their name out, Virgin already has dozens of branded
products to help keep its name in the public eye. Branson said, for
example, that he intends to have ``Virgin.com'' painted onto the
sides of his planes in place of the ``No Way BA/AA'' slogan that
has adorned Virgin's fleet since his nemesis, British Airways,
announced an abortive plan for a far-reaching alliance with
American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Without the dot-com money of a publicly traded company, Branson
seeks attention for himself and his company in ways beyond paid
advertising. Virgin generates press releases on an almost daily
basis, and he is not above publicity stunts like the Virgin Mobile
rollout in November. Creating a stir widely chronicled in the
British tabloids, he held a parade of sorts in the West End of
London, riding a float on which he surrounded himself with nude
models talking on Virgin Mobile phones. The slogan for the new
company: ``What you see is what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   He also primes the publicity pump by making himself freely
available for interviews. ``It's cheaper than buying a full-page ad
in The New York Times,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Still, wielding his brand identity against Internet upstarts is
one thing. Taking on one of Europe's fasting-growing communications
powers is another. And that is precisely the collision course he
has set for himself with Virgin Mobile, a joint venture with the
Deutsche Telekom unit One2One. Despite its 300,000 subscribers in
Britain, Virgin Mobile, will be up against the combined 42 million
European subscribers of Vodafone AirTouch and Mannesmann, which
announced plans for the biggest industrial merger ever the week
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Branson predicts that Virgin Mobile will be able to gain ground
on Vodafone when the licensing begins this spring for Britain's
next generation of wireless telephones _ digital devices that are
to combine voice, Internet access and other digital features.
Toward that end, he has put together a group of investors that
include the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and the venture
capitalist George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   But again, Branson may be a bit late, some contend. ``It's going
to take Virgin years to build a network,'' Yasskin said. ``And by
the time they do, they will have missed the huge growth period.
Anyway, the incumbents always have an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Branson nonetheless says that he will be able to compete with
established players like Vodafone. ``There is no reason we can't
offer anything that Vodafone can,'' he said. ``We will by no means
be as big as them, but we will have a slice of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   All of his businesses that have succeeded so far have done so by
carving out a niche in a mainstream industry by emphasizing service
and style _ whether it be Virgin Atlantic, with its interactive
movie and game system in every seat in economy class, or Virgin
Bride, a one-stop shop for weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin's philosophy, Branson said, is to improve upon
established businesses by adding a Virgin-esque sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   With Virgin Mobile, for example, he is taking the unusual step
of giving away an earpiece with a built-in microphone with each of
the company's mobile phones, so users do not have to hold them to
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine got a brain tumor, and before he died we had
dinner and he said his surgeon was convinced that using a mobile
phone may have been a factor,'' Branson said, raising a
product-liability specter that the head of a public company might
be likely to suppress.
</P>
<P>
   And the Virgin Web site will cater to Branson's digital naivete.
``Any jargon that I don't understand'' will be stripped out, he
said. ``I assume that I am representative of the vast majority of
the people out there.''
</P>
<P>
   That thinking may explain why for Branson _ who in the past has
attempted a solo, round-the-world balloon flight and who owns an
island in the Caribbean _ taking his business onto the Internet
does not seem as as much fun as some of his previous endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't excite me in the same way that starting Virgin
Atlantic did,'' he admitted. ``It's because I could deal with
people. And with the Internet, you're one step removed from the
people.''

MICROSOFT FACES SKEPTICAL MARKET WITH WINDOWS 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MENLO PARK, Calif. _ Will the dogs eat the dog food?
</P>
<P>
   It is a way of wondering whether the customers will accept the
product. And among the elite corps of Microsoft programmers who
labor to turn out each new operating system, the dog food aphorism
has become a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   But on the eve of the official release of Windows 2000, the
software giant's first new business-oriented operating system in
four years, PC power users like the venture capitalist Stewart
Alsop must be giving Microsoft Corp. pause.
</P>
<P>
   Last week at his desk on Sand Hill Road above Silicon Valley,
Alsop sat with two portable computers. On one side of his desk was
his old one, still running the crash-prone Windows 95, now a
half-decade old. On the other sat his brand- new Toshiba running
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   As the rain pelted down on the Valley's green foothills, Alsop
puzzled over why his just-out-of-the-box computer was crashing each
time he attempted to change its screen resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Emphatically, he said he had no desire to try to master yet
another operating system any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy,'' Alsop said. ``Computers used to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, in a nutshell, is the chasm Microsoft must cross as it
endeavors to switch business users, large and small, to a new, more
powerful operating system that it says offers a host of benefits,
ranging from added stability for mission-critical business centers
to better power management for battery-hungry laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a growing rumbling among early users and analysts
suggested that Windows 2000 might not be a runaway success. The
company's stock fell nearly 6 percent on Friday, closing at 99
15/16, after a Gartner Group report indicated that a significant
number of existing programs used by large corporations would not be
compatible with Microsoft's new operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, on Thursday night, during a conference call held by
Dell Computer to discuss earnings with analysts, the company's
founder and chairman, Michael S. Dell, threw more cold water on the
Windows 2000 launch, saying Dell did not expect a big boost in the
near future from sales of the new operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see a massive immediate acceleration due to Windows
2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Microsoft has faced a skeptical media and industry
numerous times before, and the company has almost always managed to
outpace expectations.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at a planned gala in San Francisco, Microsoft will
officially introduce what are in fact four different operating
systems aimed at different markets: desktop office users, Internet
and other network server applications, and, four months hence, a
data center version that for the first time will permit Microsoft
to compete in the very high end of the computer business.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 boasts a huge array of advanced features _ the user
document describing the product is 253 pages _ intended to put
Microsoft on an even footing with the Unix operating systems that
dominate corporate back offices.
</P>
<P>
   That market is one that Microsoft has long coveted. Indeed,
during the past three years, Microsoft's new chief executive,
Steven A. Ballmer, has frequently sketched for reporters the
company's strategy for attacking Sun Microsystems, the leading Unix
computer vendor.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has long believed that by riding on a wave of
``commodity'' computer hardware _ the vast Intel-based PC industry
_ it would be able to push its operating systems both up and down
the computer industry food chain.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, it has continuously developed and expanded its
operating systems, from the original MS-DOS, which was quickly
cobbled together for the first IBM PC in the early 1980s, through
Windows 3.0, 95, 98, NT, CE and, now, 2000. Each version was aimed
at a different market.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, the high-end computer market has eluded the
giant.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems was quick to discover the Internet and exploit
its market potential for selling servers and server software, and
Solaris, its version of the Unix operating system, now has an
inside position on most of the nation's largest e-commerce servers.
That has been a significant advantage for Sun, the Mountain View,
Calif., computer maker that was founded to manufacture technical
work stations in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, analysts who are optimistic about Microsoft's
chances at the high end of the computer industry believe that the
software publisher will finally make significant inroads against
its Unix rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows 2000 acceptance will be very, very large,'' predicted
Mark Anderson, a computer industry analyst and president of
Technology Alliance Partners. ``The replacement rate'' of
Unix-based systems, he said, ``will go to four-to-one or better.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring Anderson's optimism is a feature list for Windows
2000 that begins with its ability to handle larger tasks _ in
industry parlance, ``to scale'' _ running on computers based on as
many as 32 processors. Such systems have increasingly replaced
mainframe computers during the past decade and are now used
extensively in corporate computing centers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft's most pressing problem in the new corporate
computing market is that it must convince corporate computing
managers that Windows is an effective alternative to an
increasingly stable and scalable opponent: Linux, the free version
of Unix that has recently begun to gain adherents in corporate
settings.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft counters the free-Linux argument by saying that the
price of an operating system represents only a tiny portion of the
total cost of ownership for a complete computer system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of the software is a rounding error that can't be the
major deciding factor,'' said Jeff Price, group product manager for
Microsoft Windows.
</P>
<P>
   However, some financial analysts say that Linux's inroads will
make it difficult for Microsoft to expand its 38 percent share of
the corporate computer server market as rapidly as it was able to
grow its Windows 95 and Windows 98 consumer markets. And slowing
growth could hurt the larger Microsoft financial machine, which has
operated as a growth engine for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Sun executives say that despite Microsoft's
aggressive advertising, it has not developed a product that can
find the sweet spot of the growing Internet server market.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're out telling the world they're going to burn our house
down, but they don't realize we've moved,'' said Anil Gadre, vice
president and general manager of Sun's Solaris operating system
division.
</P>
<P>
   Sun executives say that Microsoft's assertion that its
32-processor version will match Sun's performance is premature. Not
only will the data-center version of Windows 2000 not appear until
later this year, but Sun is already far more scalable, delivering
clusters of up to eight 128-processor systems.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the battle for the very high end of the
computer industry, Microsoft is planning to spend as much as $200
million to convince corporate America that Windows 2000 is the
right operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But the company does not appear to be playing to a wildly
enthusiastic audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the greatest operating system on a variety of
accounts, but it's good enough,'' said Brian Livingston, co-author
of ``Windows 2000 Secrets'' (IDG Books Worldwide, 2000).
</P>
<P>
   And therein may lie Microsoft's biggest challenge this year:
Convincing computer users like Alsop that ``good enough'' is worth
the time and effort of the upgrade.

NEW AT&AMP;T SYSTEM DISPLAYS A `MILLIONAIRE' BONUS  
 THE DOCTOR IS NOW ONLINE AND TAKING REFERRALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There sure are a lot of people who want to be a millionaire
these days.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday in Bedminster, N.J., AT&AMP;T held a grand opening for
its new $90 million network operations center _ mission control for
one of the world's most complex communications webs.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders, or at least members of the media, are rarely invited
to peek behind AT&AMP;T's veil. So dozens of reporters showed up to ooh
and aah at the cavernous hall's complex-looking computer displays.
</P>
<P>
   But the most striking aspect of the event was only tangentially
related to AT&AMP;T _ although it was yet another testament to the
dominant television program at the moment, ABC's ``Who Wants to be
a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   On a wall screen, a computer displayed the number of current
business calls, compared with a chart for the previous Thursday,
Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The older chart showed a typical pattern, with a high volume of
calls during the day trailing off steeply into the evening. But the
graph showed a spectacular spike at 10 p.m., at the TV program's
conclusion, representing hundreds of thousands of calls to the
toll-free line for would-be contestants _ and untold revenue for
``our friends at AT&AMP;T,'' as the show's host, Regis Philbin, would
put it.
</P>
<P>
   _ SETH SCHIESEL
</P>
<P>
   The Doctor Is Now Online, and He's Taking Referrals
</P>
<P>
   Forget toasters and airline miles _ and privacy, for that
matter. In what could be a first in Internet marketing, a new Web
site devoted to discussing sex and relationships is giving away
condoms to anyone who registers, and yet more condoms for referring
friends to the site.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion is all part of the rollout of drDrew.com, an
online spinoff of the popular nighttime TV talk show and radio
program ``Loveline,'' starring Dr. Drew Pinsky, a 41-year-old
physician.
</P>
<P>
   Like the broadcast programs, the site is aimed at teen-agers and
young adults who are trying to sort out the issues of sex,
relationships and dating.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might be reluctant, of course, to give their own
names and e-mail addresses to a company distributing condoms. And
many other people might not want friends and colleagues to give out
theirs, either. But in fact, friends-and-family referrals are a
goal of the promotion; each referral that results in a registration
will yield another condom for the person who passed along the name
and address.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Sinclair, vice president of marketing for drDrew.com, said
the company was simply trying to promote safe sex, as well as
attract attention to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Although the registration form for the condoms asks for the
person's name, address, e-mail address, gender and age, the company
said it would use the street addresses only for mailing the condoms
and would not add those addresses to its database. Registered
members will receive drDrew.com's online newsletter and periodic
e-mails about future events.
</P>
<P>
   Members of drDrew.com can get advice on sex and sexual health
from Dr. Pinsky, as well as chat with other members, attend online
forums with celebrities and read features like ``Get a Life, Then
Get a Man'' or a how-to on preparing aphrodisiacs.
</P>
<P>
   Through the promotion, the Los Angeles-based company will send
out a three-pack of condoms, labeled with drDrew.com's logo, to
anybody who registers for the site or who has already registered.
The site's promoters plan to give away a million condoms through
the site, as well as on college campuses and at bars and nightclubs
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But be forewarned: One must be at least 16 years old to receive
the condoms; anyone younger than 16 who registers for the site will
receive drDrew.com stickers instead.

&HT;     TRIGGER-HAPPY COPS OR JUST SCARED? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN LYNCH  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It was seven or eight years ago. I was one of
three newspaper executives in a car on the way to inspect a new
office in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   We were two middle-aged guys in suits and ties and a woman in
stylish business attire. The car was upscale. I was riding shotgun
in the passenger seat as we pulled off a superhighway _ and as the
driver took us through a stop sign.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, a lot of people blew by that stop sign. A couple of
New York State Police cruisers were parked just beyond it. The
troopers motioned us over. One of them, a woman, stuck her head
inside the driver's side window.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just went through a stop sign,'' she told the driver.
``Let's see your license and registration.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver reached over and opened the glove compartment. The
door to the thing fell down and smacked me in the knees. I told the
driver, ``Let me get out of your way here.'' I opened the passenger
door, and stood up.
</P>
<P>
   And almost got shot.
</P>
<P>
   The trooper immediately slapped her hand on the butt of her gun.
``Get back in the car!'' she shouted shrilly.
</P>
<P>
   Startled, I glanced at this woman over the car roof. What I saw
on her face was an expression of sheer panic. She was a smallish,
dark-haired woman in her late 20s. And, if she was frightened of
me, which she clearly was, I can assure you that I was a hell of a
lot more frightened of her. She was the one with the gun, after
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, ma'am,'' I said, and slid ver-r-r-ry slowly back into
that passenger seat.
</P>
<P>
   I made it a point to get her name from her tag. Afterward, I
spoke to a friend in the State Police about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, car stops can be dangerous,'' he explained. ``I know
her. She's young, and she got skittish. With a crew of well-dressed
people in a nice car in broad daylight, she should have kept cool,
but she's new on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   I've never forgotten that incident. I hadn't realized until then
just how jumpy cops can be. The other day, as I watched Officer
Sean Carroll testify on Court TV defending himself against a murder
charge in a case where he and three other New York City cops blew
away an unarmed man, that incident with the young trooper was
dancing in my brain.
</P>
<P>
   Quite clearly, Amadou Diallo shouldn't have reached for his
wallet when the cops told him not to move. Quite clearly, I
shouldn't have gotten out of that car that day. But if I'd taken a
bullet beside that road for doing that, I suspect I would have been
seriously annoyed. If I'd taken 19 bullets, as Diallo did, I would
expect the legal system to be seriously annoyed on my behalf.
</P>
<P>
   I've been watching this testimony, day after day, and I still
don't know what to make of it. Were those cops jumpy when they
approached Diallo, a young West African immigrant living in the
Bronx? Well, 30 New York City police officers have been gunned down
since 1990. The cops had ample reason to be jumpy _ especially at
night in a high-crime neighborhood and with a guy who wasn't
showing them his hands as they say they ordered him to do. And when
he reached into his pocket for what turned out to be a wallet, and
when one of the cops thought it was a gun Diallo had in his hand,
then whammo!
</P>
<P>
   Whatever comes out of this trial, though, we'd all better hope
it includes an intensely sharper awareness on the part of police
officers that theirs are not the only lives on the line in
situations like this.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us also should realize that any contact with a
police officer on the street or the highway can end up as more than

   LATHAM, N.Y. _ For career goals, Pete Weber looks no further
than his family. The son of a Professional Bowlers Association Hall
of Famer wants to win as many titles as his dad.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Weber drew one step closer.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of the third-seeded position, Weber won two matches
Saturday to capture his 25th PBA title, the Parker Bohn III Empire
State Open at the Bowlers Club in Latham. One more and he will
equal the total of his father, Dick, who is tied for fourth on the
all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't have Dad having more than me,'' said Weber, who is
from St. Ann, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   One of Dick Weber's 26 titles came 40 years ago at the Empire
State Open. That was before Pete or Bohn _ whose name was attached
to the tournament this year _ were born.
</P>
<P>
   The first-place check in 1960 was $2,500, out of a $16,500
purse. Weber, 37, received a $15,000 winner's share from a total
prize fund of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just nice to win,'' Weber said. ``I won the Showboat 33
years after Dad won it, and made 10 times what he made for
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber defeated tournament leader Brian Himmler of Cincinnati
209-198 in the title match. Weber needed to convert a 3-6-10 spare
in the 10th frame to clinch to victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the spare to be shooting for a title,'' said Weber,
who missed the same leave in the third frame against Himmler. ``A
double (two consecutive strikes) is easier to throw than a 3-6-10
spare.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber threw hard and straight at the spare _ he tried to hook
the ball on his earlier conversion attempt _ to get the necessary
pins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never doubt that I can win,'' Weber said after earning his
first victory since Feb. 21, 1998. ``If you doubt that you're going
to win, then it's time to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Himmler, on the strength of two doubles, had the lead through
eight frames. He could have closed out Weber with strikes in the
9th and 10th frames, but he left a 2-10 split, which he missed. Had
he struck out in the 10th, Himmler would have forced Weber to
strike.
</P>
<P>
   A pesky 10-pin followed by a 6-count on his fill ball made
Weber's task easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the match right in my hands until I gave it to him in
the 9th and 10th,'' said Himmler, who won $8,000. ``I have no
excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber advanced to the title game with a 236 in the semifinals to
eliminate Ryan Shafer (212) and Jason Hurd (209), who won the first
two matches.
</P>
<P>
   Weber needed a 9-count on his first ball in the 10th to close
out Shafer, but he nearly blew it. Weber's shot crossed the pocket,
but he left only the 7-pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking nine,'' Weber said. ``Even a ringing 10(-pin)
would look good. I didn't quite get it out far enough. It hooked
enough to get Brooklyn and get nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Shafer, the tour's leading money winner, failed to strike in his
first five frames, but a triple gave him a chance heading into the
ninth, where he left a 10-pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave it a run,'' said Shafer, who took third place, ``but I
started too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurd, a 6-foot, 250-pound right-hander from Visalia, Calif., was
the story of the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening match, Hurd (232) used a late five-bagger to
dispose of Jeff Lizzi of Sandusky, Ohio (202), and Steve Wilson of
Lake Worth, Fla. (198).
</P>
<P>
   Lizzi, who doubled in the 10th frame Friday night, could have
advanced with two strikes, but he left a pocket 7-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got up and told myself to throw a good shot, that I've got a
chance to win the match,'' Lizzi said. ``I threw it good, got a bad
break. I'm a little disappointed, but I'm happy about the way I
threw it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second match, Hurd (256) threw 10 of 12 strikes to get
past Brian Voss (234) of Atlanta and Rick Steelsmith (188) of
Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd had a chance to catch Weber in the semifinals, but a 3-6
leave in the ninth frame sealed his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ninth frame was the only bad ball I threw, and I knew it
as soon as I threw it,'' Hurd said. ``With the two guys (to bowl
against), there really isn't an area to make a bad shot. It's so
hard to beat two other guys out here, especially when you've been
bowling good all week to make the show.''

 &HT;    HIGH-TECH GORE IS A FUND-RAISING FLOP IN SILICON VALLEY
 &HT;    380&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ His supporters say he would be ``the E-president,''
but in the latest lap of the race for Silicon Valley's campaign
contributions, Al Gore ran dead last.
</P>
<P>
   A computer analysis of Federal Election Commission records shows
that in the last quarter of 1999, Bill Bradley led his Democratic
opponent in that high-tech battleground, and the Republican
presidential candidates as well.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator raised $108,225 from the Silicon
Valley's 25 cities, while Gov. George W. Bush of Texas collected
$48,208 and Sen. John McCain of Arizona raised $42,906. Gore, who
brags about his role in developing the Internet, trailed with
$35,415.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1999, Bradley also came in first. He raised $617,475,
compared to $574,476 for Bush and $302,095 for Gore. McCain's
records for the first quarter were not available by computer, but
he had raised only $84,696 since April.
</P>
<P>
   At Gore's national headquarters in Nashville, his staff denied
that the gap may reflect a problem in Gore's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects Bradley's emphasis on raising money and spending
on TV advertisements,'' said Doug Hattaway, Gore's spokesman.
``We've obviously been raising money,'' but Gore has concentrated
on meeting voters and pressing the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley has always been a big campaign fund raiser and a big
spender,'' added Hattaway. ``So it's not surprising that he has
raised so much money in this campaign and in Silicon Valley. He
outspent us in New Hampshire by quite a bit and we presume he'll
continue doing the same in the primaries to come, including
California.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is a sitting vice president,'' responded Judie Wong,
Bradley's California press secretary, ``and he's been doing his
share of fund raising as well. I think that Bill Bradley is very
appealing to people in the Silicon Valley because they believe he
is the strongest candidate on the issues that are of concern to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   She said what Silicon Valley people like most about Bradley's is
his ``understanding of the interactions between the private sector
and public sector in growing our economy'' and his ``blueprint for
education.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The analysis of Silicon Valley contributions shows that the
fund-raising gap between the two Democrats con has widened
over time. During the first three months of 1999, Gore was ahead.
He fell behind during the second quarter, but by year's end Bradley
was raising three times as much money.
</P>
<P>
   That resembles the picture nationwide, where Gore leapt to an
early lead, only to see Bradley close the gap by raising twice as
much money in the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The occupations of last fall's donors suggest that Bradley, who
taught at Stanford University between 1997 and 1998, is more
attractive to high-tech donors. Half of Gore's Silicon Valley
donors who declared their occupation were retirees or homemakers,
and only 3 percent were CEOs or company presidents. For Bradley, 9
percent of donors were CEOs and only 29 percent were not in the
labor force.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one contributor suggested that people in the
Silicon Valley look beyond bits and bytes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All candidates have been very careful to express policy that
are desired by people here in the valley,'' said Thomas Heller, a
professor at the Stanford University Institute for International
Studies who contributed $500 to Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``My choice has more to do with his expertise in foreign policy
and my sense that he would make an excellent president because of
his ability to manage complex staff,'' Heller said of Bradley.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco does not want its pavement to be
striped with colored skid marks from a new type of tire being
promoted by the French tiremaker Michelin.
</P>
<P>
   Though a company executive appeared before a committee of the
governing Board of Supervisors to try to dispel opposition to the
colored treads, the supervisors decided to stick to a plan to ban
the sale of the tires in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Scorcher'' tires come with stripes of red, blue or yellow
rubber embedded in the black. A promotional video distributed by
the company showed cars leaving colored skid marks on an asphalt
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Mabel Teng, who sponsored the ordinance that would
ban the sales, said she was concerned that such publicity would
encourage young drivers to burn rubber as a kind of graffiti, and
that products named ``raging red'' and ``blazing blue'' could be
taken up by youth gangs, who already use red or blue to mark
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Police Capt. Greg Suhr echoed her fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graffiti is a concern,'' he said, ``but I'd be more concerned
there would be an act of violence, like a drive-by (shooting). The
cost would be far greater than the cost of cleaning up the skid
mark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee feels very strongly about public safety and
protecting the children of San Francisco and all the drivers of San
Francisco,'' Teng told Michelin Vice President James Morton.
</P>
<P>
   Morton said wanted to work out a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not promoting reckless driving, but we do believe young
people will be some of our best customers,'' he said. ``The market
for these tires is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton said the company had agreed to clean up skid marks in San
Francisco and set up toll-free number for a year which people could
use to report marking incidents. He also said the company was
willing to produce tires in any color a customer requested to take
the emphasis off the red and blue tires.
</P>
<P>
   Michelin also has declined to change the name of the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the word 'scorcher' is an invitation to kids to drive
dangerously,'' said Supervisor Sue Bierman. ``It means you whirl
the car in a certain way to scorch the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee sent the legislation that would ban the sale of
the tires to the full board, recommending that it be approved. It
will be heard on March 6. Eight of the city's 11 supervisors have
already signed on in support.

<P>
   Water-skiing is great fun _ but it's not such a blast for the
person who has to drive the boat. So while many may welcome the
launch next month of a riderless jet ski that can tow a solo
water-skier, safety campaigners in the United States are already
raising concerns about the potential hazards of such a system. Jet
skis, they reason, can be dangerous enough if not used carefully _
so one that travels well ahead of its ``driver'' may be even more
of a hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful enough to pull even a barefoot skier out of the water,
the Solo jet ski from Solo Water Sports of Redmond, Wash., is
controlled by the skier through a keypad in the tow handle. But
with no one actually riding the vehicle, the skier may not have a
clear view of obstacles in the water ahead, such as swimmers, small
boats or perhaps a diver's flag.
</P>
<P>
   Solo Water Sports insists its system is safe, but Jim Saxton,
Republican congressman for New Jersey, is not convinced. ``I have
strong reservations about an unmanned craft traveling in and around
public beaches and environmentally sensitive areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Saxton is already addressing the noise and disturbance issue
surrounding jet skis. A number of states have introduced ``no
wake'' zones to limit the speed of the craft, but Saxton is
attempting to introduce legislation to apply this nationally,
imposing a speed limit of 5 miles per hour in sensitive areas _ and
with a $10 million enforcement budget.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Sells, co-developer of the Solo, welcomes this move,
insisting that the machine will attract ``a different type of
person.'' ``Skiers aren't after wake, they want a nice flat
surface,'' he says. Indeed, this is half the reason for developing
Solo because, he says, the flattest, undisturbed water is usually
found early in the morning _ too early to drag someone else out of
bed just to haul you around the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Controlling it becomes second nature,'' says Sells, who adds
that visibility is exceptional because the tow cord is shorter than
normal, and there are a number of built-in safety features. If the
skier loses control and takes a fall, a cord attached to their
lifejacket is pulled out, tripping a switch that shuts off the
engine. Future models will use radar to cut the engine when an
obstacle is detected, he says.
</P>
<P>
   But jet ski groups are not keen on the new technology. Stephan
Andranian, government affairs manager with the International Jet
Sports Boating Association in Orange County, Calif., says that
without a rider the Solo doesn't count as a jet ski or ``personal
watercraft,'' as they call it. But he doesn't doubt that the public
will see things differently. ``If they have problems with safety,
it probably will reflect on personal watercraft users,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Solo is powered by a 70 horsepower, two-stroke jet ski
engine, and has similar capabilities. Despite the fact that Solo's
emissions are within the guidelines of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, the pressure group Friends of the Earth is
unimpressed: ``This vehicle looks like a jet ski, pollutes like a
jet ski and the safe operation of this vehicle is dubious like a
jet ski,'' says Erich Pica of the FoE branch in Washington D.C. He
finds it difficult to imagine somebody responsibly controlling the
craft from more than 10 meters behind it. &QL;

<P>
   Water-skiing is great fun _ but it's not such a blast for the
person who has to drive the boat. So while many may welcome the
launch next month of a riderless jet ski that can tow a solo
water-skier, safety campaigners in the United States are already
raising concerns about the potential hazards of such a system. Jet
skis, they reason, can be dangerous enough if not used carefully _
so one that travels well ahead of its ``driver'' may be even more
of a hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful enough to pull even a barefoot skier out of the water,
the Solo jet ski from Solo Water Sports of Redmond, Wash., is
controlled by the skier through a keypad in the tow handle. But
with no one actually riding the vehicle, the skier may not have a
clear view of obstacles in the water ahead, such as swimmers, small
boats or perhaps a diver's flag.
</P>
<P>
   Solo Water Sports insists its system is safe, but Jim Saxton,
Republican congressman for New Jersey, is not convinced. ``I have
strong reservations about an unmanned craft traveling in and around
public beaches and environmentally sensitive areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Saxton is already addressing the noise and disturbance issue
surrounding jet skis. A number of states have introduced ``no
wake'' zones to limit the speed of the craft, but Saxton is
attempting to introduce legislation to apply this nationally,
imposing a speed limit of 5 miles per hour in sensitive areas _ and
with a $10 million enforcement budget.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Sells, co-developer of the Solo, welcomes this move,
insisting that the machine will attract ``a different type of
person.'' ``Skiers aren't after wake, they want a nice flat
surface,'' he says. Indeed, this is half the reason for developing
Solo because, he says, the flattest, undisturbed water is usually
found early in the morning _ too early to drag someone else out of
bed just to haul you around the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Controlling it becomes second nature,'' says Sells, who adds
that visibility is exceptional because the tow cord is shorter than
normal, and there are a number of built-in safety features. If the
skier loses control and takes a fall, a cord attached to their
lifejacket is pulled out, tripping a switch that shuts off the
engine. Future models will use radar to cut the engine when an
obstacle is detected, he says.
</P>
<P>
   But jet ski groups are not keen on the new technology. Stephan
Andranian, government affairs manager with the International Jet
Sports Boating Association in Orange County, Calif., says that
without a rider the Solo doesn't count as a jet ski or ``personal
watercraft,'' as they call it. But he doesn't doubt that the public
will see things differently. ``If they have problems with safety,
it probably will reflect on personal watercraft users,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Solo is powered by a 70 horsepower, two-stroke jet ski
engine, and has similar capabilities. Despite the fact that Solo's
emissions are within the guidelines of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, the pressure group Friends of the Earth is
unimpressed: ``This vehicle looks like a jet ski, pollutes like a
jet ski and the safe operation of this vehicle is dubious like a
jet ski,'' says Erich Pica of the FoE branch in Washington D.C. He
finds it difficult to imagine somebody responsibly controlling the
craft from more than 10 meters behind it. &QL;

 THIS STORY ALSO MOVING IN THE ``L'' CATEGORY 
 RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``COLORS OF THE MOUNTAIN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Da Chen (Random House, $25)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is that rarity in these times, a truly marvelous book. Da
Chen was born in 1962, in a tiny town in southern China, and his
memoir begins with his childhood stories of life during the
Cultural Revolution. Chen's grandfather had been a wealthy
landlord, reason enough to incur relentless mistreatment for him
and his family (he lived with Chen's parents and their five
children), as well as the loss of their house, land and most
possessions. Food was scarce, humiliation was waiting around every
corner, and the future seemed without promise. And yet, the view
through young Chen's eyes is remarkably cheerful, made so by his
curiosity and pugnacity and by his parents' enduring dignity in the
face of their dreadfully altered lives. This big-hearted and
sometimes even humorous story is written in simple, evocative
prose, and it ends as Chen leaves for college in Beijing. It's a
moving moment, but not the book's first _ we were misty before we
got past the dedication. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE BRETHREN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John Grisham (Doubleday, $27.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to mock a rich man, but we must give Grisham credit:
He doesn't take the advance and run. His new novel is inventive and
unpredictable, and very different from any of his previous books.
It focuses on three judges who are incarcerated in a
minimum-security prison for sins ranging from tax evasion to
driving drunkenly over two hikers in Yellowstone. In jail, they
preside over a ``court'' in which inmates file grievances against
each other (witnesses are expected to lie, and verdicts are quick
and without appeal). The judges also run a mail scheme in which
they pose as young, nubile inmates, bait wealthy men on the
outside, then blackmail them for the gay sex talk in their letters.
Trouble brews when they target Aaron Lake, U.S. congressman from
Arizona and the presidential candidate backed by the powerful
director of the CIA. Everyone's sleazy here, and the efforts at
damage control are complex and entertaining. When this one lands on
the bestseller lists, the honor will be deserved.  &QL; 
 &UR; ``MATCH WITS WITH MENSA'' &QL; 
 &UR; (Perseus, $19.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We have found our omnipotence, and it is in vocabulary _ we will
stomp all challengers into the ground. It was the only subject in
this book at which we showed any prowess, but thank God there was
something. The editors say they have assembled more than 800
puzzles. We were struck by the inordinate amount of yakking that
precedes them. You must wade through much discussion of a category
_ trivia, analogies, logic etc. _ and a sometimes lengthy list of
acknowledgments before you get to the tests themselves, which makes
us think that Mensa members need rest between bouts of mental
exertion. We were also struck by how much Mensa members _ to be
one, you must score in the top two percent of the population on any
standard intelligence test _ like to look at themselves in the
mental mirror. But we digress. Here is what the editors consider to
be a ``warm-up'' trivia question: ``Domenikos Theotocopoulus is
better known as who?'' The answer is El Greco, the painter. We
looked it up.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE WHITE DEATH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By McKay Jenkins (Random House, $23.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins calls John McPhee his mentor, and you can see McPhee's
influence in the way Jenkins comes at his subject _ avalanches _
from all sides. His main path is the story of five young climbers
who died in an avalanche on Mount Cleveland in Montana's Glacier
National Park in 1969. He mixes the personal stories of those young
men with fascinating information about snow, mountains, rescues and
survival. He shows us how terrifying it is to be caught under snow,
not knowing which way is up (the only way to tell, he says, is to
spit _ whichever way it falls, you should dig, if you can move, in
the opposite direction), how you increase your chances for survival
if you remember to shut your mouth (many victims are found with
their mouths full of snow), how your chances plummet if you are not
rescued within minutes. Dogs have found people alive in 15 feet of
snow, sniffing them out by their individual scents. Each living
person smells different, Jenkins says. All corpses smell the same.

<P>
   The millennium bug was not a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 ``significant'' failures were caused by the
rollover from 1999 to 2000 in January alone, says the consultancy
KPMG.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the faults were trivial, a number were
potentially serious, including reported failures in nuclear power
plants and blackouts on military spy satellite processing systems.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Y2K faults are still emerging, and could reach a
peak over the next few months with the occurrence of the leap year
and the end of the financial year.
</P>
<P>
   Banks warn that Feb. 29 is likely to trigger more problems than
the New Year's Eve rollover, because some calendar software failed
to notice that _ unusually for a ``00'' year _ this is a leap year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.K., a survey by the Office of National Statistics
found that 5 percent of companies reported some sort of adverse
impact on computer systems arising from the year change,'' said
Malcolm Marshall, KPMG's information risk management partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in the U.S., a survey of IT professionals found a quarter
had experienced some sort of Y2K problem since the New Year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even computer manufacturers were not immune to the problem,
which prompted many organizations to invest millions of pounds to
protect their computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Apple, in a Stock Exchange announcement, said that in January it
had ``experienced a limited number of minor malfunctions in its
information technology (IT) systems as the result of the date
change,'' despite spending $10 million preparing against such
problems. Those mostly affected its manufacturing operations.
</P>
<P>
   David Walton, of the British Y2K Community Action Network _ some
of whose members forecast that the millennium bug would spell
disaster for civilization _ said: ``I would say that I was
pleasantly surprised by how little disruption there was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did see a lot of low-impact bugs, which was interesting _
it suggests that the high-impact ones were identified and dealt
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walton works as an IT consultant and was so worried about
the potential for collapse that on New Year's Eve he had a
generator ready to kick in if the electricity supply failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was all so safe, why did the (British) Government have a
Millennium Center with 200 staff? You have to ask yourself what
they knew about what might happen that they didn't tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysis by KPMG noted that ``the experience so far seems to
be that problems are being rapidly dealt with once they become
apparent.'' Of the recorded incidents, 67 were in the first week of
the year and 23 came later.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, companies are still discovering problems with their
systems caused by the shift to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organizations needs to remain vigilant around the key dates of
the leap year and the end of months,'' said Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Among the incidents recorded by KPMG were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Seven U.S. nuclear plants had ``minor problems.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Two Japanese nuclear plants had ``failures.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pentagon was unable to process spy satellite data for a
number of hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ France's military satellites ``lost'' data.
</P>
<P>
   _ A kidney machine in Scotland failed during routine running.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cash and credit cards issued by American banks would not
validate.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the U.S., Medicare payments were disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hundreds of Web sites displayed the date as ``January 1,
1900'' due to misprogramming; almost as many displayed it as
``January 1, 19100.''
</P>
<P>
   _ U.K. Register Office reported dates of birth as 20200.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Kremlin Press Agency was unable to send out e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   _ Traffic lights in Jamaica failed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Port traffic software in Uganda displayed wrong dates.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 50 minor problems at six major Japanese electronics
firms.
</P>
<P>
   _ Customer records at a foreign bank in Japan deleted.
</P>
<P>
   _ A customer returning a rented videotape was charged $91,000
for being 100 years late. &QL;

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
 ALSO MOVING IN THE ``A'' CATEGORY 
 RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A DAPTING WILSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kagan denies it, the Conservative Moralists are
indebted to the idealism of Woodrow Wilson. One part of Wilsonian
thought was to convince the world of the superiority of democracy,
and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and
Kristol. All the members of the realist school acknowledge that
democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the
entire planet to democracy. For this camp, the proper end of
American diplomacy is the preservation of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and like-minded policymakers are realists in the sense
that they see the world as made up of competing, self-interested
nations. For them, diplomacy is a jungle. In the spirit of Ronald
Reagan, this group is skeptical about international organizations,
although they see their usefulness. They also draw a line in the
sand between internationalism and the preservation of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Realism is a doctrine that favors unilateral action
to defend the national self-interest of the United States. It
doubts the effectiveness of multilateral action _ for example, the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which is widely acknowledged
to be a failure. The members of this school argue that the
multinational United Nations never has demonstrated its ability to
efficiently carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Straight and elegant, her mind as sharp as a quarterback in a
fourth-and-one-situation, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations under Ronald Reagan and now a professor at
Georgetown University and senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, disagrees with the Kagan-Kristol School. A strong voice
within the conservative movement, Kirkpatrick doubts that democracy
can be spread through interventionist methods.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN'S WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan, whom I admired as a great president,''
Kirkpatrick said, ``understood the sanctity of national
independence. The U.N. is a useful tool. All international
organizations are useful tools. I am not opposed to the U.N. But
one principle that Reagan stood by, and that I stand by, is that
the U.S. must never surrender its sovereignty or national
self-interests to any international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy agenda of the Republican Party is made up of
both Conservative Moralists and Realists. Gov. George W. Bush
himself stands squarely in the faction of Conservative Realism.
Many members of the realist school, including Condoleezza (EDITORS:
CORRECT) Rice, Elliot Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz
(EDITORS: CORRECT) (all of whom held high foreign policy positions
in either the Reagan or Bush administrations), are currently
advisers to the present Bush presidential campaign. John McCain is
also a Conservative Realist, and one of his foreign policy advisers
is Henry Kissinger. Neither the Conservative Moralists nor Realists
are isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Establishment also fields a team within the 20036
ZIP-code playing field, and the expertise of the Brookings
Institute is certainly playoff quality. Although it is primarily a
research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

&HT;     MICROSOFT CHIEF PITCHES NEW WINDOWS SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VANESSA HUA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The president of the Microsoft Corp. is playing
a boisterous pitchman for Windows 2000, the new business operating
system that goes on sale Thursday amid less than rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows 2000 is the PC at its very best,'' Steven A. Ballmer,
the president and chief executive of Microsoft, told the
Commonwealth Club of California on Tuesday. He said the software,
the latest version of Windows NT, enables corporate and small
business users to take advantage of electronic commerce and
Internet opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 cost the Redmond, Wash., software giant more than
$1 billion to develop and release _ a year after its target date.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most impressive thing is the way it opens up computers to
the next realm,'' Ballmer, 43, who took the helm of the company
last month from his Harvard University friend, Bill Gates. Gates,
who remains the company's chairman, stepped down to become chief
software architect.
</P>
<P>
   Flashier events to launch Windows 2000 include a concert with
musician Carlos Santana and actor Cheech Marin on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Much is at stake with Windows 2000, which is a vital element in
Microsoft's strategy to remain relevant in the post-PC, Internet
age, industry watchers said. Yet Microsoft's shares tumbled almost
6 percent Friday, to $99.94, on analyst reports of potential
Windows 2000 software compatibility problems in computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has to hitch its wagon to the big star _ the
Internet,'' said Mark Specker, a managing director at Wit
SoundView, a San Francisco technology investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   The embattled software developer is engaged in a bitter legal
fight with the Department of Justice and 19 state attorneys
general. In a finding of fact last November, a federal judge stated
that Microsoft abused its power to create a monopoly, but it still
is yet to be determined whether those actions were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   At the Commonwealth Club, Ballmer declined to discuss the
potential court-ordered breakup of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any discussion of this is beyond irresponsible and
premature,'' Ballmer said. ``We'd like to settle the lawsuit, and
get this behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer also said that despite the attacks that temporarily
crippled several major Internet sites last week, the government
should not increase its regulatory role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Private industry will come up with the solutions,'' Ballmer
said. ``Technology will provide the defense.''

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
 ALSO MOVING IN THE ``K'' CATEGORY 
 RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>

and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and

democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the

   Armed with the latest in high-powered cameras, two
plane-spotters have blown a hole through the U.S.'s strictest
security and revealed detailed shots of the legendary Area 51.
</P>
<P>
   In case you've been abducted by aliens, ``The X Files'' is a
cult American TV series majoring in the paranormal. And Area 51 is
an ``above top secret'' base featuring in many of its storylines.
</P>
<P>
   So secree base that the U.S. government denies its
existence. But unlike ``The X Files,'' Area 51 is real.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures have provoked a red-hot reaction on the Internet
from aficionados of all things spooky. The base has given birth to
a legion of Area 51 enthusiasts embracing ufologists, conspiracy
geeks, plane-spotters and the plain mad.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it is the site of germ and biological warfare tests,
citing reports that workers from the base have died of strange skin
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that the remains of nine UFO crashes are kept there,
and rumors abound that it is home to the U.S. government's very own
flying-saucer program.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that Area 51 is a secret military facility
about 90 miles north of Las Vegas, hidden in the three-million-acre
Nellis Bombing and Gunnery Range.
</P>
<P>
   It was the site selected for the testing of the then-top-secret
U-2 spyplane in the mid-1950s. The U-2's successor, the SR-71
``Blackbird,'' and the F-117 stealth fighter, are both said to have
made their test flights there.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that the 4,000-mph Aurora spyplane is there have recently
been strengthened with a photo showing a large delta-winged
aircraft at the base.
</P>
<P>
   And sightings of ``UFOs'' are so frequent along the highway that
it has been redesignated ``Extraterrestrial Highway'' by the State
of Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Area 51 is certainly suitable for a hypersonic aircraft, as it
has one of the longest runways in the world which, at six miles,
could land three space shuttles at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are not welcome. The perimeter is patrolled by armed
guards in Jeeps and helicopters. Signs warn to keep out of
restricted areas and state that ``the use of deadly force is
authorized.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the only part of the U.S. that cannot by law be
photographed from the air. But the power of modern camera
technology has made a nonsense of such distinctions, as has the
enthusiasm of the base-watchers and spyplane enthusiasts drawn to
the dry Groom Lake bed where the base is situated.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pair of these ``Groomies'' who took the latest pictures
from a mountaintop 12 miles away _ having first evaded the base
security patrols.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cooper of Aircraft Illustrated, the first magazine to
obtain the prints, said: ``These panoramic shots are by far the
most revealing done of the base so far.'' &QL;

 RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``COLORS OF THE MOUNTAIN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Da Chen (Random House, $25)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is that rarity in these times, a truly marvelous book. Da
Chen was born in 1962, in a tiny town in southern China, and his
memoir begins with his childhood stories of life during the
Cultural Revolution. Chen's grandfather had been a wealthy
landlord, reason enough to incur relentless mistreatment for him
and his family (he lived with Chen's parents and their five
children), as well as the loss of their house, land and most
possessions. Food was scarce, humiliation was waiting around every
corner, and the future seemed without promise. And yet, the view
through young Chen's eyes is remarkably cheerful, made so by his
curiosity and pugnacity and by his parents' enduring dignity in the
face of their dreadfully altered lives. This big-hearted and
sometimes even humorous story is written in simple, evocative
prose, and it ends as Chen leaves for college in Beijing. It's a
moving moment, but not the book's first _ we were misty before we
got past the dedication. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE BRETHREN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John Grisham (Doubleday, $27.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to mock a rich man, but we must give Grisham credit:
He doesn't take the advance and run. His new novel is inventive and
unpredictable, and very different from any of his previous books.
It focuses on three judges who are incarcerated in a
minimum-security prison for sins ranging from tax evasion to
driving drunkenly over two hikers in Yellowstone. In jail, they
preside over a ``court'' in which inmates file grievances against
each other (witnesses are expected to lie, and verdicts are quick
and without appeal). The judges also run a mail scheme in which
they pose as young, nubile inmates, bait wealthy men on the
outside, then blackmail them for the gay sex talk in their letters.
Trouble brews when they target Aaron Lake, U.S. congressman from
Arizona and the presidential candidate backed by the powerful
director of the CIA. Everyone's sleazy here, and the efforts at
damage control are complex and entertaining. When this one lands on
the bestseller lists, the honor will be deserved.  &QL; 
 &UR; ``MATCH WITS WITH MENSA'' &QL; 
 &UR; (Perseus, $19.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We have found our omnipotence, and it is in vocabulary _ we will
stomp all challengers into the ground. It was the only subject in
this book at which we showed any prowess, but thank God there was
something. The editors say they have assembled more than 800
puzzles. We were struck by the inordinate amount of yakking that
precedes them. You must wade through much discussion of a category
_ trivia, analogies, logic etc. _ and a sometimes lengthy list of
acknowledgments before you get to the tests themselves, which makes
us think that Mensa members need rest between bouts of mental
exertion. We were also struck by how much Mensa members _ to be
one, you must score in the top two percent of the population on any
standard intelligence test _ like to look at themselves in the
mental mirror. But we digress. Here is what the editors consider to
be a ``warm-up'' trivia question: ``Domenikos Theotocopoulus is
better known as who?'' The answer is El Greco, the painter. We
looked it up.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE WHITE DEATH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By McKay Jenkins (Random House, $23.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins calls John McPhee his mentor, and you can see McPhee's
influence in the way Jenkins comes at his subject _ avalanches _
from all sides. His main path is the story of five young climbers
who died in an avalanche on Mount Cleveland in Montana's Glacier
National Park in 1969. He mixes the personal stories of those young
men with fascinating information about snow, mountains, rescues and
survival. He shows us how terrifying it is to be caught under snow,
not knowing which way is up (the only way to tell, he says, is to
spit _ whichever way it falls, you should dig, if you can move, in
the opposite direction), how you increase your chances for survival
if you remember to shut your mouth (many victims are found with
their mouths full of snow), how your chances plummet if you are not
rescued within minutes. Dogs have found people alive in 15 feet of
snow, sniffing them out by their individual scents. Each living
person smells different, Jenkins says. All corpses smell the same.

 By MARY DEJEVSKY  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The lady may not bake cookies, but she tosses a
``mean'' salad and can even fry a ``great'' omelette _ just so
long, of course, as no eggs get broken.
</P>
<P>
   Such, it seems, are the minimum qualifications for a woman
seeking public office in equal-opportunity America at the start of
the 21st century. Ask Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   When Hillary Clinton _ sorry, Hillary Rodham Clinton _ was first
approached to run for the Senate, it looked a mad and ill-advised
idea, but you could understand the temptation and had to admire her
chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   She may have been flattered into running and she was taking a
risk, but America likes a risk-taker _ and we women wished her God
Speed.
</P>
<P>
   Never having had a Margaret Thatcher, U.S. lawmakers could do
with a Hillary Clinton to shake their all too complacent
congressional chamber out of its torpor.
</P>
<P>
   If past performance is the measure, there is no doubt that in
Senator Clinton, the people of New York would have a tough, feisty
and intelligent woman standing up for their interests.
</P>
<P>
   A passionate political speaker in her student days, she can
still command a hall. A lawyer respected by her fellow
professionals in her mid-years, she has lost none of her sharpness.
</P>
<P>
   Now one of the most popular first ladies on record, she has
travelled the world and overcome the most personal and political of
travails (Monica, impeachment and the Whitewater non-scandal) to
emerge forthright and strong.
</P>
<P>
   Who could forget her televised tour de force of loyalty and
political savvy when she defended her husband against the
``right-wing conspiracy'' in the early days of the Monica
allegations?
</P>
<P>
   It mattered not that she was, as it turned out, misguided in her
loyalty, and probably wrong in her charge of conspiracy. She was
dignified and magnificent. She had saved her husband's career
before, and her own, and would do so again.
</P>
<P>
   Half a year later, she was privately humiliated, but publicly
stoical, and hailed as a heroine across the land for doing exactly
what she had pledged not to do: stand by her man like some Tammy
Wynette.
</P>
<P>
   Small rebellions had attended her advance: that ``Rodham'' she
kept in her name, even in conservative Arkansas; those pantsuits
she settled on as her business attire; her solo travels abroad, and
now that move from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Most memorable, perhaps, was her retort, eight years ago, as the
then-presidential candidate's wife, that she had better things to
do as a professional woman than bake cookies.
</P>
<P>
   What a smashing of taboos was there; what a shock to cloistered
suburbia. She was Senate material even then.
</P>
<P>
   That Hillary, though, must have slipped out of the back door of
her new home in Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who stood in her three-quarter raincoat and sensible
shoes by the front gate on moving day was but a caricature.
</P>
<P>
   House-proud and pert, with conversation all of belongings and
shopping, this woman was no Senator-in-waiting. She had to be an
impostor.
</P>
<P>
   The substitution, to be sure, was gradual and stealthy. When the
tabloids told us that she had visited a renowned plastic surgeon
last summer, we did not want to believe it. Hillary Clinton would
not be so vain as to be diverted from her serious work by a few
facial wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   With or without the knife _ the best surgeons keep you guessing
_ she has changed: a new face, new makeup, new hair _ and a new
rack of pantsuits.
</P>
<P>
   It all shouts ``young,'' but ``young,'' alas, as all others look
young: a standardized, Stepford candidate.
</P>
<P>
   When the woman who called herself Hillary _ no more Rodham, no
more Clinton _ finally made her Senate run official this month, the
substitution was complete.
</P>
<P>
   Who would elect a senator called Hillary? She wore oversized
pearls too crude even for her remade features. She spoke in the
singsong tones and false emphases of today's political
voice-trainers, and she pointed and jabbed with her hands, just as
the male politicians are taught to do.
</P>
<P>
   And if her style has been clipped, so have her causes. Where is
the woman who told Americans to their face that their lack of a
national health system was a disgrace to a civilized nation and she
wanted to do something about it?
</P>
<P>
   Where is the woman who embarrassed the Administration by
speaking out for a Palestinian state, because she believed it
inevitable, and right?
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's all schools and women and children: all very laudable
and all very safe.
</P>
<P>
   The old Hillary was a lifelong left-winger with a streak of
idealism; the new one calls herself a ``new Democrat,'' just like
her husband, and steers none too deftly the middle course between
government as the problem and as the solution.
</P>
<P>
   She has turned tough on crime and supports the death penalty.
And she is learning how to say nothing of consequence. She will not
even commit herself to sending that small Cuban boy back to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, Hillary, you don't need the Florida vote, your husband
can't run for another term; you are not the vice president's
keeper. Just imagine that child was Chelsea and tell us what you
would do.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary, Hillary _ have you really let the consultants remake
you? Do you really believe that New Yorkers will prefer a
well-meaning suburban housewife to the independent woman you were?
</P>
<P>
   And if they did _ which would only confirm the lamentable
conformism of America's women _ is that the sort of senator you
would want to be? &QL;

   Although Israeli planes bombed three Lebanese power stations
last week after guerrillas killed six occupation soldiers, western
press and television reports almost unanimously portrayed the
latest violence in Lebanon as a war by Israel in defense of its
civilians on the other side of the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no Israeli civilians were targeted, let alone hurt, and
all the Israeli soldiers who died were inside their occupation zone
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists based in the Middle East say that Israeli diplomats
have mounted a letter-writing campaign to their editors _
especially in the United States _ in an attempt to explain away the
latest war as a response to ``terrorism'' while failing to mention
that the Israeli casualties occurred in Lebanon, not in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   On the BBC, Moshe Fogel, Israel's official spokesman, tried to
justify the Israeli raids on Lebanon's power stations _ a clear
breach of the April 1996 cease-fire agreement _ on the grounds that
``Hezbollah terrorists are attacking our soldiers and civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   But no Israeli civilians had been attacked in the violence
leading to the air raids and Fogel failed to mention that the
soldiers to whom he referred had been killed in their military
positions inside southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The only civilians to be wounded were Lebanese, 17 of whom were
hurt in the Israeli bombings.
</P>
<P>
   But subsequent BBC World Service news reports frequently
referred to ``the killing of six Israeli soldiers'' without
mentioning that they had died in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   An American academic who writes regularly on the Middle East
telephoned the Independent's Beirut office last week to ask if
electricity stations had actually been targeted by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you realize we are just not hearing about this?'' she
asked. ``All we're getting on television here in the States is
Israel's line about `terrorism' and how their civilians are being
forced to live in shelters.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Israelis living on their northern border were ordered
into bunkers by their own government. On this occasion, the
Hezbollah did not fire a single rocket over the border.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the coverage was a report in The Washington Post
whose Jerusalem correspondent referred in an article to what he
called ``Israel's two-decade-old intervention in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from being an ``intervention' _ ironically, this was the
very word the Soviet Union used when it invaded Afghanistan in 1980
_ Israel has twice invaded Lebanon and has occupied part of it in
violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   In The Independent's ``Right of Reply'' column last Friday, the
Israeli ambassador to Britain, Dror Zeigerman, also attempted to
justify the Israeli raids on the grounds of ``terrorist activities
against Israel across the border'' and failed to mention that the
six Israeli soldiers were killed in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Hezbollah attacks were launched from ``civilian
villages'' and were ``a flagrant violation of previous
understandings.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several of the Israeli dead were killed by roadside
bombs primed and exploded inside Israel's own occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, Timur Goksel, the special adviser to the United
Nations force commander in southern Lebanon, stated publicly that
the Hezbollah ``has not really violated the April (1996) accords.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.N., the Hezbollah has carried out 300 attacks
on Israeli occupation troops in December, 250 in January and at
least 60 so far this month.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the Hezbollah has fired Katyusha rockets across the
Lebanese-Israeli border _ but almost always in retaliation for the
Israeli wounding of Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 cease-fire accord states that the guerrillas and
Israeli troops may assault each other's forces inside Lebanon but
must not attack civilian targets or use civilians as cover.
</P>
<P>
   In all the reporting of last week's violence in southern
Lebanon, no mention was made of the 1,000-strong force Israel keeps
in the occupied zone or of the notorious Khiam jail there in which
_ as Amnesty International and other human-rights groups have
protested _ men and women prisoners are routinely tortured with
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was asked to
comment on the war, she contented herself with a reference to the
Hezbollah as ``enemies of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in Israel, it seems, are there journalists brave enough to
tell the truth about southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most eloquent is the novelist David Grossman who wrote
in Yedioth Aharonoth that Israel should ``evacuate the outposts,
bring the soldiers home'' and redeploy across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go. Learn to live with the insult, swallow the empty pride,
stop feeding the fire of our lingering, pitiful arrogance with more
and more of our young soldiers. We have lost. It's OK to say it
aloud, no ne dies from saying it....''
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't have found an American reporter daring to say that
last week. &QL;

EX-LAWYER UNDERGOES A TRIAL BY FIRE IN RACING WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ He grew up in Boston, a hockey and
baseball fan who played both sports at St. Sebastian's, where he
now serves on the board of directors. After a stint in the Army, he
studied business at Georgetown, then law at Boston College before
joining the Boston firm of Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky and
Popeo, becoming a partner in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped practicing law about 20 years ago,'' said Jack
Birmingham as he and his wife, Karen, relaxed in the luxurious
motor coach of their NASCAR Winston Cup team at the paddock area of
Daytona International Speedway. ``I practiced trial law in Boston
and bought a business and realized that I couldn't do both. I went
into business and wound up owning Steinway and Sons. I sold it and
sat on the beach, looking for something to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he decided to do something that appealed to his
competitive nature.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to go racing. In the ultra-competitive Winston Cup
series, no less. But he learned, as many wealthy car owners do,
that the best way to make a small fortune is to take a large
fortune and go racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a couple of false starts before, but it was just
something we wanted to do and we decided to go after it,'' said
Birmingham, 58, whose interest in motorsports was piqued when he
began watching races on television. ``It took us more than a year
and half to get to the point where Chuck Rider was willing to sell
his team to us.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rider agreed to sell Bahari Racing to Birmingham last July
for an estimated $5 million-$6 million, it marked the birth of the
Eel River Racing team, named after the Cape Cod waterway that
flowed near the Birminghams' summer home in Osterville.
</P>
<P>
   The Eel River outfit shifted into high gear when Birmingham
enlisted veteran crew chief Barry Dodson as a minority owner.
Dodson, in turn, hired Jeff Fuller, a former Modified champ from
Auburn, Mass., to campaign their No. 27 Pontiac Grand Prix as the
replacement for former Bahari driver Derrike Cope.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually a pretty weird situation,'' said Fuller, who got
an early start in racing at age 15 driving late models and
modifieds at Westborough Speedway. ``I didn't really know Jack
Birmingham, the owner, when this deal was put together. When they
called for me to come over and meet with him, knowing that he was
from Massachusetts, I mean, that was just a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the news last December that Eel River Racing had
landed a primary sponsor: Viagra, the wonder drug produced by the
pharmaceutical firm Pfizer used primarily to treat erectile
dysfunction. At the press conference announcing the sponsorship,
members of the media snickered.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first heard about it, everybody had the same response
about this and that,'' said Fuller. ``But the serious side of the
situation is that men don't get checked. They're going to be
providing a trailer at every Winston Cup event for the fans, so the
guys can actually come down and get checked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early detection is a key factor. If the trailer is able to
screen 30,000-40,000 people this year, then they'll feel they've
done a good job, so it's a win-win situation for both NASCAR and
Pfizer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I decided that I wanted to get involved and it would be
possible to do it, I spent a lot of time talking with a bunch of
different guys to see if it was doable,'' Birmingham said. ``There
was certainly some risk in it, but it was doable. But when you're
not a celebrity, you can only attract a sponsor by putting together
a good team and that's what we've tried to do.''
</P>
<P>
   With Dodson their steward, Birmingham and Fuller will be intent
on earning their stripes as rookie owner and driver when they
jockey with NASCAR's elite for a starting spot in Sunday's Daytona
500.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got in racing, my goal was modifieds,'' said
Fuller, 42, who won the 1992 NASCAR Featherlite Modified Series
championship. ``I've had a lot of races up there (in New England)
and made a lot of friends and I miss the modifieds, but ultimately
when you make it to the modifieds, you look at making another step.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started in '95 and did the Busch Series, I was hoping
that after two or three years that this (NASCAR ride) would be the
next step I'd take. It did take five years, but I'm not
disappointed with that. I think it might even be a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've obviously got a super opportunity with Barry Dodson. He
won a championship with Rusty Wallace and he knows these race cars,
so hopefully he can speed up my learning curve a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they struggled during pole qualifications Saturday, the
Eel River team got some encouragement Monday when Fuller made
significant gains in a practice session with a hot lap of 191.526
miles per hour. But before anyone could celebrate, the team was a
severe blow when their primary car was totaled in a crash caused by
Greg Sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller, who had just returned to the track for another drafting
session, was sent hurtling toward the wall and his car burst into
flames, but Fuller escaped with nothing more than a sore neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heartbreaking,'' said Dodson, who is scrambling to
prepare Fuller's backup car for Thursday's Twin 125-mile
qualifiers. ``We put 90 percent of our effort into this one car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get the backup car out there and go through the same
motions. It's kind of a Russian roulette until that last practice
is over before Thursday, but we're just going to calm down and try
to do everything right on this car, and then race our way in.''
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham seemed prepared for a bump or two like this when he
came aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's very democratic about it is that you go out
on the starting line, put your foot on the gas, and if you come in
first, everyone will be cheering for you,'' he said. ``It's a
competitive struggle, and so we're off.''

of the far-right Austrian Freedom Party, Joerg Haider. But the

HARRIS WILL TAKE A RUN AT IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Since it happened for the St. Louis Rams
with Kurt Warner, NFL teams are now wondering whether players can
virtually drop to them from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? It makes for a great story. And it's cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will bring in a few second-tier running backs in
the next week or two and hope one or two pans out.
</P>
<P>
   You never know, right? Just ask the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   One player they've already locked in to a two-year
minimum-salary deal is Raymont Harris, the former Chicago Bear and
Green Bay Packer who has one 1,000-yard season on his resume. The
Patriots are hoping he can be the surprise of their team after
missing the entire 1999 season while recuperating from a fractured
right leg.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 29, was never a great back but is certainly a tough,
rugged, tackle-to-tackle runner. Two years ago, he fractured his
left fibula and tore ligaments in his leg. When he tried out for
the Patriots before last season, he wasn't quite ready. Nobody
called him after that.
</P>
<P>
   Harris spent the year working with Ohio State strength and
conditioning coach Dave Kennedy and Seattle holdout wide receiver
Joey Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's in top condition again, and it didn't hurt that
Harris has the same agent as Patriots coach Bill Belichick (Neil
Cornrich). It also didn't hurt that Harris was familiar with
Patriots receivers coach Ivan Fears, who was receivers coach in
Chicago when Harris was there and played a part in devising the
running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's starting over in the Patriots organization,'' said
Harris. ``It's just like me. I'll be starting over, so it'll be an
ideal situation for me. I'm getting a chance to be a lead running
back for a team that's very solid. That's all I could ask from
anybody, to get the opportunity to be a starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris was a fourth-round pick of the Bears in 1994. He rushed
for 1,033 yards in 1997, scoring 10 touchdowns. Besides missing
last season, he also missed 1995 with a broken collarbone sustained
in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he's out to show people ``that I'm not brittle or
soft. I've just had some tough breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have come back and I could have played well wherever I
went and helped somebody's club. I think if I would have come back
last year, I would have played, but I wouldn't have been 100
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he will leave Kennedy and join the Patriots'
conditioning program in late March. The Patriots tried to hire
Kennedy, but so far he's turned them down. Harris has seen Andy
Katzenmoyer and Terry Glenn working out at Ohio State this winter.
</P>
<P>
   At 228 pounds, Harris said he's right at his playing weight. He
has a lot of pent-up energy he hopes to let out on the gridiron
soon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Having lost Shawn Jefferson, and with Troy Brown unsigned, the
Patriots have expressed interest in Bears free agent receiver Bobby
Engram. They're also looking at defensive linemen, such as
Pittsburgh's Nolan Harrison, former Dolphin Shane Burton, and
former Jet Anthony Pleasant . . . Steve Israel will visit the
Bengals next Wednesday. Former Patriot cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock
also is due in Cincinnati soon . . . The Patriots may part ways
with middle linebacker Marty Moore, who is an unrestricted free
agent.

of the far-right Austrian Freedom Party, Joerg Haider. But the
Jewish family that was forced to sell the ``Valley of the Bears''
on the eve of WWII, in a murky transaction involving Haider's
relatives and blocked bank accounts, says the sale was illegal and

<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea came to Jeremiah T. Doyle while shopping for groceries.
Many e-commerce Web sites take business away from brick-and-mortar
retailers, but why wasn't there a way for small, local merchants to
use the Internet to fight back?
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Doyle recently launched Eversave.com in Woburn,
Mass., one of many commercial Web sites seeking to put a new
Internet twist on some old marketing ideas and loyalty programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to link the Internet to Main Street,'' said Doyle, 34,
a direct-marketer by trade. ``We want to use the Web to drive foot
traffic to brick-and-mortar stores.''
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, Eversave.com aims to be a free service about
online coupons, comparison shopping, and saving time. First,
consumers would check prices and bargains at the Web site. Then
they would head out to Main Street to make their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In an ideal scenario, Eversave.com hopes to create a shopping
experience that combines the best of the online and off-line
worlds. Its Web site would supply valuable information, and
brick-and-mortar retailers would provide service, product, and a
chance for consumers to see and touch what they're buying.
</P>
<P>
   To small merchants, Eversave.com positions itself both as an
Internet strategy to compete with retail Web sites and as a
marketing tool, a sort of online Yellow Pages where they buy ads.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers often consult the Yellow Pages before making a
purchase; the hope is that many consumers will regard Eversave.com
in the same way, as a go-to shopping resource.
</P>
<P>
   If Eversave.com borrows some ideas from the Yellow Pages, it
also may be reminiscent of the old-fashioned, loyalty-card programs
used by everyone from Star Market to public TV stations. Even The
Boston Globe once tried a loyalty card.
</P>
<P>
   Just as with those programs, consumers who choose to apply for
an Eversave.com card qualify for discounts at participating
merchants, though Web site visitors can skip the card and simply
print out online coupons. What's in it for the merchants? They get
to learn more and more about a consumer's shopping habits.
</P>
<P>
   Eversave.com is hardly the only Internet company using coupons
to lure eyeballs to its Web site. There are CoolSavings.com and
MySavings.com, just to name two.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of players out there, but they're not all
playing the same way,'' said Melissa Shore, an analyst with Jupiter
Communications, an Internet research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because they both see the small Main Street merchants as
their best customers, Eversave.com caught the eye of TransWestern
Publishing, a regional Yellow Pages company whose biggest investor
is Thomas H. Lee Partners, the Boston buyout firm. Last month, the
two announced a strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership with TransWestern may help Eversave.com meet one
of its biggest challenges. In getting started, this kind of Web
site faces a chicken-or-egg dilemma. The big question: Which comes
first? The merchants or the consumers?
</P>
<P>
   To persuade consumers to join the network, the Web site must
offer them discounts from many merchants. But merchants won't agree
to offer the discounts _ or pay to advertise on the network's Web
site _ unless they're convinced many consumers will be visiting the
site on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Such sites are ``dependent on getting a critical mass, both of
consumers and merchants,'' said Jill Frankle, director of
e-commerce retail research at Gomez Advisors of Lincoln, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 650 merchants have agreed to place ads on
Eversave.com, though many were enticed by a free trial offer.
</P>
<P>
   With only 25 employees, Eversave.com needed more personnel to
recruit more merchants to use its marketing services. Now
TransWestern's sales force will help with that task as it
approaches merchants with package deals on buying ad space both in
regional Yellow Pages and on Eversave.com's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   As Doyle sees it, Eversave.com solves a problem for
TransWestern; one drawback to buying space in a Yellow Pages is
that a merchant is stuck with one ad for a whole year.
</P>
<P>
   For merchants, the beauty of advertising on the Web is that ads
can be regularly updated, Doyle said. Merchants can offer seasonal
specials or discounts on slow-moving merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   What's made the Yellow Pages successful is that it exposes a
small merchant's products to consumers ``at the precise moment when
consumers are ready to buy,'' said TransWestern chairman Larry
Bloch; now Eversave.com can extend this strategy online.
</P>
<P>
   TransWestern isn't the only one Eversave.com has turned to as it
looks to build an online network that connects merchants and
customers. Eversave.com has formed a strategic alliance with Pan
Pacific Retail Properties Inc., a West Coast mall operator, and it
has entered a partnership agreement with the Magma Group, a Boston
firm that specializes in marketing to college students.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Eversave.com said it has persuaded 85,000 consumers to
join its online discount program. To date, it says it has attracted
nearly $5 million in venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   Why should a consumer choose Eversave.com over rival coupon
sites? Doyle offers several reasons. For openers, Eversave.com can
link consumers to local services such as chimney sweeps or roof
repairs, as well as products.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the ``Product &AMP; Price Finder.'' Using this feature,
consumers can e-mail Eversave.com with such requests as: ``I need
to find a private dining room for my husband's 50th birthday party.
Who can do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Using the consumer's zip code to narrow the search, Eversave.com
forwards those requests by e-mail to nearby restaurants, but
without the consumer's e-mail address to protect the consumer's
privacy, Doyle said. Over the next few days, merchants e-mail
responses to Eversave.com, which relays them to the consumer. The
consumer then decides which merchants, if any, to contact.
</P>
<P>
   Though consumers need disclose only an e-mail address and zip
code to qualify for discounts, they're invited to fill out a
``personal profile'' and apply for a membership card.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Eversave.com hopes to learn more and more about an
individual's shopping habits. Eversave.com can then use this
information to help merchants target their online ads.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a consumer who has bought golf clubs with an
Eversave.com coupon or card may see different banner ads when he
visits Eversave.com's Web site than a consumer who bought flowers
will see.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers also have the option to allow Eversave.com to e-mail
them special alerts on merchant promotions. A golfer, for example,
might opt to be alerted about sales on putters.

funny, richly descriptive book called ``The Orchid Thief'' about a
subculture of obsessed collectors. It becomes a surprise
best-seller, is optioned by movie director Jonathan Demme _ and
embroils Orlean in an orchid war with those who feel she has goofed
on their sacred calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a certain number of people who flogged me
mercilessly for errors,'' says Orlean. ``These are people who
pedigree their houseplants, so it didn't come as a surprise to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   One of these people is Ned Nash of the American Orchid Society,
who is thanked in the acknowledgments for fact checking the book
but has demanded that his name be removed.
</P>
<P>
   It's still there. ``I'm leaving him in just to irritate him,''
says Orlean, a former columnist for the Boston Globe Magazine and
the Boston Phoenix, interviewed at the Harvard Museum of Natural
History, where she spoke earlier this month in connection with an
exhibition on orchids.
</P>
<P>
   She also has no patience with orchidists who complain that the
flower on the book's cover is upside down: ``I tell people it's a
bird's-eye view.''
</P>
<P>
   Iconoclastic John Laroche, the orchid thief of the title, is
unperturbed, however. He despises the AOS establishment that shuns
him. ``Susan didn't start out critical of the orchid
establishment,'' he says. ``I told her they were lunatics. She
said, no, they're just plant collectors. But after her interviews
with them she said I was right.''
</P>
<P>
   His opinion of Orlean's work? ``I didn't care if the book was
any good,'' he says. ``I don't care if the movie's any good.''
</P>
<P>
   What Laroche does care about is that he just sold the story
rights to his life to Tri-Star, which is planning to make the
movie. He says he's getting $200,000, and more if the movie's a
hit. ``They told me, `You can never sell your life again.' I think
that's a good catch phrase: You can only sell your life once!''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is going to have to invent a plot because nothing much
happens in the book. The actual trial ends quickly and
undramatically with a few hundred dollars in fines. Laroche is
barred from reentering the swamp, which confines his outings with
Orlean to orchid nurseries and shows until the last chapter. When
he finally takes her into the Fakahatchee swamp anyway in search of
rare ghost orchids like those he stole, they fail to find one in
bloom. They get lost. They find their way back to their car. The
book ends.
</P>
<P>
   Orlean pads this slender narrative into 284 pages that include
lively chapters on the history of orchid hunting, fraudulent
Florida land deals, and the Seminole Indians, emphasizing bizarre
details such as the disposition of 19th-century chief Osceola's
severed head.
</P>
<P>
   She also hangs out with members of the American Orchid Society
and orchid nurserymen, frequently making droll fun of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Orchid Thief'' is ``a color piece in the grand old
tradition of people from New York coming to points south and
finding a bunch of gargoylish characters that they can portray in
an amusing light,'' says orchid grower Martin Motes by telephone
from his nursery, Motes Orchids, in Homestead, Fla. He describes
himself as ``one of the minor gargoyles on the cathedral.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many members of the American Orchid Society, which moved
its headquarters from Cambridge, Mass. to West Palm Beach, Fla.
about 15 years ago, hate the book, Motes, like most readers, thinks
it's a hoot. But he also says Orlean rearranges chronology and
colors details to make him sound like a ``hick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Susan was not wanton with the truth, but accuracy was not
necessarily what she was looking for. She's in love with being able
to conjure a scene,'' says Motes, who disputes seven items in the
eight-page section that describes his nursery.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, his greenhouses are state-of-the-art, not
``slightly seedy,'' he says, and his doberman-rottweiller and
yellow lab are not ``mud-colored.'' When one of them bites Orlean,
it is on her ``fourth or fifth visit,'' he says, but the incident
is written to sound like it occurs during their first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are there are ``sixty thousand orchid species,'' as Orlean
writes. ``Nobody knows, and so there are all kinds of wild
estimates, but 30,000 is the top end figure,'' says Motes.
</P>
<P>
   The peculiar thing is that this numerical error has been widely
pointed out and Orlean says ``we changed it in the hard cover.''
But it's still there in the new paperback edition from Ballantine
Books.
</P>
<P>
   Motes calls the upside down orchid on the book cover ``classic
bad taste, whether it matters out there in the world of books. It's
not a very good flower, either, horror of horrors!'' He laughs
again, his voice warm with southern charm. ``A very common
phalaenopsis, your basic Kmart orchid.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from New York, the book's editor
Jonathan Karp at Random House, explains the inverted orchid on the
cover matter-of-factly: ``It looked better that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Karp calls Orlean ``the heir to John McFee'' and ``a cross
between Lucille Ball, Brenda Starr and Dorothy Parker.'' He says,
``She'll spend hours on a paragraph until it sounds just right.
</P>
<P>
   She'll even tromp through a swamp.
</P>
<P>
   Laroche recalls their foray. ``Susan was petrified,'' he says.
``She's naturally pale, but she had no color at all. She's a short
girl. Water up to my hips is water up to her chest. And there's
things swimming in there.'' Like alligators and poisonous water
snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Orlean says she assumed such expeditions would utilize ``a swamp
buggy or something.'' When the awful truth ``slowly dawned'' on
her, she almost wept.
</P>
<P>
   However, Orlean jokes, a wade through the Fakahatchee looks easy
compared to giving shape to her mass of notes. ``It was more of a
swamp than the swamp,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But all the slogging through word and water is paying off more
handsomely than stealing orchids ever could.
</P>
<P>
   Orlean has read one script for the movie and says it is
``wild.'' When it comes to films, no one even bothers to think
about accuracy, though Laroche's contract promises not to depict
him as a drug addict and a few other things. Other than that, the
sky (or the swamp) is the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Though Orlean describes their relationship as ``grudgingly
affectionate'' and absolutely not romantic, their constant sparring
provides much of the humour of the book. Yet if the movie does get
made, some are already speculating that Orlean's and Laroche's
characters (a diminuative, redheaded and feisty Holly Hunter? An
exasperating, roguish George Clooney?) will probably be swept by
mutual passions beyond orchids.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll end up in each other's arms in the primordial swamp,''
Motes laughs. ``The New York girl loses her patina of
sophistication.''
</P>
<P>
   Would he see this as the triumph of the Southern gargoyles?
``Yes! Absolutely.''

AUSTRALIAN SWIM STAR IAN THORPE HAS HIS OWN STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Take an articulate 6-foot-4-inch 17-year-old
with size 17 feet and a gracious manner, and ratchet up the
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Pin on him the hopes and expectations of his entire country,
which is the host for this year's Olympic games. Give him special
handlers who ensure his food and drink can't be tampered with by
enemies who might try to taint him with illegal substances, and
insulate him from an ever-growing, ever-insistant crush of the
media. A boy in a bubble.
</P>
<P>
   What you get is Ian Thorpe, a young man trying to balance life
as a ``typical'' Australian teenager with his status as a national
treasure. The ``Golden Goose,'' as he is called.
</P>
<P>
   The way Aussies see it, when the Summer Games come to Sydney in
September, Thorpe is not just their hope to win multiple medals,
not just the point man to reclaim Australia's past swimming
glories; he may well be the biggest Australian story of the Games,
and the comparisons with Mark Spitz are already coming thick and
fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a chance to be another Michael Johnson,'' says John
Devitt, 1956 Olympic gold medal swimmer and now vice president of
the Australian Olympic Committee, referring to Johnson's role as
the dominant athlete for the host team at the Games 1996 Games in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It could all make for a happy story, except for the cloud of
controversy, suspicion, accusation, national jealousies, and
paranoia hanging over this sandyblond, 190-pound heir-apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Just back from two weeks of World Cup swimming in Germany,
Thorpe appeared Monday at a packed press conference in Sydney, one
of the last he will face before his managers take him into a kind
of splendid isolation (``so he can concentrate on what he has to
do,'' says Devitt) in the five months leading to the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding his chances, it would seem he won't have to do much
more than he has been doing. Thorpe has dominated the last two
years of international swimming. He holds four world records _ 200-
and 400-meter freestyle, the 4X200-meter freestyle (long course),
and the 200-meter freestyle (short course) _ and has twice been
named World Swimmer of the Year by US Swimming World Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the German experience two weeks ago was an indication of the
bitter pressures that come with being a world champion, whether or
not one is ready for them.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 5, Thorpe's World Cup performance in Berlin was
questioned by German coach Manfred Theismann, who said other
swimmers were skeptical of the record-breaking time he posted.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe was one of five Australian swimmers given a random drug
test after the races, but Australian coach Don Talbot threatened to
withdraw his team at that point, complaining that Thorpe and others
had not been provided with tamperproof containers for the urine
test.
</P>
<P>
   The US, whose backstroker, Lenny Krayzelburg, also set a world
mark, joined with the Australians in complaining that the urine
samples could easily be popped open and manipulated. Talbot
threatened to pull his team from Sunday's World Cup races, and in
the face of the boycott, Berlin police finally agreed to seal the
samples.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot had said he would in no way leave urine samples in Berlin
that could be manipulated, especially since the controversy had
been sparked by allegations from a German coach.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe feels he rose to the test and overcame the negative. He
was so angry he considered withdrawing from Sunday's race; then he
felt ``sad'' about people passing rumors of his cheating; and
finally, he decided ``it was pretty humorous.'' He went out Sunday
and sped across Berlin's Europasportpark to shatter his own his own
200-meter freestyle record by more than a second.
</P>
<P>
   The hearty applause from some 2,000 fans gave his spirits a
lift. ``I've never gotten so much applause after a competition,''
said Thorpe. ``That moved me deeply. It shows me that people are
behind me and believe in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the faulty drug-testing procedures used in Berlin,
Thorpe's record may fail to be ratified, but without sounding
chippy, the teen sensation says it would not bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't concern me if I lose that particular time,'' Thorpe
said at Monday's press briefing. ``Everyone knows I performed that
time and I did it without assistance. I should be able to perform
it again.'' Devitt added that he saw no reason why the new record
would go forward with FINA, the sport's governing body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed Europe,'' said Thorpe. ``But I learned a lot on this
trip that you're not always able to compete the way you'd like to,
that you sometimes have to compete under some pretty extreme
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I learned a lot about myself and about Australian swimming
and the support I have from the nation. That really did startle me
at the time, because I could pretty much feel the whole nation get
behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thorpe and the Australia swim team have their eyes on much
bigger prizes than a European World Cup. To the end that nothing
goes wrong that could damage his career between now and the Games,
Thorpe will be under the constant watchful eye of manager David
Flaskas who has assigned three assistants to give virtually
full-time security to Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe says he will no longer eat out at restaurants or accept
any food or drink whose origins he is not aware of. While he calls
the precautions ``paranoia,'' many swimmers and other top athletes
have talked about the possible spiking of food and water bottles
with banned substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big concern is when he goes out to dinner and to movies
with the guys from the pool,'' says Ian's sister, Christiana. Ian
asks to open all the cans and bottles he drinks himself, and will
send them back if they've been opened. At the pool, he has to be
sure to pick up his own water bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear is about the many banned substances that could show up
in drug testing. When he left a Berlin hotel last week feeling
sick, Thorpe says he was afraid to buy from a pharmacy what looked
like a familiar medicine because, packaged in another country, it
may have contained banned substances.
</P>
<P>
   Paranoid? Perhaps. But understandable after the German issue,
which he believes may have been concocted to throw him off his
swimming pace. Thorpe has come to believe that an athlete at his
level, with so much to lose, can never be too careful.
</P>
<P>
   English team officials, he points out, warned their athletes to
lock up their food supplements after tests revealed the presence of
the steroid nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me very paranoid about everything,'' said Thorpe. ``I
can go to restaurants, but who is to say someone won't spike
something.''
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, Thorpe eats ``99 percent of my meals at home.''
Margaret, his mother, makes sure all the food is fresh and
well-washed, that packaged food is well-sealed.
</P>
<P>
   According to Flaskas and other swimmers on the team, there have
been several recent cases in which athletes have blamed positive
drug test results in tampering of water bottles, food supplements,
and even tooth paste. Says Australian sprinter Matt Shirvington,
Thorpe's experience in Germany has increased his own fears of being
victimized. ``It's so easy for someone to do it,'' he says, ``but
so hard for us to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   Former gold medalist Duncan Armstrong said Thorpe was now in
good hands with his managers and coaches but probably has ``been
targeted since he was 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Australian swimming is just so professional these days they
will not let anything happen to him,'' says Armstrong. ``Ian Thorpe
is our golden goose. He could win three or four golds.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as manager David Flaskas says: ``Ian is a 17-year-old kid,
and he has to have a little life. He is only a young man. There's a
very fine line between giving him enough space and keeping an eye
on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorp, who says that he goes out with his friends just as he
chooses, ``like any normal teenager,'' is far from reckless. He
thinks about everything he eats _ almost all of his snacks being
fresh fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   As for the issue of drug testing, Thorpe says, ``I don't think
the drug issue has been resolved at all. And until blood testing
comes in and a strict procedure in place, these things will
continue to happen, either to me or to some other swimmer. We
really need to enforce the testing procedure in order to protect
all those innocent swimmers out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday is yesterday,'' he adds, ``but Lenny Krayzelburg and
I are still not happy with the doping control procedures. We
believe a manipulation of the samples can't be ruled out, and
that's important to innocent athletes. Blood testing combined with
the urine testing we're already doing is the only way we'll put a
strong foot forward in the stand against drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of a strong foot forward, Thorpe is used to jokes about
his feet, which give him nearly twice the surface area of more
normal sizes. The size 17s beat through the water like flippers,
giving him what teammate Kieren Perkins describes as ``a huge kick,
with great power, and an incredible change of speed. These are all
the things that you need to be competitive in sprint events.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe says he can brush aside the unpleasantness of the Berlin
World Cup incident and resume a ``more than happy'' lifestyle
training for a goals his nation has for him. It's not pressure, he
says, only if you let it be pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any expectations anyone else has of me for the Olympics are
nowhere near the expectations I have for myself.''

HELPING WITH THE FINANCIAL TURMOIL OF DIVORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year, 1.4 million divorces are granted in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, then, that the severing of marriage bonds
has spawned a market niche for consultants and a culture of divorce
that includes everything from counseling groups and social
organizations to publications. Now there's even a new breed of
professionals: certified divorce planners, or CPDs, who help people
seeking divorce manage their finances.
</P>
<P>
   For men, often overlooked in the divorce process, the financial
pressures and emotional toll can be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say men often lack the social supports needed to help
them through such an emotionally wrenching period. Many hide their
feelings, fearing loss of a job or loss of respect. Not
surprisingly, new organizations and associations have sprung up in
support of divorced and single fathers with children.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce planner Margorie Engel of Boston says her goal is to
help both men and women ``understand that divorce is a transition,
and that the financial decisions they make will have a far-reaching
impact on their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Engel sorts out clients' finances and determines how possessions
should be divvied up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times, women will want to keep the home,'' she said.
``Many will fight for it, but that can have a negative financial
impact later on. The courts are not required to consider the tax
ramifications associated with keeping a house. That means if the
couple bought a house together and it appreciated in value, but she
decides to sell, she will bear the sole burden of any capital gains
realized from the sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Ann Wilson, author of ``The Financial Advisor's Guide to
Divorce Settlement'' (Times Mirror, 1996), maintains that few
courts recognize the assets of a career as property and few women
realize that in a divorce property is divided only once, but assets
stemming from a husband's career continue to multiply and produce
income for years to come. These assets may include stock options,
pensions, health insurance, life insurance, disability insurance,
vacation pay, sick pay, and money spent on education and training.
</P>
<P>
   Engel agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women tend to fight for the wrong things,'' she said. ``So I
talk to them about their longer-range financial goals, and what it
will take to get there. The whole business of women being the
primary custodial parent and head of the household is still new.''
</P>
<P>
   For Adam Kornfeld, a Massachusetts salesman and divorced father
of a 4-year-old son, Jordan, a local organization for divorced
fathers helped him cope with his 1998 divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a devastating experience,'' said Kornfeld, who is in
his 30s. ``I was barely sleeping. I found it very, very hard to
concentrate. Sometimes I just wanted to retreat from the world, but
I could not. I couldn't as a parent, or as an employee.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornfeld credits a sound co-parenting arrangement with his
ex-wife, a job that permits him to telecommute full time, and a
group called Fathers and Families with helping him make the
transition. Now remarried, he sees his son on the days his former
wife works.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ned Holstein, a Brookline, Mass. medical doctor and founder
of Father and Families (617-357-4832), a nonprofit organization
with 1,400 dues-paying members, contends men are often the
unwitting victims of a court system that, more often than not,
considers them tangential to their children's lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers' lives after divorce are not cakewalks. But there
needs to be a new attitude that says that dad is also important to
the kids,'' he said. ``There should be more flexibility. Even the
terminology used in the courts is offensive. Dads, for example, are
considered visitors and are given visitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Holstein, who is also divorced, founded the organization two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court system considered me superfluous to my children's
well being,'' he said. ``A judge gave me and my ex-wife joint
physical custody and it has worked out. But this is done only 5
percent of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, members will gather at the First Unitarian Society
to discuss the impact divorce has had on their personal and
professional lives. At past meetings, the men have talked about
depression so great they could barely do their jobs, about finding
ways to balance the demands of work with child custody
arrangements, about making support payments after a layoff,
demotion, or move to a lower-paying job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Divorced dads have many, many problems relative to the
workplace,'' said Holstein. ``Child support payments, for example,
may take up to 60 to 70 percent of what they earn. If anything goes
wrong and they are laid off or fired or a bonus doesn't come
through, they could wind up on the state registry for deadbeat
dads. Nobody tells them that they can go to court and modify their
child support order.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the chance to air their concerns at periodic
meetings, Fathers and Families members say their primary goal is to
change the way the court system views divorcing fathers.

ASTRONOMICAL SUMS FLOW TO START-UPS FRAUGHT WITH RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A billion dollars used to be a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   That was before this era of venture capital nirvana and
rocket-fueled technology stocks. Before it became a national
obsession to get in on a hot initial public offering. Before
investors forgot about that old wallflower, risk.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the amount of venture capital flowing to start-ups has
reached previously unthinkable levels. Venture capitalists are
raising billion-dollar funds in a few brisk months, sometimes
weeks. That helped make 1999 a year for the history books. Private
investors plowed $35.6 billion into 4,006 companies last year,
according to the latest Boston Globe/PricewaterhouseCoopers venture
capital report.
</P>
<P>
   Eager investors are happy to sign up. Perhaps too happy,
experienced venture investors concede.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are rumblings of worry bubbling to the surface of this
frothy market. Pension managers who invest in venture funds mutter
about 1929 and wonder aloud whether some venture portfolios, flush
with cash, are dropping their standards as they hunt for hot
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   These giant new funds are handing $15 million a pop to young
companies they would only have invested $5 million in a few years
ago. And they're giving the nod on those deals quicker than ever,
in days instead of months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is accelerated,'' said Kenneth Mabbs, director of
merchant banking for First Albany Corp. in Boston. ``There are
definitely going to be lots of blowups. I think you're already
seeing it on the `b-to-c' side.''
</P>
<P>
   The business-to-consumer Web firms that were all the rage last
year are ice cold today. Business-to-business is where the action
is, most venture players insist. And in this trend-conscious
market, betting on yesterday's story is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Take a glimpse at the performance of recent IPOs that tried to
defy the market's changed direction. There's Fogdog Inc., the
online sporting-goods retailer, whose shares have been flat since
their Dec. 8 debut. Health sites, from MotherNature.com and
Healthcentral.com to Plastic Surgery Co., have seen their shares
dive by double digits in two months, putting them among the worst
IPOs of December. New education sites have stumbled too.
</P>
<P>
   Venture professionals are warning that hawking vitamins, light
bulbs, or tennis rackets online might be short-term games. Broader
companies are more likely to thrive. And copycat businesses could
be big losers.
</P>
<P>
   Even as investors worry about the future, venture capitalists
are
</P>
<P>
   back on the street, raising brand-new, billion-dollar
portfolios. Polaris Venture Partners in Waltham recently raised
$800 million. CMGI Inc. in January launched two funds worth $1
billion each and is luring investors for a third. Highland Capital
just raised $500 million. And Thomas H. Lee Co., which invests in
more mature companies, is raising a fund that could reach $6
billion in just two months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UFBITE MUST DELETE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   --New England entrepreneurs garnered nearly $1.6 billion in
venture capital investments in the 4th quarter. C15
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists say they're flooded with ideas from
entrepreneurs. Oliver Curme, a partner at Battery Ventures in
Wellesley, said the firm invests in one out of 300 deals that it
reviews. When it finds one that it wants, it has to move quickly.
But even deals he turns away are finding money elsewhere.
``Everything is getting funded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the whirlwind the fact that companies are going from seed
finance to venture funding to IPO faster than ever. The whole
process can zoom by in 18 months, instead of the four to five years
it took in the mid-1990s. It's easy to make costly mistakes when
things are moving so fast, investors say.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Flint, a partner with Polaris, recalls venture
investors piling into disk-drive makers in the 1980s. Only a couple
of manufacturers were winners, he said. A couple dozen others were
money losers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet once again, Flint said, ``You find less-experienced VCs
doing me-too companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the bad deals are getting done,'' he added. ``There's so
much angel money and uninformed corporate money.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, what makes a good deal is debatable. There are no
hard and fast rules. Most venture pros say they're looking for a
company with good managers and a promising market niche. But every
deal requires a leap of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Benjamin, the first West Coast partner with Boston's
Highland Capital Partners, scurried to get a deal done during his
first week on the job, last fall. Though he claims to be focused on
business-to-business and calls the consumer space ``more crowded,''
he jumped for a site that exudes consumer kitsch: TheMan.com.
</P>
<P>
   Highland ponied up $15 million to back the San Francisco-based
company, whose Web site offers men Valentine's Day shopping ideas
and advice on golf, Scotch, and cigars. There are sympathy stories
on baldness, a list of what makes for ``seduction dates,'' and
pithy tips on getting out of the doghouse _ like sending her to the
spa for a beauty day.
</P>
<P>
   TheMan.com is the antithesis to the guy sites that carry sports
scores and porn, Benjamin said. It's all about helping men solve
problems, book vacations, and purchase anything from lingerie to
jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that none of the women's sites is making money,
Benjamin said. This is the only site of its kind, explains
Benjamin, who sits on TheMan.com's board. He calls it a ``viral''
business that could spread fast by word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Benjamin boasts, TheMan.com got seed financing from
Lycos Inc. chief Bob Davis. It's run by another Lycos veteran,
Calvin Lui, and ex-Ernst &AMP; Young consultant Steven Lombardi. And if
there was any question about their devotion to their enterprise,
they've got fresh tattoos to prove it. They had TheMan.com's logo
etched on their ankles last week, as they vowed they would if their
engineers beat programming deadlines for the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   When might TheMan make money? ``I have no idea,'' Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, turning profits is overrated in the Internet zone. As
long as investors will snap up money-losing companies in IPOs,
entrepreneurs face little pressure to produce black ink.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually, profits do matter. Wall Street punishes
unprofitable companies. Venture capitalists, by law, have to wait
at least six months to sell their stakes in companies that go
public. But they can't just dump their shares after that because
that would prompt the stock price to fall. Since their exit isn't a
quick flip, they need their companies' stocks to have some staying
power.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin is about to make his fourth deal after reviewing more
than 100 prospects. In this market, it takes just one big success
to make up for several failures. Said Benjamin: ``It's by no means
over in terms of attractive opportunities. The hard part is having
the discipline to be picky.''
</P>
<P>
   Discipline is indeed the key. But with a billion-dollar fund
being born every other week, will all that money find wise deals?
</P>
<P>
   Pension funds, endowments, and wealthy individuals want entry to
the top venture funds while the going is good. No one wants to pass
up a chance to ride the next Amazon, eBay, or Akamai _ high-tech
companies that have rewarded early venture backers with
unfathomable riches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question they're taking on more
risk,'' said Patrick Gray, a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers's
global technology group in Boston. ``But the opportunities for
rewards are also much bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Those tantalizing rewards are driving the astounding growth of
venture capital and private equity investments from Boston to
Silicon Valley. And it's making some forget the inherent risks of
investing in young, private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the uninitiated are joining what was once the preserve
of elite investors. A professor makes a venture bet, risking a
significant sum in hopes of boosting a lackluster nest egg.
Inexperienced investors are becoming ``angels,'' making seed
investments in start-ups. A 22-year-old analyst lucks out and turns
a $15,000 bonus into more than $1 million in one deal.

VENTURE FUNDING SOARS TO $14.59B IN FOURTH QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Venture capital investments soared in the fourth quarter of 1999
as 1,271 companies nationwide landed $14.69 billion in funding _ a
fourfold gain over the last quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Software and Internet services for businesses led the way.
</P>
<P>
   New England entrepreneurs garnered nearly $1.6 billion, or 10.8
percent of the total, according to the latest Boston
Globe/PricewaterhouseCoopers Money Tree Survey. A record 169
companies received financing, making the region second only to
Silicon Valley, where 358 companies landed $5.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a sound business idea and you live in the New
England area, you can get money,'' said Patrick Gray, a partner at
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For the full year, venture financings nationally broke every
record, jumping 150 percent to $35.6 billion. A total of 4,006
companies linked with investors, up from 2,849 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected 1999 to be big, but this figure surpassed even our
most aggressive estimates,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   New England ended the year with $4.1 billion worth of deals,
compared with Silicon Valley's $13.4 billion. The New York City
metropolitan area was third, with $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While New England's 104 percent gain in venture-capital deal
volume for the full year was significant, the region grew slower
than many others.
</P>
<P>
   New York raced ahead with 250 percent growth, the Northwest
gained 220 percent, the Los Angeles area surged 200 percent, and
Silicon Valley increased 195 percent. Even Colorado, the Southeast,
and the Washington, D.C., area grew faster than New England did.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, New England's share of the nation's venture money
came under pressure, slumping to 10.8 percent in last year's final
quarter, compared with 15.3 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Gray suggested that New England companies tend not to be part of
the biggest venture deals, which could affect the rankings. The
largest New England deal in the fourth quarter was HarvardNet Inc.,
which got $70 million for its networking and equipment operation.
Companies like CarsDirect.com and Colomotion Inc., both in
California, landed more than $200 million each.
</P>
<P>
   The second-biggest New England deal of the quarter was
InfoLibria Inc., a software maker that won $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Across all regions, early-stage companies attracted the biggest
share of the funding in 1999, seizing $15 billion, or 42 percent.
Each company received an average of $7.5 million, up from $4.2
million in 1998, as the size of the deals grew. Young Web firms
reaped bigger-than-average financing packages, averaging nearly $9
million each.
</P>
<P>
   Business services, new media and retail/distribution were the
fastest-growing sectors for the year; software and
telecommunications grabbed most of the cash.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in five years, investments in nontechnology
companies declined. Internet-related investments have surged,
however. In New England, such deals represented 63.2 percent of
dollars invested in the latest quarter, up from 3.7 percent in
early 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet-related companies,'' Gray said, ``offer so much
potential so quickly that they now attract the lion's share of the
investing.''

<P>
   CANTON, Mass. _ Philip Laughlin remembers the reaction when he
told his 9-year-old son his new job is leading a company that makes
human skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked at me and said, `You mean like `The Blob' _ it's
alive!' '' recalled Laughlin.
</P>
<P>
   But explaining to a child how laboratory-grown skin can help
heal certain wounds is easy, compared to convincing Wall Street the
product can be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Laughlin, 53, is the new president and chief executive of
Organogenesis Inc., a 15-year-old company that in 1998 beat the
naysayers and gained US Food and Drug Administration approval to
market the first lab-grown human skin equivalent. The pieces of
skin are cultivated from cells donated from infant males'
circumcisions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its rivals, which are developing products with cells from
pigs and cows, Organogenesis is the only company with FDA approval
for a full-thickness human skin substitute. The ability to
cultivate a skin replacement opens a new chapter in the emerging
field of tissue engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Organogenesis's product, called Apligraf, is used for treating
venous ulcers, which are leg wounds caused by ruptured blood
vessels. About 800,000 people, many of them elderly, suffer from
the open wounds.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly 22 months after FDA approval, Organogenesis has not
met many of its own ambitious expectations. After years of ups and
downs, the company has attracted a top-name pharmaceutical company,
Novartis, to market its product and is starting to show signs of
real growth. But Wall Street expects profits are still two years
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a new pill, a drug maker gets into the marketplace
quickly. But the learning curve to educate doctors about a new
medical device, like skin (replacements) _ something they have not
seen before _ takes time. And that took longer than Organogenesis
expected,'' said Michael D. Becker, an analyst at Wayne Hummer
Investments in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there are no signs of profitability, and 1999 revenues
was far below initial expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Organogenesis stock, which once commanded $35 a share, has
recovered somewhat from a low of 6 3/4 in October. It closed
Tuesday at 10 7/8, up 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Laughlin comes in. In October, he became the
company's third president in just nine years. He added the chief
executive post in December. Since Laughlin has 23 years of
marketing and sales experience in the medical device industry _
four years at Medtronic Inc., a developer of medical stents, and 19
years at Baxter International, a health care products giant _
investors are looking to him to finally bring stability and
leadership experience to a company with a turbulent history.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, the company was run by Herbert M. Stein, 72,
the mercurial chairman who co-founded it in 1985 with Eugene Bell,
a professor of biology at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, who several years earlier grew a living skin equivalent
in his laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The skin was originally called Graftskin and subsequently
renamed Apligraf. Starting with cells from a single foreskin,
Organogenesis can grow more than 100,000 three-inch round pieces of
skin in large petri-like dishes containing nutrients. Each
stretchable piece of skin costs $975. (Foreskins are donated to
Organogenesis by families with circumcised baby boys; the company
never pays for foreskins because federal law prohibits the sale of
body parts.)
</P>
<P>
   The production process requires separating different types of
cells from the foreskin and growing them over 20 days to create a
full thickness skin. Since Apligraf is a living product, the
company says, it can heal itself when cut and over time its color
adjusts to the pigment of the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Under Stein, Organogenesis scrambled for money, raising $7.2
million in its initial public offering in 1986 followed by a series
of warrant exercises, private placements and public secondary stock
offerings that brought in over $103 million. Over the years, the
company has had a 2-for-1 stock split and four 5-for-4 stock
splits.
</P>
<P>
   Stein shunned investment bankers and few Wall Street analysts
followed the company. He rarely talked to the press and Wall Street
analysts, and his management style led to a revolving door in the
executive suite, according to former executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stein kept Organogenesis going during the lean years, but he
also was difficult to get along with and never felt comfortable
speaking to groups of people,'' said one former executive. ``I
moved on because I was not entirely comfortable with his approach
to things.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last year Stein, with an eye toward retirement, hired
Laughlin as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Without Stein, Laughlin has more lattitude to make changes,
which he says boil down to solving four fundamental problems:
convincing Medicare to reimburse patients for the $975 cost of
Apligraf; expanding Apligraf usage into new markets, such as
diabetic foot ulcers; creating a pipeline of skin and non-skin
products; and reducing manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't view Organogenesis as broken,'' said Laughlin who ran
the cardiac surgery business unit at Medtronic, where he was a
senior vice president. ``It is just going through a maturation and
transformation stage, from research and development to a
multi-functional commercial company.''
</P>
<P>
   The steps Laughlin makes may also boost the company's stock
price and reduce the company's unusually high number of shares tied
to short sellers _ investors who borrow shares and sell them,
hoping to replace the shares at a lower price. Heavy short selling
in a stock can be an indication that investors think it is
overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Organogenesis has in recent years been a heavily shorted stock.
Even now, short sellers still control 5.62 million shares _ about
18 percent of the company's 30.5 million outstanding shares.
</P>
<P>
   Some early investors in Organogensis were burned when the
company, under Stein, made provocative statements about how quickly
it would get FDA approval and become a leader in the $10 billion-a
year-market for wound healing devices. The overly optimistic
predictions led to accusations from some investors in the mid-1990s
that company may have manipulated the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Sturza, who edits an influential medical investment
newsletter and remains one of Organogenesis's most ardent critics,
said this week that the company's clinical trial was flawed. He had
predicted in 1997 that the FDA would not approve Organogenesis's
product.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months after his prediction, the FDA approved Apligraf for
use in treating venous ulcers and early last year Business Week
magazine cited Apligraf as one of the 10 best new products for
1998, proclaiming ``a new era in regenerative medicine has
arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Sturza earlier this week said he was surprised that
Organogenesis received FDA approval, but warned that the company
will have a tough time making a profit with it under its marketing
agreement with Novartis. The pact, he said, favors the big drug
maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Herb Stein gone, that is a real positive and the new guy
(Laughlin) is very credible,'' said Sturza. ``But Organogenesis's
sales, after all these years, is still laughable and we don't see
any profits any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some Wall Street firms had expectations in 1997 that the
company would report 1999 revenues of $10 million to $33.5 million.
The reality is that Organogenesis lost $20 million, or 66 cents a
share, on revenues of $2.6, for the first nine months of last year.
Of that, $1.8 million was from Apligraf.
</P>
<P>
   Laughlin maintains there is an upside. He acknowledged that
Novartis, after nearly a year, is just beginning to seriously
market the product with a 50-person sales force. The huge
pharmaceutical company is also is working on gaining Medicare
coverage for Apligraf. Currently, some physicans simply won't use
Apligraf because some venous ulcer patients lack the insurance
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   He also expects to gain a second FDA approval this year for use
of Apligraf on diabetic foot ulcers _ a potential market of 600,000
potential customers who could theoretically avoid foot amputations.
Organogenesis is also developing a replacement vein for patients
undergoing cardiac surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has made the dream-to-reality transition,'' noted
Michael Ehrenreich, a health care and biotechnology analyst at
Techvest LLC, a New York investment firm. ``It's time to take a
second look at Organogenesis.''

CAN I AFFORD TO RETIRE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am divorced and hope to retire very soon, but I question
whether I can afford to. I keep hesitating _ all of my aunts have
lived into their mid-90s and one is 103 years old now. I can retire
now with a $2,500 monthly pension, for which a cost-of-living
adjustment is not guaranteed, but which has recently been increased
at a rate of about 3 percent a year. The values of my holdings in
this list are as of the end of 1999. Social Security will kick in
at age 62 or later. Is it better to take it early? I own my own
home outright but will probably move to a condo, which will cost
about $50,000 more than the value of my home. I think I should also
have long-term health insurance. Can I afford to retire?
</P>
<P>
   G.M., Signal Mountain, Tenn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The big question here is how much money you think you will
need in retirement. If you can get by on about $45,000 a year for
the next five to eight years, you should be in pretty good shape.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the way I view it. Your total savings of $538,900
consists of about 72.7 percent fixed-income holdings; although you
have a lot of funds and they are fairly nicely diversified, the
portfolio is overwhelmed by the three largest holdings _ the CDs,
the money market account, and the fixed-income annuity. Given your
happy expectation that your retirement might last 40 years or so, I
think that position is too conservative.
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular loafer in your portfolio is that $100,000
in a bank money market account, which is probably paying you only a
little more than about 2 percent; the national average for these
accounts was 2.10 percent entering this week. Many mutual fund
money market funds now pay in excess of 5 percent, and they offer
check-writing privileges that give you nearly the same liquidity as
banks offer.
</P>
<P>
   I would move half of this money _ the funds that might
eventually be used for your condo purchase _ to such a fund. I
suggest you then move the rest of the money into a solid balanced
fund _ perhaps adding to your position in Fidelity Puritan, or
perhaps going to Vanguard Balanced Index fund. (I am making this
suggestion based on the very conservative nature of your
investments; if it were my portfolio I would make the swap to
Magellan or Index 500. But I am loath to push people with very
conservative holdings to a risk level that may be uncomfortable for
them.)
</P>
<P>
   Those moves would leave you with $50,000 for your real estate
purchase, and the $270,000 in CDs and the annuity should be able to
supply you with an income stream of about $15,000 to augment your
pension income. If you feel you can live on that, retirement should
be no problem. I would have the returns from all of your other
holdings reinvested.
</P>
<P>
   The question of when to take Social Security remains. Certainly
with the prospect of living to a very old age, you probably would
profit by waiting until age 65 or later to begin collecting
benefits. Once you do begin to collect Social Security, you should
have to rely only to a small degree upon your fixed-income
investments. At that stage, you might need to use only about a
third of the fixed-income yield for living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   So, I suggest the remainder of the yield from the fixed-income
side of the portfolio be diverted to additional purchases on the
stock side _ enhancing the growth prospects of the part of the
portfolio which you will rely on to protect you against the
long-term effects of inflation. You don't need to make a final
decision on Social Security now _ you can review your overall
situation once you reach age 62, and if you decide to wait until
age 65, you can then review how things are going and decide then
whether to wait still further.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We have the savings described in the enclosed statement in
the bank. What bothers us are the following statements on the form:
Not FDIC Insured; May Lose Value; No Bank Guarantee. With all these
banks changing names one doesn't know which end is up. Could you
let us know what you think?
</P>
<P>
   C.M., Chula Vista, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. What you have is an investment in a mutual fund that invests
in long-term California municipal bonds _ issues that provide you
with an income that is free of both federal and state taxes. This
is very different from bank savings, for all of the reasons you
noted. Your money has been pooled with that of other investors to
buy these government-issued bonds, and the value of your principal
rises or falls as the long-term bond market rises or falls.
Recently its mostly been the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Note on your statement that for the period in question, your
investment brought you interest income of $65.31, but despite this
the total value of your account fell by nearly $123. That was
because of interest rate increases, and fears of more to come.
Morningstar Mutual Funds, a company that tracks the performance of
most mutual funds, grades your fund average overall. Last year the
fund lost 3.7 percent, which was a better performance than most
funds which have similar investments, but is still doubtless
frustrating to its owners. As this is written, the fund has gained
.43 percent in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   I feel a rant coming on. Clearly you did not understand where
you were putting your money and the fact that it was invested in
securities that could bring you losses as well as the potential for
gains. In my experience, it is most common that people who are
almost totally in the dark about where they have invested their
money are people who have bought mutual funds through a bank. As
you apparently did, many assume that since the bank was offering
the investment, it has the same kind of security that most people
associate with bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what to tell you about what to do at this point.
The fund has a 4.75 percent up-front sales charge, meaning that if
you began with $16,000, $760 of the money immediately disappeared
through the sales charge. If you were to close the account, that
money would have gone for nothing. People who have substantial
levels of income are often attracted to municipal bond funds
because of the tax-exempt nature of the yield, and such funds tend
to work nicely for people who take a very long-range view of the
investment. But if you have a fairly modest income level, you
probably would be better off with taxable _ and insured _
investments, such as CDs.
</P>
<P>
   If you are uncomfortable with the risk element inherent in this
holding, I suggest you get out. First I would make an effort, which
will probably be unsuccessful, to get the bank to acknowledge its
failure to assure that you understood what you were buying, and to
reverse the transaction. Most likely, though, you signed a document
saying that you did understand the nature of the investment, and
the bank will be covered legally, although from my point of view,
not morally. So if you want to get out of the investment, you
probably will have to chalk the misadventure up to experience. And
you can remember the experience by recalling what I consider the
number-one rule of investing: Never buy anything that you don't
fully understand. And this applies as much if you are buying it
from a banker as a snake-oil salesman. End of rant.
</P>
<P>
   One final point: If you look carefully at the statement, you'll
see that although $328.95 of the income you received from the fund
last year was tax-free, the fund also produced a long-term capital
gain of $46.70 for you. This came from profitable sales of holdings
within the portfolio, and you must report this amount as taxable
income on your state and federal tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Money Musings: Can a fund family get hot? Especially in a fairly
frigid climate? While I was scanning the Sunday paper, I noted that
of the nation's most popular mutual funds, only three of them were
in the black _ and all were offerings from the Janus fund family.
Checking the entire list of Janus 30 funds, only two of them _ the
Janus Aspen Flexible Income and Janus Flexible Income _ showed
year-to-date losses, and those were small, 0.1 percent and 0.2
percent, respectively. Janus Twenty showed no gain and no loss. The
rest of the Janus funds were all in the black. The national average
for domestic general stock fund performance this year is a 2.4
percent loss.

SURFSIDE RACES INTO DERBY PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kentucky Derby picture is slowly coming into focus, and, at
this early stage, a filly has assumed the leading role. While a
number of prominent 3-year-old colts are struggling to get their
acts together, Surfside is already taking bows. On Saturday, the
superbly bred daughter of Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew and
2-year-old champion Flanders, captured the $200,000 Las Virgenes at
Santa Anita, marking her third straight victory, and second of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Surfside is a homebred of Overbook Farm, and she is a serious
racehorse. Trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who saddled last year's Derby
winner, Charismatic, and also trained Winning Colors, the last
filly to win the Run for the Roses (1988), has said from the
beginning of the year that he is pointing Surfside toward the May 6
Derby. Usually, trainers with top fillies wait to assess the
strength of the male contingent before choosing between the Derby
or the Oaks, which is exclusively for fillies, on the previous day.
However, with Surfside, Lukas has never considered the Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   The attractive bay now sports a mark of 8-6-1-1 and earnings of
$860,230. The two times she was defeated (second in the Spinaway at
Saratoga last August and third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile
Fillies at Gulfstream in November), she was trapped wide. Her
record is so strong that only three foes could be found for Las
Virgenes. Bob Baffert, who trains 2-year-old filly champion
Chilukki, was so impressed with Surfside that he shipped Chilukki
to California to make her sophomore debut Saturday in the $125,000
Davona Dale at Fair Grounds in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Surfside won the Frizette at Belmont in October over a sloppy
track, but Las Virgenes, raced at one mile, provided her with her
first challenge from a track officially labeled as ``muddy.''
Spain, a nice filly who had earned a check in three straight
stakes, gave Surfside a good go, but the Lukas charge proved too
tough, winning by three-querters of a length. Rings A Chime was
another half-length back in third. Off at 1-5, ($2.40 to win),
Surfside covered the mile in 1:37.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got to the turn, she started fighting the racetrack,
and just wasn't comfortable,'' said Pat Day, who has ridden
Surfside in all of her races, and will ride her in the Derby if she
stays healthy. ``Then they came at her from both sides, and, when
she was in close proximity, she was very game. I think she was just
hesitant to really put her all into it because of the footing.''
</P>
<P>
   While the trainers of several of the talented colts are either
trying to get their horses healthy, or find the right spot for a
major Derby prep, Lukas has his schedule all laid out. ``It helps
that she got looked in the eye,'' said Lukas. ``You know, she's
gotten a little complacent. I was not concerned that anyone would
get by her in the stretch. Now, we've got another month until the
next one, the Santa Anita Oaks March 12, and then we'll get another
month before the Santa Anita Derby April 8. I would imagine we'll
have to reach down a bit more these next two races, and we'll wake
her up for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a man with a plan.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's mutuel
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The odds for the first Kentucky Derby Future Wager, which begins
Thursday and runs through Sunday, have been posted, with Churchill
Downs linemaker Mike Battaglia installing the mutuel field as the
favorite at 5-1. Charismatic came out of the field last year.
Surfside, the only female on the list, which includes 23
individuals plus a field composed of all others, and War Chant,
impressive winner of two races at Santa Anita, are next at 8-1.
Captain Steve and The Deputy are at 10-1, while Anees, Chief
Seattle, Dixie Union, Greenwood Lake, High Yield, and More Than
Ready are all at 15-1. Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet are the
longest shots on the list at 50-1. The individuals listed are
chosen by Daily Racing From handicappers Mike Watchmaker and Brad
Free, and John Asher, vice president of racing communications at
Churchill Downs. ``It's the same situation as last year, when I
made the mutuel field the favorite for pool No. 1,'' said
Battaglia. ``This year, I made the field 5-1, but it will probably
close at shorter odds than that. I really mulled it over because
this is such a wide open group of horses, but 5-1 seemed fair.''
The Future Wager calls for win betting only, and the key thing to
remember about an advance bet is that there are no refunds. You
lose if your horse does not make the race for whatever reason.
Because of the racing statutes in Massachusetts, Suffolk Downs can
not offer the bet. It is, however, available at Rockingham Park in
New Hampshire. The bet will go through two more cycles, with
changing odds and horses: Round 2 from March 9-12 and Round 3 from
April 13-16 . . . Anees, the 2-year-old champion and winner of the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile, has yet to start. The son of Unbridled has
been battling a foot bruise, and he had his first workout of the
season Sunday at Santa Anita, going a half in :50 over the muddy
surface. Anees may nake his 3-year-old bow in the San Felipe March
19 . . . Greenwood Lake, who won the Champagne at Belmont and
Remsen at Aqueduct last year, worked five furlongs in :59 3/5 last
Saturday at Hialeah as he prepares for this Saturday's $200,000
Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream. The Fountain of Youth, run at a
mile and 1-16th, is the first Grade I event of the season for
3-year-olds in the East. Greenwood Lake, who is a deep closer,
caught a speed-favoring track in the Holy Bull at Gulfstream Jan.
15, and could do no better than sixth. ``I couldn't ask for
anything better,'' said trainer Nick Zito of the work. ``All I can
hope for now is a good trip Saturday.''

   Lambana resting
</P>
<P>
   Lambana, who was named New England Horse of the Year for 1999 by
the local turf writers, was recently named Claimer of the Year by
the National Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association.
Lambana was claimed at Tampa Bay Downs in January for $6,250 by
trainer Marshall Novak, and won nine of 11 starts, including three
stakes on the turf at Rockingham, with earnings of $132,017. After
being switched to the grass, Lambana, then age 5, ended her season
with six straight tallies. At the New England Turf Writers' Dinner
in November, Novak, who owns the mare along with his wife, Suzanne,
and partner Gary Jackson, said he may not bring Lambana, who is
wintering on Novak's farm in Tampa, back to the races until Rock
reopens in June. ``She loves that course,'' he said. ``I think,
maybe, I'll just wait.''

OTHERS CHANGE, BUT NOT BRADLEY

   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ After a princely procession as the dauphin of
privilege, George W. Bush reinvented himself. He became ``a
reformer with results,'' a risky move because in his home state, a
reformer is a sidewinder real Texans won't cotton to.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, the grouchy scourge of the Arizona press,
reinvented himself into ``The Truman Show,'' funnier than Jim
Carrey, host of a rolling gabfest as open as community access
cable.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, called ``Prince Albert'' by congressional colleagues,
led an entourage as blithely imperial as Bush's. He then dispatched
his campaign to Nashville, swapped blue-suit blandness for earth
tones, and now eagerly begs for votes.
</P>
<P>
   In this season of reinvented candidates, Bill Bradley came to
the capital of the reinvented world economy to show California
Democrats that he has not reinvented himself. If there is a new
Bradley, he sounds like the old Bush or the old Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator spoke for 41 minutes. Behind him
at the San Jose convention center stood some of the most thoughtful
idealists in California politics. They and other supporters were
aching to applaud, but he fed them little as he rambled through
autobiographical musings. Six months after he formally announced
for president, Bradley is still introducing himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was proud of his father, a banker. ``Throughout the Great
Depression, he never foreclosed on a single home,'' Bradley said, a
remark which ignited the applause and sign-waving one would expect
at a Democratic state convention. But Bradley is a different
candidate. As if to stifle applause, he said, ``My mother always
wanted me to be a success, my father always wanted me to be a
gentleman, and neither one of them wanted me to be a politician.''
This puzzler united friends and foes into pondering its point: two
out of three ain't bad?
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley declared, ``I want to be president of the United
States,'' the applause was more fervent. It seemed a startling
assertion amid a catalog of political science nostrums.
</P>
<P>
   In presidential campaigns, media critics love to tut-tut that
reporters try to start fights between candidates. Here, the Bradley
staff was spinning furiously, hoping to inject conflict and to
conjure up news from a newsless speech. Bradley barely mentioned
his rival Gore, ``but it was a vivid contrast,'' they said, so
subtle you may have missed it.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore spinners were silent, happy to be on Page A21 when
their man is miles ahead in the polls. Gore's 20-minute speech was
a random collection of nouns and adjectives surrounding the word
``fight.'' He promised to fight for California, for America, for
its women, children and other assorted causes.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president then slowed down and read from notes, pelting
his opponent as though this were still a close contest. ``When he
retired from the Senate during our first term, Senator Bradley
spoke of a political process that was paralyzed, a continual
deadlock,'' he said. ``Senator Bradley seemed to suffer from a kind
of Demo-pessimism. But I tell you today, Senator Bradley gave up
too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   During Gore's extended attack, applause was muted. California
Democrats are fastidious enough to avert their gaze during a
stabbing of the wounded. But Gore followed his consultant's script,
fighting against a phantom.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is a former Olympic champion, Ivy League all-star,
Rhodes scholar, and Hall of Famer. In the face of sustained
adversity, he has yet to reinvent himself. Maybe he knows something
others don't know. His performance evoked what H. L. Mencken wrote
about the elder Henry Cabot Lodge, the Massachusetts senator who
was chairman of the Republican National Convention of 1920:
</P>
<P>
   ``He presided over the sessions from a sort of aloof
intellectual balcony, far above the swarming and bawling of the
common herd. He was there in the flesh, but his soul was in some
remote and esoteric Cathay.''

ROCKWELL'S AND SCHULZ'S GIFTS TO CIVIL RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Schulz did not really have to insert the character
Franklin into Peanuts in 1968 to ensure his legacy, any more than
Norman Rockwell was obliged to publish ``The Problem We All Live
With'' in 1963. Schulz would still be remembered as a cartoonist of
everyday insecurities and Rockwell a painter of everyday interludes
and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking about Schulz, who died last weekend, and the
late Rockwell, whose magazine art is on a national tour, is that
they were white shapers of American culture who grew to see a
nation beyond blond and red hair, blue eyes, ruddy cheeks, and
all-white scenes at diners, ballfields, and neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   This is a live issue in the year 2000, given last fall's nearly
all-white lineup of new television sitcoms. It is a live issue
since most of these shows on the foibles and fantasies of white
people are situated in cities that have a majority of people of
color. Seeing how hard it remains for today's white shapers of
culture to acknowledge the very existence of black people, it is
arguable that Schulz and Rockwell are unfortunately still ahead of
their time, even though they are dead.
</P>
<P>
   It did not matter that Schulz's art was the attempt to capture
character in simple forms of caricature. It did not matter that
Franklin was not a major figure in the Peanuts universe and, of
course, a token. What mattered was existence.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin came into the comic strip long after I grew out of it,
but I still noticed that he was dignified, smart, with a sense of
history passed on to him by his grandfather. In earlier times,
Franklin would have been a Pigpen, the dirtiest figure in the
strip. That Franklin was not Pigpen, given the ``Buckwheatization''
of black children, this was a victory.
</P>
<P>
   When he was alive, Rockwell suffered from barbs that his
attempts to capture America's character were too much like
caricature, so much so that he is absent from most ``serious''
books on American art. In the passing of time, one can much more
appreciate Rockwell's character. Few living artists can go from
Gary Cooper to Rosie the Riveter or from white boys being caught at
an illegal swimming hole to the portrait of many of the world's
ethnicities in the ``Golden Rule.''
</P>
<P>
   This might not seem a great leap if one knows that Rockwell was
interested in civil rights and lent his voice to efforts to
integrate a sorority in the 1940s at the University of Vermont. But
through the 1950s he was given clear rules for his magazine covers.
Rockwell said the editor of the Saturday Evening Post told him to
``never to show colored people except as servants.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s gave Rockwell the freedom to break the rules and put
``Golden Rule'' in the Post in 1961. He was then moved by the
attempt in 1960 by African-American first grader Ruby Bridges to
integrate a New Orleans elementary school. His painting of a little
black girl, being escorted by four white federal marshals past
thrown tomatoes and ``nigger'' graffiti, was the centerfold of an
edition of Look in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   This was ``The Problem We All Live With.'' When Ruby Bridges was
asked back then by Harvard University's Robert Coles about the
painting, Bridges said, ``I sure wish I could draw the way he does!
He's got it down, what's happening.'' Rockwell's painting was one
of the few media images of that time where the focus was truly on
her as a person and not the angry mobs heckling her. Bridges told
Coles, ``That picture is about me, I guess _ and what you see in
the news is about the trouble on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles, then an Air Force psychiatrist, also interviewed one of
the white parents who protested integration. After seeing
Rockwell's painting, the white father, whose daughter would have
been in Ruby's class, said, ``That magazine tells you to `look,'
and I sure did; I thought `There she is, the nigra kid.' You look
at her and you begin to feel sorry for her _ a lot of people will,
I'm sure. It's not her we were against, you know. It's the
interference in our life by those folks up North, that's what it
was, that's what we were saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles said this was a dramatic shift for someone who routinely
called Ruby a ``nigger.'' Coles wrote in ``Norman Rockwell,
Pictures for the American People,'' that the white parent ``was now
(as never before the case) letting Ruby herself off the hook,
directing his considerable ire at his nation's political life, at a
region rather than a person. I couldn't help but feel that a
magazine's picture had somehow touched his heart, had given him
some psychological if not moral pause.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why a pause is deserved for Schulz and Rockwell. They
were gifted white men who could have very easily contained their
art in whiter, more serene worlds and still achieve fame (Rockwell
would go on to depict the murder of civil rights workers). Their
cracking of the cocoon is a lesson for today's shapers of American
culture, particularly those on network television. Today's
television moguls do not yet understand what Schulz and Rockwell
realized a long time ago. We all have problems, foibles, and
fantasies that we all live with.

   Iranian women are by far the most politically active in the
Persian Gulf and are among the most empowered in the Islamic world.
In defiance of the theocracy, Iranian women are proving
irrepressible. Beginning in the mid-1990s, pressure from women
changed laws on employment, divorce and maternity leave. Women have
challenged other male bastions as well. Thousands of women broke a
long-time ban on attending male sporting events when they poured
into Tehran's stadium to greet the Iranian soccer team after it
qualified for the 1998 World Cup. (slugged:

WHAT TO DO WHEN A HANDSHAKE ISN'T ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The handshake is losing its grip as the all-purpose American
greeting. And in its place, there's a lot more kissing and hugging
going on.
</P>
<P>
   Someone might kiss your right cheek, or maybe just the air
around it. He or she could offer one kiss, or maybe even three, on
alternating cheeks. (If you don't turn your face, you may
accidentally wind up with a big wet kiss on the lips.) And if you
don't offer your hand quickly, someone might lean over and give you
a hearty embrace.
</P>
<P>
   While fear of sexual harassment complaints have made people more
restrained in the workplace, Americans are actually far more
relaxed in their greetings with friends, colleagues _ and even
strangers _ than ever before, say sociologists and historians who
track American customs.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly exposed to the more familiar greeting styles of
those in other countries _ either from traveling abroad or
observing immigrants here _ once-uptight Americans are loosening
up.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was shocked to see Steve Case, chairman of America
Online, and Gerald Levin, chairman of Time Warner, locked in a full
embrace last month when announcing their momentous merger. And
people have long become accustomed to President Clinton hugging on
all occasions, momentous or not. (At the other extreme, developer
Donald Trump hates hand-shaking, calling it a ``barbaric'' practice
that spreads germs.) Without a monolithic manners book, it's a
confusing world out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I put my hand out to shake a client's hand, and they
say, `Are you kidding?!' and they give me a hug. But it's a very
light hug,'' said Alicia Calascibetta, 26, a sales representative
on her way to a meeting in Boston last week.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, nobody wants to come off as staid, even in New
England. But does a hug require full-frontal contact? And how much
eye contact should there be? In the absence of
one-gesture-fits-all, people are trying out different salutations.
</P>
<P>
   James Bratton, 33, managing director of the Boston office of
Dominion Ventures, a venture capital firm, said he often adds a
strong pat on the shoulder along with a handshake to signal special
warmth to a client or colleague he likes. In social settings, he
practices what appears to be a new standard: A man gives a woman he
knows a light kiss during hellos and goodbyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A simple handshake sometimes seems aloof or distant,'' said
Bratton. ``If it's someone I've worked with for awhile, our
relationship seems like it deserves more than a simple handshake. I
want to communicate that I like the person.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some young adults, influenced by the gestures of
popular American black athletes, favor ``the pound'' (giving each
other two or three knocks with closed fists) and even chest-bumping
hugs.
</P>
<P>
   The best part about this, say etiquette watchers, is that
Americans are more aware of the pluralistic world in which they
live, and are less likely to take offense at those who want to
reach out and touch them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Etiquette standards have not dropped, they've adapted,'' said
Terri Morrison, co-author of the book, ``Kiss, Bow, or Shake
Hands,'' which explains social customs across the world. ``We're
much more open to different styles.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sociologists say they are also pleased that Americans are
better able to differentiate between affectionate and sexual
touching. It's something some other cultures, such as those in
Latin America, have been able to do for some time, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have a Puritanical heritage,'' noted David Karp, a
professor of sociology at Boston College. ``In the American mind,
you couldn't separate touching from sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the easing of some restrictions, hugging and kissing
between men is still much more rare than between men and women, or
women and women.
</P>
<P>
   If you care to follow the rules of etiquette consultants, which
are a traditional lot by nature, they say it's important to
consider a number of factors. In general, men should defer to
women, younger people to older people, work subordinates to
superiors, and foreigners to native citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say err on the side of formality,'' said Rosanne Thomas,
who works for Protocol Advisers in Boston, an etiquette consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with people who are devoutly religious, say
experts, one should respect their customs, particularly when
touching someone of the opposite sex. Muslim men, for example, are
generally not comfortable touching a woman in a greeting.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the handshake originated as a way for our
primitive ancestors to reassure one another that nobody was armed.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists and historians trace the decline of the handshake
and America's relaxation with physical touching to the 1960s, when
the youth culture promoted informality and intimacy. It gained
momentum, they say, during the 1970s and 1980s, when things foreign
gained cachet.
</P>
<P>
   America's changing styles are evident in the classes at the
International Institute of Boston. At this nonprofit organization
that helps the city's new immigrants adjust to life in this
country, instructors taught only the handshake as the generic
greeting 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although they still emphasize the handshake in business
settings, instructors now demonstrate other greetings, mostly for
social situations, such as the light kiss or a brief hug, said
Marcia Chaffee, coordinator of adult education.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell them what is allowable here,'' Chaffee said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's always important to read body language cues.
</P>
<P>
   ``With some folks, you still shake hands,'' said Gil Van Geyte,
50, New England manager for Haworth Inc., an office furniture
manufacturer. ``With others, a hug is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone likes this trend. Some etiquette experts see
tactile friendliness as pretentious Euro-philia or phony intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People assume too much,'' said Ann Nicol, who runs an
etiquette consulting business in Glen Ridge, N.J. ``Just because we
had dinner and a good conversation, that doesn't mean you have the
right to give me a kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Boskin, professor of American history at Boston
University, said he likes the growing trend toward more physical
touching in greetings. A self-described hugger, he said it meets a
basic human and animalistic desire for closeness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more natural for people to touch each other than not
to,'' he said.

<P>
   A generation after it seized power, Iran's revolutionary regime
is deeply troubled.
</P>
<P>
   It is fractured by intense political divisions, endangered by
economic disorder, discredited by rampant corruption and smothered
in social restrictions no longer acceptable to large sectors of the
changing population.
</P>
<P>
   To the outside world, the Islamic Republic of Iran often appears
to be at a precipice, its unique theocratic government on the verge
of imploding from internal tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year its domestic drama has played out visibly,
and sometimes violently, in killings by a rogue death squad,
newspaper closures, student unrest, political trials and, as
always, uneasy relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iran, often in spite of the theocrats, has begun to achieve
one of the revolution's original goals: empowering the people. For
new social and political movements are blossoming defiantly,
ranging from religious reform and cultural expression to women's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   True, the theocratic regime that seized power in 1979 is
unlikely to survive in its current, austere form because of
profound internal problems. Yet the driving force behind the
revolution has proven adaptable enough to allow Iranians to get for
themselves what the theocracy has failed to provide. Iran's
increasingly savvy population is taking stands on social issues,
making demands and even defying the theocrats.
</P>
<P>
   _ The First Republic (1979-1989). Iran's revolution was about
more than getting rid of an unpopular leader. After the shah's
ouster, the coterie around Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini gradually
crafted a theocracy instead of a democracy. Human rights were
virtually ignored during the decade-long ``First Republic,'' which
lasted from 1979 until Khomeini's death in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The regime's zealots became obsessed with deconstructing the
past and winning converts to their cause, both at home and in the
region. The new state survived only by crushing dissent, spending
its foreign exchange reserves and tapping into fierce, age-old
Persian nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, seeds of public empowerment were planted and grew.
The ``construction jihad'' _ carried out by teams of development
experts and builders _ brought progress in the form of new schools,
social services, clinics, electricity, television and roads to the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution particularly excelled in education, in quantity
if not always in quality.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, only half of Iran's youth between the ages of
six and 24 were literate. Two decades later, the number had grown
to 93 percent _ even though the population had doubled. And
students remained in school longer: The number of university
graduates soared from 430,000 in the late 1970s to more than 4
million in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   This success spurred people's expectations of a greater role in
the system and access to new instruments of progress.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Second Republic (1989-1997). During President Hashemi
Rafsanjani's tenure, Iran graduated to realistically dealing with
the present. One might say that the government of God plummeted
back to earth _ with a thud.
</P>
<P>
   The new leadership initially promoted physical reconstruction of
the nation, economic reform and a diplomatic thaw. But without the
Ayatollah's authority, longstanding political divisions deepened
and paralysis set in.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a brief try at privatization, including reviving the
monarchy's stock market, the promise of change remained largely
unfulfilled. In the end, the regime's blatantly manipulative
tactics kept it from achieving its goals, instead spawning
corruption, deepening debt and social turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the very policies that Rafsanjani introduced to
win back the support of a war-weary public inadvertently
jump-started the process of the people's empowerment. The regime
sporadically tolerated cultural freedoms and relaxed some of its
social restrictions. It also facilitated a consumer spending spree
on imports by making credit available.
</P>
<P>
   The outside world soon flooded back in, through satellite
dishes, videos, computers and textbooks full of ideas. From that
point on, the tide of information could no longer be controlled,
regardless how hard Iranian conservatives and clerics tried.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Republic also overlapped with the end of the Cold
War, which Iranians felt deeply because of their shared border with
the Soviet Union. The collapse of Soviet rule _ in a country with
superpower resources _ sent a powerful warning about the
vulnerability of revolutionary regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Iran's upheaval was part of global change, including the
demise of communism in Europe, white rule in Africa and military
dictatorships in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's theocracy came to recognize that it was endangering its
own agenda by ignoring the state's real problems _ for example, its
``population policy.'' In the 1980s, millions of women had obeyed
the theocrats' dictate to breed a new Islamic generation that would
defend the revolution. In seven years Iran's population jumped from
34 million to more than 50 million; it is now 70 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the clerics soon realized that soaring population numbers
were more likely to undo the revolution than to save it. So they
introduced one of the world's most extensive family-planning
programs. Every form of birth control, from condoms and pills to
sterilization, became free.
</P>
<P>
   Today all couples have to undergo and pass a family-planning
course before obtaining a marriage license. Thousands of women
mobilized by the Health Ministry have gone door-to-door to explain
the necessity of birth control. Clerics, preaching the benefits of
small family size, have issued decrees approving everything from
intrauterine devices to vasectomies.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Third Republic (1997 to present). In the 1997 presidential
election, which had the highest turnout since the Iranian people
endorsed revolution, 70 percent of Iran's voters spurned the
theocrats' candidate of choice. Instead they elected a dark-horse
cleric named Mohammad Khatami, a former minister of culture and
Islamic guide who was purged in 1992 for ``liberalism'' and
''negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   The election marked the burgeoning of what is by now a very
public fight for empowerment. The outcome of the Iranian elections
will at least partly reflect the degree of Khatami's success in
restoring the rule of law, fostering a civil society (two of his
campaign pledges), and wresting power from the religious
superstructure _ the theocratic part of Iran's system _ that limits
the government's powers.
</P>
<P>
   But more likely, Iran's future will be decided by the newly
energized popular forces that made Khatami's election possible in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Even clerics who have held high office and intellectuals who
were proteges of the Ayatollah Khomeini are now challenging the
religion's basic precepts as well as the specifics of theocratic
rule.
</P>
<P>
   For example, all of Tehran was engrossed last autumn in the
trial of Abdollah Nouri, a cleric and editor of the newspaper
Khordad, who served during the Third Republic as vice president,
interior minister and Tehran city councilor. The Special Court for
the Clergy charged him with multiple counts of ``insulting'' Islam,
the prophet Muhammad and the Ayatollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri, a close supporter of President Khatami, had run articles
in Khordad that questioned everything from the Islamic concept of
eye-for-eye justice to the clergy's automatic right to hold power.
At his trial, he astonished Iranians by denying the court's right
to judge him: ``I totally reject the court, its membership, and its
competence to conduct this trial, and any verdict you reach will
have no legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Nouri was sentenced to five years in prison.
His newspaper was banned, although his staff defiantly pledged to
launch another publication _ the new way of getting around forced
closures.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nouri, Mohsen Kadivar, a popular young cleric and professor
put on trial for ``disseminating lies and disturbing public
opinion'' by advocating the separation of political and religious
institutions, rejected the clergy's right to judge.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being convicted and receiving an 18-month sentence,
Kadivar gained celebrity status. Posters of him were plastered all
over Tehran. Students held a candlelight vigil in the hills near
Evin prison, where he was being held without bail. Chanting
``freedom of thought, forever, forever,'' they released doves as a
symbol of liberty.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   A generation after it seized power, Iran's revolutionary regime
is deeply troubled.
</P>
<P>
   It is fractured by intense political divisions, endangered by
economic disorder, discredited by rampant corruption and smothered
in social restrictions no longer acceptable to large sectors of the
changing population.
</P>
<P>
   To the outside world, the Islamic Republic of Iran often appears
to be at a precipice, its unique theocratic government on the verge
of imploding from internal tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year its domestic drama has played out visibly,
and sometimes violently, in killings by a rogue death squad,
newspaper closures, student unrest, political trials and, as
always, uneasy relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iran, often in spite of the theocrats, has begun to achieve
one of the revolution's original goals: empowering the people. For
new social and political movements are blossoming defiantly,
ranging from religious reform and cultural expression to women's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   True, the theocratic regime that seized power in 1979 is
unlikely to survive in its current, austere form because of
profound internal problems. Yet the driving force behind the
revolution has proven adaptable enough to allow Iranians to get for
themselves what the theocracy has failed to provide. Iran's
increasingly savvy population is taking stands on social issues,
making demands and even defying the theocrats.
</P>
<P>
   _ The First Republic (1979-1989). Iran's revolution was about
more than getting rid of an unpopular leader. After the shah's
ouster, the coterie around Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini gradually
crafted a theocracy instead of a democracy. Human rights were
virtually ignored during the decade-long ``First Republic,'' which
lasted from 1979 until Khomeini's death in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The regime's zealots became obsessed with deconstructing the
past and winning converts to their cause, both at home and in the
region. The new state survived only by crushing dissent, spending
its foreign exchange reserves and tapping into fierce, age-old
Persian nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, seeds of public empowerment were planted and grew.
The ``construction jihad'' _ carried out by teams of development
experts and builders _ brought progress in the form of new schools,
social services, clinics, electricity, television and roads to the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution particularly excelled in education, in quantity
if not always in quality.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, only half of Iran's youth between the ages of
six and 24 were literate. Two decades later, the number had grown
to 93 percent _ even though the population had doubled. And
students remained in school longer: The number of university
graduates soared from 430,000 in the late 1970s to more than 4
million in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   This success spurred people's expectations of a greater role in
the system and access to new instruments of progress.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Second Republic (1989-1997). During President Hashemi
Rafsanjani's tenure, Iran graduated to realistically dealing with
the present. One might say that the government of God plummeted
back to earth _ with a thud.
</P>
<P>
   The new leadership initially promoted physical reconstruction of
the nation, economic reform and a diplomatic thaw. But without the
Ayatollah's authority, longstanding political divisions deepened
and paralysis set in.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a brief try at privatization, including reviving the
monarchy's stock market, the promise of change remained largely
unfulfilled. In the end, the regime's blatantly manipulative
tactics kept it from achieving its goals, instead spawning
corruption, deepening debt and social turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the very policies that Rafsanjani introduced to
win back the support of a war-weary public inadvertently
jump-started the process of the people's empowerment. The regime
sporadically tolerated cultural freedoms and relaxed some of its
social restrictions. It also facilitated a consumer spending spree
on imports by making credit available.
</P>
<P>
   The outside world soon flooded back in, through satellite
dishes, videos, computers and textbooks full of ideas. From that
point on, the tide of information could no longer be controlled,
regardless how hard Iranian conservatives and clerics tried.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Republic also overlapped with the end of the Cold
War, which Iranians felt deeply because of their shared border with
the Soviet Union. The collapse of Soviet rule _ in a country with
superpower resources _ sent a powerful warning about the
vulnerability of revolutionary regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Iran's upheaval was part of global change, including the
demise of communism in Europe, white rule in Africa and military
dictatorships in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's theocracy came to recognize that it was endangering its
own agenda by ignoring the state's real problems _ for example, its
``population policy.'' In the 1980s, millions of women had obeyed
the theocrats' dictate to breed a new Islamic generation that would
defend the revolution. In seven years Iran's population jumped from
34 million to more than 50 million; it is now 70 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the clerics soon realized that soaring population numbers
were more likely to undo the revolution than to save it. So they
introduced one of the world's most extensive family-planning
programs. Every form of birth control, from condoms and pills to
sterilization, became free.
</P>
<P>
   Today all couples have to undergo and pass a family-planning
course before obtaining a marriage license. Thousands of women
mobilized by the Health Ministry have gone door-to-door to explain
the necessity of birth control. Clerics, preaching the benefits of
small family size, have issued decrees approving everything from
intrauterine devices to vasectomies.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Third Republic (1997 to present). In the 1997 presidential
election, which had the highest turnout since the Iranian people
endorsed revolution, 70 percent of Iran's voters spurned the
theocrats' candidate of choice. Instead they elected a dark-horse
cleric named Mohammad Khatami, a former minister of culture and
Islamic guide who was purged in 1992 for ``liberalism'' and
''negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   The election marked the burgeoning of what is by now a very
public fight for empowerment. The outcome of the Iranian elections
will at least partly reflect the degree of Khatami's success in
restoring the rule of law, fostering a civil society (two of his
campaign pledges), and wresting power from the religious
superstructure _ the theocratic part of Iran's system _ that limits
the government's powers.
</P>
<P>
   But more likely, Iran's future will be decided by the newly
energized popular forces that made Khatami's election possible in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Even clerics who have held high office and intellectuals who
were proteges of the Ayatollah Khomeini are now challenging the
religion's basic precepts as well as the specifics of theocratic
rule.
</P>
<P>
   For example, all of Tehran was engrossed last autumn in the
trial of Abdollah Nouri, a cleric and editor of the newspaper
Khordad, who served during the Third Republic as vice president,
interior minister and Tehran city councilor. The Special Court for
the Clergy charged him with multiple counts of ``insulting'' Islam,
the prophet Muhammad and the Ayatollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri, a close supporter of President Khatami, had run articles
in Khordad that questioned everything from the Islamic concept of
eye-for-eye justice to the clergy's automatic right to hold power.
At his trial, he astonished Iranians by denying the court's right
to judge him: ``I totally reject the court, its membership, and its
competence to conduct this trial, and any verdict you reach will
have no legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Nouri was sentenced to five years in prison.
His newspaper was banned, although his staff defiantly pledged to
launch another publication _ the new way of getting around forced
closures.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nouri, Mohsen Kadivar, a popular young cleric and professor
put on trial for ``disseminating lies and disturbing public
opinion'' by advocating the separation of political and religious
institutions, rejected the clergy's right to judge.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being convicted and receiving an 18-month sentence,
Kadivar gained celebrity status. Posters of him were plastered all
over Tehran. Students held a candlelight vigil in the hills near
Evin prison, where he was being held without bail. Chanting
``freedom of thought, forever, forever,'' they released doves as a
symbol of liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Like the world around it, Iran is still undergoing a profound
transformation. More internal turmoil lies ahead, as the
revolution's early passions are replaced by hard-earned pragmatism,
and as arrogance gives way to realism among many sectors of Iranian
society.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the government of God is being forced to cede to
secular statecraft _ and to empower Iranians.

<P>
   Iranian women are by far the most politically active in the
Persian Gulf and are among the most empowered in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 200 women ran for the 270-seat parliament and 14 won.
In 1997, four women registered to run for the presidency. Although
all were disqualified by the Council of Guardians that vets
candidates, the decision was not based on gender.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Khatami's stunning upset victory in the 1997
presidential election, in which 70 percent of the voters said no to
the hard-line conservative candidate, would not have happened
without the female vote. And as president, Khatami appointed a
female vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 5,000 women ran in local elections, and 300 won. Today,
more than 40 percent of university students are female, as are
one-third of faculty members. Thousands of women educated after the
revolution work as engineers, doctors, scientists, lawyers and even
clerics. More than 340 directors-general in government ministries
are female.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has 140 female publishers, enough to hold an exhibition of
books and magazines published by women only. Women have become
painters, authors, designers, photographers, movie producers,
directors, stars and sculptors crafting ``anatomically correct''
female figures (otherwise known as nudes).
</P>
<P>
   A fierce women's movement was not what the theocrats had
intended to see as characteristic of Iran's Islamic revolution.
Their original goal was more akin to gender apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   After the revolution, the regime, in one way or another,
dismissed almost all women who earlier had risen to positions of
importance. A former female education minister was executed for
promoting ``prostitution'' among girls.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution's severe intentions were reflected in the new
Islamic dress code and the lowering _ to age 9 _ of the minimum age
at which women could be married. The new constitution also removed
critical women's rights in divorce and child-custody battles.
</P>
<P>
   A generation later, many of the country's restrictions on women
still border on the bizarre:
</P>
<P>
   _ A woman may have an equal vote in parliament or equal powers
among the vice presidents, but her testimony in court carries only
half the weight of a man's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women can head universities and publish newspapers but cannot
leave the country without their husbands' written permission.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women can act in plays and movies alongside men, but they
cannot sing in public or ride in the same section of a public bus.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Iranian women have proven irrepressible. In
defiance of the theocracy, they are putting their imprints on
diverse aspects of Iranian life.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the mid-1990s, pressure from women changed laws on
employment, divorce and maternity leave. Women packed a courtroom
to protest child-custody laws after the brutal death of an
eight-year-old girl. She had weighed only 35 pounds and suffered a
fractured skull, two broken arms and burn marks over her body at
the hands of her father, a drug addict with a criminal record and a
documented history of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic tradition allows a mother to keep a daughter until the
age of seven and a son until the age of two; full custody then
switches to the father. In 1998 Parliament revised the law to
stipulate that a child could no longer be awarded to an unfit
father, defining the custody qualifications in a way that could
often disqualify men.
</P>
<P>
   Women have challenged other male bastions as well. Thousands of
women broke a long-time barrier preventing females from attending
male sporting events when they poured into Tehran's stadium to
greet the Iranian soccer team after it qualified for the 1998 World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Women are also playing sports. Tehran alone has 85 women's
basketball teams in five leagues. Only 10,000 women engaged in
intramural sports on the eve of the revolution. Today, 2 million
participate in soccer, basketball, swimming, tennis, handball,
skiing, aerobics, fencing, judo, shooting, volleyball, rowing,
horseback riding, gymnastics, golf, table tennis, karate, tae kwon
do and even water-skiing. This, despite the slightly absurd
waterproof coats and scarves women must wear to demonstrate
``modesty.''
</P>
<P>
   And women have forced the theocrats to acknowledge their
official participation. At the 1996 Olympics, for the first time, a
female athlete led the Iranian team onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   The new activists are as distinct as their political
environment. The most outspoken women are no longer necessarily
Westernized or upper-class elites, but have emerged from within the
revolution. Many are from traditional families, clerical circles
and rural areas _ none of which had previously produced female
activists.
</P>
<P>
   Women's publications have been brazen on reform issues. ``Zan''
(Woman) _ which the theocrats banned in 1999 _ was a newspaper
published by Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former President
Rafsanjani, and a member of parliament. It editorialized against
child-custody laws, the use of stoning as a punishment, and
``temporary marriage'' _ the practice of contracting a short-term
wife. It ran an expose on the return of prostitution and reported
on a New Year's message sent to the country by the former empress
of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Another publication, ``Farzaneh,'' is trying to reconcile more
robust women's rights with the Islamic faith. Its articles have
included ``Human Rights of Women in Islam,'' ``A History of Silence
and Debates Today,'' ``How to Proceed'' and ``The Long Way Ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Iranian cinema, which often focuses on women, has led a major
countercultural revolution since the early 1990s. We find female
movie characters who are challenging the status quo, plots that
focus on the shortcomings of the Islamic system and dialogue that
extends the boundaries of public discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Dariush Mehrjui, the father of modern Iranian cinema, wrote a
quartet of films _ ``Banoo'' (1992), ``Sara'' (1993), ``Pari''
(1995) and ``Leila'' (1997) _ about the professional and personal
plight of women in Islamic society. Each ended with the lead female
character defying convention or leaving her husband to head out on
her own _ a radical move in a society where women must get written
permission to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mohsen Makhmalbaf, who spent five years in the shah's jails, was
known in the 1980s for ardently religious and pro-revolution films.
But his seventh film, ``A Time to Love,'' was a controversial tale
_ with three endings based on three perspectives _ about a married
woman who pursues a younger man.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Makhmalbaf's teen-age daughter Samira made her film
debut with ``The Apple,'' the true story of an illiterate man who
had locked his 12-year-old twin daughters at home since infancy,
for fear that the girls' purity would be spoiled by strange men's
gazes.
</P>
<P>
   The movie revolved around the gradual exposure of the girls _
almost mute, unschooled and both physically and mentally disabled _
to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the film to make this point: All it takes to imprison
many, many women is one man,'' Samira told reporters when the film
opened in New York in 1999. ``What I noticed about those two girls
is that the more they came into contact with society, the more
complete they became as human beings. For me, that became a
metaphor for all women. Women in Iran are like springs. If they
want to be free, and if they try, they burst out with a lot of
energy.''

   The new activists are as distinct as their political
environment. The most outspoken women are no longer necessarily
Westernized or upper-class elites, but have emerged from within the
revolution. Many are from traditional families, clerical circles
and rural areas _ none of which had previously produced female
activists.
</P>
<P>
   Women's publications have been brazen on reform issues. ``Zan''
(Woman) _ which the theocrats banned in 1999 _ was a newspaper
published by Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former President
Rafsanjani, and a member of parliament. It editorialized against
child-custody laws, the use of stoning as a punishment, and
``temporary marriage'' _ the practice of contracting a short-term
wife. It ran an expose on the return of prostitution and reported
on a New Year's message sent to the country by the former empress
of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Another publication, ``Farzaneh,'' is trying to reconcile more
robust women's rights with the Islamic faith. Its articles have
included ``Human Rights of Women in Islam,'' ``A History of Silence
and Debates Today,'' ``How to Proceed'' and ``The Long Way Ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Iranian cinema, which often focuses on women, has led a major
countercultural revolution since the early 1990s. We find female
movie characters who are challenging the status quo, plots that
focus on the shortcomings of the Islamic system and dialogue that
extends the boundaries of public discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Dariush Mehrjui, the father of modern Iranian cinema, wrote a
quartet of films _ ``Banoo'' (1992), ``Sara'' (1993), ``Pari''
(1995) and ``Leila'' (1997) _ about the professional and personal
plight of women in Islamic society. Each ended with the lead female
character defying convention or leaving her husband to head out on
her own _ a radical move in a society where women must get written
permission to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mohsen Makhmalbaf, who spent five years in the shah's jails, was
known in the 1980s for ardently religious and pro-revolution films.
But his seventh film, ``A Time to Love,'' was a controversial tale
_ with three endings based on three perspectives _ about a married
woman who pursues a younger man.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Makhmalbaf's teen-age daughter Samira made her film
debut with ``The Apple,'' the true story of an illiterate man who
had locked his 12-year-old twin daughters at home since infancy,
for fear that the girls' purity would be spoiled by strange men's
gazes.
</P>
<P>
   The movie revolved around the gradual exposure of the girls _
almost mute, unschooled and both physically and mentally disabled _
to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the film to make this point: All it takes to imprison
many, many women is one man,'' Samira told reporters when the film
opened in New York in 1999. ``What I noticed about those two girls
is that the more they came into contact with society, the more
complete they became as human beings. For me, that became a
metaphor for all women. Women in Iran are like springs. If they
want to be free, and if they try, they burst out with a lot of
energy.''

   McCAIN-BAUER (Greenville, S.C.) _ John McCain touts his
endorsement by former rival Gary Bauer in an effort to counter
doubts raised by George W. Bush about McCain's anti-abortion
credentials. Bauer praises McCain as ``the best shot we have to end
the era of Bill and Hillary and Al Gore.'' Bush, meanwhile, shrugs
off McCain's endorsement by Bauer and by California Secretary of
State Bill Jones and says he's still going to win Saturday's
Republican primary in South Carolina. By STEWART M. POWELL and DAN

GOP EYES FOCUS ON THE MIDDLE GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ ``May I make a substantive remark here?''
</P>
<P>
   For much of Tuesday night's testy GOP debate, that remark by
former ambassador and longshot presidential candidate Alan Keyes
seemed very much on the mark.
</P>
<P>
   For while Tuesday night's debate was replete with passion, anger
and indignation, much more of that fervor was focused on how the
GOP campaign has been waged than on what it should be about. For 90
minutes, Senator John McCain and Texas Governor George W. Bush,
with Keyes in a secondary but important role, managed to say little
about issues such as health care and veterans benefits, two matters
at the top of the South Carolina agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were several notable exchanges that could affect
the outcome of Saturday's vote. McCain on several occasions sought
to cast himself as slightly more moderate than Bush, hoping to
appeal to Democrats and independents who are likely to determine
the victor in this state where any registered voter may participate
in the GOP contest.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for example, criticized Bush for supporting the GOP
plank against abortion rights even though it doesn't include
exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. McCain
also hammered Bush for proposing a huge tax cut that McCain says
disproportionately benefits the rich and does not put as much money
as his plan into Social Security and paying off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, stressed a campaign theme that he clearly hopes
will prove decisive. He said he should be elected because Congress
will listen to him, and not to a maverick like McCain, who is
unpopular with many of his congressional colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But later in the debate, when McCain said that Bush's tax cut
gave away too much money to the rich, Bush seemed to contradict
himself, saying of the institution he hoped to lead: ``I don't
trust Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush returned time and again to his traits as a leader,
McCain also underscored the theme of character, bringing up his
years as a Vietnam prisoner of war. For McCain, the talk about
issues was important, but it is the respect he earns for his
personal sacrifice that is widely viewed as the key to whether he
can win Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what was surprising, and perhaps bewildering to viewers,
was the extensive talk about attack ads and tactics rather than
issues. It was a heated conversation on just the topic that many
voters say turns them off about politics.
</P>
<P>
   The most heated moment of the night captured that. McCain
expressed disgust at the way Bush stood with a ``fringe'' veteran
who said that McCain did not do enough for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can understand this, George, but that
really hurt. That really hurt,'' McCain said, reminding viewers
about his POW experience and Bush's attack.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rejoined that the man was not speaking for him, and went on
to point out that McCain's political surrogates had said things
that McCain doesn't agree with.
</P>
<P>
   After all this shouting was over, one thing remained unexplored:
What exactly do McCain and Bush plan to do to help veterans? The
question was hardly on the table.
</P>
<P>
   The third man in the debate, Keyes, is low in the polls here,
but he served as a combination of critic and referee, frequently
lambasting McCain and Bush for not being conservative enough, and
berating them for not talking enough about the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, toward the end, the candidates acted like a family
trying to make up after a fight. Bush, given a golden opportunity
by CNN moderator Larry King to say whether McCain is a liberal,
responded that the Arizona senator is a conservative and ``a good
man.'' But minutes later, Bush complained that McCain had called
him untrustworthy. It was revealing that both McCain and Bush came
prepared with props _ negative campaign leaflets each said had been
dropped by opposing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason for this. In politics, there are often
intricate strategies about when to go negative and when to stop.
That is especially important in South Carolina, where many people
are independents, in part out of distaste for politics as usual. So
Tuesday night's brawl over attack ads may well turn off some and
suppress turnout. A lower turnout is likely to benefit Bush; a
higher one probably would help McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the candidates apparently believed that they could
benefit by attacking each other. For McCain, complaining about the
ads was a way to attack Bush without violating his vow to drop
attack ads. For Bush, linking McCain to the attack ads was a way to
paint the Arizona senator as something other than a reformer.
</P>
<P>
   The format of the debate may have helped Bush. In New Hampshire,
he was uncomfortable in formal, standup clashes. Tuesday night, he
was in his preferred setting, sitting around a table with McCain,
Keyes, and King. Moreover, several candidates who ran to Bush's
right and often criticized him, including Steve Forbes and Gary
Bauer, have dropped out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the hard words, a significant new tack in the campaign
emerged. Bush said that he could tell Congress to ``follow me,''
suggesting that the maverick McCain, whose policy positions have
offended congressional colleagues and party leaders, could not do
so. But McCain responded that he has passed 234 pieces of
legislation and that the Republican Party needs to reshape its
message with him at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has spread a populist message designed to appeal to
moderates and liberals, saying that Bush's tax cut plan gives too
much away to the rich, a theme seldom heard in a GOP primary unless
independents and Democrats played such a potentially large role.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, the plan was to present himself as the face of a
Republican Party that can be reborn as a reform-minded entity that
attracts voters of all political stripes. That, McCain said, will
put him in a better position to capture the general election, when
the need to attract Democrats and independents is the key to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the goal is a bit trickier. When he began his
campaign, he ran with an assumption that he would be the GOP
nominee and that he needed to cast himself as a moderate-sounding
``compassionate conservative'' in order to win in the fall. But as
McCain has run strongly against him, Bush has moved gradually to
the right during the primary season, casting himself as the more
vigorous opponent of abortion and the proponent of the biggest tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Such moves by Bush have helped among the GOP faithful, but they
could backfire in South Carolina if a large number of Democrats and
independents turn out to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, McCain is seeking to convince Republican Party
leaders, many of whom are working hard to make Bush the nominee,
that he would be a stronger candidate in the general election
because he has more appeal among Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there were numerous efforts Tuesday night by Bush
and McCain to show that they are in sync with the conservative base
of the Republican Party. Both men have said it is up to the state
to decide whether the Confederate flag should continue to be flown
over the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with slight variations, Bush and McCain agree on many
policies. But there is a huge gulf between them on campaign finance
and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign finance plan would ban corporate ``soft money''
but continue to allow individuals to give unlimited contributions
to the political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was aimed at undercutting McCain's profile as a
reformer.

THE HIGH ART OF PROTECTING LOW ARTISTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leonardo DiCaprio's new movie ``The Beach'' has been catnip for
headline writers: ``In his new movie, DiCaprio heads straight for
the shallows'' (The Boston Globe); or ``DiCaprio Sinks Again, But
There's No Iceberg'' (Wall Street Journal). The movie isn't very
good, but the producers knew that months before putting it into
theaters. That's where review-proofing comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Review-proofing is one of the more diverting sideshows in the
entertainment world. Faced with a book, movie, or play of
questionable merit, publishers and producers work overtime to
shield the turkey from professional reviewers. That way they can
make a few dollars before the half-baked bird emerges for the
full-bore roast. With ``The Beach,'' 20th Century-Fox quite
properly hyped the sizzle _ teen heartthrob DiCaprio, on the covers
of Talk, Time, and Rolling Stone magazines _ rather than the
celluloid steak.
</P>
<P>
   Review-proofing comes in different shapes and forms. An awful
movie like ``Independence Day,'' promoted with clever trailers,
became too big to fail. Likewise the Star Wars prequel, ``The
Phantom Menace,'' survived withering reviews, yet I'm sure it would
have earned another $100 million if it had been as engrossing as we
all hoped. When the recent teen yukker ``Down to You'' was withheld
from movie critics, West Coast reviewers were told there was
``something wrong'' with the print, prompting the inevitable joke
that the only thing wrong with the print was the movie itself.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Book publishers have their tricks, most often plied with
doggy, ghost-written political memoirs, which are often withheld
from reviewers to hype some tawdry piece of ``news.'' Donald
Regan's revelation of Nancy Reagan's astrology interest comes to
mind. Similarly, Random House cleverly exploited the controversy
over Edmund Morris's fictionalized Reagan biography, ``Dutch,'' to
sell a bunch of copies. Professional reviewers quickly understood
that Morris had simply dropped the ball. He didn't understand
Reagan and he bailed out of the narrative.
</P>
<P>
   But the theater is the real locus of review-proofing stunts.
Here's why: On stage, you get only one shot. Ensconced in 3,000
theaters, clunker movies like ``The Beach'' and ``Down to You'' can
generate millions of dollars in just a couple of weekends before
washing out. There is no such luxury in theater. You have one show,
and one house to fill. And the critics can close you down.
</P>
<P>
   In his heyday, Broadway producer David Merrick was the Magus of
review-proofing. One of the first major openings Frank Rich covered
as New York Times drama critic was Merrick's ghastly 1980
production ``42nd Street,'' directed by the legendary Gower
Champion. ``Merrick was not stupid,'' Rich remembers. ``He knew he
had a mediocre show on his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   At considerable cost, Merrick kept canceling press previews, and
announced that critics would have to review the show on opening
night. Then, after the second curtain call, Merrick strode onto the
stage and launched his bombshell: Following a long illness, Gower
Champion had died. Early that afternoon, as it happened. Rich's
review was unflattering, but ``no one even cared what the reviews
were,'' he says. ``The press was cowed and moved by these
extraordinary events.'' ``42nd Street'' enjoyed the proverbial
smash run.
</P>
<P>
   Does review-proofing work? Sure, sometimes. But sometimes it
proves to be overkill. In 1961, Merrick had pessimistic
premonitions about his musical ``Subways Are for Sleeping,'' which
opened in Boston prior to a Broadway run. With a book by Betty
Comden and Adolph Green, and music by Jules Styne, ``Subways'' was
supposed to sing. It didn't. So Merrick ginned up another flap.
With much attendant publicity, he announced that the Globe's young,
``incompetent'' theater critic, Kevin Kelly, would be barred from
the show.
</P>
<P>
   So there was Merrick on opening night, with the TV cameras
rolling, barring Kevin from the Colonial Theatre. Only the Globe's
drama editor, Cyrus Durgin would be admitted to review the play,
Merrick thundered. Who won? Well, Kevin had outfoxed Merrick by
sneaking into a ``Subways'' preview in Philadelphia. But _
surprise! He loved the play! Review-proofed in vain, ``Subways''
sank back into the shadows of theater history.

an Emmy. And in February he becomes captain of the Davis Cup team.

   John McEnroe, at age 40, has lost little of the intensity that
made him one of the best _ and most controversial _ athletes of our
time. Seven years after leaving the pro tennis circuit McEnroe is
still at it _ and not just on the court in seniors matches. He has
taken his swagger to the broadcasting booth, where he has drawn a
lot of attention, most of it good; last year, he was nominated for
an Emmy. And in February he becomes captain of the Davis Cup team.

YES, I'M VOTING FOR MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of my usual crowd are aghast at my announcing Sunday that
I'm voting for John McCain March 7, when five New England states
get their crack at the presidential primary candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am beyond bewilderment at your enthusiasm for John McCain,''
writes Amy Z. of South Strafford, Vt., who normally enjoys the
liberal-populist brew served up here thrice weekly. She checked out
McCain's Senate voting record online at the Web site
www.vote-smart.org and found ``that record would appall any
liberal, or indeed any moderate, voter.'' Well, Amy, not this one.
</P>
<P>
   I am not with McCain on dozens of issues: He's progun,
antiabortion, anti-minimum wage hike, anti-Clinton, anti-union, so
why am I with him?
</P>
<P>
   I know him. I've seen him in action. I've talked with him lots
of times. He's got . . . hmm, let's see what euphemism for courage
I'm allowed to type here . . . guts, that'll have to do.
</P>
<P>
   He's a Southwest Sun Belt conservative and a Republican, which
means he must buy into that partisan claptrap about smaller
gummint, lower taxes, the this-a-and-that-a of party divisions. But
I learned something when I worked in Washington, covering White
Houses back to Nixon and Congresses back when Democrats ran
everything: This is a big country, and Washington is where they
sort out issues that fracture less sturdy societies.
</P>
<P>
   On the overarching issues _ war and peace, corruption in
government, the ruthless influence of dirty money sloshing through
the bilges of our ship of state, he's in the right place. He's the
political enemy of people like Senators Trent Lott, the Senate
majority leader, and Mitch McConnell, the shrewd Kentuckian who
corrals soft money for the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough, already, with McCain,'' gripes Isabelle C. of
Randolph. She doubts he's the ``maverick'' I affirm. Echoes Jack B.
of Fort Lauderdale, ``You journalists are in love with McCain for a
reason the general Republican electorate will soon realize _ he's
really a Democrat.'' Somehow, Jackson, I doubt that will assuage
Amy Z. up in Vermont. ``His election would be disastrous for women
and likely the poor and lead to increasing militarization,'' writes
Lynne W. of Somerville. In fact, I'd argue his ascension might well
purge the money-changers from the temple and be good for the
oppressed.
</P>
<P>
   Al R. from Lowell, Mass. says he had eight guys sign up for the
National Rifle Association when they caught me (``that
flat-out-leftist wacko from the Globe'') on ``Crossfire.'' Al
claims anyone for outlawing soft money ``is a loon in the first
place.'' Hey, Al, can you shoot loons in Massachusetts? In fact,
the NRA and the loudest antiabortion fund-raisers fear McCain
because they feed out of the soft-money trough McCain would
eliminate. McCain can be cantankerous, but he does not go in the
tank like so many others.
</P>
<P>
   The gun lobby is with Bush, as are the whole trainload of
Washington lobbyists who helped fork over $70 million to the
governor, whose claim to be ``The Outsider'' is ludicrous. The Bush
camp is throwing all kinds of phony claims at McCain in South
Carolina, using massive phone banks to raise doubts about McCain's
character and truthfulness. The Arizonan turned the other cheek and
pulled his one negative ad about Bush _ comparing Bush's
truthfulness level to that of Mr. Clinton's. My view is it's a
mistake to turn the other cheek when the other guy and his pals are
mugging you in the alley. But McCain wants to win honorably, which
is more than you can say for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   One valuable Web site for reliable campaign finance info is the
Center for Responsive Politics at www.opensecrets.org, where you
get lots of straight dope. The center's Holly Bailey gleaned from
federal records that Bush has done exactly what he attacks McCain
for doing _ flying on cut-rate corporate jets furnished by campaign
contributors who do business with the government. Except
``Dubbaya'' doubled McCain. ``The Bush campaign reported more than
twice as many flights than McCain on planes borrowed from 35
companies, reporting 77 flights that cost Bush more than $152,000.
In contrast, McCain last year reported 35 flights on corporate
jets, for which his campaign reimbursed 13 companies $77,431.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Bush used the corporate jet-reimbursement
loophole twice as much as McCain, whom he maligns daily for that
practice. It's all legal if the firms are reimbursed for the cost
of a first-class ticket. This is a big bargain, because chartered
jets cost much more. McCain flew jets of Bell South, rail giant
CSX, Westfield Corp., and Paxson Corp. But Bush rode the jets of
Enron Corp., whose executives donated more than $92,000 to his
campaign; Occidental Corp., whose execs donated $20,000-plus, Texas
Utilities, Union Pacific, and other companies that do business with
Texas state government. Bush reimbursed Enron for eight rides last
year, to the tune of $25,000, but he was still ahead with Enron
givers by $67,000. Enron is vitally interested in Texas regulation
of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's attack ads continue to run round-the-clock in South
Carolina, where Bush is desperate to prevent another New Hampshire.
McCain is outgunned by 3 or 4 to 1 in the air, and his guerrilla
band on the ground is outmanned by the GOP establishment, which
dreads another Bush meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Forry, the street-smart young Boston journalist for the
weekly Dorchester Reporter, rooted around the vote-heavy precincts
of Dorchester and came up with a new breed of old-style Reagan
Democrats who are voting McCain March 7: ``I call them the
`McCain-iacs,' '' said Forry _ independents, and voters who usually
vote ``D'' but are attracted to McCain's cause.

<P>
   Hey, buddy, watch that cup of coffee. Whoa! Hate to tell you
this, but that brown splatter really stands out on the floral tie.
How much did that thing set you back? Seventy-five bucks? Ouch.
Great suit too. Worsted wool, eh? Hey, did you run all the way to
the office today _ I mean, you can't ignore those dark sweat marks
creeping down the pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   That was yesterday. Tomorrow, embarrassing _ and expensive _
clothing disasters will be history, because textile designers are
teaming up with materials scientists to develop fabrics that remain
fresh and wearable regardless of what you spill on them.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar cottons, wools and polyesters are getting face-lifts
from the atoms up. No longer will clothes simply adorn the body and
passively shield it from the elements. Fabrics are being coached,
molecule by molecule, to engage with their environments, to get in
the ring with odor, bacteria, heat, cold and dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Take that tie stain. Actually, don't take that stain. Buy a tie
with Teflon. The slippery polymer from DuPont is also making its
way into jackets, shirts and almost anything wearable.
</P>
<P>
   What once kept burned grease from sticking to frying pans has
been modified to protect individual fibers. The resulting fabrics
lose little in the fashion jungle, judging from their appearance in
the windows of Hugo Boss and Prada, and they slice dry-cleaning
bills in half.
</P>
<P>
   A stickier problem is the damage the body itself inflicts on
clothes. Sweating is a human's clumsy attempt to adjust to everyday
temperature swings. Textile engineers are working to create
so-called phase-change fabrics that keep the body perpetually
comfortable and sweat-free.
</P>
<P>
   A waxy compound developed a decade ago changes from a solid to a
liquid when heated and then slowly releases that heat and changes
back into a solid when cooled _ like H2O changing from ice to water
to ice.
</P>
<P>
   NASA and the U.S. Air Force planned to put this material into
gloves to keep pilots' hands warm, but the idea fell prey to budget
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado-based entrepreneurs Bernie Perry and Ed Payne purchased
patent rights for the compound and, after years of testing,
supplied retail stores with hiking boots lined with cloth permeated
with tiny capsules of the phase-change wax. Their material,
manufactured under the name Outlast, is being made into things like
socks, which keep feet within a comfortable 10-degree-variable
temperature zone.
</P>
<P>
   More sophisticated phase-change fabrics are on the way. Research
scientist Tyrone Vigo of the U.S. Department of Agriculture spent
the last decade developing a polymer called polyethylene glycol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polymer looks like a helix,''he says. ``It coils and
uncoils and acts like a thermal spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Outlast fabric, clothing impregnated with Vigo's
phase-change molecules keeps the wearer at a steady temperature.
</P>
<P>
   But temperature control is only the beginning. Vigo's versatile
material performs other tricks that come in handy when things turn
sweaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polyethylene glycol has a lot of hydrogen and oxygen, so it's
hydrophilic, or water loving,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When the molecule's thermal spring encounters damp heat _
perspiration, for example _ it uncoils, trapping the warmth, and
draws water away from the skin. If a cool breeze comes up and a
wearer stops perspiring, the spring reacts and coils, releasing
heat.
</P>
<P>
   The fabric can be formulated to maintain a range of
temperatures, kicking into action only if conditions get too hot or
cold.
</P>
<P>
   Developing a cost-effective process for bonding polyethylene
glycol to fabric took years. But now it's show time.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lister, president of Wisconsin Global Technologies, has
leased Vigo's patent on the material and confidently predicts the
polymer-coated fabric will be on store shelves within the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Lister breathlessly rattles off the virtues of clothing
containing the miracle molecule: ``Nontoxic, antimicrobial,
eliminates all odor-causing microbes, antistatic, antiwrinkle and
there's no shrinkage.''
</P>
<P>
   The elasticity of the molecules makes all fabrics tougher and
wrinkle resistant, while the molecules' tendency to soak up water
diffuses static charges.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Global Technologies' spin-off company, ThermoSense,
has begun manufacturing prototypes of phase-change slippers and
gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Those springlike polyethylene glycol molecules will be a boon
for the medical industry as well. For reasons still not totally
understood, microorganisms cannot survive on fabrics treated with
the polymer. Perhaps the water-loving molecules make the clothing
so dry that bacteria cannot survive, or more likely the molecules
alter fabric fibers so that bacteria cannot attach themselves.
</P>
<P>
   John Artley, president of Bayshore Holdings in New York City,
doesn't care; he's just happy to exploit the combination of
absorbency and antibacterial activity. Possibilities include
bandages that stop infection, and scrubs to protect doctors from
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan on making bedding, blankets, footwear, wound-care
dressings and incontinence products,'' Artley says.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is reviewing the products. And there's more than one way
to engineer killer clothing. HaloSource in Seattle developed a
process to incorporate N-halamines, compounds used in swimming
pools to stabilize chlorine, into clothing fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Attaching N-halamines to cotton gives chlorine atoms something
to hang on to and then, just as in a swimming pool, the chlorine
kills germs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, HaloSource's process will hit the market in
chlorine-engineered socks, diapers, bandages, medical uniforms and
air filters. When a garment begins to lose its potency, it can be
washed in chlorine bleach for a recharge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Acordis Acrylic Fibers in Bradford, England, has
engineered a fabric that targets other pests _ like those found in
a bed. Typically, a person shares an evening of rest with 2 million
dust mites, microscopic critters that feed off human skin cells and
cause health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Acordis' team of entomologists, chemists and materials
scientists came up with a surprising twist on acrylic fabrics. To
kill dust mites, the textile needed to take down the middleman, the

<P>
   Hey, buddy, watch that cup of coffee. Whoa! Hate to tell you
this, but that brown splatter really stands out on the floral tie.
How much did that thing set you back? Seventy-five bucks? Ouch.
Great suit too. Worsted wool, eh? Hey, did you run all the way to
the office today _ I mean, you can't ignore those dark sweat marks
creeping down the pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   That was yesterday. Tomorrow, embarrassing _ and expensive _
clothing disasters will be history, because textile designers are
teaming up with materials scientists to develop fabrics that remain
fresh and wearable regardless of what you spill on them.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar cottons, wools and polyesters are getting face-lifts
from the atoms up. No longer will clothes simply adorn the body and
passively shield it from the elements. Fabrics are being coached,
molecule by molecule, to engage with their environments, to get in
the ring with odor, bacteria, heat, cold and dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Take that tie stain. Actually, don't take that stain. Buy a tie
with Teflon. The slippery polymer from DuPont is also making its
way into jackets, shirts and almost anything wearable.
</P>
<P>
   What once kept burned grease from sticking to frying pans has
been modified to protect individual fibers. The resulting fabrics
lose little in the fashion jungle, judging from their appearance in
the windows of Hugo Boss and Prada, and they slice dry-cleaning
bills in half.
</P>
<P>
   A stickier problem is the damage the body itself inflicts on
clothes. Sweating is a human's clumsy attempt to adjust to everyday
temperature swings. Textile engineers are working to create
so-called phase-change fabrics that keep the body perpetually
comfortable and sweat-free.
</P>
<P>
   A waxy compound developed a decade ago changes from a solid to a
liquid when heated and then slowly releases that heat and changes
back into a solid when cooled _ like H2O changing from ice to water
to ice.
</P>
<P>
   NASA and the U.S. Air Force planned to put this material into
gloves to keep pilots' hands warm, but the idea fell prey to budget
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado-based entrepreneurs Bernie Perry and Ed Payne purchased
patent rights for the compound and, after years of testing,
supplied retail stores with hiking boots lined with cloth permeated
with tiny capsules of the phase-change wax. Their material,
manufactured under the name Outlast, is being made into things like
socks, which keep feet within a comfortable 10-degree-variable
temperature zone.
</P>
<P>
   More sophisticated phase-change fabrics are on the way. Research
scientist Tyrone Vigo of the U.S. Department of Agriculture spent
the last decade developing a polymer called polyethylene glycol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polymer looks like a helix,''he says. ``It coils and
uncoils and acts like a thermal spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Outlast fabric, clothing impregnated with Vigo's
phase-change molecules keeps the wearer at a steady temperature.
</P>
<P>
   But temperature control is only the beginning. Vigo's versatile
material performs other tricks that come in handy when things turn
sweaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polyethylene glycol has a lot of hydrogen and oxygen, so it's
hydrophilic, or water loving,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When the molecule's thermal spring encounters damp heat _
perspiration, for example _ it uncoils, trapping the warmth, and
draws water away from the skin. If a cool breeze comes up and a
wearer stops perspiring, the spring reacts and coils, releasing
heat.
</P>
<P>
   The fabric can be formulated to maintain a range of
temperatures, kicking into action only if conditions get too hot or
cold.
</P>
<P>
   Developing a cost-effective process for bonding polyethylene
glycol to fabric took years. But now it's show time.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lister, president of Wisconsin Global Technologies, has
leased Vigo's patent on the material and confidently predicts the
polymer-coated fabric will be on store shelves within the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Lister breathlessly rattles off the virtues of clothing
containing the miracle molecule: ``Nontoxic, antimicrobial,
eliminates all odor-causing microbes, antistatic, antiwrinkle and
there's no shrinkage.''
</P>
<P>
   The elasticity of the molecules makes all fabrics tougher and
wrinkle resistant, while the molecules' tendency to soak up water
diffuses static charges.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Global Technologies' spin-off company, ThermoSense,
has begun manufacturing prototypes of phase-change slippers and
gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Those springlike polyethylene glycol molecules will be a boon
for the medical industry as well. For reasons still not totally
understood, microorganisms cannot survive on fabrics treated with
the polymer. Perhaps the water-loving molecules make the clothing
so dry that bacteria cannot survive, or more likely the molecules
alter fabric fibers so that bacteria cannot attach themselves.
</P>
<P>
   John Artley, president of Bayshore Holdings in New York City,
doesn't care; he's just happy to exploit the combination of
absorbency and antibacterial activity. Possibilities include
bandages that stop infection, and scrubs to protect doctors from
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan on making bedding, blankets, footwear, wound-care
dressings and incontinence products,'' Artley says.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is reviewing the products. And there's more than one way
to engineer killer clothing. HaloSource in Seattle developed a
process to incorporate N-halamines, compounds used in swimming
pools to stabilize chlorine, into clothing fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Attaching N-halamines to cotton gives chlorine atoms something
to hang on to and then, just as in a swimming pool, the chlorine
kills germs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, HaloSource's process will hit the market in
chlorine-engineered socks, diapers, bandages, medical uniforms and
air filters. When a garment begins to lose its potency, it can be
washed in chlorine bleach for a recharge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Acordis Acrylic Fibers in Bradford, England, has
engineered a fabric that targets other pests _ like those found in
a bed. Typically, a person shares an evening of rest with 2 million
dust mites, microscopic critters that feed off human skin cells and
cause health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Acordis' team of entomologists, chemists and materials
scientists came up with a surprising twist on acrylic fabrics. To
kill dust mites, the textile needed to take down the middleman, the
fungus Aspergillus repens, which breaks down flakes of human skin
into dust-mite meals. The company found a way to get acrylic fibers
to absorb a slow-release chemical that stops the fungus from
reproducing. Without the fungus, the mites eventually starve.
</P>
<P>
   Even more advanced engineered clothing will emerge from devices
that assemble textiles atom by atom. Such nano-technology mills
could completely transform how fabric is made.
</P>
<P>
   No longer would giant factories turn out hundreds of tons of

<P>
   Every year, Hans-Joachim Pachur leaves his office in a pleasant
villa opposite the Berlin botanical garden and catches a plane for
Libya. In Tripoli he meets up with several colleagues and gets
ready for the desert.
</P>
<P>
   A geographer at the Free University of Berlin, Pachur has been
exploring the Sahara for the last quarter century. He and his team
are on a mission to find evidence that this barren land once
contained substantial amounts of water.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, in the Murzuq Sand Sea of southwestern Libya, Pachur
found animal bones as well as windblown ridges of lake-bed chalk _
evidence that the region had been dotted with bodies of freshwater.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago in the northern Sudan, Pachur found traces of a lake
that may have been as large as Erie. In that same region he traced
the course of a river that once flowed east into the upper Nile. He
has found other rivers that flowed from the Tibesti Mountains 600
miles north to the Mediterranean Sea, through the core of the
Sahara. That region now gets less than two-tenths of an inch of
rain each year.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lost rivers, between 6,000 and 9,000 years ago,
giraffes munched on acacia trees and hippos wallowed in mud. And
people lived there too. Pachur believes the Sahara then was an
Eden.
</P>
<P>
   ``People did not experience this region the way we do, as a
hostile environment,'' he says. ``For them, it provided enormous
possibilities to blossom.''
</P>
<P>
   But then the climate began to change, and the desert came. It
began sometime after 6,000 years ago. Within just a few centuries,
a gentle, fertile region the size of the United States was
transformed into one of the harshest places on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Saharans had to leave. Many must have migrated east into the
valley of the Nile, their closest source of water. That exodus,
some archaeologists think, may be the event that triggered the rise
of the pharaohs in Egypt a little more than 5,000 years ago. Eden
gave way to one of the planet's first great civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   Miracle or catastrophe, the birth of the Sahara was not an act
of God. At the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, just
outside Berlin, a theoretical climatologist named Martin Claussen
and his graduate student Claudia Kubatzki have recently been able
to re-create the desert-building process on a computer. They say
that ultimately what keeps rain from falling on the Sahara is a
lack of plants _ which is not as paradoxical as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen, who uses Pachur's data to anchor his model to reality,
has never been to the Sahara. But then he has never been to Jupiter
either, and in a way that's the starting point for any attempt to
explain the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter's gravity and Venus' gravity pulls on Earth, causing our
planet to tilt on its axis to varying degrees. The tilt is what
gives Earth seasons: Summer happens in the northern hemisphere when
it is tilted toward the sun. The sun's zenith during this period
reaches as far north as the tropic of Cancer, which at present runs
through the Gilf Kebir and the southern edge of the Murzuq. That
latitude, 23.5 degrees, is the present tilt angle.
</P>
<P>
   But over the course of a 41,000-year cycle, the tilt and the
tropic get as high as 24.5 and as low as 22.1 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   While Jupiter and Venus are tilting the Earth's axis, the sun
and moon are causing it to wobble like a top; that changes the time
of perihelion, the point on Earth's elliptical orbit at which the
planet comes closest to the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Together these two cycles _ along with even slower perturbations
in the shape of the orbit _ determine how much sunlight falls on a
given latitude at a given season. They are called Milankovitch
cycles, after the Serbian mathematician Milutin Milankovitch, who
proposed in the 1930s that such regularly occurring variations
could explain why Earth's climate goes in and out of ice ages.
</P>
<P>
   According to this theory, the most recent ice sheets began
retreating from Canada and Eurasia around 17,000 years ago because
that's when the northern hemisphere started getting enough sun
during the summer to melt them.
</P>
<P>
   About 9,000 years ago, the northern sunlight curve was reaching
a peak; climatologists call this period the Holocene Optimum. The
axial tilt was higher than it is now, around 24 degrees, and
perihelion was in July. Both factors made for especially hot
northern summers and _ though it may seem surprising _ for a
greener Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ice age, the Sahara was a desert. But as the
summers got hotter, they also got wetter. During the summer, the
African landmass heats up more than the adjacent Atlantic, and that
temperature contrast drives the monsoon: as hot air rises up and
away over the land, moist winds flow northeast from the Gulf of
Guinea to replace it. Hotter summers mean a stronger monsoon that
brings more rainfall farther north, into the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, that has been the whole explanation for why the
desert once bloomed _ but it just doesn't work, Claussen says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to reproduce that process in a computer-model
atmosphere, the results are disappointing,'' he says. ``You end up
with a Sahara desert more or less where it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit more rain does fall on the desert, but not nearly enough
to support abundant vegetation or to create lakes. A few years ago,
Claussen had a hunch: Maybe the Sahara wasn't turning green in the
models simply because the models, unlike reality, weren't letting
it.
</P>
<P>
   Every gardener knows, he says, that climate zones dictate what
plants can grow where. But what about the reverse process _ might
vegetation have an influence on climate? In short, yes.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least two ways in which vegetation itself might
procure the rainfall it needs. First, ground covered by plants is
darker than a desert; if you look at satellite images, the Sahara
is the brightest feature on Earth after the polar ice caps. It
reflects away as much as 40 percent of the sunlight it receives and
sends most of the rest right back into space, through cloudless
skies, as infrared radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Human bodies get fried in the Sahara, but as far as the
atmosphere is concerned, the desert is a net cold source _ and so
most of the time air flows into the region at high altitude and
sinks, forming a dry region of high pressure.
</P>
<P>
   If there were enough plants there, darkened ground would absorb
more sunlight, the atmosphere above the plants would be heated, and
the warm air would rise _ which is a prerequisite for clouds and
rain.
</P>
<P>
   The other prerequisite, of course, is water. Plant-covered soil
is invariably wetter than desert sand. When moist soil absorbs
sunlight, the water evaporates. In the atmosphere it condenses
again, releasing energy that fuels updrafts, and thereby forms
clouds. The clouds rain, returning water to the soil. The updrafts
strengthen the monsoon, pulling in more moisture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive, self-reinforcing feedback loop,'' Claussen
says.
</P>
<P>
   With his colleagues at Potsdam, Claussen developed a model that
incorporated this positive feedback. They turned its clock back to
9,000 years ago, and started it running with the sunlight
distribution prescribed for that date by Milankovitch, and lo! they
got a Sahara savanna.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen let the model keep running. The positive feedback works
as well in reverse. By 6,000 years ago, Earth's axis was tilting
less than it had been, heading toward its current angle, and
perihelion was heading out of northern summer and toward winter.
Northern summers were getting cooler, the African monsoon a bit
weaker, and the vegetation in the savanna sparser.
</P>
<P>
   All this was happening very gradually; the orbital cycles are
subtle. But at some point _ in Claussen's model it was around 5,500
years ago _ the system crossed a threshold: the feedback kicked in.
Enough vegetation had been lost from the Sahara, enough bare ground
exposed, that precipitation declined sharply and barrenness began
to spread like wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly things went downhill very rapidly,'' Claussen says.
Within a few centuries the cool moist soil had become sand.
</P>
<P>
   If we followed the Milankovitch clock, we would need to pass
through another ice age before the Sahara turned green again, but
we're not sticking to that timetable. Global warming caused by
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could, a century or two
from now, provide the nudge to the monsoon that the tilt and wobble
of Earth's axis did in the middle Holocene.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen's model suggests it's possible, though he doesn't much
like to talk about it. The real message of his simulations, he
says, is that feedbacks in Earth's climate have in the past
produced abrupt climate changes that disrupted human societies
tremendously _ and we're not yet capable of predicting which
changes lie in our future. &QL;

<P>
   Every gardener knows, he says, that climate zones dictate what
plants can grow where. But what about the reverse process _ might
vegetation have an influence on climate? In short, yes.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least two ways in which vegetation itself might
procure the rainfall it needs. First, ground covered by plants is
darker than a desert; if you look at satellite images, the Sahara
is the brightest feature on Earth after the polar ice caps. It
reflects away as much as 40 percent of the sunlight it receives and
sends most of the rest right back into space, through cloudless
skies, as infrared radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Human bodies get fried in the Sahara, but as far as the
atmosphere is concerned, the desert is a net cold source _ and so
most of the time air flows into the region at high altitude and
sinks, forming a dry region of high pressure.
</P>
<P>
   If there were enough plants there, darkened ground would absorb
more sunlight, the atmosphere above the plants would be heated, and
the warm air would rise _ which is a prerequisite for clouds and
rain.
</P>
<P>
   The other prerequisite, of course, is water. Plant-covered soil
is invariably wetter than desert sand. When moist soil absorbs
sunlight, the water evaporates. In the atmosphere it condenses
again, releasing energy that fuels updrafts, and thereby forms
clouds. The clouds rain, returning water to the soil. The updrafts
strengthen the monsoon, pulling in more moisture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive, self-reinforcing feedback loop,'' Claussen
says.
</P>
<P>
   With his colleagues at Potsdam, Claussen developed a model that
incorporated this positive feedback. They turned its clock back to
9,000 years ago, and started it running with the sunlight
distribution prescribed for that date by Milankovitch, and lo! they
got a Sahara savanna.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen let the model keep running. The positive feedback works
as well in reverse. By 6,000 years ago, Earth's axis was tilting
less than it had been, heading toward its current angle, and
perihelion was heading out of northern summer and toward winter.
Northern summers were getting cooler, the African monsoon a bit
weaker, and the vegetation in the savanna sparser.
</P>
<P>
   All this was happening very gradually; the orbital cycles are
subtle. But at some point _ in Claussen's model it was around 5,500
years ago _ the system crossed a threshold: the feedback kicked in.
Enough vegetation had been lost from the Sahara, enough bare ground
exposed, that precipitation declined sharply and barrenness began
to spread like wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly things went downhill very rapidly,'' Claussen says.
Within a few centuries the cool moist soil had become sand.
</P>
<P>
   If we followed the Milankovitch clock, we would need to pass
through another ice age before the Sahara turned green again, but
we're not sticking to that timetable. Global warming caused by
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could, a century or two
from now, provide the nudge to the monsoon that the tilt and wobble
of Earth's axis did in the middle Holocene.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen's model suggests it's possible, though he doesn't much
like to talk about it. The real message of his simulations, he
says, is that feedbacks in Earth's climate have in the past
produced abrupt climate changes that disrupted human societies
tremendously _ and we're not yet capable of predicting which
changes lie in our future. &QL;

<P>
   Hey, buddy, watch that cup of coffee. Whoa! Hate to tell you
this, but that brown splatter really stands out on the floral tie.
How much did that thing set you back? Seventy-five bucks? Ouch.
Great suit too. Worsted wool, eh? Hey, did you run all the way to
the office today _ I mean, you can't ignore those dark sweat marks
creeping down the pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   That was yesterday. Tomorrow, embarrassing _ and expensive _
clothing disasters will be history, because textile designers are
teaming up with materials scientists to develop fabrics that remain
fresh and wearable regardless of what you spill on them.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar cottons, wools and polyesters are getting face-lifts
from the atoms up. No longer will clothes simply adorn the body and
passively shield it from the elements. Fabrics are being coached,
molecule by molecule, to engage with their environments, to get in
the ring with odor, bacteria, heat, cold and dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Take that tie stain. Actually, don't take that stain. Buy a tie
with Teflon. The slippery polymer from DuPont is also making its
way into jackets, shirts and almost anything wearable.
</P>
<P>
   What once kept burned grease from sticking to frying pans has
been modified to protect individual fibers. The resulting fabrics
lose little in the fashion jungle, judging from their appearance in
the windows of Hugo Boss and Prada, and they slice dry-cleaning
bills in half.
</P>
<P>
   A stickier problem is the damage the body itself inflicts on
clothes. Sweating is a human's clumsy attempt to adjust to everyday
temperature swings. Textile engineers are working to create
so-called phase-change fabrics that keep the body perpetually
comfortable and sweat-free.
</P>
<P>
   A waxy compound developed a decade ago changes from a solid to a
liquid when heated and then slowly releases that heat and changes
back into a solid when cooled _ like H2O changing from ice to water
to ice.
</P>
<P>
   NASA and the U.S. Air Force planned to put this material into
gloves to keep pilots' hands warm, but the idea fell prey to budget
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado-based entrepreneurs Bernie Perry and Ed Payne purchased
patent rights for the compound and, after years of testing,
supplied retail stores with hiking boots lined with cloth permeated
with tiny capsules of the phase-change wax. Their material,
manufactured under the name Outlast, is being made into things like
socks, which keep feet within a comfortable 10-degree-variable
temperature zone.
</P>
<P>
   More sophisticated phase-change fabrics are on the way. Research
scientist Tyrone Vigo of the U.S. Department of Agriculture spent
the last decade developing a polymer called polyethylene glycol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polymer looks like a helix,''he says. ``It coils and
uncoils and acts like a thermal spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Outlast fabric, clothing impregnated with Vigo's
phase-change molecules keeps the wearer at a steady temperature.
</P>
<P>
   But temperature control is only the beginning. Vigo's versatile
material performs other tricks that come in handy when things turn
sweaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polyethylene glycol has a lot of hydrogen and oxygen, so it's
hydrophilic, or water loving,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When the molecule's thermal spring encounters damp heat _
perspiration, for example _ it uncoils, trapping the warmth, and
draws water away from the skin. If a cool breeze comes up and a
wearer stops perspiring, the spring reacts and coils, releasing
heat.
</P>
<P>
   The fabric can be formulated to maintain a range of
temperatures, kicking into action only if conditions get too hot or
cold.
</P>
<P>
   Developing a cost-effective process for bonding polyethylene
glycol to fabric took years. But now it's show time.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lister, president of Wisconsin Global Technologies, has
leased Vigo's patent on the material and confidently predicts the
polymer-coated fabric will be on store shelves within the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Lister breathlessly rattles off the virtues of clothing
containing the miracle molecule: ``Nontoxic, antimicrobial,
eliminates all odor-causing microbes, antistatic, antiwrinkle and
there's no shrinkage.''
</P>
<P>
   The elasticity of the molecules makes all fabrics tougher and
wrinkle resistant, while the molecules' tendency to soak up water
diffuses static charges.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Global Technologies' spin-off company, ThermoSense,
has begun manufacturing prototypes of phase-change slippers and
gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Those springlike polyethylene glycol molecules will be a boon
for the medical industry as well. For reasons still not totally
understood, microorganisms cannot survive on fabrics treated with
the polymer. Perhaps the water-loving molecules make the clothing
so dry that bacteria cannot survive, or more likely the molecules
alter fabric fibers so that bacteria cannot attach themselves.
</P>
<P>
   John Artley, president of Bayshore Holdings in New York City,
doesn't care; he's just happy to exploit the combination of
absorbency and antibacterial activity. Possibilities include
bandages that stop infection, and scrubs to protect doctors from
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan on making bedding, blankets, footwear, wound-care
dressings and incontinence products,'' Artley says.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is reviewing the products. And there's more than one way
to engineer killer clothing. HaloSource in Seattle developed a
process to incorporate N-halamines, compounds used in swimming
pools to stabilize chlorine, into clothing fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Attaching N-halamines to cotton gives chlorine atoms something
to hang on to and then, just as in a swimming pool, the chlorine
kills germs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, HaloSource's process will hit the market in
chlorine-engineered socks, diapers, bandages, medical uniforms and
air filters. When a garment begins to lose its potency, it can be
washed in chlorine bleach for a recharge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Acordis Acrylic Fibers in Bradford, England, has
engineered a fabric that targets other pests _ like those found in
a bed. Typically, a person shares an evening of rest with 2 million
dust mites, microscopic critters that feed off human skin cells and
cause health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Acordis' team of entomologists, chemists and materials
scientists came up with a surprising twist on acrylic fabrics. To
kill dust mites, the textile needed to take down the middleman, the
fungus Aspergillus repens, which breaks down flakes of human skin
into dust-mite meals. The company found a way to get acrylic fibers
to absorb a slow-release chemical that stops the fungus from
reproducing. Without the fungus, the mites eventually starve.
</P>
<P>
   Even more advanced engineered clothing will emerge from devices
that assemble textiles atom by atom. Such nano-technology mills
could completely transform how fabric is made.
</P>
<P>
   No longer would giant factories turn out hundreds of tons of
cloth a day. Instead, says materials engineer David Forrest,
president of the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing, nano-mills
will spit out custom fabrics from contraptions the size of
photocopy machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raw materials such as nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen will be
put into a desk-size unit,'' Forrest explains, ``which will
rearrange the elements and control the trajectories of all the
molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   What's he got in mind? Clothing that incorporates sensors to
detect rips and tears, alerting paramecium-size robotic crews to
execute repairs by means of the same atomic manipulation used to
make the garment in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   What will they think of next?

FAR RIGHT'S ASCENT DIVIDES AUSTRIAN INTELLECTUALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA _ Maybe it was just coincidence, but a few days after the
far right Freedom Party took power in Austria, Walter Famler, the
editor of a left-leaning literary magazine, got a letter from the
federal government informing him that it was canceling its
subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Famler doesn't think the order came from Joerg Haider, the
charismatic leader of the Freedom Party who has a habit of speaking
sympathetically about Nazis while demeaning liberals and
immigrants. Instead, he sees a more worrisome possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some civil servant decided it would not look good to have our
magazine in government offices,'' said Famler, editor and publisher
of Wespennest, which publishes essays by many of Austria's leading
intellectuals. ``Self-censorship is worse and harder to confront
than official censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Freedom Party and the mainstream conservative
People's Party formed a coalition government three weeks ago,
intellectuals and artists have engaged in a heated debate whether
the rise of the far fight imperils intellectual and artistic
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   While the government has not published its cultural agenda, the
new culture minister, Frank Morak, has suggested there will be
budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   While a few artists have likened the arrival of the Freedom
Party to that of the National Socialists in 1938, when the Nazis
annexed a willing Austria, many others, like Famler, consider that
a gross exaggeration and see the rise of the right here as
something that should inspire caution, not panic.
</P>
<P>
   Like the reaction to Haider's party taking power in general, the
outrage among artists and intellectuals seems to have been stronger
outside the country. Lou Reed, the ageless American rocker,
canceled an upcoming concert in Vienna. Elie Wiesel, the
Romanian-born Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Boston University
professor, canceled a lecture in May. French actress Catherine
Deneuve canceled her appearance at the Opera Ball, Vienna's premier
social event. (The Vienna State Opera is of particular interest in
Boston because that will be the new home of outgoing Boston
Symphony Orchestra music director Seiji Ozawa in 2003.)
</P>
<P>
   Sylvain Cambreling, conductor of Germany's Sudwestrundfunk
Orchestra, said that while he is committed to play in this year's
Salzburg Festival, he would no longer perform in Austria because,
``I cannot work with people I consider to be fascists.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Mortier, the Belgian-born artistic director of the
Salzburg Festival who has complained about government interference
in the past, pushed up his departure by a year because of the
Freedom Party's rise.
</P>
<P>
   Artists also have said the rise of the Freedom Party is a threat
to civility and, by extension, artistic integrity. Elfriede
Jelinek, one of Austria's leading dramatists, has forbidden any of
her plays from being performed as long as the Freedom Party is in
power.
</P>
<P>
   While Jelinek also threatened to leave, Ioan Holender, director
of the Vienna State Opera, said artists and intellectuals have a
duty to stay and express their dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not happy with the situation,'' he said. ``But in times
like this we should not close the doors but open our mouths louder.
If we close the doors now, we do exactly what happened with the
Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   With that last sentiment, Holender hit on what has transformed
this debate from one that could be dismissed as just a bunch of
pampered elitists complaining about threats to their subsidies to
one that has extraordinary resonance in a city that could tolerate
the racist diatribes of a young Adolf Hitler and could find no way
to save Sigmund Freud from forced exile.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reaction here, and especially outside Austria, can
be explained by history, especially that of the Holocaust, said
Peter Gerlich, a professor of political science at the University
of Vienna. ``It is an exaggeration to call Haider a fascist,'' said
Gerlich. ``But it doesn't matter if he's a Nazi, because so many
people outside Austria think he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Famler said he is in constant contact with intellectuals across
Europe and is disturbed by what they are telling him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a conversation with a German intellectual, and he
said intellectuals outside of Austria are developing a picture in
which we are the new Serbs. This is very dangerous. Intellectually
and artistically, we could be seen as the new pariah state, whether
that reputation is deserved or not.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, when the Nazis rolled into this gracious city, many
artists and intellectuals rolled out. Some fled because they knew
their artistic integrity would be compromised. Others, like Freud,
the father of psychoanalysis, were Jews and fled for their lives as
well as for their intellectual freedom. Freud got out, but his four
sisters were not as lucky. They were sent to concentration camps
and, like all but 2,000 of the 60,000 Viennese Jews sent to the
camps, were killed. There were 185,000 Jews in Vienna before 1938;
today there are 12,000.
</P>
<P>
   It is often said, only half in jest, that Austria's greatest
accomplishment was that it convinced the world that Hitler was
German and Beethoven was Austrian. In the city where Hitler was
allowed to hone his Aryan theories by arguing them in Vienna's
cafes while Freud had to die in exile in London, the question about
the relationship between the intellectual and the government
remains volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian artists and intellectuals depend heavily on government
subsidies. Famler's magazine, for example, gets a quarter of its
budget from the government. Now that the government has canceled
its subscription, he wonders if the magazine's grant is next. He
said the 12-year-old magazine would fold without its subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, sitting in his office in the capital of Carinthia, the
southern province where he is governor, laughed out loud when told
that artists and intellectuals are worried that the government will
cut back heavily on culture, and seek to censor art and writings
that are critical of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the opposite will happen,'' said Haider, whose office
walls are adorned with the usual ``grip-and-grin'' snapshots of
politicians and with several postmodern paintings. ``I'm
responsible for culture here in Carinthia, and we have spent more,
not less than the last government here. We started a program to
enlarge subsidies. Just ask the actors and artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced. The relatives of the late Ingeborg
Bachmann, a great Austrian poet and author, said Bachmann's name
could not be used on the annual literature prize given in her
memory until Haider guarantees freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing hard on a thin cigar, Gerlich, the bearded, bespectacled
professor, said he does not think Haider will clamp down on the
freedom of expression any harder than the Republicans in Congress
who went after the National Endowment for the Arts for funding
controversial pieces
</P>
<P>
   ``Culturally, I have no fear,'' Gerlich said, exhaling a long
stream of smoke into the air. ``It's simply not true to say that
Austrian civic society is not aware of the past and has not learned
from it. We are and we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Famler, the editor who puts a high-brow magazine out on a
shoestring, is more concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international image is so damaged it will take at least a
decade to get over this,'' he said. ``Intellectuals are leaving.
International performers will not perform here. International
orchestras are cancelling.''
</P>
<P>
   But while he believes calling Haider a Nazi is an exaggeration,
Famler defends the outrage of some artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an overreaction,'' he said. ``Artists send signals.
It is right and proper that they express their concern.''

<P>
   Every year, Hans-Joachim Pachur leaves his office in a pleasant
villa opposite the Berlin botanical garden and catches a plane for
Libya. In Tripoli he meets up with several colleagues and gets
ready for the desert.
</P>
<P>
   A geographer at the Free University of Berlin, Pachur has been
exploring the Sahara for the last quarter century. He and his team
are on a mission to find evidence that this barren land once
contained substantial amounts of water.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, in the Murzuq Sand Sea of southwestern Libya, Pachur
found animal bones as well as windblown ridges of lake-bed chalk _
evidence that the region had been dotted with bodies of freshwater.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago in the northern Sudan, Pachur found traces of a lake
that may have been as large as Erie. In that same region he traced
the course of a river that once flowed east into the upper Nile. He
has found other rivers that flowed from the Tibesti Mountains 600
miles north to the Mediterranean Sea, through the core of the
Sahara. That region now gets less than two-tenths of an inch of
rain each year.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lost rivers, between 6,000 and 9,000 years ago,
giraffes munched on acacia trees and hippos wallowed in mud. And
people lived there too. Pachur believes the Sahara then was an
Eden.
</P>
<P>
   ``People did not experience this region the way we do, as a
hostile environment,'' he says. ``For them, it provided enormous
possibilities to blossom.''
</P>
<P>
   But then the climate began to change, and the desert came. It
began sometime after 6,000 years ago. Within just a few centuries,
a gentle, fertile region the size of the United States was
transformed into one of the harshest places on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Saharans had to leave. Many must have migrated east into the
valley of the Nile, their closest source of water. That exodus,
some archaeologists think, may be the event that triggered the rise
of the pharaohs in Egypt a little more than 5,000 years ago. Eden
gave way to one of the planet's first great civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   Miracle or catastrophe, the birth of the Sahara was not an act
of God. At the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, just
outside Berlin, a theoretical climatologist named Martin Claussen
and his graduate student Claudia Kubatzki have recently been able
to re-create the desert-building process on a computer. They say
that ultimately what keeps rain from falling on the Sahara is a
lack of plants _ which is not as paradoxical as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen, who uses Pachur's data to anchor his model to reality,
has never been to the Sahara. But then he has never been to Jupiter
either, and in a way that's the starting point for any attempt to
explain the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter's gravity and Venus' gravity pulls on Earth, causing our
planet to tilt on its axis to varying degrees. The tilt is what
gives Earth seasons: Summer happens in the northern hemisphere when
it is tilted toward the sun. The sun's zenith during this period
reaches as far north as the tropic of Cancer, which at present runs
through the Gilf Kebir and the southern edge of the Murzuq. That
latitude, 23.5 degrees, is the present tilt angle.
</P>
<P>
   But over the course of a 41,000-year cycle, the tilt and the
tropic get as high as 24.5 and as low as 22.1 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   While Jupiter and Venus are tilting the Earth's axis, the sun
and moon are causing it to wobble like a top; that changes the time
of perihelion, the point on Earth's elliptical orbit at which the
planet comes closest to the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Together these two cycles _ along with even slower perturbations
in the shape of the orbit _ determine how much sunlight falls on a
given latitude at a given season. They are called Milankovitch
cycles, after the Serbian mathematician Milutin Milankovitch, who
proposed in the 1930s that such regularly occurring variations
could explain why Earth's climate goes in and out of ice ages.
</P>
<P>
   According to this theory, the most recent ice sheets began
retreating from Canada and Eurasia around 17,000 years ago because
that's when the northern hemisphere started getting enough sun
during the summer to melt them.
</P>
<P>
   About 9,000 years ago, the northern sunlight curve was reaching
a peak; climatologists call this period the Holocene Optimum. The
axial tilt was higher than it is now, around 24 degrees, and
perihelion was in July. Both factors made for especially hot
northern summers and _ though it may seem surprising _ for a
greener Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ice age, the Sahara was a desert. But as the
summers got hotter, they also got wetter. During the summer, the
African landmass heats up more than the adjacent Atlantic, and that
temperature contrast drives the monsoon: as hot air rises up and
away over the land, moist winds flow northeast from the Gulf of
Guinea to replace it. Hotter summers mean a stronger monsoon that
brings more rainfall farther north, into the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, that has been the whole explanation for why the
desert once bloomed _ but it just doesn't work, Claussen says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to reproduce that process in a computer-model
atmosphere, the results are disappointing,'' he says. ``You end up
with a Sahara desert more or less where it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit more rain does fall on the desert, but not nearly enough
to support abundant vegetation or to create lakes. A few years ago,
Claussen had a hunch: Maybe the Sahara wasn't turning green in the
models simply because the models, unlike reality, weren't letting
it.
</P>
<P>
   Every gardener knows, he says, that climate zones dictate what
plants can grow where. But what about the reverse process _ might
vegetation have an influence on climate? In short, yes.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least two ways in which vegetation itself might
procure the rainfall it needs. First, ground covered by plants is
darker than a desert; if you look at satellite images, the Sahara
is the brightest feature on Earth after the polar ice caps. It
reflects away as much as 40 percent of the sunlight it receives and
sends most of the rest right back into space, through cloudless
skies, as infrared radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Human bodies get fried in the Sahara, but as far as the
atmosphere is concerned, the desert is a net cold source _ and so
most of the time air flows into the region at high altitude and
sinks, forming a dry region of high pressure.
</P>
<P>
   If there were enough plants there, darkened ground would absorb
more sunlight, the atmosphere above the plants would be heated, and
the warm air would rise _ which is a prerequisite for clouds and
rain.
</P>
<P>
   The other prerequisite, of course, is water. Plant-covered soil
is invariably wetter than desert sand. When moist soil absorbs
sunlight, the water evaporates. In the atmosphere it condenses
again, releasing energy that fuels updrafts, and thereby forms
clouds. The clouds rain, returning water to the soil. The updrafts
strengthen the monsoon, pulling in more moisture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive, self-reinforcing feedback loop,'' Claussen
says.
</P>
<P>
   With his colleagues at Potsdam, Claussen developed a model that
incorporated this positive feedback. They turned its clock back to
9,000 years ago, and started it running with the sunlight
distribution prescribed for that date by Milankovitch, and lo! they
got a Sahara savanna.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen let the model keep running. The positive feedback works
as well in reverse. By 6,000 years ago, Earth's axis was tilting
less than it had been, heading toward its current angle, and
perihelion was heading out of northern summer and toward winter.
Northern summers were getting cooler, the African monsoon a bit
weaker, and the vegetation in the savanna sparser.
</P>
<P>
   All this was happening very gradually; the orbital cycles are
subtle. But at some point _ in Claussen's model it was around 5,500
years ago _ the system crossed a threshold: the feedback kicked in.
Enough vegetation had been lost from the Sahara, enough bare ground
exposed, that precipitation declined sharply and barrenness began
to spread like wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly things went downhill very rapidly,'' Claussen says.
Within a few centuries the cool moist soil had become sand.
</P>
<P>
   If we followed the Milankovitch clock, we would need to pass
through another ice age before the Sahara turned green again, but
we're not sticking to that timetable. Global warming caused by
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could, a century or two
from now, provide the nudge to the monsoon that the tilt and wobble
of Earth's axis did in the middle Holocene.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen's model suggests it's possible, though he doesn't much
like to talk about it. The real message of his simulations, he
says, is that feedbacks in Earth's climate have in the past
produced abrupt climate changes that disrupted human societies
tremendously _ and we're not yet capable of predicting which
changes lie in our future. &QL;

INVESTORS WARM TO MILLER'S NEW MILLENNIUM FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you ran a company, would you have one of your star employees
work only two days week? If you owned a baseball team, would you
use one of your top players only three innings per game?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is obvious. Of course you wouldn't. So why, if you
are Fidelity Investments, do you have Neal Miller manage only $3.6
billion worth of mutual fund assets, peanuts by today's standards?
</P>
<P>
   Miller is one of Fidelity's stars, a Peter Lynch style manager
who finds lots of different ways to make money. Since he started
the New Millennium Fund in December 1992, he has had an average
annual return of 34.2 percent, far above the 20.7 percent return of
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index. According to Lipper Inc., Miller
ranked first among his 46 peers in the mid-cap growth category over
that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, New Millennium was up a stunning 108 percent.
Unfortunately, relatively few investors got a piece of that action.
New Millennium has been closed to new investors since May 1996.
Only existing customers can put money in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   A little history is in order here. When New Millennium was
created in 1992, Fidelity promised it would never get bigger than
$500 million. The decision was not hard to understand. The greater
the cash flow into a fund, the harder a manager has to work to
invest the money. In a big fund, a manager also may be forced to
move up the capitalization ladder and buy larger stocks than he
would like.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity didn't honor its initial pledge. When New Millennium
reached $500 million, in 1995, the fund stayed open. But the next
year, with assets still well under $1 billion, Fidelity shut the
door. In an interview last year, Miller said the fund's small size
was a plus. Last week, a Fidelity spokesman said there were no
plans to reopen New Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   We don't buy that. In fact, we think Fidelity ought to give
serious consideration to opening the door and letting some new
investors inside.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, quite a few other mutual fund companies manage to
run successful small and mid-cap funds with far more than the $3
billion that Miller runs. Putnam's Vista fund has more than $9
billion in assets; T. Rowe Price's New Horizon fund has close to $7
billion under management.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Miller does not stick all that closely to the strict
definitions of market cap. A mid-cap stock is supposed to be one
with a value of less than $10 billion. Yet at the end of 1999,
Miller's holdings included Qualcomm (market cap: $95 billion),
Veritas Software ($43 billion), CMGI ($30 billion), and Micron
Technology ($20 billion).
</P>
<P>
   The truth is $10 billion doesn't go as far as it used to _ not
when brand-new companies do IPOs and have market values of $15
billion at the end of the first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we are not part of the camp that believes size matters
all that much. Robert Stansky has done a nice job managing the $100
billion Magellan Fund. Is there any reason to think Neal Miller is
any less skillful?
</P>
<P>
   ``Fidelity managers are smart enough to put cash to work,'' said
Jim Lowell, editor of Fidelity Investor, a newsletter. ``I don't
like to see managers having their hands tied behind their backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially Miller's. The guy is an original. He claims to get
his ideas by reading up to 300 periodicals, everything from
``American Funeral Director'' to ``Bandwidth.'' In an interview
with one of Fidelity's in-house publications last year, he
explained his investment style this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on a bank overlooking a calm sailboat race and what I see
is what all other investors see. But what I am looking for is
happening outside that efficient picture. I am looking at the cloud
formation on the horizon, which is what generates the wind which
will ultimately decide how the race evolves and who will win. I'm
looking for a change dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   Burt Greenwald, a Philadelphia mutual fund consultant, puts it
simply. ``No question Miller is a star,'' he said. Greenwald thinks
Fidelity could create a ``son of Millennium'' to leverage Miller's
talents.
</P>
<P>
   Giving investors a shot at Miller also would be good for
Fidelity. The mutual fund giant has seen money flow out of its
conservative funds and into its aggressive ones. Funds like
Aggressive Growth and Growth Company have ballooned in the past
year. Erin Sullivan, the manager of Aggressive Growth, resigned
Monday to run her own hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Fidelity is it doesn't have enough hot funds to
offer investors. David O'Leary, president of Alpha Equity Research,
thinks the lack of exciting funds explains why Fidelity took in $2
billion in new money in January, compared to $8 billion for red-hot
Janus, a Denver-based mutual fund complex.
</P>
<P>
   Why not a ``new'' New Millennium fund for the new millennium? It
would be good for Fidelity and good for investors.
</P>
<P>
   So how about it, Neal? We think you could handle the extra dough
and still turn in some stellar results. How about opening that door
a little and letting the rest of us in?

   Here's what Tim Robbins says when you call him one of
Hollywood's most political actors: ``I don't like politicians. I
think they lie all the time. I don't hang around with politicians;
I don't support candidates. I resent having to vote for the lesser
of two evils. Political is a negative term in my life, and that's
why I resent being called that. I don't have anything to do with
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, don't expect Robbins to join Warren Beatty, Alec
Baldwin or Cybill Shepherd on a celebrity presidential ticket any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   His reasoning might smack of semantic hairsplitting, but it's
sound enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political people are people who do things for their own
benefit,'' he explains. ``When you make a political decision,
you're not making an emotional or humanist decision. You are making
a decision that is calculated and cold.''
</P>
<P>
   So you try again: Is he a humanist? A socially responsible
artist?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very suspicious of labels people use.'' he shoots back.
``Why do they call them ethnic Albanians? They're Albanians. I
think sometimes if a word is thrown out, people use it without
thinking about it, and it becomes a way to label someone.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why Tim Robbins has a reputation as a prickly
interview subject, one who's been said to dismiss questions he
doesn't like (say, anything that reduces him to the status of Mr.
Susan Sarandon) and even _ although he says this is untrue _ to
walk out abruptly in the middle of an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But that picture is far from complete. It would be more accurate
to say that Robbins, who is an enthusiastic and brutally
competitive amateur athlete, loves to debate. And he seems to love
being right even more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it can be disconcerting to see his malleable face
transform itself: One minute, he looks like an amiable goofball _
recognizable from his roles in ``Bull Durham'' and ``The Hudsucker
Proxy'' _ and the next he exudes the sly intelligence of Griffin
Mill, the ruthless movie executive he played in ``The Player.''
</P>
<P>
   He can train his eyes on a interlocutor like a predator fixing
lunch in its gaze. When he hears a question intended to direct him
toward well-trodden territory _ his protesting of the Gulf War, for
instance _ a faint smile of bemused professorial condescension
plays across his face.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in an untucked navy-blue flannel shirt open over a
thermal T-shirt and jeans, his lanky 6-foot-5-inch frame unraveled
on a chair in his New York office, Robbins gives the impression of
a superannuated college kid _ he'd be that smart, earnest guy who
took a semester off to organize factory workers in some benighted
part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The office, located among the Internet startups of Silicon Alley
in the Flatiron district, is headquarters for his Havoc Productions
and does resemble a grown-up version of a college dorm _ a perfect
place for late-night bull sessions. There are well-worn Mission and
veneered '30s antiques, movie posters on the walls, a treadmill and
Stairmaster sitting unplugged in one corner and a comfortable,
understuffed green velvet sofa in another.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins is munching on a cheeseburger and picking at an enormous
pile of french fries as he discusses his latest directorial
project, ``Cradle Will Rock,'' a sweeping drama about the final
days of the WPA's Federal Theater Project.
</P>
<P>
   The film takes its title from a real-life 1937 labor-movement
musical by the composer Marc Blitzstein and follows its production
at New York's Federal Theater, directed by a young Orson Welles and
produced by John Houseman.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress cancels the Project's funding, the production is
shut down on the eve of its opening, sparking a renegade
performance at a nearby theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cradle'' is populated by a slew of historical and fictional
characters played by an ensemble that includes Sarandon, John
Turturro, Emily Watson, John and Joan Cusak, Bill Murray, Hank
Azaria, Cherry Jones and Vanessa Redgrave.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Robbins interweaves disparate stories from the closure of
Welles' production to Theater Project head Hallie Flanagan's
efforts to defend the program before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The genesis of the film was a proposed script on the subject
pitched to Robbins by a pair of producers in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I don't want to read this script, but I want to do
this film,''' the actor recalls, adding that he began researching
Welles' production with an eye to writing a script of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I read, the more the movie expanded into different
stories,'' he says. ``I did about 40 versions (of the script). Lots
of cutting and pasting.''
</P>
<P>
   What he wound up with could almost be an homage to the
kaleidoscopic style of director Robert Altman.
</P>
<P>
   The similarity is not lost on Robbins, who has starred in three
of Altman films: ``The Player'' (which launched the actor into
stardom), ``Short Cuts'' and ``Ready to Wear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never hidden my love for his films, especially
`Nashville,' being a seminal experience for me,'' Robbins says.
``It was one of the first times I remember sitting in a movie
theater and understanding how wonderful film can be. I was 17. What
impressed me most was the scope of it, the idea that at the end of
the movie, after watching all these characters and story lines, you
walk out with an emotion or feeling about culture _ America _ and
how people are to one another.''
</P>
<P>
   The acting bug bit Robbins while he was still a child, growing
up in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   The son of folk singer Gil Robbins (Tim's brother David is a
composer who scored ``Dead Man Walking'' and ``Cradle'' and
co-wrote, with him, the spite-laden political folk songs for Bob
Roberts), Robbins joined the Theater for the New City, a street
troupe, at the age of 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember doing these street vaudevilles critical of the
administration,'' he says. ``There was no one there to beat us
after the show _ the government was actually giving us money to do
it. They had the confidence in the strength of this democracy to
fund this act. That's amazing; I grew up with a great faith in
democracy because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   After Roman Catholic grade school and Stuyvesant High School, he
attended UCLA and soon after founded the Los Angeles theater group
The Actors Gang.
</P>
<P>
   His first big film break was 1988's ``Bull Durham,'' which also
provided an introduction to Sarandon, 12 years his senior. The
couple now has two children, and they divide their time between
homes in the Village and rural Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins followed ``Bull Durham'' with Adrian Lyne's underrated
``Jacob's Ladder''; ``The Player,'' which earned him a Golden Globe
and best actor at Cannes; ``The Shawshank Redemption,'' the Coen
brothers' ``The Hudsucker Proxy'' as well as less memorable films
like ``I.Q.,'' with Meg Ryan and this past summer's ``Arlington
Road,'' which he also produced.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he launched his writer/director career with the
caustic political ``mocumentary'' ``Bob Roberts'' in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I like directing my own stuff,'' Robbins says. ``It
takes an enormous emotional commitment to direct a film. It takes a
lot of time from your family. Acting is a breeze compared to
directing, for me. You become obsessed, you're staying late,
editing, working weekends. It's just an all-consuming kind of
occupation, so I don't know if I want to deal with someone else's
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim's got an incredible eye for detail,'' says Cherry Jones,
who plays Flanagan. ``I remember watching him for an hour as he
placed the background players for one scene, choosing the colors of
the costumes to paint the picture in his eye ... It's thrilling to
keep up with Tim's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' most successful directorial effort to date was ``Dead
Man Walking,'' for which he received an Academy Award nomination.
Sarandon earned an Oscar as Sister Helen Prejean, who develops a
complex relationship with a death-row inmate played by Sean Penn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each film I've ever done is a different animal; each one has
its own life,'' Robbins says. ```Dead Man Walking' is a very
personal, very intimate love story; `Cradle' is an epic. It is a
wider canvas, and it's about more things than `Dead Man Walking.'''
</P>
<P>
   While Robbins and Sarandon are loath to discuss their
relationship, ``Dead Man's'' intense shoot gave rise to rumors of
tension between the couple, which Robbins downplays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with Susan, there were some difficult days,'' he says
now, ``and we talked about them (to the press) in the context of
doing a movie together. People seized on this idea that we didn't
get along for the entire shoot. We had a couple difficult days; you
have a couple difficult days with anybody. Some days you're in love
with everybody, other days things don't come so easily.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple tries to arrange work schedules so that one can be at
home with their children while the other is on the set. But that
doesn't mean there's no shop talk at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll show her stuff I write,'' Robbins says. ``I don't know if
I'd want to be her when I do that, because I'm so insecure. I don't
take criticism well. Sometimes I just want to hear that it's really
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins and Sarandon garnered more attention than they bargained
for with one particular collaboration in 1993, when they presented
together at the Oscars and made a public plea on behalf of 260
HIV-positive Haitian refugees being detained by the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   The incident got the couple banned from the following year's
ceremonies and opened them to criticism as celebrity grandstanders,
an accusation Robbins vehemently denies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not grandstanding, I'm sorry, that's not
grandstanding,'' he says. ``Grandstanding is getting up and
bragging about yourself. If there was someone reporting about (the
detainment incident), if it was in the news, we would not have done
it. That would have been grandstanding.'' (Their protest, he adds,
led a federal judge to order the refugees' release days after their
Oscar speech.)
</P>
<P>
   Robbins is particularly irked when he's not taken seriously. Or
worse, when he's ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's an example,'' he says. ``When I was publicizing
`Arlington Road,' we started talking about Columbine and about
violence in America, and about what Clinton had just said the week
before _ about how taking more responsibility for violence in
films. And I said that I'm willing to take responsibility for that
if he takes responsibility for violence in real life. There's a
real violence happening now in Kosovo because of our lack of
communication. Why do we think as a nation that that doesn't affect
us? And he's talking about fictional violence? That's insane. This
didn't get picked up anywhere. When I said something negative about
`Forrest Gump,' it got all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins does participate, grudgingly, in the political process.
He votes _ for Bill Clinton in the last presidential elections
(``he's the first Republican I've ever voted for,'' he jokes) and
would for Warren Beatty, although he notes, ``I vote only because
of the Supreme Court, to get people in.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Hillary Clinton's senate run from New York, he says only,
``If Giuliani were running against a fire hydrant, I'd vote for the
fire hydrant.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, his next film, Brian DePalma's ``Mission to
Mars,'' is due out in March. Robbins is scheduled to begin work
soon on Terrence Malick's adaptation of Walker Percy's ``The
Moviegoer'' with Julia Roberts _ and he's still not keeping his
mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't shut up because people are going to disagree with
you or criticize you,'' he says. ``It's a free country we're living
in. You should be able to go up and say whatever the hell you
want.'' &QL;

films. And I said that I'm willing to take responsibility for that
if he takes responsibility for violence in real life. There's a
real violence happening now in Kosovo because of our lack of
communication. Why do we think as a nation that that doesn't affect
us? And he's talking about fictional violence? That's insane. This
didn't get picked up anywhere. When I said something negative about
`Forrest Gump,' it got all over the place.''

<P>
   Robbins does participate, grudgingly, in the political process.
He votes _ for Bill Clinton in the last presidential elections
(``he's the first Republican I've ever voted for,'' he jokes) and
would for Warren Beatty, although he notes, ``I vote only because
of the Supreme Court, to get people in.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Hillary Clinton's senate run from New York, he says only,
``If Giuliani were running against a fire hydrant, I'd vote for the
fire hydrant.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, his next film, Brian DePalma's ``Mission to
Mars,'' is due out in March. Robbins is scheduled to begin work
soon on Terrence Malick's adaptation of Walker Percy's ``The
Moviegoer'' with Julia Roberts _ and he's still not keeping his
mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't shut up because people are going to disagree with
you or criticize you,'' he says. ``It's a free country we're living
in. You should be able to go up and say whatever the hell you
want.'' &QL;

FOODS THAT RECAST WINTER AND ITS DISCONTENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If we really ate with the seasons, we'd starve. No one is
growing vegetables anywhere near us, and what's in the markets
carries a high price tag. So it's official: It looks pretty dreary
out there.
</P>
<P>
   So why is this winter different from all other winters? Because
this is the year you should change your attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Decide that the glass is half full.
</P>
<P>
   Then walk briskly past cucumbers that lack summer's snap, and
don't bother with those expensive tricolored bell peppers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; You're looking for bulbs of beautiful fresh fennel, their
fernlike leaves spilling onto the other greens. Or pick up some
fresh baby spinach leaves, loose or packaged. And don't be a snob
about the frozen case. Peer deeply into it for tiny peas and frozen
haricots verts, the slender French green beans. They're not as
crisp and firm as the fresh ones, but don't overcook them and
they'll be bright green and just right beside slices of roast
chicken bathed in their pan juices.
</P>
<P>
   Darkest February begs for a little pantry cheer. It might be
something as simple as varying your pasta shape or tossing
beautiful olives into the tomato sauce. Here's a short list of
items to boost your spirits until crocus time.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh fennel (about $2 each) is the winter salad-lover's savior.
Bulb shaped, with firm, overlapping white leaves and fern-like
ends, fennel has the mildest licorice taste and a beautiful crunch.
It is perfectly wonderful roasted with a little olive oil. Or use
it raw in a salad. Slice it as thinly as possible and cut the
slices into matchsticks. Arrange peeled, sliced navel oranges on a
platter, scatter the fennel matchsticks on top, add a handful of
whole Italian parsley sprigs, and sprinkle lightly with oil,
vinegar, salt, pepper, and crumbled goat cheese. Just add warm,
crusty bread.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen haricots verts ($1.59), the slender French green beans,
come in 1-pound bags at Trader Joe's (781-433-0234) and take
seconds to cook. Imported from France, the beans are individually
quick frozen, which means that you can pour tonight's portion out
of the bag, then reseal it. Drop them into boiling water; when the
water returns to a boil, let them cook for half a minute. Drain
them and rinse with a teacup of cold water to set the color. Serve
haricots verts beside any juicy meat or fish, so they can mingle
with the juices. Or chill them and scatter them onto a winter
salad.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny cherry tomatoes shaped like grapes, called grape
tomatoes (around $3 for a pint box), are one of the best new
products to come along in years. These little gems are sweeter than
all the other cherries shipped north in midwinter, and best of all,
their skins aren't thick. If you see them on sale, buy lots and
make a quick tomato saute to ladle over pasta or accompany lamb
chops: Heat just enough oil in a skillet to film the bottom, add
the tomatoes, salt, and pepper, and cook over medium heat for 10
minutes, stirring often, until the tomatoes release their liquid.
Add a handful of fresh herbs (parsley, thyme, oregano, or basil).
</P>
<P>
   Also relatively new to the markets is fresh baby spinach, which
comes loose or bagged. The bags are less than half a pound (about
$2 each), found in the produce department with the lettuces that
are already cut and bagged. Look carefully to make sure the spinach
hasn't deteriorated inside. At home, remove the stems and add a
heaping handful of spinach to vegetable soup. Cook it only until it
wilts. Or saute the spinach in a little butter with a pinch of
nutmeg, salt, and pepper. This is the spinach you should use to
make a raw spinach salad, or add some to a bowl of mesclun, fennel,
and watercress.
</P>
<P>
   Once called Yuppie Lettuce because of its high price, mesclun
salad (about $7 per pound) is now everywhere. This mixture usually
combines at least half a dozen greens, including curly endive, beet
leaves, arugula, mizuna, mache, radicchio, and baby lettuces. The
drawback is that it's highly perishable. If one of the greens
wilts, it can give an off taste to the whole mix. Look closely at
the bin to make sure that any green lettuces have not already
turned yellow. At home, pack them in a large plastic container that
is lined on the bottom with a damp paper towel. Cover the lettuces
with another damp paper towel and seal with the lid. Toss mesclun
with other lettuces, baby spinach, and fennel.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed olives ($7 to $9 per pound) used to be hard to come by
outside of specialty markets, but now stores that sell good olives
generally offer them. Most manufacturers make their own mix and
include all sizes of green and black olives grown in France, Italy,
and Greece. Toss a handful of olives in any chicken dish with a
tomato-based sauce, or add some to a garlicky tomato sauce along
with chopped anchovies, a generous pinch of crushed red pepper, and
capers. This will produce the classic puttanesca, a spicy sauce
named for Italy's streetwalkers.
</P>
<P>
   With the sauce, of course, you want pasta, not the same
spaghetti you make year in and year out, but rather a great new
pasta shape. Strozzapreti (literally ``strangle the priest'') is a
pasta shaped like a teardrop with a twist at the end, or, more
precisely, a noose. Made by Benedetto Cavallieri, a 1-pound bag
($4.95) will feed four. It's more expensive than other brands, but
you'll taste the difference. When top-quality pasta is cooked to
the point when it is tender but still has some bite, it brings new
definition to the words ``al dente.''
</P>
<P>
   And just in case you thought that pasta was one of the few
mandatory items in the pantry, here's another: Trader Joe's canned
whole kernel corn (69 cents), 15 ounces of sweet crunch, and a big
surprise for anyone who looks down her nose at canned vegetables.
Picked and processed in Idaho without sugar or preservatives, the
corn is very yellow and very cheerful. Microwave it for one minute
just to remove the chill. Add a little summertime to your plate.
</P>
<P>
   Winter's coldest months do bring a sweet treat from the sea.
Tiny, tasty, fresh Maine shrimp ($5 to $7 per pound) are fished off
the coast of Maine from mid-January for exactly 60 days. That gives
you until the middle of March to get to a good fish market and find
these little treats. And they are little. About four shrimp will
fit into a soup spoon. Cook them in boiling water just until the
water returns to a boil. Drain and rinse with cold water until they
are no longer hot. Peel (if they're not peeled already) and toss
with mayonnaise, a squeeze of lemon juice, and a dash of liquid hot
sauce. Pile them onto crusty toasted French bread and thank the
weather gods for winter.
</P>
<P>
   You might also want to thank them for the warm days we had
earlier this winter, if you're a fan of shad roe. Thanks to the
weather, it's here early this year _ about two or three weeks ahead
of schedule. But that means the season will end early, too, so
while you're shopping for shrimp, you might as well ask for shad
roe, too. Saute it gently in butter over very low heat, add a
squeeze of lemon, and supper's ready.
</P>
<P>
   In the grain department, there are more tiny finds, French du
Puy lentils. Smaller, darker, and more flavorful than ordinary
lentils, du Puys (around $5 per pound) are less likely to fall
apart in the pot, which makes them wonderful in salads. Moisten
them with vinaigrette and add lots of spring onion, red onion, and
parsley. In soups, use them in place of ordinary lentils. They beg
for something smoky in the pot _ bacon, pancetta, Canadian bacon,
or serrano ham.
</P>
<P>
   Intensely dark, moist, and ultra-thin, German rye, wheat, and
multigrain breads (about $2.50 per pound) will stay fresh in the
fridge for weeks. One of the best is made by Mestemacher and is
available at food specialty stores. Spread slices of bread lightly
with butter and then add smoked salmon in a very thin layer.
Garnish with a sprig of fresh dill. Cut the bread into triangles
and arrange them on a platter. Cover them with a damp paper towel,
then a clean kitchen towel, and let them sit in a cool place for as
long as several hours. To serve: Light a fire, pull some
comfortable chairs close to the fireplace, uncork the wine, and dig
in.

&HT;     POSSIBLE EXAMINER BUYERS MAY INCLUDE EX-MAYORAL CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETER HARTLAUB  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Clint Reilly, the failed candidate for mayor who
went to court last month seeking to block the merger of the city's
two daily newspapers, has emerged as a potential buyer of the
135-year-old San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Hearst Corporation, which owns the Examiner and
is buying the rival San Francisco Chronicle, announced Tuesday that
they had receive more than one proposal. Tuesday was the deadline
the company set for selling the Examiner, which was purchased by
they Hearst family in 1887.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst officials said they would not say who had made offers.
But Reilly's lawyer, Joseph M. Alioto, announced that his client
made a bid after he was ``invited'' to do so by Hearst lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement marks the latest development in efforts by
Hearst to find a buyer for the Examiner as part of a plan announced
last Aug. 6 for Hearst to purchase the Chronicle for an estimated
$660 million and sell the Examiner. If no qualified buyer appeared,
Hearst indicated it would merge the two newspapers and close the
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst officials promised staff members they would not lose
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Justice and the California attorney
general are reviewing the proposed merger to determine if it
complies with anti-trust laws. The San Francisco Board of
Supervisors, which has said it wants to preserve both newspapers,
also is examining the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst on Jan. 25 expanded its effort to find a buyer, throwing
delivery trucks, a printing plant and the Examiner office building
into the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto said Reilly wasn't interested in buying the newspaper
until after Jan. 11, when he filed an antitrust lawsuit to stop the
Hearst Corporation from merging the two newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Alioto said, Hearst lawyers suggested that Reilly
buy the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client was invited to do this,'' Alioto said. ``If I find
out later they were not serious, I will take the appropriate
response.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the New York-based Hearst could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, who was in Hong Kong on Tuesday and unavailable for
comment, once sued the newspaper and Examiner Executive Editor Phil
Bronstein over a conference-room altercation. He was criticized in
Examiner editorials during his campaign against Mayor Willie Brown,
in which he spent nearly $4 million of his own money for a
fourth-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto said the bid for the newspaper has nothing to do with
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have express interest in the newspapers, which has an
afternoon circulation of 107,000, did not return telephone calls.
The morning Chronicle's circulation is 457,000.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said last month that he hoped to save the Examiner and
would try to bring together some investors to buy the newspaper. He
also talked about creating a ``Save the Examiner'' task force. The
mayor's press secretary declined to comment on potential bidders.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Cuthbertson, executive officer of the Northern California
Media Workers Guild, said he was surprised that there were several
offers, one of them coming from Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be highly interested in seeing what kind of plan they
have to survive, whether they have pockets deep enough to go head
to head in the morning with the Chronicle,'' Cuthbertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuthbertson said the delays that could result because of the
offers would only prolong feelings of uneasiness at both
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in both newsrooms has been frustrated for years to
one degree or another, not knowing what their futures would be,''
Cuthbertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein said he has not been involved in discussions of the
sale. ``I'm not in that loop,'' he said. ``My job is to run the
newsroom.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a century, the Examiner and the Chronicle were
morning rivals. But in 1965, the newspapers entered into a joint
operating agreement (JOA) under which the Examiner switched to
afternoon publication. The newspapers maintain separate news staffs
and compete for stories, but the companies share printing and
business operations and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Such arrangements were later authorized by the Newspaper
Preservation Act of 1970, a federal law aimed at preserving
newspapers that would be forced to close without relief from the
expense of head-to-head competition.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco JOA expires in 2005, but last year the owners
of the Chronicle Publishing Co. decided to sell all the company's
assets.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department must approve the sale of the Chronicle to
Hearst. A decision is pending.

SERVICE PROBLEMS STIR DINERS' PASSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON ARNETT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I recently asked you to talk back about service in today's
restaurants. Talk back you did, flooding my e-mail, the fax
machine, and the US mail with replies. Not only did you answer the
eight questions, but you gave specifics on calculating tips
according to the level of service, told horror stories and
heartening tales, and over and over gave a clarion call that
restaurateurs ignore only at their peril. As one reader commented
after answering the questionnaire: ``Boy, I had no idea I felt so
strongly about this subject!''
</P>
<P>
   When the Zagat survey asked in New York City whether men are
treated better in restaurants than women, the question got an
overwhelming number of affirmatives: Four out of five said men were
given preference. In this poll, the spread was narrower, but still
many more women _ and men _ think that women get short shrift when
eating out. Seating was the biggest complaint, with women saying
they always were seated at the worst tables in the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Groups of women, the readers said, are particularly
discriminated against, and both men and women took some time to
list what might be the reasons. But, as a male reader said, ``I am
a man who worked for many years in a field dominated by women, so I
spent a lot of time eating in restaurants with women. Women are
treated worse in restaurants than men both by waiters and by
waitresses. Some places it is really embarrassing. Partly it is
clearly sexism and partly it is that women at least appear to take
longer to order, fuss more over their orders and their food, and
are reputed to tip less well than men. And I have also eaten in
restaurants with women who divide a check down to the penny (``I
had, you had, so my share of the tip is $4.19''), and I imagine
this drives waitstaff crazy. But the sexism is still inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   Inexcusable indeed. I was most amazed by women who apologized,
seemingly agreeing that the waitstaff was justified in ignoring
them or placing them at inferior tables. Because the
most-often-cited reason for discrimination against women in
restaurants _ that they don't tip as well _ certainly is not borne
out by the answers to this survey. Many more women than men replied
that they tipped 20 percent of the total bill or even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to challenge the stereotype,'' one woman wrote, ``by
tipping 20 percent consistently; 25 percent if service is
excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most generous respondents pointed out that at some
point in their lives they had been on the other side, as waitstaff.
Others were more exacting about the terms of tipping. One man
wrote: ``When I walk into a restaurant, the tip is 15 percent. It
goes up or down from there, depending on the quality of the total
experience (in my opinion, the total experience being broken down
to 50 percent service, 50 percent food quality).''
</P>
<P>
   Although most respondents did say they adjusted a tip according
to service, many adding that they never went below 15 percent, one
reader thought differently. ``I dine out frequently and my
experience is that too many people give tips even when the service
is poor or inept. . . . The problem is that some diners feel
uncomfortable or are afraid to leave small tips or no tips at
all.'' This, he says, only exacerbates the problem, and waiters and
waitresses ``have become spoiled and expect a large tip just for
delivering the food.'' Small tips or no tips would encourage
waitstaff to do better or to find work elsewhere, this reader
argued, ``which will benefit everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said they make sure to praise good service to the
management as well as tipping above 25 percent. One reader told of
giving a waitress a small tip because of service but ``personally
handing money to the busboy because he had been very attentive to
us and was working very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Some respondents said they never complain about service, adding,
``it is too time consuming and inept'' or ``rude servers are
impossible to correct or complain to.'' But many more said they do
voice their opinions, while making clear they understand that some
service problems, such as food that's slow to arrive, are not
always the waitstaff's problem. One reader, who does complain to
management, added: ``I also make sure to mention if I feel the
problem is due to a lack of staff or the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reader told of a particularly grim restaurant visit
involving a 45-minute wait for salads, disappearing staff, and warm
wine, and then recounted the reaction of the manager, who solicited
her party's reasons for being disgruntled. ``He said: `it only took
25 (minutes), besides, we have only been open 6 weeks and you seem
hostile.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone thought restaurants should compensate for errors and
should reduce the cost of the meal and pay for cleaning in case of
spilled drinks or food. A woman who owns a retail business pointed
out: ``Always better to err on the side of generosity _ and
customers remember and appreciate it.'' But that doesn't always
happen. One reader wrote: ``I had hot coffee sprayed on me over a
railing. A manager came by to ask, `was the food compromised?' When
I said no, he walked away without saying another word. I had to
have my pants dry-cleaned.''
</P>
<P>
   And what kind of service is your ideal? ``Friendly but not too
friendly'' was the consensus of the respondents. But efficiency is
very important, no matter what the style of the restaurant. The
server should know the menu, be attentive, and be open to answering
questions. And smile _``If you smile and do your job correctly,
then I will tip you VERY well,'' one woman said.
</P>
<P>
   Noise matters a lot to some people and not much at all to
others. Most said they would complain to the server.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other pet peeves _ some that are mine, too.
Lighting is often too dim or poorly placed to let you read the
menu. A woman replying to the question about gender treatment said
she can't stand restaurant personnel who insist on calling her and
her friends ``dearie.'' Many others commented on other annoying
phrases such as ``are you still working on that?'' Or ``will you be
needing change?'' Or the server saying, ``What will you guys be
having?'' Others complain of ``servers who want to pounce on the
plate of someone who has finished eating,'' leaving that person
feeling silly while others finish dinner. Many complained about
silverware not being changed between courses.
</P>
<P>
   And the complaint that I agree with since I see it constantly:
servers who almost have to be sought out and run to the ground
before they'll bring the check. Don't they want to get paid? I
always wonder. But many readers wrote that management is
responsible for service in the end, that owners and managers should
be aware how the dining room is running, and that staff members
should be trained. ``There was a time,'' one reader wrote, ``when
management trained service personnel, from headwaiter or greeter to
waitstaff, on how guests should be greeted and served, thus
providing guests with a pleasant dining experience.''
Unfortunately, the reader said, that seems often not to be the
case.
</P>
<P>
   As another woman wrote: ``I like to be treated the way I would
treat a guest in my home.''
</P>
<P>
   By far, the crucial question for restaurateurs is the last: ``Do
you complain about service or do you just not return to that
establishment?'' A majority of the respondents said they vote with
their feet. No matter how unpleasant it might be to deal with
complaints, it's better than lack of business.
</P>
<P>
   But over and over readers were loud and clear on the reason:
``There are too many restaurants to put up with poor service or
poor anything,'' one reader wrote. And he added: ``Word of mouth is
very powerful.''

   ATLANTA _ Lots of announcements from WWF promotions. The next
music CD is expected to be released March 21 and should be called
``Aggression.'' Meanwhile, three new videos are scheduled to hit
shelves April 25. They are ``The Rock: The People's Champ,'' ``Mick
Foley: Wild Man Un-Masked'' and ``Eve of Destruction.''

   It was originally going to be a Canadian super-match between the
country's top two stars, Bret Hart and Chris Benoit, for the Feb.
26 house show in Winnipeg, Manitoba. When Benoit left WCW, the card
was switched to Bret Hart vs. Sid. Now the ads are touting Sid vs.
Scott Hall, but that match might be in jeopardy also.

   WWF stock may have finally bottomed out. News of the XFL
football league has sent investors running to sell and the stock
plunged to an all-time low of 10 3/4. On Monday of this week it
jumped to 11 5/8 and is expected to climb slightly as the stock is
considered a great value under $13.
</P>

   On the WWF injury front, Eddy Guerrero had his cast taken off
his arm and he may return to the mat in just a month, ahead of the
orginal diagnosis of three to four months. Matt Hardy injured his
shoulder at a house show in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On the rumor killer tour, Shawn Michaels will not become the
third member of the WWF announcing team, although many feel he does
good work as a mouthpiece. Michaels did get some of his wrestlers
(from Shawn Michaels' Texas Wrestling Alliance) developmental
contracts with the WWF. Lance Cade, American Dragon, Spanky and

may return also, but only if the television ratings start to sag;
the Hemsley-McMahon era has really taken off in the ratings.

 &HT;    ECW enters the hot video-game market
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's taken awhile, but Extreme Championship Wrestling is
breaking into the final frontier of sports entertainment
money-making _ video games.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, some of the most popular video games
have been wrestling oriented. The World Wrestling Federation and
World Championship Wrestling have found a cash cow in the world of
video games.
</P>
<P>
   This week, ECW joins the market with its first video game _
``ECW Hardcore Revolution'' _ from Acclaim Entertainment Inc. The
game will be available for the Sony Playstation and Color Game Boy
and scheduled for release on Sega Dreamcast in early March.
</P>
<P>
   ``While others have tried to imitate, ECW is the innovator of
hardcore wrestling,'' said Michael Jerchower, the director of
licensing for Acclaim. ``Just as ECW has set the standard in
extreme wrestling, `ECW Hardcore Revolution' will set the strandard
for wrestling video games.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the game has incorporated some of the most violent
moves of some of the most extreme wrestlers in ECW. One of the new
looks is that players can wrestle in the infamous barbed-wire
match, in which the ropes are replaced with barbed-wire. Add to
this the use of weapons, such as cheese graters, kendo-sticks,
bats, shovels and ladders, and the results are bloody wrestlers for
a mature game player.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim's press releases say theirs is the first mature-rated
wrestling video game, intended for audiences 17 and older. In
addition to the blood-letting, the wrestlers use adult language.
There is no nudity.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership of ECW and Acclaim is unique. When Acclaim got
``exclusive, long-term interactive software'' license rights from
ECW, they also got a minority equity interest in ECW.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acclaim is the most experienced, creative and successful
interactive entertainment partner when it comes to producing
wrestling titles,'' ECW executive producer Paul Heyman said. ``If
you are a fan of wrestling, this will be a must-buy video-game
title.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the ECW game has been compared with the products of
the big two _ WWF's ``Warzone,'' ``Attitude,'' ``Smackdown'' and
``Wrestlemaina 2000''; and WCW's ``Mayhem'' and ``WCW/NWO
Revenge.'' But it has its differences and will have a definite
appeal from the millions of people who watch ECW on television.
</P>
<P>
   While ECW joined in the war in the video game market late, it is
unlikely to win the war soon. But it has its sights set on WCW for
second place.

 &HT;    WCW still failing to generate excitement for TV shows
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This past Monday held a lot of promise for the floundering World
Championship Wrestling's ``Nitro'' television program. For the
first time in 2000 (it will happen again when the U.S. Open comes
back to New York in September), the TNT show ran unopposed from the
USA network juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   The night promised to be a big one with legends Hulk Hogan and
Ric Flair meeting in the ring, along with a handful of story lines
going for the final push before Sunday's ``SuperBrawl''
pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   But before the lights went up on the 8 p.m. show from Long
Island's Nassau Coliseum, trouble had already arrived. After a
weekend wrestling with WCW in Germany, Scott Hall, who has been
thrust into the main-event spotlight since Kevin Nash's injury, was
not allowed on his flight out of Germany because he was
intoxicated, according to a 1wrestling.com report. Without Hall,
who would've been in the main event, the ``Nitro'' show had to be
rewritten and it resulted in a match that was orginally going to be
the main event for the pay-per-view. Luckily it won't be because
the match was average at best.
</P>
<P>
   It followed a good match between Hogan and Flair. The two
veterans (combined age: nearly 100), pulled out all their old moves
for the millionth time in the match that went as any average fan
could've scripted from home.
</P>
<P>
   The show was a loss when Ernest Miller was given a promo right
after the Hogan-Flair battle. And that's what the writers at WCW
seem to be missing. The show should grow to something. Set up the
night's event early, then don't waste time with some bit with a
mid-carder.
</P>
<P>
   There is no fan excitement around ``SuperBrawl'' because the
fans don't care or are split in different directions on the Scott
Hall-Sid Vicious-Jeff Jarrett match. They don't care because the
story line is weak and the combatants are miscast. The giant
wrestler (Vicious) is playing the role of the underdog. In order to
make a 6-foot-10, 340-pound man seem like an underdog, they have to
put him in situations where there are two or three wrestlers
against him. But then the pay-per-view has him going against two
guys who no longer can work together, so who cares? That's bad and
will translate to more poor buy-rate figures this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Things only seem to be getting worse for WCW. Shane Douglas and
Chris Kanyon are the newest departees. Douglas is suing WCW for
releasing him, in part because he has nowhere else to go. The WCW
is also in the middle of a lawsuit for racial discrimination from
three former performers. This suit is not expected to be settled
like the Douglas one. And WCW has not been able to pry Sabu and
Chris Candido away from their ECW contracts.

KID-LEVEL PLAYGROUND HUMOR COMES TO ADULT BOARD GAME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By PHIL DAVIS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Would you rather bite the curb and get kicked in the back of the
head or get a papercut on your eyeball? Would you rather be hairy
like Bigfoot or have body odor that can be detected across the
yard?
</P>
<P>
   The questions take you back to the playground _ a time when it
was still possible to ponder the price of eating a booger. Santa
Monica entrepreneur Randy Horn wants to take you back to that
elementary school mindset with his twisted board game Zobmondo.
</P>
<P>
   At first, adult minds want to resist. The only logical answer to
the questions above _ plucked from the Zobmondo box _ is none of
the above.
</P>
<P>
   But 32-year-old Horn knows the lure of the playground is strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to get you to have a logical, reasonable
conversation that you can't even believe you're having,'' said
Horn, who created Zobmondo three years ago while pursuing a
master's degree in business at the University of California, Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're sitting there choosing to eat a handful of worms as
your preference,'' Horn continued. ``You look at that person and
say, `Do you realize what you're saying? You're vehemently arguing
to eat a handful of worms.' That's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Zobmondo (kid-speak translation: really bad) works like this: A
player must try to predict which of the two terrible options the
rest of the players will choose. The other players have three
minutes to reach a consensus. If the prediction is correct, the
player rolls again. The first player to the end _ the ``quagmire''
_ must devise his or her own Zobmondo question, creating a dilemma
so prickly that the other players cannot reach a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Horn is not the only one cashing in on bizarre dilemmas these
days.
</P>
<P>
   Authors Justin Heimberg and David Gomberg were among the first
to cash in on this childhood game with the 1997 book ``Would You
Rather ...?'' (Plume; $8.95).
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the concept has been, er, refined. Perhaps fermented
is a better word.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Doe, two Hollywood entertainment execs whose crude,
in-your-face books are so annoying they must hide behind aliases
and disguises, rolled out ``The Book of Horrible Questions'' (St.
Martins Griffin; $9.99). This disgusting book could one day give
aliens an excellent argument for the extermination of the human
race.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the questions are too crude to print in a family
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned that basically everybody has a price,'' said Smith,
who refuses to reveal his true identity. ``No matter how
disgusting, humiliating or embarrassing the act is, everybody has a
price. So we wrote a book that took that concept to the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we're prophets, don't you think, Doe?'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' the more honest Doe replied, ``we're for profits.''
</P>
<P>
   These ``would you rather?'' entrepreneurs have struck a chord in
society. It's contagious.
</P>
<P>
   Horn decided to create Zobmondo after ``would you rather?''
questions saved a particularly dreadful evening with a dull date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all started having a great time immediately,'' Horn said.
``The bartender was in on it, the food servers were coming out
telling me they've asked the cook _ everybody in the restaurant is
talking about these questions. I'm sitting there thinking it's
unbelievable. As we were walking out, I thought this is what's
supposed to happen when you sit down to play a social board game.
If what we're trying to do is create fun, this does it.''
</P>
<P>
   He took the idea back to his business class. Horn hired comedy
writers to write the 1,500 dilemmas in the game and honed the rules
with focus groups. A year later, after recruiting friends and
family to invest in the concept, his game was the sleeper hit at
the 1998 Toy Fair.
</P>
<P>
   He still hasn't had the breakthrough success of Pictionary or
Trivial Pursuit, but the $35 game has spread from 300 to 1,000
specialty stores, such as the Store of Knowledge in Woodland Hills.
It's also for sale on the Web at www.zobmondo.com, amazon.com and
etoys.com.
</P>
<P>
   If this kind of stuff is not your thing _ tough. Get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   Both Horn and Smith and Doe are working on TV deals to take
their warped humor to the airwaves. Horn is hoping to catch
Hollywood's current game-show fever.
</P>
<P>
   And while Smith and Doe finish a book that they claim will
expose everyone's secret sexual desires, Horn is pitching Zobmondo
to calendar companies, toy manufacturers, CD-ROM distributors and
anyone else who will listen.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, somehow, somewhere, these crude questions are going
to find you. So just relax and start calculating your price to eat
a live, kicking 2-inch cockroach. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John McCain, the Republican challenger for the
party's White House nomination, has been accused of virtually
everything else in an increasingly nasty campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But now he is being labelled a KGB spy, a traitor and perhaps
even a brainwashed zombie controlled by Communists, in a smear that
veers between the comic and the vile.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing fringe groups hate McCain, a former prisoner of war
in Vietnam. He has not supported their crusade to free the
prisoners they believe remain behind in Southeast Asia after the
Vietnam War, and has backed a resumption of relations with Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Though comic, the accusations will harm McCain among some of the
veterans in South Carolina, a crucial element in the state's
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Sampley, a veteran from North Carolina who runs a
newsletter, accuses McCain of betraying his country while a
prisoner, wearing medals that he is not entitled to and even being
a KGB spy.
</P>
<P>
   A former KGB official has said that the Russians ``turned'' a
``high-ranking naval officer'' during interrogation, he says. This
man ``agreed to work with the Soviets upon his repatriation to the
United States and has frequently appeared on U.S. television.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has also made an even more bizarre accusation against
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the movie `The Manchurian Candidate,' actor Lawrence Harvey
portrayed the character of a former POW and war hero of the Korean
War, whose brainwashing by his communist captors resulted in his
enemies being able to manipulate his actions,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``To trigger him to do their bidding all they had to do was have
him play solitaire with the Queen of Diamonds being the trigger
that made him theirs, body and soul.''
</P>
<P>
   He goes on to ask Senator McCain, rhetorically: ``Have the
Vietnamese flipped you a Queen of Diamonds?''
</P>
<P>
   The ridiculous accusation has been given wide circulation by
conservative activist Paul Weyrich. Weyrich also quotes an
authority that would not normally be compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cambodian Khmer Rouge has claimed that McCain is a
Vietnamese agent, for whatever that is worth,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Weyrich does not definitively say that he believes McCain is
working for SMERSH, but he does hint pretty broadly. ``The charges
are reminiscent of those against Bill Clinton in 1992. It is hard
to know who is telling the truth in all of this,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not always be true that where there is smoke there is
fire, but many times it is true.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lisa Kudrow couldn't stop staring at her _ for days. There she'd
be on the set of ``Hanging Up,'' the new comedy from writers Nora
and Delia Ephron, and Kudrow would look at her out of the corner of
her eye, watching and wondering just how Meg Ryan does what she
does.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about her, like some kind of light and
energy that emanates from her,'' Kudrow says. ``And, you know, I
wanted to find out where that all came from. She should know that
if she ever wants to do a six-hour movie, we'll sit there and
watch. She's just got this magic and you're compelled to look at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, 38, bursts out laughing (``Ha! You're kidding, right?'')
when told of Kudrow's fixation, wondering out loud, ``What? Did I
have something between my teeth?''
</P>
<P>
   It's but one indication of how lightly the actress takes herself
and the fame that comes with being one of America's most-loved
leading ladies. In person, Ryan is both down-to-earth and
down-to-business, funny, charming and laid-back.
</P>
<P>
   And Ryan has every reason for feeling relaxed these days. She
limits herself to one film per year so she can have more time for
her husband, actor Dennis Quaid, and their 7-year-old son, Jack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like my life, so not working really is an act of
selfishness and not self-discipline,'' Ryan says. ``I work about
three months a year and the rest of the time I hang out with the
girls at Coffee Bean &AMP; Tea Leaf.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, Ryan discusses ``Hanging Up'' and its themes of
``responsibility overload,'' how she managed to simplify her life
and why a solo commute can be a liberating experience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've said you made ``Hanging Up'' because you understand
your character, Eve, and the avalanche of expectations that
threatens to bury her.
</P>
<P>
   A: Most days, I would just love to unplug all the phones. I
mean, don't you wish you had a ``do not disturb'' button on your
life, at your house and inside your car? There would be this
operator with a calm, soothing voice saying, ``Meg's not taking
calls right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Isn't that what an answering machine is for?
</P>
<P>
   A: With an answering machine, I constantly screen it. I'm like a
Pavlovian dog. I hear the ring and I can't stand not knowing what I
might miss.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So where do you carve out time for yourself?
</P>
<P>
   A: In my car. That's one of the reasons I love Los Angeles
because that's when you get that uninterrupted time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And how do you spend that time?
</P>
<P>
   A: I sing. I love to sing. And I make sure the car phone is off.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Given your residency at your local coffee house, you must be
doing something right when it comes to simplifying your life.
</P>
<P>
   A: I made some big changes in my life about five years ago. Up
until then, I felt like I was at everybody's beck and call and that
my whole life was reactive instead of proactive. It's a common
problem for women today because we've gone from having no options
to having so many. And those options end up running your life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did you do?
</P>
<P>
   A: I had to sort of stop giving in to everyone else's dramas
like they were my own and feeling like I can control things that I
can't. I had friends that I don't have anymore because they just
required so much caretaking from me. And once you have a kid, it's
just impossible. You know who you're the primary caretaker of.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And that would be Jack. I've heard a story that when he was
born you couldn't stop staring at him.
</P>
<P>
   A: For months! It was embarrassing. People were making fun of
me. I just couldn't believe there was another person right there.
My pregnancy had seemed like a condition, an illness almost. And
then all of a sudden ... well, I couldn't believe it until I saw
him. And then my whole life changed instantaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you worry about being a good mother?
</P>
<P>
   A: All the time. I still do. Having a child changes everything
and there's no describing the power. And there's nothing you won't
do for him. You see how it's possible to think of someone before
yourself. It is !ital!so cool.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sounds like you wouldn't mind having another.
</P>
<P>
   A: I would love to have more kids. I would love to. Please.
Sometime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Hanging Up'' is a little tougher than the other movies
you've made with the Ephron sisters. Was that part of the appeal?
</P>
<P>
   A: Definitely. This woman I play helped me see myself more
clearly. And I'm now at a place in my life where I'm having these
experiences _ you know, responsibilities, marriage and family _ so
I'm looking for something to reflect that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: No more romantic comedies?
</P>
<P>
   A: You know what I'd like? A movie that deals with staying
together, not getting together. Most movie romances are just about
foreplay. And because I'm married, I'd like to find something about
how people stay together over the course of a lifetime. I haven't
seen a script like that yet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you see many serious scripts? People seem to like you best
in the light comedies.
</P>
<P>
   A: There's not a lot of great stuff out there. And, you're
right, I don't think people see me as this ``serious'' actress. I
had a hard time thinking of myself as an actress, period, for the
longest time. I'd always think that I'd better have an out. You
know, like, ``Keep that Peace Corps application at the ready!''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What changed your mind?
</P>
<P>
   A: When I got to ``When a Man Loves a Woman,'' I thought, ``Oh,
I like this.'' I had some sort of emotional connection with that
woman and really, really understood her. And I felt like we were
sort of bringing a situation to light in a responsible and
evocative way, and it was the first time that I was serving an idea
that I respected instead of just doing an exercise of acting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: That film was a good 10 years into your career. It took you
that long to feel that way?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most of the time, I just feel lucky. And you know what? I
am. &QL;

<P>
   Quite possibly, say two anthropologists, who have produced the
first reliable evidence that an artifact found in Mexico is of
Roman origin, and that it almost certainly arrived in the New World
before the Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Hristov, an independent anthropologist formerly at
Southern Methodist University in Dallas, decided to investigate a
black terra-cotta head that was first unearthed in 1933 in the
Toluca Valley, approximately 65 kilometers west of Mexico City. The
head, which is just a few centimeters tall, represents a bearded
man and is different in style from any other known pre-Columbian
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Although much had been written about the head since its
discovery, Hristov found that no one actually knew where it was.
With the help of a Mexican anthropologist, he finally found it in
1994, locked away in a Mexico City museum.
</P>
<P>
   To determine when the head was made, Hristov drilled some
material from the remains of its neck. He then took the sample to
be tested at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in
Heidelberg using a technique called thermoluminescence.
</P>
<P>
   In this method, heat forces high-energy electrons that have
accumulated in the sample over time to release their energy as
light. By measuring the light released, the researchers were able
to estimate that the terra-cotta was fired 1,800 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hristov also consulted art experts, who agreed that the head was
Roman, dating roughly to A.D. 200. Furthermore, a review of the
circumstances surrounding the head's original discovery confirmed
that the head was placed in the burial ground where it was found no
later than 1510, a decade before the Spanish arrived in
Meso-America.
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, the head was excavated from the site by
professionals, says David Kelley, an archaeologist at the
University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada. ``This was sealed under
three floors. It's as close to archaeological certainty as you can
get.''
</P>
<P>
   Hristov believes the head is the first hard evidence of
pre-Hispanic transoceanic contacts between the Old and New Worlds.
But it is unclear whether it will resolve what is one of the most
contentious debates in modern cultural anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no reason why ancient contact is not possible,'' says
Betty Meggers, an anthropologist at the National Museum of Natural
History in Washington D.C., who says that ancient Ecuadorian and
Japanese pottery have identical features.
</P>
<P>
   David Grove, an archaeologist at the University of Illinois in
Urbana, Champaign, agrees the head is Roman, but questions its
significance. It could, for example, have been taken off a Roman
shipwreck on the Mexican coast, which would not require significant
interaction between ancient Americans and Romans, he says. There is
also no evidence of ancient cultures from Europe or elsewhere
making a significant mark on pre-Columbian cultures. &QL;

   Amazon.com, the high-profile online retailer, stepped up its
expansion into Europe this week, detailing plans for a new customer
service center in The Hague, while revealing that sales via its
U.K. Web site during the Christmas quarter jumped more than
fivefold to (pounds sterling)26 million (over $40 million).
</P>
<P>
   The company indicated it would add further Web sites in Europe
beyond its existing British and German operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands facility, which will serve customers across the
continent who shop at the British and German sites, will employ 125
people when it opens later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, which is currently accessible over PCs only, is also
exploring links with mobile phone and interactive television
operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a clear commitment to make Amazon's shopping platform
available through PCs, mobile phone and television,'' said Steve
Fraser, managing director of Amazon.co.uk, while declining to
provide details.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're committed to doing is building a great platform for
e-commerce and we're great believers in open access to different
systems,'' he said. ``Our goal is universal access: anything,
anywhere, anytime on whatever platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon said that 1 million Britons visited its site during the
quarter and that it has 17 million users worldwide. In November and
December, Amazon's U.K. operation shipped 1.5 million items in some
900,000 packages.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's interactive retailers, including Open, controlled by
BSkyB and British Telecom, and WHSmith, have declined to release
sales figures.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding competition from Open, Fraser said: ``I'm not sure
they're even close to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon is the world's biggest online retailer and has extended
its retail offering beyond its bookseller origins to CDs and
consumer electronics goods.
</P>
<P>
   But despite rapid growth in quarterly sales, the company still
refuses to say when it will reach profitability. Earlier this
month, it reported a 1999 pro forma net loss of $390 million
compared with a pro forma net loss in 1998 of $74 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among new initiatives, Amazon.com opened five new retail stores
around the world during the Christmas quarter, along with its
sothebys.amazon.com service. It also agreed to ventures with
NextCard, Greenlight.com, drugstore.com, Audible, and living.com.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's presentation in London closely follows Amazon raising
$600 million from the euro-denominated sale of junk bonds to
European investors.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, however, paid a price to get the debt issue subscribed,
including a hefty 6 7/8 percent to 7 3/8 percent coupon.
</P>
<P>
   It also offered a debt to equity conversion premium of 35
percent to 40 percent, meaning that the bonds are convertible into
Amazon stock at a price that is 35-40 percent above the current
market price.
</P>
<P>
   Convertible bonds are hybrid instruments that act like stocks
but offer investors a bond-like return. &QL;

 &HT;    RECORD ECONOMIC BOOM HASN'T DONE MUCH FOR THE LESS WELL-OFF
 &HT;    1260&AMP;add. With ECONOMY-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Feb. 20.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Next month, the U.S. economy will complete nine
consecutive years of growth, extending the longest and largest
economic boom the country has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Since the expansion began in March 1991, the economy has grown a
staggering 64 percent to become the mightiest engine of commerce in
the history of the world, on track to kick out more than $9.5
trillion worth of goods and services this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   At its current growth rate, a sizzling 5.8 percent a year, the
economy is generating $1.5 billion worth of new wealth each day.
That's enough to create 62 new millionaires every hour, with enough
left over for a new minivan.
</P>
<P>
   The prosperity, however, hasn't been evenly shared. The great
American wealth machine is making the richest Americans richer
while its poorest workers fall farther behind.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, only the highest-earning Americans have
seen their net worth grow after inflation, and these same fortunate
few have collected an ever-growing share of the nation's income.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton touts the achievements of the economy's
winning streak, aides concede that leveling the economic playing
field, a central goal of his administration, continues to elude
policy makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're completely satisfied,'' Martin Baily,
chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told
reporters this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly progress that needs to be made,'' said
Baily, ``to make sure that everyone shares in that prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration claims that it has begun to make headway.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1993 and 1998, Baily pointed out, income for the poorest
fifth of the nation's workers grew at about 2.7 percent a year, on
average, compared with 2.4 percent growth for the highest paid 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But those gains, driven almost entirely by a $1-per-hour hike in
the minimum wage, have been swamped by longer-term trends in income
and wealth distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear who's getting what here,'' said New York
University economist Edward Wolff. ``We've seen a continuation of
rising inequality, though at a moderating rate.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are varied, and not all are confined to traditional
economics.
</P>
<P>
   _ The economy is evolving in ways beyond the average working
family's control.
</P>
<P>
   Workers must adapt to the revolution in computer and
communications technologies, the growing importance of services
over goods, and the sharp increase in global trade or face
declining fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The stock market boom, by its very nature, heavily favors
those with the most money to invest.
</P>
<P>
   _ Social factors, ranging from drug use to demographic shifts
away from traditional family structures, continue to hold many
people back.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the causes, some analysts warn that if the trends are
not reversed, fundamental questions of economic fairness will arise
that challenge the ideals of opportunity and egalitarianism at the
nation's political core.
</P>
<P>
   ``It matters, because it goes to the heart of what we believe
about our society,'' said John Weicher, a specialist in income
inequality at the Hudson Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point,'' said Cornell University economist Robert
Frank, ``we have to ask whether the economy is sustainable if all
the growth continues to go to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy's long and potent expansion has showered broad
benefits, to be sure, on workers at all levels.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is a razor-thin 4 percent, its lowest level in a
generation. Average wages for workers who punch the clock have
climbed to $13.50 per hour, up 35 percent since the boom began. And
the poverty rate, at 12.7 percent, is the lowest since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, behind each heartening statistic lies a more complex
and troubling tale.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the wage gains for low-income workers have come since
1997, after Congress raised the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour. Even
so, the minimum wage remains 20 percent below 1970s levels after
adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment remains high for those who lack the education or
skills to compete in the new economy. Nearly 6.5 percent of high
school dropouts can't find work, and the figure is higher for
minority groups such as African Americans, for whom the jobless
rate is near 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While poverty has declined, the reductions have occurred almost
exclusively in the South, which has enjoyed something of a boom
within a boom. Elsewhere across the country, good times haven't
made a dent in the poverty that continues to afflict more than one
in every three children of black or Hispanic descent.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of Americans, in fact, work is no ticket out of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the last year for which figures are available, the
number of full-time, year-round workers living in poverty jumped
459,000 _ the largest such increase in history _ to 2.8 million,
according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you know,'' Wolff said at a recent briefing hosted by
the American Enterprise Institute, ``the worse it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Things aren't getting better over time.
</P>
<P>
   Between World War II and the mid-1970s, the nation's surging
prosperity was broadly spread. ``Everybody saw their income grow at
about 2.8 to 2.9 percent a year,'' said Frank, ``rich and poor
alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past quarter-century, though, the gaps between rich and
poor have widened, both in terms of annual income and accumulated
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-year period from 1978 to 1980, the wealthiest
20 percent of the nation's families earned 7.4 times as much, on
average, as the poorest fifth of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1996 and 1998, the richest fifth was making 10.6 times
as much as the bottom 20 percent, according to a January study by
the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The widening income gap has increased the portion of the
national earnings pie gobbled up by the wealthiest families.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the richest fifth of the nation took in 46.6 percent of
the country's total earnings. By 1998, that figure had grown to
49.2 percent, even as the income meted out to the poorest fifth
fell from 3.9 percent to 3.6 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   In dollar terms, the disparity is no less jarring.
</P>
<P>
   As of 1998, the lowest-paid 20 percent of workers earned, on
average, $9,223 a year. That was just $250 above 1990 levels, after
adjusting for inflation, representing a miserly 2.8 percent gain
over the entire period.
</P>
<P>
   The top fifth, however, got a whopping 17.4 percent raise over
the same period, increasing their annual paycheck by $18,858, on
average, to $127,529.
</P>
<P>
   As income inequality has widened, so too has the difference
between wealth in poor households and rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distribution of wealth is even more skewed'' than lopsided
earnings, said Elizabeth McNichol, an expert on the subject at the
Center of Budget and Policy Priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have money,'' she said, ``you can make money.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, the ledger looks increasingly grim.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1998, families earning less than $10,000 a year
actually lost ground. Their net worth slumped from an
inflation-adjusted $6,200, on average, to $5,600, a decline of 9.7
percent, according to a January report by the Federal Reserve
Board.
</P>
<P>
   Families taking in more than $100,000 per year, however, saw
their wealth jump from $195,500, on average, to $239,500, a gain of
22.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The wealthier a family, the more it stands to gain from good
economic times.
</P>
<P>
   For the richest 1 percent of Americans, said the Hudson
Institute's Weicher, fully half of all wealth comes from ownership
of businesses or investment real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Those assets are at risk, of course, if the economy sours. As it
soars, though, so do the fortunes of asset owners.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the greatest stock market gains, and risks, accrue to
those with the largest stake there.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the country's workers own stocks or mutual funds,
directly or through retirement savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Again, though, the real money is concentrated at the top.
</P>
<P>
   As of 1997, the richest 1 percent of households held half the
stocks and bonds in the country, said Wolff.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 percent accounted for 90 percent of share and bond
holdings and have garnered the greatest benefits from the more than
tripling of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the current
economic run-up began.
</P>
<P>
   Portfolio values further underscore the divide. Only the richest
one-fourth of American families held $10,000 or more worth of stock
in 1997, said Wolff.
</P>
<P>
   The figure has risen, no doubt, with the market gains of the
past three years. The vast majority of American workers, however,
are not getting rich on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Not all analysts accept the suggestion that the economy has
become more ruthless than ever at anointing winners and dispatching
losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distribution of wealth isn't changing in any significant
way,'' said Weicher. ``We're getting richer, the rich and the poor,
at more or less the same rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all economic debates, this one will be settled, if at all,
only with the aid of several years of hindsight.
</P>
<P>
   By then, if the growing body of data is any guide, the rich will
be far richer still, and the poor will be struggling against
ever-lengthening odds.

   &HT;     Is Mr. Clean coming out of the closet? 
 &HT;     By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By David Grimes
</P>
<P>
   NYT Regional Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   How would you like it if you'd been unable to speak since birth
and now you're 42 years old and suddenly, miraculously, you find
yourself able to talk and the first question you are asked is ...
Are you gay?
</P>
<P>
   That is the dreary prospect facing Mr. Clean, the bald hunk with
the earring who's been pitching cleaning products since 1958.
</P>
<P>
   In a new version of his Web site set to open later this month,
Mr. Clean will speak in full sentences for the first time.
Possibly, someone will ask him how to get stubborn dog stains out
the carpet or suggest a trick for restoring the luster to whitewall
tires, but this being America and this being the Web and this being
America's brain on the Web, you've got to think a good number of
questions will have to do with Mr. Clean's sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   For all his cleaning prowess, Mr. Clean apparently has no effect
on dirty minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been receiving questions like that for at least the past
10 years,'' Mr. Clean spokesman Damon Jones told Salon's Amy
Reiter. ``We're not sure where it started _ it could have to do
with his earring or his attire _ but we like to think Mr. Clean was
just a man before his time.''
</P>
<P>
   The don't-ask-don't-tell policy may be good enough for the
military, but it's not good enough for Mr. Clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll definitely have an answer to that question,'' Jones
said. ``Whether it will be the answer people want to hear or not,
that's a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear, to me at least, what answer people do want to
hear. What good, after all, is a cleaning product if it never comes
out of the closet? If you keep two Mr. Cleans side-by-side under
your sink, will you be breaking the law in Hawaii? How about Texas?
Why haven't we heard the Rev. Jerry Falwell weighing in on this?
Has he suddenly gone soft on switch-hitting mopping solutions?
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, this flap over Mr. Clean's image comes at a time
when the average American home is dirtier than it's ever been.
</P>
<P>
   According to USA Today, the average time that married couples
spend doing housework has dropped from 36 hours a week in 1965 to
29 hours a week now. The newspaper did not say whether those lost 7
hours are now spent pondering the sexual orientation of fictional
cartoon icons, but I think the implication is clear.
</P>
<P>
   (Guys will be happy, or unhappy, to know that we're doing more
housework now than in 1965, 9 1/2 hours a week compared to 4 1/2
hours. It's women who have slacked off, dropping from 27 hours a
week to 15 1/2 hours. No wonder the house is such a mess.)
</P>
<P>
   I think I speak for a lot of Americans when I say that Mr. Clean
can dress up in high-heels and a low-cut dress if he agrees to come
in and clean bathrooms. The earring thing is not a problem either,
as long as he can get that green mossy stuff out of my shower.
</P>
<P>
   For his 40th birthday two years ago, Procter and Gamble
described the image of Mr. Clean as someone who approaches home
life as a ``partnership'' by ``helping to clean, organize, repair,
shop, assist with homework, provide emotional and other support
(and) makes life better and easier for their mate and everyone in
the home.''
</P>
<P>
   If a person like that volunteered to go to work in my house, I
would be overjoyed and much too grateful to ask what side of the
plate he bats from or any other questions that are none of my
business.
</P>

 &HT;     (For release Friday, Feb. 18)  
 A romantic getaway easy to rationalize  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A short getaway, perhaps to take advantage of the kids going to
your brother's or maybe just a compelling need to be where e-mail
doesn't go, is something that even workaholics can rationalize.
</P>
<P>
   The getaway is not like a real vacation. The umbilical cord to
everyday life is only briefly cut. You don't even have to drive
into a different area code. The goal is to simply play hooky for a
weekend, although it's even more mischievous if you do it in the
middle of the week.
</P>
<P>
   I think that's why B&AMP;B's thrive, because they invite you do the
things that you might do at home if you could indulge yourself free
time without guilt. To stare outside at the rain, read all day by
the fire, eat chocolate in bed. Were you to do this on a Saturday
in your own house someone would certainly wonder if you were sick
or sulking.
</P>
<P>
   We need our getaways, even more so now that so many people's
home is also their office and it's so easy to wreck a Saturday just
by checking your messages.
</P>
<P>
   My pal Rachel, who has an inn in Mendocino, says couples often
come to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, the last time alone
before the baby comes, even the successful completion of a work
project, but more and more the typical couple ``arrives just
exhausted from their normal frenetic pace. What they're looking for
is an excuse to simply do nothing.'' Think of it. Two days being
unaccountable plus baby soaps and free shampoo -- what a great
escape.
</P>
<P>
   In this economy people have more money than time, says Rachel.
``It's very hard to find time to just squander.'' We live in an
overbooked world, when overtime is the norm and multitasking is an
epidemic. You even have to play productively. You plan an extended
vacation and you better come back with adventures, an award-winning
travel video and a list of little known museum shows. There are
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to report what happens on a quick getaway,
because people are going to think all you did anyhow was stay in
bed and read the funny papers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with some couples there may be one who loves the idea
of getting away and one who wonders why a person would choose to
sleep in a strange bed when their mattress knows them so well.
They'll go out to eat, but sleeping over is pushing it.
</P>
<P>
   In long-ago sexist times, we would have assumed that it is more
a womanly thing to crave a night away and that more women than men
appreciate the novelty of leaving wet towels on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But, Cathy, who runs a B&AMP;B in California's Wine Country says
just as many men as women call looking for a room and a place to
chill the champagne. This week she talked to a man who explained
his wife was between jobs and for the first time in a long time
they were both free to get away. Last week Cathy hosted a couple
whose seven kids were stashed elsewhere so they could spend the
whole day in her living room just reading and writing.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a promotion for B&AMP;Bs, but a seasonal reminder that
staying over in some clean, cozy spot which has a claw-foot tub and
a deck to sit with your coffee when the sun breaks through can get
a person as many points as booking a trip to France. You don't even
need to take a change of clothes and it doesn't cost that much
considering the huge breakfasts that are part of the deal. Red
roses and poetry are nice but a person can feel very pampered being
led to a tub full of bubbles and told they needn't worry about the
strain on the well and that a clean terry robe is waiting when they
get out.
</P>
<P>
   Simple pampering is what the workaholic couple craves. Sarah
runs an inn in New England and tells people not to come if they
want chandeliers and velvet drapes but do come if they like dogs
and cats, sleeping in a big bed and well-stocked book shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Reading makes me think of chairs which can be an issue. There's
this person who will agree to go away but first he needs
reassurance about the chairs. He gets a little itchy if he walks
into a room that's over-fluffed and the bed is piled high with
heart-shaped pillows. But he can put up with an excess of lace if
at least the chair is right.
</P>
<P>
   We all have our getaway needs and his is a chair that is
comfortable enough to read and doze in. He believes that's
impossible in anything made out of rattan or wicker.
</P>
<P>
   All I want is a room with a view and a fireplace, wood stacked
and ready to light, no TV, no phone, a window that opens and
someone else up early to make the coffee.
</P>

   IVORY-COAST _ Alassane Ouattara, the former prime minister of
the Ivory Coast, places enormous faith in democracy. It can, he
says, spur economic growth, calm ethnic strife, reduce corruption
and even slow the spread of AIDS. Yet, despite all that, Ouattara
is glad that a coup in December forced his country's president out
of office. Why? Because he thinks the coup will help, rather than
hinder, democracy. Ouattara plans to run for president in elections
he hopes the Carter Center will monitor. (Melvin, Atlanta

   KOREA _ Members of the Korean Community Presbyterian Church were

however, came when the church learned a few months ago that the
federal government plans to deport the deacon because of a 1996
immigration law roundly criticized as unduly harsh. Worry about the
deacon's predicament became the flash point for the first
well-organized political effort among the roughly 50,000 Korean
immigrants in Georgia. (Bixler, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40.

   WASHINGTON _ John McCain, the Republican challenger for the
party's White House nomination, has been accused of virtually
everything else in an increasingly nasty campaign. But now he is
being labelled a KGB spy, a traitor and perhaps even a brainwashed

comic and the vile. Although absurd, the accusations will harm
McCain among some of the veterans in South Carolina, a crucial

   LIVERMORE, Calif. _ A Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
chemist has quit his job to protest its nuclear weapons work.
</P>
<P>
   ``My conscience simply does not allow me to work for the
development or maintenance of nuclear weapons,'' said the chemist,
Andreas Toupadakis, who resigned effective Jan. 31. He was employed
in the study of what happens to nuclear weapons components over
time.
</P>
<P>
   Toupadakis said he originally went to Livermore in August 1998
under the assumption that his work would involve research on
non-military technology, specifically ways to clean up radioactive
waste.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving, he quickly ``realized it was an illusion. All
the jobs are related to nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   One anti-nuclear activist praised Toupadakis' decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is highly unusual for a scientist working in (the) nuclear
weapons program at a government lab to forsake a high-paying
permanent job in the prime of his career and to wholeheartedly
endorse the peace movement,'' said Jackie Cabasso of the Western
States Legal Foundation in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wampler, a spokesman for the lab, said of the resignation:
``Everyone has a right to their own opinion. Dr. Toupadakis has a
right to work here or not to work here as he chooses. ... The
people who work at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory believe
that they are contributing to our nation's defense by maintaining a
nuclear deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Crete, Toupadakis has a doctorate in chemistry from
the University of Michigan. He previously worked for an independent
contractor at the nation's other major nuclear weapons laboratory,
the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Toupadakis said he left Los Alamos because the had faced
radiation dangers that ``I just couldn't believe.'' He said he did
not complain about the Los Alamos pollution because ``if I spoke
out, overnight I would lose my job.''
</P>
<P>
   In deciding to quit, Toupadakis also cited the U.S. Department
of Energy's decision to begin polygraph testing of employees after
recent congressional investigations into alleged espionage at Los
Alamos. The Energy Department oversees the nation's nuclear labs.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 15 Toupadakis wrote a letter of resignation, effective
Jan. 31, to lab director Bruce Tarter. He said Livermore officials
expressed no interest in his decision to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Toupadakis is now teaching chemistry at Ohlone College in
Fremont and Mission College in Santa Clara.

seminal event for the nation's toy manufacturers, it is abundantly
clear that technology has become an essential component in toys for
the nation's children practically from the moment of their birth _
replacing the kinds of inanimate objects once considered
playthings, and supplanting adult involvement in activities like
learning the ABC's and singing a baby to sleep. The trend appears
to be breathing new life into toys whose sales might otherwise have

 &HT;    Old-fashioned fare has soothing, therapeutic effect
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It gets late early out there.'' _ Yogi Berra
</P>
<P>
   'Tis the season for comfort foods. Unlike those little
medallions of something or other arranged on an oversize plate,
with _ if you're lucky _ a couple of baby carrots and three or four
green beans for color, then drizzled with swirls of some kind of
sauce like a Jackson Pollock painting and topped with a sprig of
brittle herb, comfort food makes no claim at being trendy or arty
or nouveau anything. The claim of comfort food is simply that it
hits the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort food is difficult to categorize. But like art, it
depends on the eye _ or the taste _ of the beholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is life in a nutshell _ you're born, someone slaps you,
you cry, someone gives you milk, you stop crying'' is the
straightforward way comfort foods are described in a cookbook of
the same name by Rita M. Harris.
</P>
<P>
   A bit tonier description comes from ``Simple Abundance: A
Daybook of Comfort and Joy'' by Sarah Ban Breathnach. ``When the
miseries strike and you're down in the dumps, food transformed by
love and memory becomes therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   What all comfort foods do have in common is their ties to our
past and memories of life as a fairly uncomplicated proposition _
before we started obsessing about good and bad cholesterol, fat
ratios and ketosis.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has their own favorite comfort food. If I could but
taste again a stuffed artichoke like my mother, Josephine, used to
make, I know I would weep with the joy of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort food can range from meatloaf and mashed potatoes all the
way to scones. Tomato soup, banana sandwiches, macaroni and cheese,
rice pudding, strawberry shortcake, fried chicken and biscuits, lox
and bagels and veal Parmesan all rate high in the comfort food
category.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort for winter days and nights
</P>
<P>
   If you want to experiment with what comforts others, check out
these sites for some new recipes and new twists that might put some
ease into those chilly, dreary winter days and nights.
</P>
<P>
   Most comfort foods prepared the old-fashioned way don't have
today's higher nutritional standards. If you are serious about good
nutrition, there's no need to give up your favorite comfort foods
of old. Dietitian Michele Peters offers recipes for some
slimmed-down versions of old favorites like macaroni and cheese,
pot roast and meatloaf at
www.homearts.com/mrfood/articles/49comf16.htm.
</P>
<P>
   For other low-fat comfort food recipes, including a beauty for
pineapple upside-down cake, see
www.californiaheartland.org/archive/hl314/comfort.htm.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in Vegetarian Journal, Rachel Himmelheber says
that when she craves comfort food, she goes to the same old-timey
diner and orders a vegetable plate. On one visit, though, she
couldn't keep her eyes off her neighbor's plate, which was heaped
with a hot open-faced hamburger sandwich, with mounds of mashed
potatoes and gravy. ``My fresh corn on the cob was wonderful, but I
</P>
<P>
   envied how rich and comforting their dinner looked.''
</P>
<P>
   She set out to develop vegetarian recipes with the comfort-food
component, including a chicken soup with no chicken that looks like
it may do the trick. See www.vrg.org/journal/vj98jan
</P>
<P>
   /981vegan.htm.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the dietary spectrum comes ``Radiance, the
magazine for large women,'' which put out a call on the Internet to
people in the fat-acceptance and big-folks news groups for stories
about their favorite comfort foods. To check out the great
responses, stories, some humdinger recipes and to see what these
gals can do with peanut butter, eggs, rotini pasta, Monterey Jack
cheese and fudge, see www.radiancemagazine.com

   Comfort food is not the prerogative of Americans. Asian cultures
have comfort foods, too. For comfort food with an Asian flair, see

meat and potatoes, it just doesn't count, see ``Comfort Foods Made
Easy With Beef'' at www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/food/greattastes
</P>
<P>
   /cgt08s01.html.

importance. For ideas on what to put on the dinner tray of a person

 &HT;    There's nothing like a pot roast, slow-cooked for Sunday-dinner
like Mom used to make
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My mother's brisket was a company dish, served with buttered
noodles on the Wedgwood platter from the top shelf of the china
closet. My mother's pot roast was a family dinner, a haphazard
thing forgotten in the oven and then served in its battered
roasting pan. We peeled back the aluminum foil cover and pulled off
shreds of meat and pried loose the carrots and potatoes as sweet
and brown and sticky as caramel candy.
</P>
<P>
   Like every good hausfrau of her generation, my mom combined two
of the most common but tasty convenience products _ Lipton onion
soup mix and Heinz chili sauce _ and let the alchemy of the slow
braise take it from there. Time was a readily available seasoning
in her pantry, one she could always add at will to transform cheap
ingredients into the flavors and smells of home.
</P>
<P>
   My home smells like that only on weekends, when I find the time
to even consider the four-hour proposition of a pot roast. But I'm
glad when I do.
</P>
<P>
   Like my mom, I always begin with a chuck blade roast _ the big,
thick, flat, fat-marbled slab that has that beefy flavor deep in
its fiber. A chuck roast is such an easy thing to cook because it
needs only time. It forgives variations in the recipe _ the amount
of braising liquid, the temperature, the cooking vessel _ as it
transforms inexorably from a chewy mass into shred-apart fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The trick, of course, is to catch the roast during the window
when it is succulent and sliceable but before it separates into
visible strings.
</P>
<P>
   I tested chuck roasts for this article, cooking one in a covered
Dutch oven on top of the stove, another in a foil-covered roasting
pan in the oven. I even burnt one beyond all recognition, which is
something my mother never did, I suppose because she always put it
in the oven after ``All My Children'' and took it out when my dad
came home at precisely 6:10.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, to my taste the best pot roast was cooked in the oven at
275 degrees for slightly more than three hours. After four hours it
begins to dissolve into shreds.
</P>
<P>
   If I wanted to use the braising liquid as a gravy, I found it
necessary to decant it to drain off the copious fat.
</P>
<P>
   We tested some gourmet-seeming recipes that called for white
wine and brandy. We played around and cooked one pot roast with
smoky Mexican chipotle peppers. We looked deep into an empty pantry
and still managed to fashion a great braising liquid from beer,
balsamic vinegar and an oddly perfect secret ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   And then we went back to onion soup mix and chili sauce and
agreed that was the best of all. Even for company.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Note
</P>
<P>
   Chefs and other food professionals often sear meats, then braise
them slowly at low temperatures, but the USDA Meat &AMP; Poultry
Hotline advises home cooks to set their controls higher. Our best
pot roast recipes inside can be made either way.

 &HT;    Spiced up or homey, roast will win raves
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The term pot roast is kind of a misnomer if you consider that
the meat is braised rather than roasted and that most people use a
high-sided pan or skillet rather than a pot. But ``braised chuck''
just doesn't have that homey ring, does it?
</P>
<P>
   You can get a chuck blade roast with or without bones, and in
our tests we noticed no difference in how the roasts behaved or
tasted, so it's solely a matter of preference.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some recipes that Mom would approve of. And a few that
she wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Chipotle Pot Roast
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 3 1/2-4 hours
</P>
<P>
   This recipe is particularly delicious when you shred the beef
and toss it with the defatted sauce. Then it becomes a delicious
base for tacos and burritos. Otherwise, serve with polenta or
mashed potatoes to soak up the spicy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 top blade roast or top chuck roast (about 3-4 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, diced
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground Mexican oregano
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon New Mexican red chile powder
</P>
<P>
   1 or 2 canned chipotle peppers, mashed
</P>
<P>
   2 cups tomato juice
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 275 degrees (see Safety Note). Heat the oil in a
large skillet over a medium-high flame. Salt and pepper roast and
sear in pan until very brown on both sides. Remove. Add onion and
garlic and saute until translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Add spices
and mashed chipotle and stir until the chile tickles your nose,
about 30-45 seconds. Add tomato juice and stir well, loosening
brown bits in the bottom of the skillet. If skillet is oven-safe,
add roast to pan, cover with foil and place in the oven. If not,
place roast in a high-sided baking dish, pour contents of skillet
into dish and cover with foil. Braise in oven for 3-4 hours, until
very tender. Before serving, decant juices from pan into a large
measuring cup and let fat separate to the top. Remove fat.
</P>
<P>
   If desired, wait until meat is cool enough to handle and shred
it with your fingers. Toss with the reserved pan juices. Serve with
warmed corn or flour tortillas, shredded lettuce, sour cream,
sliced avocado and lime juice.

   Balsamic-Ale Pot Roast
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings

<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 3 1/2-4 1/2 hours

   Chinese oyster sauce gives a sweet, earthy depth charge to long
braises as well as stir-fries. And, as odd as the combination
sounds, it combines well with balsamic vinegar. This easy recipe
has more flavor than the short ingredient list would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 top blade roast or top chuck roast (3-4 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   1 medium white onion, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 bottle of good ale (we used Pete's Wicked Ale)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup Chinese oyster sauce
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 275 degrees (see Safety Note). Heat the oil in a
large skillet over a medium-high flame. Season roast with salt and
pepper and sear in pan until very brown on both sides. Remove. Add
sliced onions to pan and stir until they begin to wilt and turn
fragrant. Add remaining ingredients and stir well, loosening brown
bits in the bottom of the skillet. If skillet is oven-safe, add
roast to pan, cover with foil and place in the oven. If not, place
roast in a high-sided baking dish, pour contents of skillet into
dish and cover with foil.
</P>
<P>
   Braise in oven for 3-4 hours, until very tender. Before serving,
decant juices from pan into a large measuring cup and let fat
separate to the top. Remove fat.

<P>
   Pot Roast (Braised Roast)
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours
</P>
<P>
   The coffee and brandy give this pot roast a subtle perfume. The
author, a ``Cook's Illustrated'' editor, tested pot roasts cooked
at different temperatures and found that the relatively low 200
degrees produces the most succulent roast. The USDA recommends 325
degrees for safety. See Safety Note.
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1 pot roast (top blade roast or top chuck roast), about 3 pounds
</P>
<P>
   2 slices bacon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, diced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon instant coffee powder mixed with 1 tablespoon hot
water
</P>
<P>
   1 cup low-salt beef or chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon brandy
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 200 degrees (see Safety Note). Mix together the
thyme, cloves, allspice, pepper and salt and rub over meat.
</P>
<P>
   Cook bacon in a heavy pot just large enough to hold the pot
roast. Remove bacon (reserve for another recipe) and all but 1
tablespoon of fat. Add olive oil and brown pot roast on all sides
over medium-high heat. Remove meat to a platter or bowl; add onion
and carrot to pot and saute for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add wine, coffee, broth, brandy and bay leaf and scrape bottom
of pot with a wooden spoon. Boil rapidly for 3 minutes, stirring
constantly. Add pot roast, along with juices that have accumulated
in the bowl, and cook over medium heat until liquid starts to
simmer. Ladle liquid over roast and cover roast loosely with
aluminum foil. Cover pot tightly with aluminum foil, then cover
with lid. Immediately place in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Cook about 3-4 hours. Remove meat from pot and cover with
aluminum foil, then pour braising liquid into the bowl of a food
processor. Process for 7 seconds. Return puree to the pot, place
over medium heat and bring to a simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Add the cornstarch mixture and whisk until thickened. Serve with
sliced pot roast.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure cooker variation: This is the best method for cooking a
pot roast, but you will need a 5-quart pressure cooker to hold the
meat.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the directions above, browning the meat in the pressure
cooker, and when the pot roast is added back to the pot after
browning, place the roast in the pressure cooker on top of the
trivet (most models have round metal trays that allow the roast to
sit above the liquid; if yours does not have one, simply place the
roast on the bottom of the cooker), secure the top of the cooker
and bring it up to high pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Cook under high pressure for 60 minutes. Remove from heat, allow
pot to cool on stovetop, and when pressure subsides, remove cover
and proceed. _ From ``The Cook's Bible'' by Christopher Kimball

   Is it simply the nostalgia that makes this taste so good? That
unmistakable odor of onion soup mix meeting chili sauce and onions
that so many people remember from childhood? Who knows. But if
there's a better pot roast on the planet, we'd like to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Sauce:
</P>
<P>
   1 package dried onion soup mix
</P>
<P>
   3 medium onions, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 celery ribs, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 cup bottled chili sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 bottle lager beer
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1 (4- to 6-pound) piece of beef brisket or chuck or 6 pounds
short ribs, trimmed of most external fat
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Water or beef stock if necessary
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Combine sauce ingredients (soup mix
through water) in a large Dutch oven with a cover or in a covered
casserole. Put the meat in and spoon some of the sauce over the
top. Cover the pot and bake for 2 1/2 to 4 hours. Check the meat
after 2 1/2 hours to see if it's fork tender. If not, cook until
done. Ideally, you should refrigerate the meat and sauce overnight,
remove the congealed fat, then slice and reheat the meat in the
sauce. Or you can degrease the sauce, taste for salt and pepper,
slice the meat and serve it in the sauce immediately. If the sauce
seems too thick, dilute it with a little water or stock. _ From

   Chefs and food professionals, including Atlanta food scientist
Shirley Corriher, widely tout cooking roasts at 200 degrees for
maximum flavor and tenderness and maintain the practice is safe, so
long as the meat is seared first, to kill any surface bacteria, and
cooks no longer than 4 hours in an accurate oven. Be sure to test
the temperature of your oven with an oven thermometer. Cooking it
longer at a low temperature could create an environment where
harmful toxins can develop, Corriher says.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA, however, recommends not taking any chances and advises
cooking meats at a temperature no lower than 325 degrees. The meat
will not be as tender, Corriher says, but it should be acceptable.
(Incidentally, the pot roast method in ``Joy of Cooking'' (1980
edition) calls for cooking a 3- to 4-pound roast at 300 to 325
degrees for 3 to 4 hours.)
</P>
<P>
   If you do go the higher-temperature route, Corriher suggests
cooking the meat several hours longer than the cooking time called
for, adding more liquid if necessary to keep it from drying out.
For tough cuts of meat, longer cooking times produce more tender
</P>
<P>
   results, ``so it will eventually reach a fall-apart stage,
although it still won't be as tender and juicy as one cooked at a
lower temperature.''
</P>
<P>
   Any pot roast recipe, she adds, also may be adapted for a
crockpot. After searing the meat, place it in the crockpot first on
high for 30 minutes, then on low for 7 or 8 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Choose the cooking method you feel most comfortable with. If you
are serving the roast to anyone who is very young, very old or has
a compromised immune system, it's wisest to go with the USDA
recommendation.

   Cooking time: 4 hours
</P>
<P>
   Food stylist Mary Ann Clayton, who devised this recipe,
recommends serving it with soft polenta _ a better match for the
robust sauce than couscous. It would also be good with rice.
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon turmeric
</P>
<P>
   1 3-pound beef roast, chuck or brisket
</P>
<P>
   2 preserved lemons, rinsed (found in jars in Asian and Indian
groceries and some gourmet foods shops), and cut in thin strips
</P>
<P>
   1 cup brined black olives (Greek or Kalamata), pitted
</P>
<P>
   5 small onions, quartered
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons honey
</P>
<P>
   2 cups hot water
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl combine the paprika, coriander, cinnamon, black
pepper and turmeric. Pat this mixture on the beef roast and place
in a roasting pan. Add the lemons, olives and onions to the pan.
Dissolve the honey in the water and pour over the roast. Pour in
additional water to a depth of 1 inch. Cover tightly and bake for 3
1/2 to 4 hours. Check periodically after a couple of hours to make
sure roast does not dry out. Add a little more water if necessary
to ensure about 2 cups of sauce. When roast is falling-apart
tender, remove from oven and let it rest about 20 minutes before
serving.

 &HT;    Fudge formula classic treat made for sweet tooth
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A fudge formula sent in by Anna Judd of Lawrenceville, Ga.,
should satisfy Phyllis Flory's sweet tooth. Someone Flory used to
know made a fudge with light brown sugar that tasted much like the
See's brand, and she hoped to duplicate it.
</P>
<P>
   Judd, who recently moved South from southern Indiana, found the
</P>
<P>
   recipe in a small book called ``Candy Cookbook,'' published in
1966 by Favorite Recipes Press in Nashville. ``It's one of those
oldies full of classics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has made this fudge many times and says her daughter really
likes it.

   Home Section stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Thursday, Feb. 17:
</P>
<P>
   DESIGN-LEGACY (New York) _ In London, Washington and, most
recently New York, attendance at the traveling exhibition on
Charles and Ray Eames, the post-war design mavericks, broke museum
records. But most people filing by to marvel at their plywood
molding experiments _ the prototypes that didn't quite cut it and,
eureka!, the ones that did _ were unaware that nearly every major
American institution had passed on the opportunity to buy the
Eameses legacy of furniture invention. The Museum of Modern Art and
the Metropolitan Museum of Art were among those that turned it
down, leaving the Eames family faced with huge inheritance taxes,
the threat of eviction and the prospects of selling off the
products, piecemeal, to resale stores. The preservation movement
that routinely takes up arms to protect buildings with an
established cultural significance has yet to take an active role in
saving America's modern design legacy. By Julie V. Iovine.

   METAL-INTERIORS (New York) _ Americans consumed 130 million tons
of steel last year. Some were extremely fussy about it. The
minimalist vogue has elected crude metal the interior material of
the moment. From the TSE boutique to Gianni Versace to the Giorgio
Armani offices and showroom, enough steel, aluminum and bronze has
gone in recently to make New York City the newest Rust Belt. And
Thomas Hand, a metalworker and ex-sculptor with a studio on Leonard
Street in TriBeCa, is the cold-rolled-steel set's current ``It''
Boy. By William L. Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   DIANNA-ROSE (Undated) _ When Elton John sang ``Goodbye England's
Rose'' at Westminster Abbey in 1997, who knew it would lead to
``Hello Garden Sales''? Bonnie Masterson, who runs a little company
called Collectible Commemorative Gardens out of Tulsa, Okla., calls
it ``one of life's little miracles.'' Lt. Col. Kenneth Grapes, the
director general of the Royal National Rose Society in England,
thinks it is ``the most extraordinary coincidence you ever heard
of.'' The players, with their collision of rolling Southern accents
and clipped British voices, are all counting on profits to flow in
from a new rose dedicated to Diana, Princess of Wales. By Anne
Raver.
</P>

   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Dora
Galitizki.
</P>
<P>
   DOG-PICTURES (New York) _ When the John Emms painting of dogs
called ``A Jack and Two Knaves'' sold on Tuesday for $125,000, more
than three times the low estimate, the audience let out a
collective whoop _ and the auctioneers breathed a sigh of relief.
Only two lots before, another Emms painting ``Sailor and Bramble''
didn't sell at all. Tuesday was Dog Day at the William Doyle
Galleries. With the Westminster Kennel Club show packing dog lovers
in to the point of claustrophobia at Madison Square Garden, the
auctioneers hoped this would be an ideal time to auction off
hundreds of canine pictures, many of debatable value. By Tracie
Rozhon.

By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suzanne Dunaway grew up Texas in the company of women _
including her mother and two grandmothers _ who made bread (and
other baked goodies) in their kitchens on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, Dunaway continued the tradition in her own kitchen,
offering her creations to friends and family. It was a compliment
that turned a family tradition into a business.
</P>
<P>
   Her new career began one afternoon when a friend who had just
returned from a long trip pulled a 3-month-old loaf of rosemary
focaccia Dunaway had given her out of the freezer and ate it. ``She
called and said, `If you don't get this bread on the market, you're
crazy,' and hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Sunday afternoon in July 1993, and I wasn't busy, so
I baked up a half a dozen rosemary focaccia and took them to a
small neighborhood market _ Beverly Glen Marketplace _ near my home
to see if they would sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Sell they did, and things took off as other small upscale
markets began buying and selling her homemade breads.
</P>
<P>
   Dunaway, now the owner of Buona Forchetta Hand Made Breads in
West Los Angeles, admits she was a little naive about about baking
bread for the masses or running a bread business.
</P>
<P>
   From those half a dozen focaccia, Dunaway found herself baking
1,000 loaves a week in her kitchen. After a year and a half, she
moved to an industrial area in West Los Angeles. By this time, her
husband, Don Carlos Dunaway, gave up a successful 25-year
screenwriting career to join her. And the rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   Today Buona Forchetta (which means ``good fork'' in Italian)
produces 4,000 to 6,000 loaves a day with a team of 40 employees.
Most of the breads are sold in supermarkets with a small percentage
going to caterers and restaurants. Dunaway's breads continue to be
made from the family tradition _ by eye and by hand. However, the
dough is now mixed in a commercial mixer.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of customers, friends and her cooking school
students, she shares her techniques and recipes in ``No Need to
Knead, Handmade Italian Breads in 90 minutes,'' (Hyperion; $24.95)
which she also illustrated. The 85 recipes are her originals and
interpretations, developed over years of trial and error. They are
the same country loaves, filoncini, focacce and other basic breads
sold by Buona Forchetta.
</P>
<P>
   Dunaway is out to dispel the mystique surrounding bread baking _
that it is intimidating and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so easy to make bread. Don't be afraid _ throw your fear
away. Bread is the most forgiving material in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   She points out that the wonderful smell of the bread baking and
wafting through the air in your kitchen is a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who has never cooked _ or people who have been cooking
a lifetime _ can make my world-class breads. No special equipment,
knowledge or skill is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the breads in the book use store-bought bread flour and
yeasts _ not fancy starters _ require no kneading (except brioche)
_ and can be whipped up in a matter of minutes using tap water and
commercial salt. Of course, they will require some rising time _
either overnight in the fridge (this is the quickest way to have
bread on hand every day in very little time) or at room temperature
_ and some will need more rising time once shaped.
</P>
<P>
   A renegade of sorts, Dunaway uses no proofers,
temperature-controlled equipment, deck ovens or peels (as is usual
in conventional commercial bread-baking) and regularly breaks every
rule in the book about baking. She advocates moist, unworked doughs
(far wetter than conventional bread doughs most bakers use) for
yielding a chewy, open structure and texture in breads like
focaccia. And she doesn't punch down her dough, preferring instead
to fold it over on itself with just a few hand strokes.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve better taste, she also believes in maximizing surface
area (crust) in relation to volume (crumb) and bakes her breads at
a higher temperature than normal.
</P>
<P>
   She says her breads are not like other breads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crusts are lighter, chewier, user-friendly; the crumb is
moist and stays fresh longer than most breads; ingredients are
simple and to-the-point _ no froufrou, as I call it. No fat, sugar
or dairy products are used in the basic doughs at Buona
Forchetta.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides traditional and special breads, sweet loaves, pizza (and
even some cakes), Dunaway also includes chapters in the book on
breads for children and how to use breads in other creations _ like
bread soups, bread salads, bruschetta, bread souffles and bread in
pasta, rice or desserts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know what to do with stale bread or half a loaf
of bread. You can make all kinds of great things like Pears in
Carmel With Cheese on Toast, Chocolate Bread Pudding and Penne With
Broccoli and Anchovies.''
</P>
<P>
   It's time to roll up your sleeves and get baking with these
inspirations from ``No Need to Knead.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FOCACCIA &QL; 
(BASIC DOUGH FOR FLATBREADS OR LOAVES)
</P>
<P>
   This user-friendly dough is about as basic as you can get. It
was the dough that inspired me to start my bakery in Los Angeles.
It is very hardy dough. With it you can make loaves of bread,
flatbreads, crisp breads, little sandwich buns (focaccette), the
French ladder bread fougasse, exotic hamburger buns, bread sticks
and more. You can also forget it in the refrigerator or if you
leave it to rise a little too long, it will bounce back very
easily. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
2 cups lukewarm water (85 to 95 degrees F) &QL; 
2 teaspoons active dry yeast &QL; 
4 cups unbleached bread flour &QL; 
2 to 3 teaspoons regular salt &QL; 
2 to 3 teaspoons olive oil &QL; 
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary &QL; 
1 teaspoon sea OR kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Measure water into a large bowl. Sprinkle yeast over water and
stir until dissolved. Stir in 2 cups flour and regular salt and
stir briskly until smooth, about 2 minutes. With a strong wooden
spoon or a mixing spoon with a big hole in middle, stir in
remaining 2 cups flour, about 2 minutes longer, just until dough
pulls away from sides of bowl and flour is incorporated.
</P>
<P>
   Dough will be fairly wet and tacky (sticky), but when it pulls
away from sides of bowl and forms a loose ball, you'll know dough
has been stirred sufficiently. If it seems too sticky, stir in an
additional 1/4 to 1/2 cup flour.
</P>
<P>
   SAME-DAY METHOD: Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise
in a warm place until doubled in volume, 30 to 40 minutes. Proceed
with shaping instructions.
</P>
<P>
   OVERNIGHT METHOD: Cover bowl and refrigerate overnight. Dough
will rise in refrigerator and acquire flavor from slower yeast
action. Remove dough 2 hours before shaping and let stand, covered,
in a warm place. Dough will rise for the second time. Proceed with
shaping instructions.
</P>
<P>
   TO SHAPE INTO FOCACCIA: Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Oil 1 or
2 nonstick 13x18-inch baking sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Pour dough onto sheet(s), carefully scraping from sides of bowl
with a rubber spatula. Brush dough with 2 teaspoons olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   To make traditional focaccia with indentations, dip your fingers
into cold water or olive oil and insert them straight down into
dough. Make holes in dough by pulling it to sides about 1 inch at a
time. Pull holes at random to form little craters all over with pan
showing through where you have put your fingers. As you work,
stretch dough into a 1-inch-thick oval. (If you are using just 1
baking sheet, focaccia will cover almost entire sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Brush loaf with another teaspoon olive oil and sprinkle with
rosemary and sea salt. Focaccia does not need to rise, but if you
forget it for a few minutes, don't worry. It will bake beautifully,
despite a little neglect.
</P>
<P>
   TO BAKE FOCACCIA: Place pan(s) in preheated 500-degree oven and
reduce oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or
until focaccia has a nice, golden-brown color mixed with a little
darker brown around indented area. Cut focaccia into wedges or
rectangles and serve warm. Makes 1 large or 2 small focacce.
</P>
<P>
   TO SHAPE INTO LOAVES: Oil a seasoned nonstick, ovenproof 9-inch
skillet or 2 (5-inch) skillets. Pour dough into large pan or divide
equally between 2 smaller pans by loosening dough with a spatula
and then carefully scraping it from sides of bowl, keeping dough as
inflated as possible. If you are using 2 pans, cut dough off at
edge of bowl with spatula as it falls into each pan. The shape that
dough takes on as it falls into pan is fine. Brush tops of loaves
with olive oil, sprinkle with rosemary and sea salt and set aside
to rise until doubled, about 15 to 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 500
degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   TO BAKE LOAVES: Place bread in preheated 500-degree oven and
reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or
until nicely browned and loaf sounds hollow when tapped with your
finger. Remove loaf from pan and cool on a rack. Makes 1 large or 2
small loaves.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: For a breakfast focaccia, mix 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
with 1 cup coarse brown sugar and sprinkle over focaccia in place
of rosemary and salt. &QL;

KALAMATA OLIVE FILONCINO
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our Kalamata Olive Bread is one of the most popular at Buona
Forchetta, most likely because of the quality and taste of the
olives used. Not every olive reacts well with flour and yeast, not
to mention being baked. There is a sweetness to a good brine-cured
olive, in contrast to the acrid, often bitter taste of the olives
marinated in oil used by many bakers. The bread is stained with the
rich dark juice of the briney olives released during baking. Use
other kinds of olives if Kalamatas are not available; the result
will be different. But don't worry, you will most likely come up
with a delicious, new bread. Even martini olives work in a pinch. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups lukewarm water (85 to 95 degrees F) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons active dry yeast &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 1/2 cups unbleached bread flour &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon regular salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup chopped Kalamata olives (OR leave some whole, if
desired) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive paste (see Notes) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup Kalamata olive brine (see Notes) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons olive oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon kosher OR sea salt
</P>
<P>
   Measure water into a large bowl. Sprinkle yeast over water and
stir to dissolve. Stir in 2 1/4 cups flour, regular salt, olives
and olive paste and stir until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add
remaining 2 1/4 cups flour and olive brine and stir.
</P>
<P>
   Dough will be fairly wet and sticky, consistency of a very thick
batter. If dough seems too wet, add an additional 1/4 to 1/2 cup
flour.
</P>
<P>
   SAME-DAY METHOD: Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise
in a warm place until doubled in volume, 30 to 45 minutes. With a
scraper or spatula, fold dough by gently lifting it up from
underneath and turning or folding it over on itself 3 or 4 times.
Let dough rise a second time in a warm place until doubled in
volume, 30 to 45 minutes. Proceed with shaping instructions.
</P>
<P>
   OVERNIGHT METHOD: Cover bowl and refrigerate overnight. Dough
will rise in refrigerator and acquire flavor from slower yeast
action. Remove dough from refrigerator 2 hours before shaping and
let stand, covered, in a warm place. Dough will rise for second
time. Proceed with shaping instructions.
</P>
<P>
   TO SHAPE INTO LOAVES: Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Spray a
3-loaf baguette pan with nonstick spray or rub with olive oil. With
your left hand (or right hand if you are left-handed), hold bowl
and tip it over opening of a groove and pour dough along and into
groove by loosening dough with a spatula. Carefully move along
groove as dough pours, keeping it as inflated as possible. With
spatula, cut dough off at rim of bowl as it falls into groove.
Dough should form a nice, rounded cylinder that fills groove and
stands about 1/2-inch above rim of pan. Fill other 2 grooves.
</P>
<P>
   Brush tops of loaves with olive oil and sprinkle with kosher
salt.
</P>
<P>
   TO BAKE LOAVES: Place pan in preheated 500-degree oven and
reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or
until tops are browned and loaves sound hollow when tapped. Remove
baguetes from pan and cool on wire racks. Makes 3 baguettes.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: If you prefer loaves with crisper undersides, remove
loaves from pan and return them to oven, placing them directly on
oven rack, about 5 minutes. Cool on wire racks.
</P>
<P>
   Make olive paste by putting 2 cups pitted olives in a blender
and pureering until smooth but still a little textured. Excess may
be used for tapenade or on pizza or sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   A strong olive brine is used to pack olives. If brine with
olives you buy does not measure 3/4 cup, add enough water to
measure 3/4 cup and add 1/4 teaspoon salt. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BIGMAMA'S KOLACHES
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother made all of her own breads and pastries, among
them the sweet rolls called kolaches, stuffed with fruit, farmer's
cheese or poppy seeds. In the Czech and German community of Weimar,
Texas, a lot of kolaches changed hands, but undeniably Bigmama's
were different. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened, plus about 3 tablespoons,
melted &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons granulated sugar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dairy sour cream OR plain yogurt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon active dry yeast &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup lukewarm water (85 to 95 degrees F) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup warm milk &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5 cups unbleached all-purpose flour &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apricot Filling OR Cottage Cheese Filling (recipes follow) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 tablespoons sifted powdered sugar (optional)
</P>
<P>
   TO PREPARE DOUGH: In a large mixing bowl, beat together 1/2 cup
softened butter and granulated sugar until creamy. Add eggs, sour
cream and salt. Dissolve yeast in water and stir into mixture.
Gradually add milk and flour and stir until dough is smooth and
satiny.
</P>
<P>
   Use about 1 teaspoon melted butter to coat a clean bowl and
place dough in bowl. Cover tightly and refrigerate about 2 hours or
overnight. Dough will rise in refrigerator and gain flavor.
</P>
<P>
   TO SHAPE ROLLS: Remove dough from refrigerator and let stand,
covered, in a warm place about 45 minutes. Rub 2 baking sheets with
melted butter. Divide dough in half and shape each portion into 8
little round flat cakes. Arrange cakes 3 inches apart on baking
sheets.
</P>
<P>
   With your thumb, make a wide, deep indentation in center of each
for filling. Spoon about 2 teaspoons Apricot OR Cottage Cheese
Filling into each indentation. Close dough over filling by
gathering outside of flattened cake and pulling it together like a
drawstring purse over filling. Brush kolaches with remaining melted
butter, cover, and let rise about 30 minutes or until doubled.
</P>
<P>
   TO BAKE ROLLS: Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 20 to 25
minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to cooling racks. If
desired, sift a bit of powdered sugar over tops. Makes 16
kolaches. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

   1 teaspoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   In a saucepan, combine dried apricots with just enough water to
cover. Bring to a simmer and cook until soft. Add sugar and lemon
juice and cook over low heat about 20 minutes, until thick and
shiny. Cool and use to fill kolaches, as directed. Makes about 1
cup. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   PENNE WITH BROCCOLI AND ANCHOVIES
</P>
<P>
   Even the most adamant broccoli haters love this dish, although
it is best not to tell them what's in it. Just serve it and wait.
You may substitute cauliflower for the broccoli, for variety. &QL;

   DESIGN-LEGACY (New York) _ In London, Washington and, most
recently New York, attendance at the traveling exhibition on
Charles and Ray Eames, the post-war design mavericks, broke museum
records. But most people filing by to marvel at their plywood
molding experiments _ the prototypes that didn't quite cut it and,
eureka!, the ones that did _ were unaware that nearly every major
American institution had passed on the opportunity to buy the
Eameses legacy of furniture invention. The Museum of Modern Art and
the Metropolitan Museum of Art were among those that turned it
down, leaving the Eames family faced with huge inheritance taxes,
the threat of eviction and the prospects of selling off the
products, piecemeal, to resale stores. The preservation movement
that routinely takes up arms to protect buildings with an
established cultural significance has yet to take an active role in
saving America's modern design legacy. By Julie V. Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   METAL-INTERIORS (New York) _ Americans consumed 130 million tons
of steel last year. Some were extremely fussy about it. The
minimalist vogue has elected crude metal the interior material of
the moment. From the TSE boutique to Gianni Versace to the Giorgio
Armani offices and showroom, enough steel, aluminum and bronze has
gone in recently to make New York City the newest Rust Belt. And
Thomas Hand, a metalworker and ex-sculptor with a studio on Leonard
Street in TriBeCa, is the cold-rolled-steel set's current ``It''
Boy. By William L. Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   DIANNA-ROSE (Undated) _ When Elton John sang ``Goodbye England's
Rose'' at Westminster Abbey in 1997, who knew it would lead to
``Hello Garden Sales''? Bonnie Masterson, who runs a little company
called Collectible Commemorative Gardens out of Tulsa, Okla., calls
it ``one of life's little miracles.'' Lt. Col. Kenneth Grapes, the
director general of the Royal National Rose Society in England,
thinks it is ``the most extraordinary coincidence you ever heard
of.'' The players, with their collision of rolling Southern accents
and clipped British voices, are all counting on profits to flow in
from a new rose dedicated to Diana, Princess of Wales. By Anne
Raver.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Dora
Galitizki.
</P>
<P>
   DOG-PICTURES (New York) _ When the John Emms painting of dogs
called ``A Jack and Two Knaves'' sold on Tuesday for $125,000, more
than three times the low estimate, the audience let out a
collective whoop _ and the auctioneers breathed a sigh of relief.
Only two lots before, another Emms painting ``Sailor and Bramble''
didn't sell at all. Tuesday was Dog Day at the William Doyle
Galleries. With the Westminster Kennel Club show packing dog lovers
in to the point of claustrophobia at Madison Square Garden, the
auctioneers hoped this would be an ideal time to auction off
hundreds of canine pictures, many of debatable value. By Tracie
Rozhon.

   TERLINGUA, Texas _ Just how gourmet, we wondered, could a Rio
Grande rafting trip be? We were camping on the Mexican border, more
than 100 miles from even so much as a cappuccino stand.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, we of little faith. How gravely we underestimated our
Swiss-born chef, who has more than a dozen years' experience at
river catering: 14 pounds of salmon, 7 pounds of duck breast, 7
pounds of lamb and 60 bottles of wine later, we had embraced
gastronomic nirvana, Chihuahua Desert-style.
</P>
<P>
   Like all groups that take one of the eight trips offered by
outfitter Far Flung Adventures and catered by San Antonio chef
Francois Maeder, the 17 travelers on a three-day float on the Rio
Grande last fall quickly became passionate rafting-cuisine
converts. We swooned as do newly infatuated lovers over the
culinary surprises wrought by a skilled and cheerful staff that
wooed us well with truffles, cream and cognac.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a shared adoration for exquisite food _ mind you,
we're the kind of people who habitually speak with fervor about
what's for dinner while we're savoring every morsel of lunch _ we
shared an appetite for the irresistible measures of mysterious
beauty and isolation that the Big Bend region of southwesternmost
Texas holds.
</P>
<P>
   Our journey began roughly a half-hour's drive west of Big Bend
National Park. After a quick safety chat from one of the guides,
who emphasized the importance of drinking gallons of water in this
desert environment, we were afloat.
</P>
<P>
   The delightful surprise in my raft was better than most
desserts: Our oarsman, the guy who would do all the work for our
minigroup of four, was singer/songwriter Butch Hancock, a Terlingua
resident who's currently touring with his Lubbock pals as the
Flatlanders. Nearly every gourmet trip Far Flung sponsors comes
with entertainment by Hancock or acclaimed Texas music man Steven
Fromholz.
</P>
<P>
   There was just enough water in the Rio Grande to keep the raft
moving, but Butch had to row if we wanted to get anywhere. We
spotted bright-red birds called vermilion flycatchers, myriad
ducks, hundreds of turtles along the way. We talked about food.
</P>
<P>
   Our days of floating were interludes so lazy that some
passengers actually napped on the rounded sides of their rafts. As
Hancock rowed, he pointed out geological oddities in low rises on
either side of the river and shared the homespun philosophies that
come easily to songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly two hours had passed before our first lunch stop, but it
was long enough that some floaters were sunburned and a few beer
drinkers were talking amusing trash. Our accomplished guides put
down their oars and picked up knives to artfully slice tomatoes and
oranges, which they spread on platters with lovely cheeses. We had
impressive platters of cold cuts and spreads such as pesto and
sun-dried tomato with cracked-pepper crackers; none of that Cheese
Nips tackiness, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The first dinner and sleep-over took place at the wax camp, a
campsite on the Mexican side of the river so named for the
proliferation of candeleria plants that are harvested for wax. The
desolate, sandy clearing a few yards from the river quickly became
a small village where river guides tossed up tents in moments,
while the kitchen was erected and put in business by Francois and
two assistants who traveled with him from San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   In 13 years of catering such gourmet rafting gigs several times
each spring and fall, Francois' operation has become seamless. With
Francois' own employees and the experienced hands of the three or
four oarsmen, the elaborate meal unfolded with the precision of a
well-practiced prep line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think menus like this would be hard to prepare at home for
this many people, much less when camping out,'' said Carol
Giddings, a traveler and novice camper from Corpus Christi, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't get the chow jobs have the tasks of pitching
tents, setting up dining tables and establishing the latrines.
Clearly, KP is the desired duty.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's social hour was spent munching Francois' truffle
pate and the cream cheese-stuffed salmon rolls prepared by one of
the oarsmen and sampling various chardonnay and pinot noir
selections. As rafting patrons mingled, we established that our
group was perfectly safe; our numbers, it turned out, included two
physicians and four nurses.
</P>
<P>
   As more wine was poured, we discovered that the retired
commercial airline pilot among us was a devoted bird-watcher. At
the end of the wine guzzling, we found that the two older women in
our outfit would be the most dedicated snorers.
</P>
<P>
   While we quaffed and visited, a dining room sprang up: From the
supply rafts came a spread of folding tables, draped in
snow-white-and-azure linens, as well as folding chairs, glass wine
goblets, china and stainless steel cutlery.
</P>
<P>
   We discovered that the Orvieto classico was an ideal companion
for our first course, angel-hair pasta tossed with olive oil, pine
nuts, sun-dried tomato shreds, freshly chopped garlic and freshly
shredded Parmesan. This was followed by the exquisite main course,
lamb chops cloaked and soaked in a Dijon sauce, then grilled over
an open fire _ for which a nice accompaniment was a Napa cabernet.
</P>
<P>
   Ardent ooohs and aaahhs were heard. Repeatedly. Who said eating
isn't a sensual experience?

&HT;     GRAND JURY PROBE FOCUSES ON BROWN SUPPORTER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LANCE WILLIAMS and CHUCK FINNIE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal grand jury is scrutinizing financial
deals involving Mayor Willie Brown's office and his friend Charlie
Walker, federal subpoenas show.
</P>
<P>
   In four subpoenas issued from June through January, the grand
jury told the mayor's staff to turn over records involving
businesses through which Walker, a political supporter and former
law client of Brown, has sought city funds since Brown became mayor
of San Francisco in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Among the businesses of interest to the grand jury: a candy
company for which Walker unsuccessfully sought a
multimillion-dollar city loan and a nonprofit organization, the
Third Street Economic Development Corp., that obtained a $100,000
federal loan from Brown's Office of Community Development.
</P>
<P>
   The loan to the nonprofit organization is already under scrutiny
by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which told
the city in a letter that the Third Street operation improperly
used the money to buy a building later used as a mosque by the
Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoenas were served at Brown's office, at the Mayor's
Office of Community Development and at an entity known as the
Mayor's Youth Fund. Taken together, they show that the grand jury's
probe has expanded beyond its original scope.
</P>
<P>
   When it began a year ago, FBI agents were investigating possible
criminal wrongdoing involving suspected contracting abuses at the
San Francisco International Airport, which is undergoing a $2.4
billion expansion.
</P>
<P>
   According to people who were interviewed, agents asked about
Walker, who was imprisoned in the 1980s for abusing the city's
minority contracting program, but who in recent years has won about
$800,000 in subcontracts at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The new subpoenas show the FBI and grand jury also are looking
into grants and loans administered by the mayor's office, as well
as real estate projects on city property.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 25 subpoena, for instance, the panel sought records of
meetings between Brown and developers seeking to build an
industrial park at Piers 90 and 92 and housing at the Hunters Point
Naval Shipyard. Both properties are controlled by commissions
appointed by the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been charged with wrongdoing, but the grand jury also
has subpoenaed more than a dozen people, including airport Director
John Martin, to testify.
</P>
<P>
   In July, FBI agents searching for evidence even shut the offices
of the city's Human Rights Commission for a weekend, while they
searched for documents.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has referred questions about the federal probe to the city
attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy City Attorney Joanne Hoeper said Tuesday the mayor has
urged city officials to do ``everything in their power to
cooperate'' with the investigators. She said the subpoenaed records
had been delivered to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has declined to answer questions about the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the subpoenas, the grand jury sought records regarding the
Third Street Economic Development Corp., the organization Walker
founded.
</P>
<P>
   The company is best known for hosting an annual gala honoring
the mayor, but is in a wrangle with HUD over alleged misuse of the
$100,000 grant administered by the mayor's office.
</P>
<P>
   In its grant application, the Third Street company claimed it
had been granted charitable tax-exempt status. But according to the
Internal Revenue Service, it has never received the tax-exempt
status it needed to obtain the grant.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, public records show that, without telling the city,
Third Street last May sold a building to the Nation of Islam, which
used it as a mosque. Last month, a local HUD official told the city
it should repay the $100,000 because it was improper to spend
federal funds on religious activities.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office has been trying to get Walker to account for
the transaction, but has not been successful, city records show.

KALAMATA OLIVE FILONCINO
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our Kalamata Olive Bread is one of the most popular at Buona
Forchetta, most likely because of the quality and taste of the
olives used. Not every olive reacts well with flour and yeast, not
to mention being baked. There is a sweetness to a good brine-cured
olive, in contrast to the acrid, often bitter taste of the olives
marinated in oil used by many bakers. The bread is stained with the
rich dark juice of the briney olives released during baking. Use
other kinds of olives if Kalamatas are not available; the result
will be different. But don't worry, you will most likely come up
with a delicious, new bread. Even martini olives work in a pinch. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 1/4 cups lukewarm water (85 to 95 degrees F) &QL; 
2 teaspoons active dry yeast &QL; 
4 1/2 cups unbleached bread flour &QL; 
1 teaspoon regular salt &QL; 
3/4 cup chopped Kalamata olives (OR leave some whole, if desired) &QL; 
2 tablespoons olive paste (see Notes) &QL; 
3/4 cup Kalamata olive brine (see Notes) &QL; 
2 teaspoons olive oil &QL; 
1 teaspoon kosher OR sea salt
</P>
<P>
   Measure water into a large bowl. Sprinkle yeast over water and
stir to dissolve. Stir in 2 1/4 cups flour, regular salt, olives
and olive paste and stir until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add
remaining 2 1/4 cups flour and olive brine and stir.
</P>
<P>
   Dough will be fairly wet and sticky, consistency of a very thick
batter. If dough seems too wet, add an additional 1/4 to 1/2 cup
flour.
</P>
<P>
   SAME-DAY METHOD: Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise
in a warm place until doubled in volume, 30 to 45 minutes. With a
scraper or spatula, fold dough by gently lifting it up from
underneath and turning or folding it over on itself 3 or 4 times.
Let dough rise a second time in a warm place until doubled in
volume, 30 to 45 minutes. Proceed with shaping instructions.
</P>
<P>
   OVERNIGHT METHOD: Cover bowl and refrigerate overnight. Dough
will rise in refrigerator and acquire flavor from slower yeast
action. Remove dough from refrigerator 2 hours before shaping and
let stand, covered, in a warm place. Dough will rise for second
time. Proceed with shaping instructions.
</P>
<P>
   TO SHAPE INTO LOAVES: Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Spray a
3-loaf baguette pan with nonstick spray or rub with olive oil. With
your left hand (or right hand if you are left-handed), hold bowl
and tip it over opening of a groove and pour dough along and into
groove by loosening dough with a spatula. Carefully move along
groove as dough pours, keeping it as inflated as possible. With
spatula, cut dough off at rim of bowl as it falls into groove.
Dough should form a nice, rounded cylinder that fills groove and
stands about 1/2-inch above rim of pan. Fill other 2 grooves.
</P>
<P>
   Brush tops of loaves with olive oil and sprinkle with kosher
salt.
</P>
<P>
   TO BAKE LOAVES: Place pan in preheated 500-degree oven and
reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or
until tops are browned and loaves sound hollow when tapped. Remove
baguetes from pan and cool on wire racks. Makes 3 baguettes.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: If you prefer loaves with crisper undersides, remove
loaves from pan and return them to oven, placing them directly on
oven rack, about 5 minutes. Cool on wire racks.
</P>
<P>
   Make olive paste by putting 2 cups pitted olives in a blender
and pureering until smooth but still a little textured. Excess may
be used for tapenade or on pizza or sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   A strong olive brine is used to pack olives. If brine with
olives you buy does not measure 3/4 cup, add enough water to
measure 3/4 cup and add 1/4 teaspoon salt. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BIGMAMA'S KOLACHES
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother made all of her own breads and pastries, among
them the sweet rolls called kolaches, stuffed with fruit, farmer's
cheese or poppy seeds. In the Czech and German community of Weimar,
Texas, a lot of kolaches changed hands, but undeniably Bigmama's
were different. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened, plus about 3 tablespoons,
melted &QL; 
4 tablespoons granulated sugar &QL; 
2 large eggs &QL; 
1 cup dairy sour cream OR plain yogurt &QL; 
1 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1 tablespoon active dry yeast &QL; 
1/4 cup lukewarm water (85 to 95 degrees F) &QL; 
1 cup warm milk &QL; 
5 cups unbleached all-purpose flour &QL; 
Apricot Filling OR Cottage Cheese Filling (recipes follow) &QL; 
2 to 3 tablespoons sifted powdered sugar (optional)
</P>
<P>
   TO PREPARE DOUGH: In a large mixing bowl, beat together 1/2 cup
softened butter and granulated sugar until creamy. Add eggs, sour
cream and salt. Dissolve yeast in water and stir into mixture.
Gradually add milk and flour and stir until dough is smooth and
satiny.
</P>
<P>
   Use about 1 teaspoon melted butter to coat a clean bowl and
place dough in bowl. Cover tightly and refrigerate about 2 hours or
overnight. Dough will rise in refrigerator and gain flavor.
</P>
<P>
   TO SHAPE ROLLS: Remove dough from refrigerator and let stand,
covered, in a warm place about 45 minutes. Rub 2 baking sheets with
melted butter. Divide dough in half and shape each portion into 8
little round flat cakes. Arrange cakes 3 inches apart on baking
sheets.
</P>
<P>
   With your thumb, make a wide, deep indentation in center of each
for filling. Spoon about 2 teaspoons Apricot OR Cottage Cheese
Filling into each indentation. Close dough over filling by
gathering outside of flattened cake and pulling it together like a
drawstring purse over filling. Brush kolaches with remaining melted
butter, cover, and let rise about 30 minutes or until doubled.
</P>
<P>
   TO BAKE ROLLS: Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 20 to 25
minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to cooling racks. If
desired, sift a bit of powdered sugar over tops. Makes 16
kolaches. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
APRICOT FILLING &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 (8-ounce) package dried apricots &QL; 
Water &QL; 
2/3 cup sugar &QL; 
1 teaspoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   In a saucepan, combine dried apricots with just enough water to
cover. Bring to a simmer and cook until soft. Add sugar and lemon
juice and cook over low heat about 20 minutes, until thick and
shiny. Cool and use to fill kolaches, as directed. Makes about 1
cup. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
COTTAGE CHEESE FILLING &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 cup large- OR small-curd cottage cheese &QL; 
1/2 cup sugar &QL; 
1/4 cup toasted bread crumbs (crumbs made from rosemary focaccia
are good in this) &QL; 
1 large egg yolk &QL; 
1 tablespoon grated lemon peel &QL; 
Pinch ground mace &QL; 
Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   Loosen lid on cottage cheese container or loosely cover a
measured cup of cottage cheese and leave on countertop at room
temperature about 12 hours to sour.
</P>
<P>
   Mix cottage cheese, sugar, bread crumbs, egg yolk, lemon peel,
mace and salt until very smooth. Use to fill kolaches, as directed.
Makes about 1 cup. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PENNE WITH BROCCOLI AND ANCHOVIES
</P>
<P>
   Even the most adamant broccoli haters love this dish, although
it is best not to tell them what's in it. Just serve it and wait.
You may substitute cauliflower for the broccoli, for variety. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Salt &QL; 
Water &QL; 
1 1/2 pounds fresh broccoli, trimmed, cut into florets and stems
removed &QL; 
3/4 cup olive oil &QL; 
4 cloves garlic, minced &QL; 
1 cup tomato sauce OR 4 ripe tomatoes, diced &QL; 
1 (2-ounce) tin anchovies in olive oil, drained &QL; 
4 tablespoons raisins &QL; 
2 tablespoons drained capers &QL; 
2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint &QL; 
1/2 cup pine nuts &QL; 
3/4 cup fresh bread crumbs &QL; 
16 ounces uncooked penne &QL; 
Juice of 2 large lemons
</P>
<P>
   Put 2 inches salted water in a large pot and bring to a simmer.
Add broccoli, cover and cook about 3 to 4 minutes, just until
tender. Do not overcook. Remove broccoli with a slotted spoon and
set aside. (To keep bright green color of broccoli, run under cold
water 2 to 3 seconds. Drain well.)
</P>
<P>
   Fill same pot with water (for pasta) and add salt to taste.
Bring to a boil, while you make sauce.
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet, heat 1/2 cup olive oil over medium heat, add
garlic and saute 1 or 2 minutes. Add tomato sauce or tomatoes,
anchovies, raisins, capers and mint, and cook about 10 minutes,
stirring until well mixed.
</P>
<P>
   In a small skillet, heat remaining 1/4 cup olive oil over medium
heat, add pine nuts, and toast 2 to 3 minutes, shaking pan several
times to avoid burning. Add bread crumbs and cook 2 to 3 minutes
longer. Remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   Cook pasta in boiling water 9 minutes or just until al dente.
Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of water in pot. Return pasta to
pot and toss with broccoli, tomato sauce and pine nut mixture. Add
lemon juice and serve immediately. Makes 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BRUSCHETTA WITH ARUGULA AND PROSCIUTTO &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
6 (1/2-inch) thick slices bread &QL; 
6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil &QL; 
6 very thin slice prosciutto &QL; 
1 cup chopped arugula leaves &QL; 
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice &QL; 
Salt and finely ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   Grill or toast bread until nicely browned on both sides. Brush
one side of each slice with olive oil. Lay a slice of prosciutto on
each slice of bread.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, combine arugula and lemon juice. Toss gently
and season with salt and pepper. Spoon mixture on toast and serve
immediately. Makes 6 servings. &QL;

and includes all meals, wine, water, tents, waterproof gear bags
and river guides. You bring sleeping bags and pads, or rent them
from the outfitter.
</P>
<P>
   Rafting patrons must be in Terlingua _ about a 10-hour drive
from Dallas/Fort Worth, sans stops _ at Far Flung's offices at 9
a.m. Friday. Overnight lodging in Terlingua-Study Butte includes
the very basic Big Bend Motor Inn, about $70 per night. Some guests
prefer the more atmospheric and expensive Gage Hotel in Marathon,
about an hour north of Big Bend National Park. Far Flung has a list
of lodgings.
</P>
<P>
   The rafting trip usually ends about 3 p.m. on Sunday. Far Flung
will provide a good gear list, which includes things like
sunscreen, rain gear, insect repellent and flashlight.

FAR RIGHT'S ASCENT DIVIDES AUSTRIAN INTELLECTUALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA _ Maybe it was just coincidence, but a few days after the
far right Freedom Party took power in Austria, Walter Famler, the
editor of a left-leaning literary magazine, got a letter from the
federal government informing him that it was canceling its
subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Famler doesn't think the order came from Joerg Haider, the
charismatic leader of the Freedom Party who has a habit of speaking
sympathetically about Nazis while demeaning liberals and
immigrants. Instead, he sees a more worrisome possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some civil servant decided it would not look good to have our
magazine in government offices,'' said Famler, editor and publisher
of Wespennest, which publishes essays by many of Austria's leading
intellectuals. ``Self-censorship is worse and harder to confront
than official censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Freedom Party and the mainstream conservative
People's Party formed a coalition government three weeks ago,
intellectuals and artists have engaged in a heated debate whether
the rise of the far fight imperils intellectual and artistic
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   While the government has not published its cultural agenda, the
new culture minister, Frank Morak, has suggested there will be
budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   While a few artists have likened the arrival of the Freedom
Party to that of the National Socialists in 1938, when the Nazis
annexed a willing Austria, many others, like Famler, consider that
a gross exaggeration and see the rise of the right here as
something that should inspire caution, not panic.
</P>
<P>
   Like the reaction to Haider's party taking power in general, the
outrage among artists and intellectuals seems to have been stronger
outside the country. Lou Reed, the ageless American rocker,
canceled an upcoming concert in Vienna. Elie Wiesel, the
Romanian-born Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Boston University
professor, canceled a lecture in May. French actress Catherine
Deneuve canceled her appearance at the Opera Ball, Vienna's premier
social event. (The Vienna State Opera is of particular interest in
Boston because that will be the new home of outgoing Boston
Symphony Orchestra music director Seiji Ozawa in 2003.)
</P>
<P>
   Sylvain Cambreling, conductor of Germany's Sudwestrundfunk
Orchestra, said that while he is committed to play in this year's
Salzburg Festival, he would no longer perform in Austria because,
``I cannot work with people I consider to be fascists.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Mortier, the Belgian-born artistic director of the
Salzburg Festival who has complained about government interference
in the past, pushed up his departure by a year because of the
Freedom Party's rise.
</P>
<P>
   Artists also have said the rise of the Freedom Party is a threat
to civility and, by extension, artistic integrity. Elfriede
Jelinek, one of Austria's leading dramatists, has forbidden any of
her plays from being performed as long as the Freedom Party is in
power.
</P>
<P>
   While Jelinek also threatened to leave, Ioan Holender, director
of the Vienna State Opera, said artists and intellectuals have a
duty to stay and express their dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not happy with the situation,'' he said. ``But in times
like this we should not close the doors but open our mouths louder.
If we close the doors now, we do exactly what happened with the
Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   With that last sentiment, Holender hit on what has transformed
this debate from one that could be dismissed as just a bunch of
pampered elitists complaining about threats to their subsidies to
one that has extraordinary resonance in a city that could tolerate
the racist diatribes of a young Adolf Hitler and could find no way
to save Sigmund Freud from forced exile.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reaction here, and especially outside Austria, can
be explained by history, especially that of the Holocaust, said
Peter Gerlich, a professor of political science at the University
of Vienna. ``It is an exaggeration to call Haider a fascist,'' said
Gerlich. ``But it doesn't matter if he's a Nazi, because so many
people outside Austria think he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Famler said he is in constant contact with intellectuals across
Europe and is disturbed by what they are telling him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a conversation with a German intellectual, and he
said intellectuals outside of Austria are developing a picture in
which we are the new Serbs. This is very dangerous. Intellectually
and artistically, we could be seen as the new pariah state, whether
that reputation is deserved or not.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, when the Nazis rolled into this gracious city, many
artists and intellectuals rolled out. Some fled because they knew
their artistic integrity would be compromised. Others, like Freud,
the father of psychoanalysis, were Jews and fled for their lives as
well as for their intellectual freedom. Freud got out, but his four
sisters were not as lucky. They were sent to concentration camps
and, like all but 2,000 of the 60,000 Viennese Jews sent to the
camps, were killed. There were 185,000 Jews in Vienna before 1938;
today there are 12,000.
</P>
<P>
   It is often said, only half in jest, that Austria's greatest
accomplishment was that it convinced the world that Hitler was
German and Beethoven was Austrian. In the city where Hitler was
allowed to hone his Aryan theories by arguing them in Vienna's
cafes while Freud had to die in exile in London, the question about
the relationship between the intellectual and the government
remains volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian artists and intellectuals depend heavily on government
subsidies. Famler's magazine, for example, gets a quarter of its
budget from the government. Now that the government has canceled
its subscription, he wonders if the magazine's grant is next. He
said the 12-year-old magazine would fold without its subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, sitting in his office in the capital of Carinthia, the
southern province where he is governor, laughed out loud when told
that artists and intellectuals are worried that the government will
cut back heavily on culture, and seek to censor art and writings
that are critical of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the opposite will happen,'' said Haider, whose office
walls are adorned with the usual ``grip-and-grin'' snapshots of
politicians and with several postmodern paintings. ``I'm
responsible for culture here in Carinthia, and we have spent more,
not less than the last government here. We started a program to
enlarge subsidies. Just ask the actors and artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced. The relatives of the late Ingeborg
Bachmann, a great Austrian poet and author, said Bachmann's name
could not be used on the annual literature prize given in her
memory until Haider guarantees freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing hard on a thin cigar, Gerlich, the bearded, bespectacled
professor, said he does not think Haider will clamp down on the
freedom of expression any harder than the Republicans in Congress
who went after the National Endowment for the Arts for funding
controversial pieces
</P>
<P>
   ``Culturally, I have no fear,'' Gerlich said, exhaling a long
stream of smoke into the air. ``It's simply not true to say that
Austrian civic society is not aware of the past and has not learned
from it. We are and we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Famler, the editor who puts a high-brow magazine out on a
shoestring, is more concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international image is so damaged it will take at least a
decade to get over this,'' he said. ``Intellectuals are leaving.
International performers will not perform here. International
orchestras are cancelling.''
</P>
<P>
   But while he believes calling Haider a Nazi is an exaggeration,
Famler defends the outrage of some artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an overreaction,'' he said. ``Artists send signals.
It is right and proper that they express their concern.''

<P>
   If you were thinking of scrapping your old car for a newer model
to help the environment, think again.
</P>
<P>
   Bert van Wee of the National Institute of Public Health and the
Environment at Utrecht University in the Netherlands has found that
getting rid of your old banger and buying a new car produces more
of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide than just sticking with the
old car.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of CO2, it is without a doubt better to do nothing,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Many countries have introduced policies or tax incentives that
encourage the scrapping of old gas guzzlers so that they can be
replaced by more efficient modern cars. Some environmentalists
claim that this will reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   But van Wee suspected this wouldn't be the case. People hadn't
taken into account the fact that new cars are heavier and more
powerful than older ones. The current Volkswagen Golf weighs about
1,100 kilograms, for example, whereas the first Golf weighed about
800 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
   Van Wee also knew that no one had factored into the equation the
energy used in scrapping and the emissions released in car
manufacture. So to find the true cost to the environment, he and
his colleagues adjusted the statistics on car emissions collected
by the Dutch government.
</P>
<P>
   They introduced figures for emissions resulting from scrapping,
or even recycling, the old cars and from producing new cars.
</P>
<P>
   They found that reducing the average age of cars in the
Netherlands by three years would increase CO2 emissions by 4
percent overall. The problem will persist until new cars are much
more efficient, says van Wee.
</P>
<P>
   He believes their study is, in fact, overly optimistic because
people tend to drive their comfortable new cars more than their old
ones. Choosing a modern car may reduce other harmful emissions such
as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, van Wee
concedes. But these could be mopped up by fitting existing cars
with catalytic converters, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Dunn, an energy transport researcher at the Worldwatch
Institute, the environmental watchdog based in Washington, D.C.,
says that he isn't surprised by the findings. ``We need to think
about the efficiency of the entire life cycle of cars,'' he agrees.
</P>
<P>
   But Dunn cautions that we shouldn't necessarily hang onto our
old cars. He wants car manufacturers to make more effort to improve
car efficiencies and consumers to be more energy conscious in their
choices. Another problem lies in the way the statistics are
gathered. In the US, for example, more than half of new vehicles
produced are classed as sports utility vehicles. These are gas
guzzlers that are excluded from statistics on other cars due to
their different classification.

   ``California Screamin'''
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Dregs. Zebra. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Falling somewhere between the Allman Brothers and Mahavishnu
Orchestra, the Dregs pioneered a kind of rebel-yell fusion in the
late '70s that was marvelously difficult to pin down. It was also
short-lived: the original band split in 1982, and while
composer-guitarist Steve Morse put out sporadic Dregs product for
another decade, nothing recaptured the group's initial spark. Now
Morse has reunited the founding members for a best-of live album.
And for fusion fans, the news is good. ``Screamin''' is a
high-octane return to form that showcases the muscular jazz-rock
that earned the band six Grammy nominations. Morse, whose long
locks once got him expelled from his Augusta high school, continues
to challenge orthodoxy, blurring the line between rock and jazz as
he tears through the Dregs' tight instrumentals and Southern-fried
jams. Highlights include the Jeff Beck-inspired meditation ``Night
Meets Light,'' a countrified romp, ``The Bash,'' and funked-up
covers of Frank Zappa's ``Peaches En Regalia'' and the Allmans'
``Jessica.'' Dixie Dregs perform March 1 at the Tabernacle with
Dream Theater.

<P>
   At the altar of Amel Larrieux's solo debut, you must respect the
26-year-old for the thoughtful (``Infinite Possibilities'') and
often inspiring (``INI) direction she takes lyrically. The warm
Fender Rhodes organ on the first single ``Get Up'', ``Sweet
Misery's'' sensual bass guitar and the hip-hop snap of ``Searchin'
For My Soul'' should incite nothing less than revelry. All as
you're reminded that the former member of the short-lived, mid-'90s
R&AMP;B duo Groove Theory (``Tell Me'') has a surprisingly amorphous
quiver that can scat as convincingly as accomplished jazz singers,
gurgle in the lower registers and throughout this mesmerizing bow,
enrapture.

   All the lacquer has rubbed off of Joni Mitchell's voice. Once
mirror-bright, that shiny instrument has been flue-cured by
cigarettes and age (she's 56) to the color of an old trumpet. The
muted patina suits her new project, ``Both Sides Now,'' a valentine
box of jazz standards, backed by a 70-piece orchestra playing
arrangements so humid they breed mosquitoes. (Think Nelson Riddle,
with sweeteners added.) While other pop divas, from Linda Ronstadt
to Carly Simon, have tried this same packaging, Mitchell's set has
authenticity. Her jazz chops are bona fide and her song choices
fresh. Yet it's still a shock to hear ``A Case of You,'' dropped by
a half-octave since the days of ``Blue,'' delivered with the
cracked vibrato and hoarse colors of a late period Annie Ross.

TERLINGUA, Texas: sensual experience? 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost superfluous were the steamed broccoli and a fluffy green
salad, but the latter was drizzled with Francois' signature creamy
tarragon dressing, subtle and wonderful. Along with dessert _ a
sublime trifle of sponge cake, whipped cream, Baileys, almonds and
white chocolate _ were offerings of port, cognac and cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Francois joined the diners and talked about his work as
chef/owner of Crumpets, a San Antonio restaurant. ``Where does he
get his inspiration?'' the diners asked. ``Where does this artistry
come from?''
</P>
<P>
   It's just a job he enjoys, he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chefs who act like food is art just tick me off,'' said
Francois, who came to San Antonio from Geneva by way of Canada in
1978. ``It's not art. It might be a craft, maybe. But it's really
just a trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The cognac flowed still longer as Butch played his guitar and
sang his songs. Later, those who were sober enough peered at the
crowded blanket of stars through a thoughtfully supplied telescope.
Most everyone was asleep before midnight, but many woke when the
moon made a dramatic rise like a spotlight at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's breakfast was gobbled by a group that was half
bleary-eyed and searching for aspirin and half bright-eyed but
sand-coated from an overnight windstorm. Plenty of strong cowboy
coffee, fresh orange wedges, eggs Benedict on fresh croissants and
fruit pastries kept spirits aloft.
</P>
<P>
   When someone wondered aloud how much wine had been consumed the
night before, Francois announced the tally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-eight bottles,'' he said. ``You're a bunch of
lightweights.''
</P>
<P>
   Our Saturday float took in a setting moon in the deeply blue
Mexican sky, a skunk darting in and out of the riverside brush, a
gorgeous red horse grazing along the bank. The sighting of a dead
beaver drew a ``There's lunch!'' quip from Francois. Nary a snake,
nary a gar _ not that you can see anything in the muddy Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   The rafting staff whipped up a stellar lunch salad of shredded
chicken breasts, which had been chargrilled the night before, mixed
with apples, nuts and seasonings. This was accompanied by more
pesto and sun-dried tomato spreads, olives, smoked oysters and
myriad pickles.
</P>
<P>
   We hiked up rocky hillsides to look down into the mouth of Santa
Elena Canyon, which we drifted deep within after lunch. Guides
described the geological history detailed in layers of ancient,
soaring cliff walls and pointed out cactus we should _ but didn't
always manage to _ avoid.
</P>
<P>
   An afternoon of floating, enveloped by the craggy, towering
walls of Santa Elena Canyon, put us at sunset in our second
campsite _ and into a second stunning riverside nighttime feast.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the sea of tables swept with fresh linens came a
bountiful spread of platters of brie and crackers and chilled
marinated shrimp. During this ``cocktail hour,'' we were serenaded
by Houston oarsman Mike Casper, whose alias _ for good reason _ is
Dr. Fun and who sings a mean Cat Stevens song while playing the
guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Francois crafted a sensational saute of shallots, red wine and
cocoa for the juicy duck breasts he served as appetizers. This he
followed with a main course of gorgeous Alaskan silver salmon
fillets, simply seasoned with dill and black pepper, then
chargrilled and served with crisp, steamed asparagus and a fresh
green salad.
</P>
<P>
   Much merriment, augmented by plenty of port and cognac, followed
our dessert of fresh berry trifle. Butch Hancock and Dr. Fun led
hours of singing beside a roaring campfire before jolly rafters
stumbled over soft, sandy hills to tents and sleep.
</P>
<P>
   As we feasted on chubby breakfast burritos Sunday morning, we
watched a pair of peregrine falcons work the canyon wall, one
acting as a decoy while the second swooped down and nabbed a
white-throated swift for a meal. Breakfast as drama in the Santa
Elena.
</P>
<P>
   Our final float took us out of the canyon and to a hiking
excursion within a lush fern gully on the Mexican side of the
river. An easy climb inside a boulder-strewn limestone cranny
involved one quick stretch through an icy, spring-fed waterfall,
undertaken by all except the rafter who had injured her foot
stepping between rocks, and the one fearful of heights. Even the
party guy who bemoaned the growing distance between himself and his
beer cooler was a good sport.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal finale for our gourmet group was a floating Sunday
afternoon lunch. Tying our rafts together, we drifted for an hour,
drinking champagne and eating a lovely tortellini salad tossed with
vinaigrette and sun-dried tomatoes. Dr. Fun offered a farewell
serenade with softened versions of ``L.A. Woman'' and ``Mustang
Sally.''
</P>
<P>
   Vans awaited us, driving us through the national park, past
landmarks such as Mule Ear Peaks. Too soon, these sights were
replaced by the bleaker (for us, anyway) monuments of reality _ the
golden arches.

</P>
<P>
   EASY PECAN BRITTLE
</P>
<P>
   Yields 1 pound
</P>
<P>
   _ 1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   _ 1 cup pecans, broken
</P>
<P>
   _ 2 tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/2 cup white Karo syrup

   BUCKEYES WITHOUT PARAFFIN: Many, many readers sent in the recipe
for chocolate-covered peanut butter balls. Called Buckeyes, after
the symbol of Ohio, most of the recipes included melted paraffin to
be mixed with the chocolate coating to make it solidify quicker.
Paraffin won't hurt you, but the idea of eating wax is a bit
distasteful. So, here are two recipes that omit the paraffin.
</P>
<P>
   PEANUT BUTTER BALLS
</P>
<P>
   Yields 30
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/2 cup peanut butter
</P>
<P>
   _ 3 tablespoons butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   _ 1 cup sifted powdered sugar
</P>
<P>
   _ 8 ounces chocolate-flavored candy coating
</P>
<P>
   In mixing bowl, combine peanut butter and butter. Gradually add
powdered sugar, stirring until combined. Shape into 1-inch balls;
place on wax paper. Let stand until dry _ about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Chop candy coating. Place in heavy saucepan, cook and stir over
low heat until melted and smooth. Cool slightly. Dip balls, one at
a time, into coating. Let excess coating drip off peanut butter
balls. Place on wax paper; let stand until coating is firm. Store
tightly covered in refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   NUTRITIONAL ANALYSIS PER BALL: 90 calories, 6 grams fat, 9 grams
carbohydrates, 1 gram protein, 3 milligrams cholesterol, 13
milligrams sodium, 60 percent of calories from fat.
</P>
<P>
   PEANUT BUTTER SQUARES
</P>
<P>
   Yields 117 (cq) pieces
</P>
<P>
   _ 2 sticks margarine, melted
</P>
<P>
   _ 1 cup creamy peanut butter
</P>
<P>
   _ 1 cup graham cracker crumbs
</P>
<P>
   _ 1 pound powdered sugar
</P>
<P>
   _ 12 ounces chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   Combine all ingredients except chocolate and press into
9-by-13-inch glass pan. Melt chocolate and spread on top. Let stand
for 2 hours and cut into 1-inch squares. Don't put in refrigerator
before cutting because chocolate will crack when you cut it.
</P>
<P>
   CONTRIBUTOR'S NOTES: The peanut butter mixture can be rolled
into balls and dropped into the chocolate. When I have the time, I
use a plastic candy mold shaped like Reese's cups and, after
coating the mold with melted chocolate, I press a small amount of
the peanut mixture and then cover completely with chocolate.
</P>

milligrams sodium, 60 percent of calories from fat.

   The moment that all hints of Valentine's Day vanish, Presidents
Day is upon us. Meaning, the kids will be getting an extra dose of
George Washington and Abraham Lincoln stories in history class.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate this holiday in culinary terms means to see what
kinds of delightful noshes can be made with cherries. (It WAS a
young George Washington who couldn't lie about chopping down that
cherry tree, wasn't it?)
</P>
<P>
   Here are some charming cherry recipes for the whole family.

 &HT;    `Chocolate Soul' expands on sweet series
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No more digging through the import sections at record
stores, flipping from college station to college station and
catching an occasional Chocolate Soul when you can.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, continue to do those things, if you have. But if
you haven't, Will G. has done some of that pleasurable work for
you.
</P>
<P>
   The creator of what started as a theme for Thursday nights at
downtown Atlanta's Yin Yang Cafe and became a sporadic concert
series with always-worthwhile acts has compiled a strong album
under the locally popular ``Chocolate Soul'' banner.
</P>
<P>
   It starts overseas with London acid jazz band D-Influence easing
through the airy and somewhat lightweight ``Life.'' Two tracks
later, we're back home, and Atlanta's Seek lays more solid musical
footing on ``Ever After.'' Then fellow residents Edith's Wish stomp
all over that footing in the achy, stand-out rocker
``Mockingbird.''
</P>
<P>
   Next stop, Japan, where Satashi Tomiie catches another breezy
jazz feel until the wind delightfully changes into drum and bass at
the bridge of ``Heaven.'' Local oft-noted singer/songwriter Jeffery
Butts offers more of a change in time than place on the early '70s
Sly Stone-inspired ``Amazing,'' which is what Atlanta hip-hop act
Mass Influence is, lyrically anyway, on the lithe ``Rhyme
Placement'' that follows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chocolate Soul's'' final destination is the mind-set of those
who think R&AMP;B is as limited as commercial radio programming and
many major record label offerings. Feel a little silly now?

 &HT;    Morphine explores dark corners of `The Night'
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On July 3, 1999, Morphine's 46-year-old bassist/vocalist Mark
Sandman suffered a fatal heart attack on a stage near Rome. ``The
Night'' was delivered to the record company before the trio hit the
road in Europe. Unlike so many posthumous releases, this one has
been released just as Sandman intended. It finds the Boston-based
band growing and stretching, while maintaining its distinctive
sound. It's a shame that it stops here.
</P>
<P>
   Morphine sounds sexy. The music is steamy and sensual, not
salacious, but with a hint of danger in the guttural saxophones and
Sandman's sinewy bass lines. The saxophone is such a misused and
abused instrument in a rock context that its appearance is often
the listener's cue to take a powder. Without it, there could be no
Morphine, though. Dana Colley's shaded, sultry and utterly integral
baritone sax playing, as much as Sandman's raspy voice and
two-string slide bass, makes the band sound like nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   Dark and occasionally forbidding, this is a perfectly titled
album. When it doesn't bring to mind the pleasures of the flesh, it
conjures the monsters that lurk beneath the bed or behind a
creaking closet door. Sometimes, as on the title track or the
twisted swirl of ``A Good Woman Is Hard to Find,'' the two
co-exist. This, sadly, is the last shot of Morphine we'll get, but
it's potent stuff.

   &QR;  ``Brokedown Palace'' (PG-13) _ A by-the-numbers prison drama.
Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale sweat it out in a Thai
maximum-security pit after being duped into dope smuggling.
Unbearably high-minded, the movie doesn't even have the B-movie
juice of an old babes-behind-bars melodrama. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Joe the King'' (R) _ With this ``400 Blows'' wannabe,
actor-turned-filmmaker Frank Whaley has fashioned a starkly
hopeless memoir about growing up in the '70s with an abusive,
alcoholic father (Val Kilmer). Noah Fleiss is good in the role of a
neglected adolescent. But the movie strikes one note _ a blend of
blighted poignancy and stark injustice _ and stays there. Instead
of being moved, you're numbed. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Lovers on the Bridge'' (Rating) _ In this cult item from
France, Juliette Binoche plays an artist going blind who sets up a
makeshift shelter on the Pont Neuf bridge, already ``home'' to an
alcoholic, mentally unstable street performer (Denis Lavant). The
two cautiously develop a relationship. In one amazing scene, they
steal a speedboat and Binoche skis down the Seine while fireworks
explode. But much of the rest of the movie is mundane and
under-conceived. You sense director Leos Carax's talent and
audacity; you also sense his self-infatuation. Grade: C+

 &HT;    Just beachy: Island locales provide paradise _ or not
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life's a beach. Especially if you're Leonardo DiCaprio. So
perhaps it's all too fitting that his first movie after that one
with the big boat is titled ``The Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on a novel by Alex Garland, it's about a myth-enshrouded
island off Thailand where a hippielike commune strives to create
its own private paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Islands, heavenly or otherwise, have long been a favorite theme
in movies. Maybe that's because not everyone out there can afford a
place at Malibu. Anyway, here are a few ideas for your own Beach
Blanket Bingo film fest. Minus, alas, Annette and Frankie. We'll
have their festival later.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Black Stallion'': A boy (Kelly Reno) and a horse are
stranded on an island paradise. A mystical bond develops between
the two. Gorgeously photographed by Caleb Deschanel.
</P>
<P>
   Would you want to stay there? Absolutely. Especially if you're
more into animals than people.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Blue Lagoon'': A boy (Christopher Atkins) and a girl
(Brooke Shields) are stranded on an island paradise. A
not-so-mystical bond develops between them. The nubile leads
provide the gorgeousness.
</P>
<P>
   Would you want to stay there? Probably, especially if you're
more into buff, inarticulate teens than people.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Swiss Family Robinson'': A family is shipwrecked, and they
build the coolest treehouse this side of Johnny Weissmuller and
Maureen O'Sullivan in the Tarzan movies.
</P>
<P>
   Would you want to stay there? A functional family who can fight
off pirates and still get along? Sounds like paradise to me.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Mysterious Island'': Some Union soldiers escape a
Confederate prison camp in a hot-air balloon and crash-land on an
island where the animals are Kong-sized. Effects by the master, Ray
Harryhausen; the score is by Bernard Herrmann.
</P>
<P>
   Would you want to stay there? Depends on how you feel about
fending off giant crabs and overgrown chickens on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Papillon'': Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman star as
criminals incarcerated on France's infamous Devil's Island.
</P>
<P>
   Would you want to stay there? They didn't. The whole movie is
about their various escape attempts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Crusoe'': Aiden Quinn plays literature's most famous
castaway, Robinson Crusoe. Ade Sapara is a very unservantlike Man
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Would you want to stay there? A tossup. The company's fine, but
do you want to camp out for the rest of your life?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Father Goose'': Island recluse Cary Grant shelters Leslie
Caron and some schoolgirls during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Would you want to stay there? Wouldn't you want to stay anywhere
with Cary Grant?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Six Days, Seven Nights'': A storm forces pilot Harrison Ford
and passenger Anne Heche to land on an isolated island, where they
try to survive drug-dealing pirates and each other.
</P>
<P>
   Would you want to stay there? Sort of the Cary Grant principal,
depending on whether you're attracted to Ford or Heche or both.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``No Man Is an Island'': During World War II, GI Jeffrey
Hunter manages to hide from the Japanese for three years on Guam,
thanks to the help of some loyal and courageous natives.
</P>
<P>
   Would you want to stay there? Sure, if the Japanese would just
go home.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Lord of the Flies'': Some British schoolboys are left on
their own on an uncharted island. Slowly but surely, they descend
from attempted civilization to utter savagery. Make sure to get the
Peter Brook 1963 version, not the remake.
</P>
<P>
   Would you want to stay there? Only if you had an automatic
weapon and a waiting helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Island of Lost Souls'': Charles Laughton is a mad doctor
performing unspeakable experiments in the name of progress. Later
remade with Burt Lancaster in 1977 and Marlon Brando in 1996 as
``The Island of Dr. Moreau.'' The 1933 Laughton version is by far
the best; it still gives you chills almost 70 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Bela Lugosi as one of the so-called ``manimals.''
</P>
<P>
   Would you want to stay there? Not even with an automatic weapon
and a waiting helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Exit From Eden'': You, too, can go to an S&AMP;M fantasy camp
with Rosie O'Donnell and Dan Aykroyd.
</P>
<P>
   Would you want to stay there? Are you kidding?

 &HT;    Inspiration in Hollywood can be a funny business
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Muse'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   In his perversely amusing comedy, writer-director-star Albert
Brooks plays Steven Phillips, a longtime screenwriter who, as
everyone keeps telling him, has suddenly ``lost his edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Steven's old friend and fellow scribe, Jack (Jeff
Bridges exuding Hollywood insider self-confidence), has a tip. He
introduces Steven to Sarah (Sharon Stone), a genuine
honest-to-the-gods Muse. As in, one of the nine daughters of Zeus.
Before you can say Mighty Aphrodite, Sarah has taken over Steven's
life and his bank account.
</P>
<P>
   As she explains to him, her job is to inspire. And in Hollywood,
inspiration doesn't come cheap. (There's a constant stream of
trinkets in little Tiffany's boxes, proffered by such grateful
clients as Rob Reiner, Martin Scorsese, Wolfgang Puck and James
Cameron.)
</P>
<P>
   As is so often true with Brooks' films, his framework is funnier
than his follow-through. Once Steven meets his Muse, the movie
loses a little of its edge. It becomes a broader satire, of
everything from marriage to writer's block. But there's a cheerful,
kind-spirited lunacy throughout the movie. And sometimes it's
downright hilarious. Especially when Brooks is satirizing his home
turf. When Steven's little daughter asks if she can star in one of
Daddy's movies, he replies, ``Of course, honey. As soon as you're
an older man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Muse'' is a lot like Brooks' sense of humor _subtle,
self-deprecating, off-the-wall clever.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+

   Mice that are predestined to get Huntington's disease stay
healthier for longer when they live in a varied environment with
plenty of opportunities for exercise, climbing and exploring,
neuroscientists at Oxford University have discovered. The finding
is surprising since, in people, Huntington's is strongly genetic,
and experts had thought it unlikely to be significantly affected by
environmental factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't expect this dramatic delay,'' says Tony Hannan, who
ran the study with Anton van Dellen and Colin Blakemore. Reporting
the findings at the Australian Neuroscience Society meeting in
Melbourne last week, Hannan said they had expected an enriched
environment to hasten the onset of the symptoms, rather than
delaying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's enormous. It's the first evidence that by manipulating
the environment you can delay the onset _ and possibly the severity
_ of the disease,'' says Richard Faull, an expert in HD at the
University of Auckland.
</P>
<P>
   But the effects may be less dramatic in people, because ``an
enriched mouse is more like a normal human,'' Hannan warns.
</P>
<P>
   In people with HD, brain cells die, causing them to lose control
of their movements and leading to severe cognitive and behavioral
deterioration. Mice genetically engineered to have part of the gene
that causes Huntington's get many of these symptoms. These include
a motor impairment that prevents them turning while walking on a
horizontal pole.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the engineered mice in Hannan's study were 18 weeks
old, they all fell off the pole. But when the researchers put boxes
and tunnels in the cages of similar engineered mice, and changed
the box and tunnel configuration every two days, only 15 percent of
them failed the test at the same age. They also performed better in
another test for Huntington's symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The enriched mice also showed changes in a brain region called
the striatum, which helps to coordinate movement. More of their
striatal cells contained a protein called calbindin, which is known
to protect neurons from damage.

MAROON CARROT IS NO AGGIE JOKE
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To Texas A&AMP;M fans, it's the Aggie carrot. To the produce
marketing world, it's the Beta-Sweet. Either name will work _ as
will maroon carrots.
</P>
<P>
   Developed at Texas A&AMP;M University by Leonard Pike (the father of
Texas' 1015 onion), the Beta-Sweet carrot is a cross between a
nonedible purple carrot from Brazil and our standard orange carrot.
(Back in the mists of vegetable time, carrots were purple or white;
they were bred to today's hue by the Dutch.)
</P>
<P>
   So excited were the Aggies by their beloved maroon in vegetable
form, the publicity created demand that exceeded supply when the
carrots were introduced two years ago. Now there are two operations
in Texas' Rio Grande Valley licensed to grow the carrots, and
another grower is operating in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the carrots are widely available in grocery stores,
it's time to get acquainted with their eating qualities. They're
quite sweet, these purple guys, and good for eating out of hand.
They're also nice marinated and grilled or roasted. Don't saute
them, because they turn an unpleasant brown. As for those Longhorns
who might hesitate to support their rivals, they should keep in
mind that these carrots are far higher than ordinary carrots in
alpha and beta carotene, important preventatives for cancer, heart
disease and eye degeneration.

&HT;     NEW YORK CONTRIBUTES TO EXPANSION OF COMPUTER CHIP FACILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JAMES M. ODATO  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York is taking another step toward offering
the world's most advanced computer research and development labs,
officials said in announcing a $15 million grant for a cutting-edge
plant here to make prototypes of the next generation of computer
chips.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratories will be part of a new wing of the Center for
Environmental Sciences and Technology Management building in Albany
that technology companies and the state helped build. New York
previously donated $10 million toward the facility's construction
and is providing $1 million annually in operating funds.
</P>
<P>
   The new wing would provide highly expensive ``clean room''
fabricating space, a business incubator and facilities for work
force training.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the center would open many more opportunities
for partnerships with businesses in an industry expecting to need
40 new fabrication plants and thousands of workers to build the
next phase of computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   The center is already one of just a handful of labs worldwide
focused on semiconductor chip research, officials said, and it is
attracting bright students, research dollars and private
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope it will be the key to marketing this part of
upstate New York as a serious player in the emerging field of
computer chip development and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, planners say, the facility would help drive the
region's economy in this century, perhaps luring one of the new, $4
billion chip-fabricating plants envisioned to employ a few thousand
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the only research and development facility
of its kind in the world, no hyperbole, no exaggeration,'' Alain
Kaloyeros, the director of the center, said Tuesday. ``That's going
to send a statement to the entire universe that New York is
investing in state of the art infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno and
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver appeared together at the center
Tuesday to pledge $15 million in aid from a state economic
development account that the three leaders control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will make New York a leader in semiconductor chip R&AMP;D,''
said Pataki, a Republican, adding that he envisions spinoffs that
would allow this region to become another Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The new state money will be used to attract private investment
for the construction of a large manufacturing wing to make 300mm
wafers _ prototypes of the next generation of computer chips. They
would replace the 200mm wafers now used to carry the microchips
that make computers work.
</P>
<P>
   A goal of the investment is to lure computer-chip manufacturers
and associated industries to the region. Industry representatives
attending the announcement of the grant said the state is heading
in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited about having advanced R&AMP;D right here in the
Capital District, particularly close to our IBM locations is a big
plus,'' said John Kelly of IBM in Fishkill. ``This is a big
positive for our industry as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed wing will cost $55 million, Kaloyeros said. Another
$250 million in tools and systems will be needed to outfit the
facility, which is part of the Center for Advanced Technology at
the State University of New York at Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that this facility is going to be a magnet,''
said Kaloyeros, adding that it will attract private dollars and
allow the center to become a $1 billion, one-stop shop for chip
research. He said SUNY-Albany and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
will be applying for funding for a microelectronics venture under
the new state program to develop high-tech capabilities, called
Jobs 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturing space would be used by companies such as IBM,
Motorola and Intel, offering them testing and trouble-shooting
equipment. The business incubation space would be used for smaller
high-tech companies that do not require daily use of clean-room
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The work force training center would consist of a 100-seat
classroom linked electronically to schools such as community
colleges. The program will provide short-course training on
advanced semiconductor manufacturing practices, followed by
hands-on, on-site training.

A TOAST TO EAST GERMAN, COLORADO DARK ALES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN MELTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quick _ name some ebony-colored ales that are neither porter,
dunkel or stout, yet refresh like exceptional lagers.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, I might've been stumped, too. But in my constant
quest to find new beverages to review so I may earn my monthly
stipend, I've come across two relatively new brews that fit the
bill: Colorado-made 1554 Brussels Style Black Ale and Germany's
Kostritzer Schwartzbier.
</P>
<P>
   The 1554 comes from our friends at New Belgium Brewery in Fort
Collins as part of their ``Special Release Beer Program.'' This
delightful, innovative brewery is responsible for the delicious Fat
Tire Ale and Abbey Ale, both previously (and positively) reviewed
in these pages. The idea behind ``Special Release'' is a kind of
test-marketing exercise, in which they fix up a limited batch of
something fun and see how it sells. Their Blue Paddle Pilsener was
just such a beer, and now it's part of their permanent product line
... as 1554 should be. Toasty, malty, full-bodied and easy on the
finish, 1554 is one of the more imaginative beers I've sampled in
ages.
</P>
<P>
   New Belgium claims to have discovered references to historical
Brussels black beers while attending a Belgian brewing conference.
Noting that the oldest mention of such mysterious brews was 1554,
their marketing wizards hit upon the next special-release name. As
their Web site says, ``In the profile of 1554 Brussels Style Black
Ale, our staff hoped to create an ale that it would be easy to
imagine as a beer served 445 years ago, but also a beer that
doesn't ignore 445 years of brewing advancements.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's coincidental, but the recent marketing push of
Kostritzer Schwartzbier (black beer) emphasizes the brewery's
equally ancient (1543) founding in Thuringen, Germany. After being
stuck behind the Iron Curtain these past few decades, Kostritzer is
making up for lost time with an aggressive sales effort that
deserves to be richly rewarded, because it's a wonderful brew:
toasty, malty and beautiful, with an elegant finish.
</P>
<P>
   The brewery's Web site calls Kostritzer ``Das Haus der Magischen
Biere,'' which, if my high school German still works, means ``The
House of Magical Beer.'' The rest of the site is in German, full of
scary words such as ``erfolges'' and ``farbebilden'' and
``andrang,'' none of which I understand, all of which I'm too lazy
to look up and don't think I want to know, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   My lack of intellectual questing aside, I comparison-tasted both
brews and came up even. Too close to call. Both beers have notable
merits and little downside. Add to it that they're readily
available at all finer booze stores, and I'd call that a win-win
scenario.
</P>

 &HT;    HIGH-TECH GORE IS A FUND-RAISING FLOP IN SILICON VALLEY
 &HT;    Eds: Corrects Bush figures in grafs 3 and 4.
 &HT;    380&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ His supporters say he would be ``the E-president,''
but in the latest lap of the race for Silicon Valley's campaign
contributions, Al Gore ran dead last.
</P>
<P>
   A computer analysis of Federal Election Commission records shows
that in the last quarter of 1999, Bill Bradley led his Democratic
opponent in that high-tech battleground, and the Republican
presidential candidates as well.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator raised $108,225 from the Silicon
Valley's 25 cities, while Gov. George W. Bush of Texas collected
$47,280 and Sen. John McCain of Arizona raised $42,906. Gore, who
brags about his role in developing the Internet, trailed with
$35,415.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1999, Bradley also came in first. He raised $617,475,
compared to $573,548 for Bush and $302,095 for Gore. McCain's
records for the first quarter were not available by computer, but
he had raised only $84,696 since April.
</P>
<P>
   At Gore's national headquarters in Nashville, his staff denied
that the gap may reflect a problem in Gore's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects Bradley's emphasis on raising money and spending
on TV advertisements,'' said Doug Hattaway, Gore's spokesman.
``We've obviously been raising money,'' but Gore has concentrated
on meeting voters and pressing the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley has always been a big campaign fund raiser and a big
spender,'' added Hattaway. ``So it's not surprising that he has
raised so much money in this campaign and in Silicon Valley. He
outspent us in New Hampshire by quite a bit and we presume he'll
continue doing the same in the primaries to come, including
California.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is a sitting vice president,'' responded Judie Wong,
Bradley's California press secretary, ``and he's been doing his
share of fund raising as well. I think that Bill Bradley is very
appealing to people in the Silicon Valley because they believe he
is the strongest candidate on the issues that are of concern to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   She said what Silicon Valley people like most about Bradley's is
his ``understanding of the interactions between the private sector
and public sector in growing our economy'' and his ``blueprint for
education.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The analysis of Silicon Valley contributions shows that the
fund-raising gap between the two Democrats contenders has widened
over time. During the first three months of 1999, Gore was ahead.
He fell behind during the second quarter, but by year's end Bradley
was raising three times as much money.
</P>
<P>
   That resembles the picture nationwide, where Gore leapt to an
early lead, only to see Bradley close the gap by raising twice as
much money in the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The occupations of last fall's donors suggest that Bradley, who
taught at Stanford University between 1997 and 1998, is more
attractive to high-tech donors. Half of Gore's Silicon Valley
donors who declared their occupation were retirees or homemakers,
and only 3 percent were CEOs or company presidents. For Bradley, 9
percent of donors were CEOs and only 29 percent were not in the
labor force.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one contributor suggested that people in the
Silicon Valley look beyond bits and bytes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All candidates have been very careful to express policy that
are desired by people here in the valley,'' said Thomas Heller, a
professor at the Stanford University Institute for International
Studies who contributed $500 to Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``My choice has more to do with his expertise in foreign policy
and my sense that he would make an excellent president because of
his ability to manage complex staff,'' Heller said of Bradley.

   Mice that are predestined to get Huntington's disease stay
healthier for longer when they live in a varied environment with
plenty of opportunities for exercise, climbing and exploring,
neuroscientists at Oxford University have discovered. The finding
is surprising since, in people, Huntington's is strongly genetic,
and experts had thought it unlikely to be significantly affected by
environmental factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't expect this dramatic delay,'' says Tony Hannan, who
ran the study with Anton van Dellen and Colin Blakemore. Reporting
the findings at the Australian Neuroscience Society meeting in
Melbourne last week, Hannan said they had expected an enriched
environment to hasten the onset of the symptoms, rather than
delaying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's enormous. It's the first evidence that by manipulating
the environment you can delay the onset _ and possibly the severity
_ of the disease,'' says Richard Faull, an expert in HD at the
University of Auckland.
</P>
<P>
   But the effects may be less dramatic in people, because ``an
enriched mouse is more like a normal human,'' Hannan warns.
</P>
<P>
   In people with HD, brain cells die, causing them to lose control
of their movements and leading to severe cognitive and behavioral
deterioration. Mice genetically engineered to have part of the gene
that causes Huntington's get many of these symptoms. These include
a motor impairment that prevents them turning while walking on a
horizontal pole.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the engineered mice in Hannan's study were 18 weeks
old, they all fell off the pole. But when the researchers put boxes
and tunnels in the cages of similar engineered mice, and changed
the box and tunnel configuration every two days, only 15 percent of
them failed the test at the same age. They also performed better in
another test for Huntington's symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The enriched mice also showed changes in a brain region called
the striatum, which helps to coordinate movement. More of their
striatal cells contained a protein called calbindin, which is known
to protect neurons from damage.

Movie, ad put two long-dead musicians in the spotlight 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They say that everything old is new again _ and what's new/old
right now (besides, of course, Madonna's cover of ``American Pie)''
is a little-known English folk singer and the first European jazz
star, dead 26 and 46 years, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Nick Drake and Django Reinhardt, two men who have
little in common despite fierce loyalty from die-hard fans and a
sudden, unexpected status as at least strong blips on the
pop-culture radar.
</P>
<P>
   Drake's sweet ``Pink Moon'' is featured in a current Volkswagen
commercial; you know, the one where the carload of friends pulls up
to the party, they look at one another, and then the car goes
riding over a night-shrouded road. ``Pink pink pink pink _ pink
moon,'' his soft voice sings over an easy guitar strum.
</P>
<P>
   And Reinhardt (his music and the story of his life) is the
linchpin for Woody Allen's latest film, ``Sweet and Lowdown,'' the
story of fictional '30s jazz guitarist/scoundrel Emmett Ray (Sean
Penn), who both plays like and is obsessed with the Belgian
musician.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt is invoked constantly _ and is briefly ``seen'' _ in
the film, and his music and style of guitar playing are featured
prominently on the excellent soundtrack. Penn's Ray is so awed by
Reinhardt that, tricked into believing that Reinhardt is in the
front row of a show Ray is about to play, he simply skips out on
the gig, too scared to perform in front of his idol.
</P>
<P>
   Drake and Reinhardt could not be more different in musical style
or popularity: The former cut only three brief albums of lovely,
haunting folk music before falling into a severe, debilitating
depression. He played few shows (none in the United States), and
died of an overdose of anti-depressants in November 1974. His death
was ruled a suicide, although friends and family believe it was an
accidental overdose.
</P>
<P>
   None of Drake's three LPs sold well, but since then, he has been
elevated to icon status, his name invoked by R.E.M., Tom Verlaine,
Kate Bush and Lucinda Williams _ all noting how affected they were
by his fragile, sweetly sad songs.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt, on the other hand, is often cited as one of the
greatest jazz guitarists of all time. A Gypsy, he grew up playing
banjo, but his fretting hand was permanently disfigured in a fire
when he was 18, leaving him without the use of two fingers. He
switched to guitar and developed his own playing technique.
</P>
<P>
   A stunning soloist with amazing speed and taste, he is best
known for his work with violinist Stephane Grappelli; the two led
the Hot Club of France, the first important European jazz band. The
group cut dozens of records and became European superstars;
Reinhardt recorded with American jazz stars such as Coleman
Hawkins, played in France during the German occupation, toured the
United States with Duke Ellington in 1946, and died of a stroke in
France in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Several of his songs, such as ``Love's Melody'' and
``Djangology,'' have been frequently covered. Reinhardt was a huge
influence on numerous guitarists, from jazzers to the Allman
Brothers' Dickey Betts.
</P>
<P>
   And both men evoke a time gone by. Drake's downcast, evocative
folk was part and parcel of the post-Dylan folk boom that included
bands such as Fairport Convention and solo artists such as John
Martyn. The melancholia and sense of isolation in his music speak
to the end of the '60s and the beginning of the '70s, when the
dreams of Woodstock faded into harsher realities, harder drugs and
harder choices.
</P>
<P>
   Drake chose to simply withdraw into himself; when he died, he
was living with his parents in the tiny town of Tanworth-in-Arden.
In that context, his songs _ especially his final LP, 1972's ``Pink
Moon'' _ sound like a life slowly turning autumnal and blowing away
like leaves on a quiet country lane.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt's music is the polar opposite: Whether playing
original tunes or standards such as ``St. Louis Blues'' and Duke
Ellington's ``Solitude,'' he swings like mad, his solos ringing
with fire and intelligence. His music still evokes scenes of
well-dressed men and women dancing the night away in swank
nightclubs in a better time and place.
</P>
<P>
   But at least both share this: Their legacies have been
well-preserved _ Drake's years ago, and Reinhardt's just recently
on a monumental boxed set.
</P>
<P>
   The 1986 ``Fruit Tree'' box (reissued on CD by Rykodisc) is
literally everything Drake recorded: All three of his studio albums
and ``Time of No Reply,'' a 14-cut CD that ends with four songs
from his final recording session in February 1974. Much of the
material from that last session is as beautiful as anything he
released in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt's music has been released and re-released on numerous
LPs and CDs. But in November, Mosaic Records dropped the mother
lode: ``The Complete Django Reinhardt and Quintet of the Hot Club
of France Swing/HMV Sessions 1936-1948.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-CD set collects all of Reinhardt's important recordings;
literally everything you need to know is here, from his landmark
1930s sessions with his band to duets with Grappelli to songs cut
with a big band and strings, to songs in which he backs vocalist
Josette Dayde. ``Nuages, Swing Guitars, Stockholm, Limehouse
Blues'' _ it's all here, beautifully packaged and with, most often,
excellent sound.
</P>
<P>
   A must-have for any jazz fan, the box is available by mail order
or by phone, and you'll need to act fast: Only 7,500 copies will be
printed.

U.S. ASKS JAPAN TO CONSIDER MAINTAINING SUPPORT FOR U.S. MILITARY
OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CALVIN SIMS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In high-level security talks that concluded here
Wednesday, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott called on the
Japanese government to reconsider a proposal to reduce its
financial support for American troops stationed in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day talks follow a move by Japanese officials last month
to cut support payments to the United States to cover the costs
incurred by American military forces in Japan, including labor,
utilities, facilities, maintenance and training.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese financial support for American military operations
began in 1978, when the U.S. economy was foundering and Japan's
cost of living had skyrocketed. The Japanese government, which paid
about $2.5 billion to support the American military last year, is
now seeking to reduce those payments because it has fallen upon
hard economic times.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott, who led an American delegation including Defense
Undersecretary Walter Slocombe, asked Japan's foreign minister,
Yohei Kono, to generate public support for continuing the host
nation assistance for the U.S. military, said Japanese foreign
affairs officials familiar with the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I discussed with foreign Minister Kono, Japan and the
United States bring different contributions to our security
alliance,'' Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bases and host nation support that Japan provides are a
critical contribution to the alliance,'' he said. ``Host nation
support is not just another line item in the budget, it is a
critical aspect of our alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese foreign officials said that there was no immediate
response from Kono but that the government's position was that the
military support payments, while important to Japan's security, are
a heavy burden, especially during this time of fiscal difficulty.
The agreement under which Japan provides support to the U.S.
military is scheduled to expire in March 2001 and is currently
being renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Germany and South Korea also make support payments to the United
States to cover the costs of American military operations in those
countries, but those payments are small compared with Japan's.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 45,000 U.S. military personnel in Japan,
including 19,000 marines in Okinawa and 13,700 air force staff.
American military officials have said that the importance of the
military bases in Japan has increased in the last decade with the
closing of bases in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the bases in Japan were especially vital for
responding to security threats from China, North Korea, or Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Slocombe, who is defense undersecretary for policy, Wednesday
called on Japan and the United States to continue cooperating on a
planned theater missile defense system to guard against the threat
posed by North Korea's missile program.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with the Japanese Defense Agency chief, Tsutomu
Kawara, Slocombe said that the United States and Japan needed to
consider ``a military approach'' in dealing with North Korea,
Japanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, North Korea fired a short-range ballistic missile over
the Japanese mainland and into the Pacific Ocean, raising concerns
across Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, North Korea threatened to test launch a more advanced
missile with a longer range and greater accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to those threats, the United States and Japan signed
an agreement to conduct joint research on a missile defense system,
which is estimated to cost as much as $521 million in the initial
phase that would be split equally by both countries.
</P>
<P>
   The theater missile defense system is intended to protect the
United States and its allies from incoming ballistic missiles
flying within about 1,800 miles' radius by detecting them with
satellites and shooting them down with missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a recent agreement by North Korea to suspend its missile
development program in exchange for the United States' lifting
economic sanctions, Slocombe expressed concern that the Stalinist
country still poses a security risk to the region, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related issue, Talbott told Japanese officials Wednesday
that the United States wanted the government to shut down an
industrial-waste incinerator that is polluting an American naval
air base in Atsugi, just west of Tokyo, U.S. embassy officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   A survey conducted by the U.S. and Japanese governments found
high levels of dioxin in the air at the navy base, which is located
350 meters from the incinerating complex, which is operated by a
private company.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese foreign ministry officials said the government has
spent $12 million to reduce the plant's emissions and is currently
pressuring the incinerator's operator to install filtering
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy officials here said the American delegation also
discussed issues related to Russia, Southeast Asia, Indonesia,
Japan's global role, and preparations for the economic summit
meeting of major industrialized nations that is scheduled to take
place in Okinawa in July.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation left for Beijing Wednesday evening where it is
expected to discuss the anti-missile shield, which China and Russia
have opposed because they cannot afford to a develop program and
they fear the system will give the United States and its allies a
strategic advantage if it works.

 &HT;    SOUTHEAST'S SCHOOLS LEAD IN LINKING TO INTERNET
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Southeast leads the nation in connecting public
schools to the Internet, the U.S. Department of Education reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the West leads in success in installing high-speed
connections and the Central states lead in the race to bring
Internet service into every classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the percentage of schools connected to the Internet
stepped up each year, from 35 percent in 1994 to 95 percent in the
fall of 1999, according to the report on annual surveys of about
1,000 public schools by the National Center for Education
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The regional leader in the latest survey is the Southeast, with
98 percent of its schools connected. Five years previously, with
only 29 percent connected, the Southeast (defined broadly by the
survey-takers as states stretching from Texas to Maryland) had been
in last place.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1999 survey, connections had reached 95 percent of
schools in the West, 94 percent in the Northeast and 93 percent in
the Central region.
</P>
<P>
   As late as 1996, three-fourths of the schools linked to the
Internet had telephone dial-up connections like those used by most
computers in homes. By 1999, only 14 percent still used dial-up
modems. The rest had direct lines, ISDN, wireless, cable or other
faster systems that accommodate more students.
</P>
<P>
   Regionally, the slower dial-up connections still accounted for
16 percent of the school connections in the Southeast and the
Northeast, followed by the Central (14) and West (9) regions.
</P>
<P>
   Classroom connections are the next frontier. Only 3 percent of
public-school classrooms had Internet access in 1994. That has
reached 63 percent nationally. The leading area is the Central
region, with 70 percent of its classrooms wired, followed by the
West (68), Southeast (60) and Northeast (56).
</P>
<P>
   Because so many schools have Internet access, urban and suburban
high schools with few poor children are no longer more likely than
other schools to be connected to the Web. But they still have the
edge in obtaining high-speed connections and in wiring all their
classrooms.

Schools and Classrooms: 1994-99,'' go to

nonabrasive, and supposedly will take out such stubborn stains as
grease, oil, shoe polish, blood, chocolate, lipstick, tomato sauce
and wine. However, it will not remove permanent dyes and inks.

   Q: I am trying to find a fragrance by Cartier called So Pretty.
My sister gave it to me for Christmas and I can't find it anymore.

   Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Like the song says, ``I feel pretty, oh so pretty.'' You will
too, when you dab on So Pretty De Cartier, which debuted in the
jewelry-and-leather goods store in 1995. This fruity floral is a
combination of mandarin, neroli and dewberry with middle notes of
iris, rose and orchid, and bottom notes of sandalwood and musk. A
3.3-ounce eau de toilette spray is $85; a 1.6-ounce parfum is $70
at Cartier in Lenox Square, 3393 Peachtree Road N.E.
(404-841-0847).

<P>
   Q: I am interested in finding Paul Newman's Italian dressing. It
used to be everywhere. But now I can't find it anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sheryl Holland, Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your salads will soon have that Newman touch again. The
actor's Newman's Own Family Recipe Italian dressing can be found at
Harris Teeter, 3954 Peachtree Road N.E. (404-814-5990). A 16-ounce
bottle is $3.19. A drawing of the actor, who is depicted wearing a
striped T-shirt and straw sailor hat with red ribbon, adorns the
bottle. Incidentally, Newman, after taxes, donates all his profits
from the sale of the dressing for educational and charitable
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Tofutti. It's an ice cream product made
without milk but with tofu. I have children who are lactose
intolerant, and I would like to find this product for them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shannon Mandley, Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Everyone should be able to enjoy ice cream. We found Tofutti,
a nondairy Premium Frozen Dessert (1 pint, $2.99) at Kroger in
Brookhaven, 3871 Peachtree Road S.E. (404-240-0808). It's available
in a variety of flavors including vanilla and vanilla fudge,
chocolate and ``better'' pecan.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We own a two-story wooden cabin in North Georgia. I would
like to have a rope ladder that could be used from a second-story
window in an emergency. I have asked in hardware and mega-type
stores, so far without success. Thank you in advance for your help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cindy Runyon, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a good idea for all two-story households. Although
it's not rope, we did find a First Alert Steel Fire Escape Ladder
(15 foot model is $39.97) at Lowe's, 4855 U.S. 78, Lilburn
(770-978-9724). The fully assembled, ready-to-use ladder has
slip-resistant rungs, six pairs of steel rung stabilizers and large
hooks that secure easily to windowsills for maximum stability. The
manufacturer, BRK Brands, warns that its fire escape ladder is
intended to be used only as an alternate escape means in a fire
emergency. It is not intended to be the main exit for escape in an
emergency. Look on the company's Web site, www.firstalert.com

&HT;     HIP-HOP PROFESSOR TAKES A NEW LOOK AT MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VENISE WAGNER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Caution: The following contains material that
may offend readers partial to the sacrosanct portrayals of the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. Reader discretion is advised.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Eric Dyson, social critic, self-described hip-hop
scholar and DePaul University professor, doesn't apologize either.
This 41-year-old Baptist minister is not one to censor himself at
the expense of revealing truths.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest and most controversial book, ``I May Not Get There
With You'' (The Free Press, $25), Dyson crushes the rose-colored
lenses through which the civil-rights martyr has been viewed since
his assassination three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   His aim is not to besmirch King, he says, but rather to make the
civil rights leader relevant to a new generation that views the
'60s protests, ``I Have a Dream'' declarations and refrains of ``We
Shall Overcome'' as relics of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tired of people saying, `If Martin Luther King was here,
he'd be sick of hip-hop culture,''' says Dyson, a Detroit native
who sprang from poverty to become a Princeton Ph.D. graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson has experienced the same urban realities and resistance
that resonate in the rap music of the late Tupac Shakur and the
Notorious B.I.G., aka Biggie Smalls.
</P>
<P>
   The King that the hip-hop generation knows, Dyson says, has been
frozen in time, sanitized and beatified to assuage white
integrationists who fear the calls of black nationalism, the social
conservatives who learned to appropriate King's words for their own
purposes, and the older black establishment that wants to protect
its slain leader's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the tradition of jazz saxophonists John Coltrane and Charlie
Parker, Dyson riffs with speed, eloquence, bawdy humor and
startling truths. He visited the San Francisco Bay area earlier
this week to promote his message and book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't no getting around it _ he ain't got to be perfect in
order to be great,'' Dyson said of the civil rights icon. ``My
point wasn't to bring King down, it was to lift them (those in the
hip-hop generation) up. My point is get real, be honest.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Dyson breaks it down: Martin Luther King Jr. womanized,
plagiarized and prophesied.
</P>
<P>
   He got it right when he predicted the rebellious rage of blacks
who tired of inequality, Dyson said. But he added that King got it
wrong when he thwarted the rise of women to leadership in his
circle. His own sexism squelched his wife Coretta's ambition to
participate in the movement.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King Jr. was a radical, Dyson said, recalling that
he opposed the Vietnam War, embraced democratic socialism, gave
most of his earnings to the civil rights cause and called for a
form of reparations for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson recalled that King also told lewd jokes, talked trash,
pursued sex recklessly and suffered depression.
</P>
<P>
   He sometimes lost faith but always inspired hope, Dyson said.
King concluded that many whites were unconscious racists. Yet he
never stopped trying to illuminate their biases and help them
transcend.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said Dyson, was not unlike
Shakur.
</P>
<P>
   In the minds of some, this is the equivalent of comparing Jesus
with Gabriel, the risen with the fallen.
</P>
<P>
   But Dyson explained, ``I wanted to suggest to
(hip-hop-generation members) that they have much more in common
with King than they realize, that Martin Luther King Jr. was much
more relevant, much more funky, much more insightful and much more
gritty than the smoothed-out iconic textures that have been
delivered to us by most media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both (Shakur and King) were obsessed with their own deaths.
Both used older rhetorical sources (Shakur sampled music, King
borrowed prose) and gave them fresh meaning. Both had distressingly
similar viewpoints about women. Both struggled against forms of
evil, like police brutality, racial inequality and economic
inequality.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyson's critics cringe at these comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights veteran Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., told the Washington
Post: ``I think a lot of what Dyson is doing is just a fad. I think
he does this to get attention. I think it's a disgrace. It's
shameful for him to put Dr. King on that level.``
</P>
<P>
   But others say Dyson is employing the rappers' trade of sampling
material, taking old stories and giving them a fresh sound, a new
look.

CONTROVERSIAL ISRAELI DECREE EXTENDS DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Daring to single-handedly alter a calendar that is
as politically sensitive as everything else here, Natan Sharansky,
the interior minister, decreed Wednesday that Israel's ``summer
time'' will be longer this year by 34 days.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where even the issue of daylight savings time is
contentious, it was a provocative decision, playing into a
long-running battle between secular Israelis and some religious
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Daylight savings time _ what Israelis refer to as summer time _
will start earlier in the spring and extend almost a month further
into the fall, Sharansky said. This rescinds a tradition of
accommodating the prayer schedules of some religious Jews leading
up to the High Holidays in September _ a tradition that secular
Israelis have long resented as subordinating the routines of the
majority to the special rituals of a minority.
</P>
<P>
   But religious politicians did not immediately react. They were
too busy confronting Sharansky, a Russian immigrant leader, on
another decision.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Sharansky said the Interior Ministry would
begin recognizing and registering civil marriages performed at
foreign consulates in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Such marriages _ which only some consulates perform _ make it
possible for immigrants here who are not recognized as Jewish to
marry Israelis. Under Israeli law, only religious weddings are
permitted, and what the rabbis see as inter-marriages are
forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky took over the Interior Ministry from Shas, an
ultra-Orthodox Sephardic party, after years of friction between the
Russian immigrants he represents and the Shas bureaucrats who had
the power to grant and deny them citizenship and marriage licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Wresting the Interior Ministry from Shas was part of Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's election platform, and taking control of it
was Sharansky's main plank.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sharansky's dealing with Shas have been strained, his
relations with other religious political groups have been based on
mutual respect. Sharansky is an observant Jew, and many of the
religious politicians believed that he respected them. His
recommendation about the consular marriage took them by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   In defending his decision on changing the daylight-savings
calendar, Sharansky said that ``preservation of life was the
guiding principle'' that pushed him to make the change, even if it
upset religious Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, daylight savings time ended on Sept. 3, and Israel
then moved into ``winter time.'' This meant that during the dog
days of early September, the sun was rising long before the workday
started and setting during rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Technion Institute proved to him, Sharansky said,
that an additional hour of late-afternoon light would lower traffic
accidents by 9 percent, and fatal ones by 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For secular Israelis, the old system generated much grumbling.
But ultra-Orthodox Sephardic Jews, who traditionally recite
penitential prayers at the midpoint between sunset and sunrise,
were able to get more sleep _ starting their prayers at midnight,
say, instead of 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sephardic public, for the most part, works hard and has to
get up early for work,'' said Itzik Suderi, a spokesman for Shas.
``So if the penitential prayers are late, they can end at 3:30 a.m.
and then the people have to get up at 5:30 a.m. What we are asking
for is consideration.''

CLINTON RELEASES $125 MILLION MORE FOR HOME-HEATING OIL
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: New England)   (nk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton ordered the release of another
$125 million in government aid Wednesday to help needy families in
the Northeast pay the soaring costs of heating their homes this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   The release, announced by Clinton at the start of an afternoon
news conference, comes only six days after the government made $130
million in home-heating aid available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have always pulled together in time of need,'' the
president said, referring to the government's recent help for flood
and tornado victims. ``Now, the families of the Northeast need our
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also suggested that states make assistance for
home-heating available to more middle-income people rather than
only to those loosely defined as poor.
</P>
<P>
   While a breakdown of aid amounts for individual states was not
immediately available, there was no doubt whatever that much of the
assistance would go to the Northeast and New England because a
large proportion of homes in those regions have oil heat. Crude-oil
prices have skyrocketed in recent weeks because of production
cutbacks by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people with home-heating oil are the most vulnerable
people in America by a good long ways'' to international economic
trends and upheavals beyond their control, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In the hardest-hit regions, the price of home heating oil has
passed $2 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that, in addition to telling the Department of
Health and Human Services to release the $125 million, he would
urge members of Congress and governors from the affected states to
adjust their guidelines to make more people eligible.
</P>
<P>
   State guidelines vary, but typically a family's income must be
no more than 150 percent of the official poverty level in that
state. For instance, if the official poverty level for a family of
a certain size is an income below $12,000 a year, aid is typically
available to families that make no more than $18,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In the release announced last week, New York state got the most
aid, just over $34.3 million. New Jersey got $7.5 million and
Connecticut just over $3 million. The allocations are based on
formulas that consider the cost of fuel in a given area, the
day-by-day weather in that area and poverty statistics.

 &HT;    NATION'S TOP WASTE-WATCHER CONFRONTS EUPHORIA OF SURPLUSES
 &HT;    570&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ David M. Walker picked up a small wooden cudgel
studded with sharp spikes that he prominently displays in his
office. He has promised not to use it, he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   But as comptroller of the United States, he needs all the potent
symbols he can find.
</P>
<P>
   The former partner and global manager in Atlanta for the
accounting firm Arthur Andersen, Walker is just 15 months into a
huge and increasingly thankless mission.
</P>
<P>
   He heads the 3,275-person General Accounting Office, the
investigating arm of Congress and chief watchdog for exposing waste
and mismanagement throughout the federal government, which Walker
calls ``the largest, most complex, most diverse entity on the face
of the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Although finding waste in government may seem as easy as finding
sand at the beach, Walker has arrived in the capital just as
exposing waste has fallen out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   A deluge of budget surpluses has undercut the urgency for
heeding the approximately 1,500 audits, investigations and
testimonies that GAO churns out each year on everything from how
much the Pentagon pays for screws to the solvency of the Social
Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Walker is scheduled to appear Thursday before the House Budget
Committee amid an attempt by the panel's chairman, Rep. John
Kasich, R-Ohio, and the Republican leadership to revive some of the
lost zeal of the government reform movement.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Walker has prepared a list of what he calls
``immediate targets of opportunity'' in programs that are at
highest risk for waste, fraud and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is far from certain that the comptroller's
suggestions will be enthusiastically embraced by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   When Walker presented a list of 61 potential reforms and program
eliminations to the Senate Budget Committee a few weeks back, the
senators didn't wait to hear him speak before they pounced on the
list and defended their pet projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hearing illustrated the difficulty of making some
changes,'' Walker said philosophically in an interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   An impeccably attired 48-year-old whose wire-rimmed glasses and
orderly office fit the image of the nation's top auditor, he has
the job of digging out the facts and presenting recommendations.
But he pointed out that the lawmakers don't have to accept them.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, we work for 540 politicians, and they must be
accountable to the American people,'' he said during an interview
this week. ``Reasonable people can and do differ.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if his message is finding only a lukewarm reception, Walker
continues to admonish Congress to use the good economic times to
begin ``weeding out programs that have proven to be outdated,'' pay
down the national debt and prepare for the costs as the baby boom
generation begins to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we're rolling in dough today, and we are in pretty
good shape from a budgetary standpoint,'' he said this week. ``But
we know we're going to face re-emerging deficits.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he politely suggested that Congress has fallen down on
the job of monitoring how money is spent. ``There is a recognition
on the Hill that there's a need for more oversight,'' he said,
noting the reason why. ``It's not headline-grabbing work,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And even with budget surpluses, he said, ``We still have a
responsibility to make sure that the taxpayer is getting a good
return on their investment.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Congress, the executive agencies and even the public may not be
listening very closely now. But the role of the comptroller general
is to deliver the bad news anyway, said Paul C. Light, director of
governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington
research center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he's going to feel like a skunk at a picnic and
sometimes he's going to feel more popular, but that's his job,''
Light said. ``And he's got to keep hacking on it and hacking on it
and hacking on it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Light gives high marks to Walker's efforts, especially
for his dialog with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Only the seventh comptroller in the GAO's 77-year history,
Walker has met with most of the lawmakers. Meticulously
non-partisan, Walker has been a conservative Democrat, then a
moderate Republican and now has registered as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   He was the choice of congressional Democrats and Republicans as
well as the White House for the post, which carries a 15-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Government Reform Committee Chairman Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn., said that Walker ``has taken a fresh look at GAO and is
positioning the organization to be able to address the problems
that will affect the way government operates in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of that effort, Walker announced in early February that
modernization would start with the $378 million operations of GAO
itself. He is shutting down five of 16 field offices and shuffling
much of the staff, which is 40 percent below its peak in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the agency a motto for their core values,
``accountability, integrity and reliability,'' a theme that has
earned him the nickname ``AIR Walker'' at his agency. He even had
the motto woven into a rug in front of his desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid for it,'' he added quickly, as he gave a tour around
his spacious digs atop the GAO's building a few blocks from the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   He makes no apologies for the large office. ``I spend 60 hours a
week here,'' said the comptroller, who generally begins firing out
e-mail to his staff soon after 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is that public service is a high calling,'' said
Walker, who has worked for the federal government in various roles
on three previous occasions. And regardless of who's listening, he
said the GAO would continue to dispense reports and assessments
that are ``objective, fact-based, non-partisan, non-ideological,
fair and balanced.''

DELEGATING THE DIRTY WORK OF CLEANING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there a secret grapevine for cleaning companies that spreads
the word about which houses to avoid? Is it possible that the last
cleaning crew who came to my house could have taken photographs and
showed them to the competition?
</P>
<P>
   No, they seemed far too busy _ scraping glitter-flecked glue off
the kitchen table, removing a melted straw from the dishwasher and
using tongs to transport the baby's hidden supply of half-eaten
bologna to the garbage _ to have time to document the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   So why did I find myself unable to get my house cleaned last
month? Was it a coincidence that two companies didn't return my
calls, or that another cleaner quoted $300 for the job, a price
that did not include cleaning supplies or fresh tongs?
</P>
<P>
   Not to sound paranoid, but the lack of response reminded me that
the tree company never sprayed the hemlocks last fall. And the
gutter specialist never came by to measure for new eaves troughs,
situations that in the past might have prompted me to such acts as
_ this only happened once, I swear _ dropping in at a friend's
house with a plate of homemade cookies at a time I suspected his
carpenter would be there.
</P>
<P>
   Since that desperate juncture in my life, I have learned there
is an easier way to hunt down, I mean, hire, local service
providers: over the Internet. You go online to sites like
www.handshake.com or www.imandi.com that match your address with
merchants in their nationwide databases.
</P>
<P>
   (If you live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, you can also try
www.fundu.com, which operates only in that area and plans to change
its name to ServiceLane.com next month.) These companies began
operating in the past year, and a fourth, www.efrenzy.com, is
scheduled to start Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Then you just sit there _ no need to leave whiny, pleading phone
messages about how you hate to be leaving yet another message, but
really, you need that stain on the rug, which might or might not be
food coloring, cleaned before your mother, who gave you the rug,
arrives in town on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site acts as contractor for all kinds of services, and
pretty soon the world comes to you. Bottled water delivery
services. Pet sitters. Airport shuttles. Movers.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded, frankly, too good to be true. To test it, I searched
for housecleaners a few weeks ago on imandi.com, which connects
customers to 180,000 merchants who provide services and products in
300 categories.
</P>
<P>
   After I clicked on ``house cleaning,'' I filled out a form to
describe the job, entering information about things like how much I
wanted to spend, the size of my house, the number of bedrooms and
bathrooms and the number of pets. There also was a box to type
additional comments; I thought it best to gloss over the baby's
bologna habit.
</P>
<P>
   To complete the registration, I entered personal information,
including my name, address and phone number. Then a list appeared
of a dozen or so cleaning services that operated in the New York
metropolitan area. I could click on the ones that interested me and
that operated in my geographic area.
</P>
<P>
   Imandi.com assured me that my request would go out to all of
them; they would be encouraged to respond directly to me by e-mail
or phone.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I received an e-mail message from one. Joe Brown,
who owns Klean and Brite Cleaning Service on Long Island, wrote
that he would be happy to schedule a time to send a crew of two men
with equipment and supplies ($35 an hour) to my house. As
references, he also provided the names and phone numbers of two
other customers. I phoned one, a longtime customer, who recommended
the service highly.
</P>
<P>
   Then I sent e-mail back to Brown, requesting a crew the
following Friday and including directions to my house. At the
appointed time, the crew arrived, cleaned everything really well,
collected payment and left me a receipt.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the cost of the Web site is being borne by the
investors who are betting on the concept's eventual success.
Although there is no fee for either for service providers or the
customers, the idea is that the sites will eventually charge
merchants for customer referrals.
</P>
<P>
   I know, this all sounds too good to be true. And actually, even
though the process worked fine for me, I identified a few potential
problems. For one thing, this concept is so new that when I also
tried to search for housecleaners at Handshake.com, I learned that
no housecleaners in my area had signed up for the company's new
Express Service feature, which promises immediate bids on
housecleaning requests.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, Klean and Brite was the only merchant to respond to
my request at imandi.com. The reason might be that many of the
merchants are not online themselves, said Raghav P. Kher, the
company's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving toward building closer and closer relationships
and convincing merchants who are offline to get online,'' Kher
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, imandi.com offers customers a list of ``star
merchants,'' service providers who are online, who promise to
respond within 72 hours and who provide references. For those
service providers not online, imandi.com faxes a customer's request
and phone number to merchants, who get in touch with customers
directly.
</P>
<P>
   You can see how this could become cumbersome at best, like an
unwieldy version of that old game Telephone, where you whisper
``Siamese cat'' into someone's ear and the phrase gets garbled as
it travels around the room, finally returning to you as ``Hyenas
fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem is that neither imandi.com nor
Handshake independently evaluates the merchants in their networks.
Instead, they encourage customers to post merchant reviews online.
(Fundu.com screens merchants in its network, a company spokesman
said, and eFrenzy will as well.) For now, the only evaluations I
found on imandi.com were ones that said a merchant ``never
responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Those caveats aside, I'd happily try imandi.com again. In fact,
I already have. Last week, I submitted a request for landscape
design to six local companies. So far, one designer has responded;
she's coming over to look at the job on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm not neglecting my family's health anymore. I called
Klean and Brite back this week. As I type, I can hear in the
distance the sweetest sound on earth: the sound of men vacuuming.

IN SEARCH OF A SIMPLE MACHINE THAT IS DEDICATED TO THE BASICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We are retired and only want to do word processing and use
the Internet. Is there a simple machine out there that will let us
just use word processing programs and go out on the Internet? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Any new computer will be capable of getting the user on the
Web, and most of them will handle word processing and other kinds
of software. But there are options available that may be especially
attractive to new users.
</P>
<P>
   The all-in-one computers, like Apple Computer's iMac (which runs
the Mac operating system) or Gateway's Astro PC (which runs
Windows), can simplify the hardware and software set-up process and
cost much less than a more complicated system. These types of
devices come with a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, a sound card, a
modem and plenty of RAM to get you on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   These ``all in one'' systems provide not only basic
word-processing features and Internet capability but the potential
for many other uses (like games, home accounting or genealogy
software, for example) that you may find yourself wanting to try
once you get comfortable with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Prices can range from about $800 to $1,600, and technical
support is often included. Some retailers offer rebates on the
total price if you sign up with a particular online service, but
read the fine print carefully before you buy.
</P>
<P>
   Those who wish only to explore the World Wide Web and send
e-mail might want to look at the Internet appliances that are
starting to hit the market. These devices, which cost about $300 to
$500, lack the features of a fully outfitted system but are often
simpler to use and fulfill their basic function: getting the user
online. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I finally understand how MP3 music files work, but what are
``skins''? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Skins are purely decorative interfaces for MP3 player
software. Instead of having a rather straightforward electronic
rendering of the CD-player controls and equalizer to play and mix
your digital music files, you can dress up your player.
</P>
<P>
   WinAmp, for example, a Windows MP3 player, has thousands of
skins available (www.winamp-skins.com), everything from futuristic
space-shiplike buttons to one that turns the equalizer into an
``Ecowlizer'' with little Holsteins to adjust the music levels.
</P>
<P>
   SoundJam MP, an MP3 player and encoder for the Macintosh, comes
with several alternate skins. A Web search should help you find
skins for your particular player.
</P>
<P>
   Mac users may want to see what is available in the downloads
section of www.soundjam.com or on the Macast site (home of another
Mac MP3 player) at www.macamp.net. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have read much about DSL service for fast Internet
connections, but what is VDSL? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Most of the digital subscriber line services written about
these days refer to ADSL, or asymmetric digital subscriber lines.
</P>
<P>
   ADSL (the term is usually shortened to DSL when the service is
advertised by companies selling it) offers downloading speeds that
far surpass the capacity of the current 56K modems available. But
while DSL speeds can reach about 8 megabits per second, VDSL (very
high bit-rate digital subscriber line) downloading speeds can
approach 52 megabits per second.
</P>
<P>
   VDSL is still very much in development. The service, which uses
existing copper wire and fiber-optic networks, is not expected to
hit the general market until around 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If all the promises of the technology are fulfilled, however,
VDSL will add a new dimension to home networking.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the ultrafast speeds, transmission of high-quality
video images over the phone line will be possible, which could
allow digital television channels to compete with cable television
companies for viewers. Video teleconferencing will also be much
smoother, Web browsing faster and downloading quicker.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, there is the VDSL Coalition page on the
Web at www.vdsl.org. &QL;

DOWNING STREET TALKS FAIL TO PATCH UP NORTHERN IRELAND RIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Demands by the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, that
Britain restore the suspended Northern Ireland government were met
in a crisis session at 10 Downing St. on Wednesday with counter
demands from other participants that the Irish Republican Army
first return to disarmament talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no room at all to do anything in this situation,''
said the beleaguered Sinn Fein leader, whose party is the political
wing of the IRA. ``The only breakthrough which can start to make
politics work is a return to the institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Under fire for the IRA's refusal to make any move to disarm,
Adams complained that his party was being unfairly scapegoated. ``I
don't think we can play a useful role on the arms issue when all we
are met with is rejections and rebuttals.''
</P>
<P>
   He also ruled out participating in a formal review of the
stalled peace negotiations, saying the British had acted illegally
in shutting down the Belfast administration last Friday. ``There
cannot be a review based on unilateral suspension,'' he told
reporters outside the British prime minister's official residence.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair's insistence that the time had come
for the IRA to start disarming gained valuable support from his
Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, who came to London to join in the
emergency talks.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that continued participation by republicans in the
Northern Ireland government with ``armed backing'' was
unacceptable, Ahern said, ``Whether people like it or not, it is
not compatible, beyond a short transitional period, to have that
democratic mandate with armed backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot agree to it,'' he told members of the Irish
parliament in Dublin before flying to London.
</P>
<P>
   His words may go some way toward closing a rift that had
developed between Britain and Ireland, the two sponsors of the
Ulster peace talks, over the British action suspending the
government in Belfast. Britain took the action, it said, because
the IRA had failed to begin disarming even after members of Sinn
Fein had been admitted to their ministerial positions in the
Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While speaking to the Irish parliament on Tuesday evening, Ahern
was surprised by an IRA announcement that it was ending its contact
with weapons mediators and withdrawing fresh proposals it had made
to consider disarming for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy leader of the moderate Catholic Social Democratic and
Labor Party, Seamus Mallon, who like Ahern had been opposed to the
suspension, joined in the criticism of the IRA on Tuesday for
pulling out of the consultations with the disarmament commission.
He said he found it incredible that the clandestine organization
had made its announcement at a time when Ahern was before his own
legislators in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only have they made a studied insult to Bertie Ahern, but
to the entire political process in Ireland as a whole and to the
Irish people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA action was a dismaying development for supporters of the
peace plan who had been holding meetings throughout recent days
hoping that the new IRA arms initiative would be a basis for
restoring the home rule government. The IRA had offered late Friday
to consider putting its arms ``beyond use'' and suggested that it
could live with a timetable that would see full disarmament by the
May date set down in the April 1998 peace accord. Then Tuesday the
group took back those words.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's meeting was scheduled to find a way to keep the
staggering peace effort on its feet, and the consensus that emerged
was that the vexing issue of guerrilla disarmament had to be
confronted before any progress could be made on restarting the
mothballed Northern Ireland government.
</P>
<P>
   Adams presented an opposite scenario in which the government
would have to be restored before the issue of disarmament could be
taken up, but he had no takers outside his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at Downing Street, his chief rival, David Trimble, the
Ulster Unionist leader, said, ``The onus is fairly and squarely on
the republican movement to put forward proposals as to how this is
going to work. The ball is still firmly in their court. We are not
interested in cobbling together a formula that enables this to
stagger on for a week or two. We want this sorted out once and for
all.''

EXPLORING ZULU HISTORY ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For roughly 60 years during the 19th century, the Zulu kingdom
that had been forged by the warrior leader Shaka was one of the
mightiest black states in Africa. It took a full military campaign
by Britain to pull it down.
</P>
<P>
   Before succumbing, the Zulus inflicted on Britain in 1879 the
most crushing defeat ever by a modern army at the hands of an
aboriginal force.
</P>
<P>
   The Zulus, like others in South Africa, are still recovering
from mistreatment and brutality under apartheid, and their pastoral
traditions have been disrupted by poverty and urbanization. Until
recently, they were largely invisible on the Internet, too.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, the province of KwaZulu-Natal, which was formed from
Natal and the apartheid-era homeland of KwaZulu, has established an
economic development and tourism Web site
(www.kzn-deat.gov.za/tourism/kzntour.htm) that focuses on the Zulu
as a vibrant, living people, not a relic of history.
</P>
<P>
   Under Zulu Culture and Traditions, the site discusses ancestor
worship; the inyangas, or tribal doctors; food and drink (sour milk
and beer, which is brewed by the women); various dances; and
musical instruments, baskets and beadwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love letters date from the introduction of glass beads about
1830, which were quickly given meanings dependent upon their
color,'' the site says. There is more on love beads at the Zulu
Bead Art Page at www.compustyle.co.za/kwazulu/zulu/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cattle mean status, wealth, power and the ability to buy
wives,'' the site notes. ``Frequently, Zulu chiefs would be buried
in their cattle kraals.'' Shaka's kraal was estimated to be more
than 3 miles around and able to hold 12,000 warriors.
</P>
<P>
   The Zulus cannot be studied apart from the rest of South Africa,
in which they are the largest ethnic group (7 million of the
nation's 40 million people) and the most nationalistic.
</P>
<P>
   The founder and first president of the African National Congress
(www.anc.org.za) were both Zulus. So was Albert Luthuli, who became
South Africa's first Nobel laureate in 1960 when as president of
the Congress, he led passive resistance against racist laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site of the Inkatha Freedom Party, based in
KwaZulu-Natal and frequently at odds with the congress, is
www.ifp.org.za.
</P>
<P>
   Several Web sites on the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, a war that the
Zulus did not want and were goaded into fighting by Britain, offer
sharply different perspectives on history. The British lost about
850 men and a roughly equal number of native allies at Isandhlwana
(pronounced is-sandal-WAH-na) on Jan. 22, 1879, after Lord
Chelmsford, their commander, misguessed the Zulus' strength and
location and split his force.
</P>
<P>
   The encampment was wiped out by 20,000 Zulu foot soldiers using
their assegais, or stabbing spears, and their classic ``chest and
horns'' flanking attack, which Shaka had perfected 60 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A bitter 1979 essay on the centenary of Isandhlwana, from
Sechaba, a publication in exile by the African National Congress
(www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/misc/isandhlwana.html) emphasizes
the fight against colonialism. The defense of Rorke's Drift, a tiny
mission station, one day later, in which about 125 British soldiers
held off about 4,000 Zulus in 10 hours of hand-to-hand combat, is
detailed at www.battlefields.co.za/history/index.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Knight, an authority on Zulu warfare, has a detailed account
of Isandhlwana on the same site. He said the victory transformed a
little-known African kingdom into a stereotype of alien savagery
that colored whites' understanding of Zulu history and culture even
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most historical calamities, the British defeat came about
not through any single great error of judgment, but rather through
a combination of misunderstanding, miscalculation and sheer bad
luck,'' he wrote. ``The Zulu victory, on the other hand, was won by
sound tactical judgment, by aggressive spirit and by raw courage
and endurance in the face of an awesome and destructive enemy
weapon technology.'' &QL;

LOVE, HONOR, CHERISH. BUT REVEAL MY PASSWORD?

 (Attn: N.Y., N.H.)   (Circuits)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Susan Fliess had been looking forward to receiving pictures of a
friend's baby through e-mail. She never got the chance. The
pictures arrived at fliess1(at)netscape.net, the e-mail address she
shared with her husband, Kevin, but then: ``Kevin was, like:
`What's this big, huge file? You know what their baby looks
like,''' Fliess said. ``The next thing I knew, he'd deleted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fliess doesn't mind an overflowing In box; her husband does. The
Silicon Valley couple, married nearly three years, decided to deal
with their different attitudes toward clutter by getting separate
e-mail accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The ascendancy of e-mail has opened a new arena to the delicate
diplomacy of relationships. Couples can share many things _ living
space, secrets, friends and finances. Should they share e-mail
accounts, as well?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things need to be negotiated, and e-mail is one of
them,'' said JoAnn Magdoff, a psychotherapist in Manhattan who has
written about the psychology of the Internet. ``But e-mail has its
own twists. It adds a layer of instant intimacy.'' A shared account
``raises issues of how far you really want to go in terms of
disclosure,'' Magdoff said.
</P>
<P>
   People may want an individual e-mail address at home, but feel
snubbed when their partners do, too. Or they may like the freedom
to gripe to their friends without being fearful or self-conscious
about what their partners might read.
</P>
<P>
   One stay-at-home mother, who did not want her name used, said
she resented that her husband had a private office address while
she used their shared AOL address at home. ``He can look at my
mail,'' she said, ``but I can't look at his.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he reads the mail and deletes it, so she doesn't see
it at all. At other times, he uses AOL's ``keep as new'' function
so she can't tell he has read the mail. And even when she has
deleted her outgoing messages, her friends have occasionally
incorporated them into their replies.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband was furious after finding out via an e-mail message
sent to her that she had told a friend something she had kept from
him.
</P>
<P>
   A common mistake couples make is assuming that e-mail is like
other, older forms of communication, Magdoff said. ``People dash
off e-mail where they wouldn't pick up the phone and certainly
wouldn't pick up a pen,'' she said. Home e-mail also affords much
less privacy than, say, a home telephone. On the phone, callers
assume that a couple share both a number and an answering machine;
talkers almost always know if there is a chance they may be
overheard.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for couples to create a merged e-mail name,
like romeoandjuliet(at)aol.com, or to announce their closeness with
an address like wevegoteachother(at)aol.com. The inclusiveness of a
merged name can be an appealing part of a relationship, said Lynn
Harris, who dispenses relationship advice on the Breakup Girl Web
site (www.breakupgirl.com). She refers to joint e-mail addresses as
``we-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people should share everything,'' Harris said.
``Some things are your own stuff. With so much free Web-based
e-mail, there's no need to share.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple's use of joint e-mail can reflect the way they function
in the real world. For Rabbi Michael Beals, the leader of B'nai
Tikvah Congregation in Los Angeles, and his wife, Elissa Green, a
veterinarian, that means he handles the household correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got married five years ago,'' Beals said, ``all the
`ugh' part of life Elissa delegated to me, like paying the bills
and taking out the kitty litter. You should play to your strengths.
My strength is communication, so I'm the one sending most of these
messages out. We're a team. It's fine for me to speak in both of
our names.''
</P>
<P>
   Their e-mail address, rabbivet(at)lafn.org, has caused some
confusion, though, with people assuming the rabbi is a war veteran.
Their signoff _ ``Michael, Elissa, Yofi and Shovas'' _ includes the
dog and the cat. It expresses what is important to them, Beals
said, although some of their correspondents think both the address
and the signoff are a little too cute.
</P>
<P>
   Even people with their own accounts face a question: Should they
reveal their passwords to their partners?
</P>
<P>
   Harris believes that whatever conclusion a couple reach,
password-sharing should not become another intimacy test in a
relationship. ``Some people are weird about sharing anything,''
Harris said. ``They wouldn't give their mom food off their fork.
You have to be careful about drawing relationship conclusions from
other interpersonal weirdness. It might not be a matter of intimacy
at all, but of what boundaries are comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The real red flag, Harris said, is online snooping. Like
medicine cabinets, credit-card bills and diaries, e-mail tempts the
distrustful. Judging from Breakup Girl's advice seekers _ and these
are people in troubled partnerships, not harmonious ones _ ``the
problem is there's enough suspicion to cause the snooping,'' Harris
said.
</P>
<P>
   And if that troubled partnership should dissolve, a shared
e-mail address means yet another headache.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when Dina Robertson and her husband, Scott
Robertson, got a home computer, ``it didn't occur to me not to do
something together,'' said Robertson, of Greenland, N.H. So they
combined everyone's initials, choosing SDDRobt(at)aol.com. (The
second D is for their son, Douglass.)
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when her husband moved out, there was no dispute
that Robertson, the coordinator for a children's advocacy group,
would keep the address. She changed the password.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is gradually reclaiming her maiden name, Dudarevitch.
But she can't get rid of her husband's name on her e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thoroughly involved with that address,'' she said. ``If I
changed it, it would affect hundreds of people. I feel locked into
it. It really bothers me.''

 &HT;    U.S. WILL PUSH AHEAD WITH SPACE STATION, CONGRESS TOLD
 &HT;    By ANGEL WILSON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON NASA plans to continue construction of the
International Space Station regardless of whether Russia's
participates on schedule, a congressional panel was told Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin told the House subcommittee
on space and aeronautics that the United States is prepared to
launch the interim control module and other space station
components without waiting for Russia to launch a service module
that was scheduled to be put in orbit first.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said Russia cannot be given full blame for the space
station delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians were not alone in experiencing launch failures,
as the Japanese, Europeans, and the U.S. struggled as well to
achieve safe and reliable access to space,'' he said. ``Russia was
having financial problems and the United States was having
technical problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The space station was the main topic during the hearing which
focused on NASA's budget proposal for 2001. President Clinton
requested $14 billion for NASA, an increase of 3.2 percent over the
budget for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The station involves 15 countries, including the United States,
Japan, and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee members criticized Russia's inability to launch its
service module. The delay of the service module has caused a
six-year delay in the launching of NASA's interim control module,
costing the U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members also expressed concern over the Mars Surveyor
program and the space shuttle program. The Mars Surveyor program
suffered a serious blow last year with the loss of the Mars Climate
Orbiter, the Mars Polar Lander and the Deep Space-2 probes.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said he was aware of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the Mars failures, I appointed a Mars Program
Independent Assessment Team in December of 1999 led by A. Thomas
Young. That team has been charged to review and assess the entire
Mars program architecture, management, content, and recent
failures. Its report is due out in mid-March,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a particularly slow space shuttle year with only two
successful missions in 1999, NASA plans to complete six missions in
2000. The manifest for 2001 already has nine missions listed; seven
of those missions involve assembly of the space station.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 shuttle budget of $3.2 billion will enable the system
to successfully meet its goals of safer flying, customer diversity,
system improvement, and supportability improvement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must continue to ensure the space shuttle's viability as a
safe, effective transportation system and scientific platform,''
Goldin said.

 &HT;    SUMMIT SEEKS TO BOOST TRADE BETWEEN U.S., AFRICA
 &HT;    (800&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With chart information attached at end of story.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - The organizers of a national confab on Africa want
American companies and investors to realize what their European
counterparts have known for centuries: that Africa represents a
multi-billion dollar opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Africa's perceived political instability aside, such opportunity
was not lost on President Clinton two years ago when he paid the
longest visit to the continent by a modern-day American president.
At the time, more than 150,000 American jobs _ many in the
Southeastern U.S. _ were dependent upon trade with African nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those jobs are tied to (Africa's) oil, petroleum, and mining
industries,'' said Leonard H. Robinson Jr., president of the
National Summit on Africa _ which is hosting a five-day conference
that began here Wednesday in hopes of boosting commercial ties
between Africa and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Priority one in turning that hope into reality is making
American companies aware of the burgeoning business opportunities
in Africa to improve U.S.-Africa trade, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster that message, both President Clinton and Vice
President and Democratic presidential front-runner Al Gore will
each address the group Thursday and Friday, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more than 20,000 expected to attend, many _ such
Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell _ are already working to develop
increased ties with African nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, we took more than 60 people and 25 businesses
to South Africa for 10 days,'' said Campbell, who sees Atlanta as a
gateway to Africa. ``Now, with projects in place such as Delta Air
Lines' direct flight to South Africa, we are beginning to see the
results of our efforts through increased travel, trade
opportunities and growing tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, few American corporations _ such as Delta, Goodyear,
and H.J. Heinz _ have done business with African nations over the
years. That number pales in comparison to Europe, behind which U.S.
trade with the continent continues to lag.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. trade with
Africa in fiscal year 1999 was $22 billion. Europe, by comparison,
did $63 billion worth of trade with Africa in 1998, the last year
for which complete figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   A primary reason for the trade gap falls upon American
companies' fear of political instability, military coups and
investments being expropriated by governments, said Mark Mallach
Brown, administrator of the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP).
</P>
<P>
   Incidents from Ethiopia to Congo to Nigeria, and even the
relatively stable Ivory Coast, have done little to allay those
fears over the last decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Robinson argues, Africa is making economic progress and
it is time for American companies to take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was quick to explain, however, ``I'm not talking about
Americans staking out Africa for economic exploitation . . . (but)
Americans engaging in trade, investments, business with Africa on
an equal plane.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, efforts by Clinton and some in the U.S. Congress
have led the way in promoting trade with Africa. The Africa Growth
and Opportunity Act, the first major trade bill in five years, if
passed, would reward American sale and investment in Africa and cut
tariffs on imported African clothing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Export-Import Bank, which provides U.S.
exporters with financing, distributed $600 million in loans last
year. And bank chairman James Harmon last month promised another $1
billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, the the Ex-Im Bank has done 44 transactions in
Sub-Saharan Africa, totaling $77 million, said Gloria Cabe,
counselor to the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that excites us (about the 44 transactions) is that
we've had a lot of small transactions, which means that we are
supporting small American businesses as well as the large ones,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, others say increasing trade with Africa is the last thing
the continent, which is ``a basket case,'' needs. Walter Williams,
an economics professor at George Mason University said Africa is
more in need of a stable political system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want to invest in an area where there were no rule
of law and no respect for contracts,'' he said. ``You need
institutional infrastructure to promote investment.''
</P>
<P>
   George Ayittey, a professor of economics at American University
here agrees. He said although he is not opposed to helping African
people, their leaders haven't shown a strong commitment to reform.
And by investing in the continent, American companies are
supporting the gangs and thugs who run the governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can pass all the bills you want, but it won't make a
difference unless African leaders are willing to change,'' said
Ayittey, a native of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a former World Bank vice president, agreed that Africa
has to regain American investors' confidence by building a
portfolio of success stories. But, he added that political
instability should not be a reason not to trade and invest in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every country's long-term salvation depends on trade and
investment, not just aid,'' he said.

KIRK DOUGLAS STARTS `NEW CAREER' IN `DIAMONDS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Kirk Douglas is still game. After a
morning of interviews, the gray-haired actor _ he is now 83 _
should be exhausted. But courtesy comes first, and he quickly gets
to his feet to welcome his next interrogator.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas is clearly on an enthusiasm high. His handshake is
strong, and the light in his dark hazel eyes burns bright.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder. After years off the screen, the actor who was
always famous for his physical and emotional vigor is back,
starring in a motion picture, by his own count his 82nd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diamonds,'' opening Friday, is Douglas' first film since the
stroke that hit him in January 1996 and a back operation that same
month.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Diamonds,'' Douglas plays Harry, a former boxer who has had
a stroke. Like Douglas, Harry has trouble pronouncing words but has
worked hard at speech therapy and can now be understood maybe 95
percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Like Harry, Douglas has a lot to say. Publicists for
``Diamonds'' have to almost literally pull him away from the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy who can't talk, I talk a lot,'' Douglas jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody minds. Douglas is a legend of cinema, a box-office star
from the late 1940s through 1970s, still playing leads into the
1980s. Make that into 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Among his films: ``Champion'' (his first Oscar nomination,
1949), ``Young Man With a Horn'' and ``The Glass Menagerie'' (both
1950), ``The Bad and the Beautiful'' (Oscar nomination, 1953),
``20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' (1954), ``Lust for Life'' (Oscar
nomination, 1956), ``The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral'' (1957),
``Paths of Glory'' (1958), ``Spartacus'' (1960), ``Lonely Are the
Brave'' (1962), ``Seven Days in May'' (1964), ``The Man From Snowy
River'' (1982) and ``Tough Guys'' (the last of seven films with pal
Burt Lancaster, 1986).
</P>
<P>
   Though he has never received an Academy Award for acting, he was
nominated three times and accepted a special Oscar in 1996. He
received an American Film Institute Life Achievement Award in 1991,
he was selected one of AFI's top 25 male stars of all time in 1999,
and was named one of the top 100 stars of all time by Entertainment
Weekly in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Jewish Russian immigrants (he was born Issur
Danielovitch on Dec. 9, 1916), he began acting in college and was
on Broadway by 1941. After World War II service, he got the male
lead opposite Barbara Stanwyck in his first movie, ``The Strange
Love of Martha Ivers'' in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   But his breakthrough came playing a tough boxer in ``Champion.''
How fitting it is, therefore, that scenes of Douglas in
``Champion'' are used for flashbacks in ``Diamonds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to go out and cast a guy who looked like young
Kirk Douglas,'' said ``Diamonds'' director John Mallory Asher.
``Kirk said, `Why don't we use `Champion' for this?'''
</P>
<P>
   The old boxing film means more to Douglas than just his first
Academy Award nomination. It broke him out of the ``intellectual''
characters he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When `Champion' came along, my agent was mad at me because
they had me assigned to a big picture with Gregory Peck and Ava
Gardner called `The Great Sinner.' I said `No, I want to do this
little picture, `Champion.' `Champion' made me a star.''
</P>
<P>
   As we sit in a large guest room in the exclusive L'Ermitage
hotel in Beverly Hills, the effects of age, a half-decade of pain
after a 1991 helicopter crash and the stroke are clearly evident on
that famous, broken-nosed, granite face. But the profile, seen
against the bright sunlight through a side window, is still strong
and distinct, and his trademark cleft chin is unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas is dressed in a black turtleneck, khaki slacks, white
socks and dark deck shoes. His hair is combed straight back.
</P>
<P>
   He struggles with his speech. The words are thick and come
slowly. But you'd better believe he is in command of them.
</P>
<P>
   In the original script for ``Diamonds,'' the character Harry had
Alzheimer's disease. It was changed to fit Douglas, who helped
rewrite many scenes to add what he had experienced. Even the
therapy tapes Harry watches are Douglas' own tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kirk and I did a lot of rewrites as we were shooting,'' Asher
said. ``He'd call me in the middle of the night and say `What about
Scene 54?' About 2 a.m. I'd hang up the phone and two hours later
I'd get up and go to the set. This was very important to him. I
can't commend him enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Diamonds,'' Harry has a melancholy scene with the madam of
a house of ill repute _ played by Douglas' lifelong friend Lauren
Bacall (they knew each other before they were in movies) _ and
tells her how difficult fighting back from the stroke has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see a lot of the screenplay I wrote myself,'' Douglas
says. ``(Like) when I told Bacall, `You just want to cry and give
up on everything.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was how Douglas felt in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terrible thing about a stroke is the depression,'' he
says. ``At the beginning of my stroke, I babbled like a baby. What
is an actor if he can't talk, you know? When I first had my stroke,
after my helicopter crash almost breaking my back, I thought, `I
will never do another movie again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But then you have to motivate yourself. Or have, like in my
case, your wife (of 45 years, Anne Douglas) say, `Come on, get your
(behind) out of bed and start working.'''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to act, Douglas turned back to writing. His 1988
autobiography, ``The Ragman's Son,'' had been a best seller, and he
had written three novels: ``The Gift,'' ``Dance With the Devil''
and ``Last Tango in Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 came a new memoir, ``Climbing the Mountain: My Search
for Meaning.'' The children's book ``Young Heroes of the Bible''
came out last October.
</P>
<P>
   But his real love and work is acting. He admits he missed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like coming back home,'' he says about working on
``Diamonds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was an important picture because, with a lot of
humor and some poignant scenes, we were making a statement, that
having a stroke is not the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Diamonds'' is a generational drama with comedy about the
bonding between Douglas' character, Harry's long-estranged adult
son Lance, played by Dan Aykroyd, and Lance's son (Corbin Allred).
</P>
<P>
   Forced into a road trip together, they discover the
relationships they had all been missing.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas has four sons, all of whom went into show business,
something he did not want to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want my kids to be actors,'' he says. ``The chances
for success are remote.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael, of course, became almost as famous as his dad. The two
have never made a film together, but father and son still hope to
act together in a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the stroke, Michael and I were working on a script.
When I had the stroke, Michael said, `Well, Dad, keep working with
your speech therapist and we'll do the movie.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Look, why don't you work with my speech therapist.
And when you talk like I talk, then we'll make the movie.' He
thought that was very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   At least they soon will be onscreen in some of the same
theaters. Michael's new film, ``Wonder Boys,'' opens Feb. 25, a
week after ``Diamonds.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, who recently had his second bar mitzvah _ 70 years
after his first _ is looking forward to more acting work. He is set
to shoot a segment of ``Touched By An Angel'' this month and has
film plans in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have many things to be grateful for,'' he says. ``Making
`Diamonds' was like starting my life over again as an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   So the legend goes on. But don't tell Kirk Douglas he's a
legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not complimented because I think a legend involves the
past,'' he says thoughtfully. ``And I like to think that with my
stroke, I am now embarking on a new career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finished? I just started.''

   RUSSIA-BANK (New York) _ A former Bank of New York executive and
her husband pleaded guilty to federal charges Wednesday, revealing
how they built one of the largest money laundering schemes in U.S.
history to aid Russian bankers and their gun-toting customers. Lucy
Edwards, 41, and Peter Berlin, 46, stood side by side, each telling
a federal judge how they used Edwards' position as a vice president
in the bank's Eastern European Division to help Russian bankers set
up an illegal bank on U.S. soil that laundered more than $7
billion. (Summary from wires) By Timothy L. O'Brien.

<P>
   GERMANY-KOHL (Berlin) _ The crisis of the conservative party
that has governed and stabilized Germany for most of the years
since World War II deepened Wednesday with the abrupt resignation
of its leader, Wolfgang Schaeuble. The departure of Schaeuble, who
was handpicked by former Chancellor Helmut Kohl to be his successor
as party leader in 1998, left the opposition Christian Democratic
Union rudderless at a time of profound shifts in the political
landscape of German-speaking Europe. By Roger Cohen.

<P>
   PINOCHET-HEALTH (Madrid) _ Former Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet has suffered brain damage and is mentally unfit to stand
trial on human rights charges, Spanish newspapers said on
Wednesday. The papers cited a confidential report by an independent
team of British doctors as saying the 84-year-old general would
have difficulty understanding and answering questions at a trial,
though he was physically capable of facing prosecution. (Summary

   LABOR-IMMIG (New Orleans) _ The American labor movement, after
long regarding immigrants as a threat, adopted a sharp change in
policy Wednesday and called for amnesty for illegal immigrants and
an end to most sanctions against employers that hire such
immigrants. In decades past, many labor unions saw immigrant
workers as the enemy, often accusing them of pulling down wages and
breaking strikes. But the AFL-CIO's executive council adopted a
more sympathetic approach toward immigrants Wednesday, saying the
nation's immigration rules have too often enabled employers to
exploit undocumented workers. By Steven Greenhouse.

<P>
   Piano tuning is a quirky, sparsely populated profession. Like
glass blowing, the skill is often handed down from one generation
to the next. And it is difficult to learn. The traditional rule of
thumb, or ear, is that it can take three years, or 1,000 tunings,
before a professional tuner can tune a piano well.
</P>
<P>
   John Callahan, a piano technician in Oakland, Calif., who is now
42, learned to tune pianos from his father when he was 16. After
the younger Callahan opened his own business, he relied on his ears
and a tuning fork. But when he tunes a piano now, he fires up his
laptop computer, places it atop the piano and calls up a software
program called CyberTuner.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan must still use his ears to listen to the pitch and a
tuning hammer to manipulate the tuning pins. What CyberTuner adds
is a highly accurate visual readout of the pitch of the strings as
they are struck or played. With CyberTuner, Callahan can create a
customized, uniform tuning for each of the 800 or so pianos he
tunes each year. Tuning a piano with CyberTuner is usually no
faster than tuning a piano by ear. Settings for each piano are
stored in the computer for future reference, eliminating the need
to reinvent the wheel every time Callahan returns to tune the same
instrument, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While there are many tuning aids, the CyberTuner software has
inspired a loyal following among tuners like Callahan. Another
popular product is Accu-Tuner, a stand-alone device that is used by
more tuners than CyberTuner. But not only are CyberTuner,
Accu-Tuner and other such products anathema to some tuners, they
are also the unlikely fuel that has helped rekindle a debate over
how pianos should sound in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   CyberTuner is the work of Dean Reyburn, a professional piano
tuner and amateur computer programmer in Cedar Springs, Mich., who
wrote the program a few years ago to help his fellow tuners.
Reyburn has sold about 1,000 copies of the program, at $800 each.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan marvels at the program's versatility and power. ``If
Dean Reyburn lived in Silicon Valley, none of this would have
happened,'' Callahan said. ``Instead of writing this obscure
program to help a few thousand piano geeks, he'd be working at a
computer company and probably making millions.''
</P>
<P>
   Many tuners prefer Accu-Tuner, a more entrenched mainstay of the
piano tuning world. Accu-Tuner is the invention of Albert
Sanderson, a physicist in Chelmsford, Mass., who has been creating
electronic tuning devices since 1973. Sanderson has sold nearly
6,000 of his Accu-Tuners, which means that many of the country's
tuners _ a number that some put at 10,000 and others at 15,000 _
use some kind of electronic tuner.
</P>
<P>
   Neither product is aimed at untrained hobbyists who might want
to avoid hiring a professional tuner. ``If you try to do this on
your own,'' said Taylor Mackinnon, vice president of the Piano
Technicians Guild, ``be sure to have a good piano tuner's phone
number at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   While the $1,200 Accu-Tuner is a self-contained device,
Reyburn's CyberTuner software takes advantage of a laptop's power,
which allows it to do more things. But those who prefer the
Accu-Tuner say they would find it too cumbersome to carry a laptop
to every tuning job. (Reyburn and Sanderson are currently in a
patent dispute over a feature that automatically steps a tuner from
one note to the next.)
</P>
<P>
   Karla Pfennig, a tuner in Austin, Texas, who uses Accu-Tuner,
said, ``I'd have to take my G3 PowerBook around, and I'm not going
to do it.'' Speaking of Accu-Tuner, she added, ``It's dedicated,
and it has a battery that lasts for weeks, as opposed to hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the purists, who shun any kind of electronic aid
altogether. The danger of a device like CyberTuner, many tuners
say, is that it becomes a crutch. Steinway &AMP; Sons, for instance,
allows its concert technicians to tune only by ear.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Sullivan, a tuner in Corvallis, Ore., said that she had no
need for an electronic device. ``I learned to tune aurally by a
tuner who learned aurally,'' Sullivan said. ``It's such a beautiful
way to do it, I've never seen any reason to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But Callahan disagreed about the value of a computerized tuning
program: ``It's like an X-ray. It doesn't mean you don't need the
doctor anymore, but it gives you a much better diagnostic tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with electronic tuning instruments, tuning remains an
artistic and creative task. ``We tell people, Don't leave your ears
at home,'' Sanderson said. ``If you're tuning with this thing,
there will be some times you will disagree with the instrument. Go
with your ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuners like Sullivan see the electronic devices as tools of
convenience. ``It's useful when tuners have to do a quick pitch
raise,'' she said, referring to a special, time-consuming tuning
for every key on pianos that have not been tuned for a long time.
``Or if you can't hear well because there's lots of noise, or if
you're working in a shop and want to do a bunch of pianos and get
them in the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   But for tuners who use electronic aids without apology,
convenience is the least of it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most controversial feature of electronic tuning is
its ability to help a tuner change a piano's tuning, also known as
its temperament, with ease.
</P>
<P>
   Modern pianos are tuned in ``equal temperament,'' which divides
each octave into twelve equal half-steps. The frequency of a note
is adjusted up or down, sacrificing some harmony in all keys so
none are too dissonant.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in many tunings that were popular in the
Baroque period, intervals are extremely pure in some keys at the
expense of others, increasing the dissonance in those keys.
</P>
<P>
   When Bach wrote his famous ``Well-Tempered Clavier,'' pieces
that exploit the 24 major and minor keys in which they were
written, in the first half of the 18th century, it gave rise to the
term ``well temperament.'' That tuning scheme, although not an
example of absolute equal temperament, was a departure from earlier
tunings and allowed keyboardists to play all the pieces without
retuning the instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Equal temperament is now universally accepted, but its
detractors view it as an unhappy compromise. They say historic
temperaments are essential to unlock the emotional charge of
earlier music.
</P>
<P>
   CyberTuner comes with 57 historical temperaments, which can
depart a little or a lot from absolutely equal temperament.
</P>
<P>
   Mordecai Shehori, a concert pianist in New York, is the rare
pianist who tunes his own instrument. Shehori uses CyberTuner
whenever he tunes his piano. He is not an advocate of historical
temperaments, but he often changes tunings slightly, according to
the composer he is playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the octaves are stretched very little, it creates purer
sonorities and leaner sound, which fits better Scarlatti, Mozart
and Haydn,'' he said. ``When the octaves are stretched more, it
creates a more robust, gritty sound that fits better to Schumann,
Brahms or Liszt.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On a more radical level, Jerry Kuderna, a concert pianist who
lives in Berkeley, Calif., had Callahan tune his piano to a
temperament devised by Johann Philipp Kirnberger, a student of
Bach's, in 1771. Kuderna said the Kirnberger temperament was well
suited to Debussey and Ravel, who composed in the early 20th
century. ``A tuning that really makes music of the 18th century
sound well will also serve 20th-century music well,'' Kuderna said.
``I know it's a radical thing to say, but it's been borne out by me
in experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuderna was introduced to different temperaments in 1992 by his
previous tuner, Paul Bailey, who was also a student of the piano
and piano literature.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Kuderna, 52, is a convert to the practice of playing
in a historic temperament would only begin to underscore the point.
``Equal temperament is like tract housing, where you go to a
development and all the houses are basically the same,'' he said.
``They are designed to not stand out, to not upset anybody. It's a
common denominator.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in an unequal temperament, Kuderna said, ``is like
Billie Holliday singing in the cracks.'' ``It gives you the notes
you can't find in equal temperament,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kuderna's view is held by a small minority of pianists,
a growing number of tuners are beginning to experiment with
different tunings. That would be very difficult without electronic
tuning. Without that, tuners would have to spend days studying the
different temperaments, then trying to achieve them by ear.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians like Callahan say the electronic devices reduce the
work involved in producing different tunings to the same amount of
time it would take to tune a piano in equal temperament. ``The
historical temperaments are now available at the touch of a
button,'' he said. ``It takes a late 20th-century laptop sitting on
top of a 100-year-old piano to allow me to touch a button and
instantly choose a temperament that's appropriate for music written
in 1780.''
</P>
<P>
   Callahan often asks serious pianists if they would like to try a
new tuning, and those who say yes are not disappointed. ``I haven't
had one customer yet ask me to take the tuning off,'' Callahan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reyburn said that when he developed CyberTuner, he had not
intended to help kick up a storm over electronic tuning. But that
is exactly what he has done.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, David Leahy, a fourth-grade teacher at the
Greenaway Elementary School in Beaverton, Ore., anointed himself
the school's Webmaster and started work on his labor of love.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Leahy spends 90 minutes a week updating the school's
site, and parents say his efforts _ particularly the page where he
posts his students' work on projects like haiku, proverbs and the
Underground Railroad _ have revived dinner table conversations in
the homes of his fourth graders all over town.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who visit Leahy's classroom page say they finally know
that their children do a lot more than ``nothing'' at school every
day, and they have the electronic evidence to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web site gave me a jumping-off point for dialogue with my
son about what was going on in his classroom,'' said Jill Bogle, a
Beaverton resident whose son was in Leahy's class last year. Now
Bogle's son is in middle school and his teacher does not maintain a
Web site, and Bogle says finding out what is going on at school is
a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Education experts say that the more parents are involved in
their children's education, the better the children will perform in
school. One of the best ways to foster involvement is to keep
communication flowing from school to home.
</P>
<P>
   With 71 percent of the nation's 86,000 schools able to reach the
Internet from at least one classroom in each school, according to a
report titled ``Technology Counts,'' which was underwritten by the
Milken Family Foundation and originally published in Education
Week, the Web can be an effective way to send information from
school to home, instead of through the backpack express.
</P>
<P>
   At many schools, parents can log on to check homework
assignments, peek at their children's latest work and check the
results of recent tests.
</P>
<P>
   Parents with enough time, interest and computer access say that
the Web sites make them feel more connected to their children's
schools, but Barbara Stein, a senior policy analyst for the
National Education Association, said the schools' Web site efforts
were usually done on a small scale by volunteers and tended to lack
a larger strategic plan.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of teachers are not comfortable using computer
technology, Stein said, according to a survey on professional
development and training conducted by the U.S. Department of
Education in 1998 and distributed last year. And she said that few
teachers had time to keep a Web site current. As a result,
communication can be spotty, and parents who come to rely on the
Web may be abruptly cut adrift, like Bogle, if a student moves into
a new class that doesn't have a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies are making it easier for schools and
teachers to set up a Web site. Companies with a well established
Web presence include MySchoolOnline.com
(familyeducation.com/golocal), part of the Family Education
Network; School Notes (www.edgate.com/notes.html), part of the
Copernicus Education Gateway; HighWired.com (www.highwired.com), an
online publishing service for high schools; Electric SchoolHouse
(www.eschoolhouse.com); and bigchalk.com (www.bigchalk.com). And
the publishing powerhouse Scholastic (www.scholastic.com) is
retooling the teacher-to-parent portion of its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The point of entry for many school Web sites is often a template
that includes things like lunch menus, sports schedules, teacher
rosters and notes from the principal.
</P>
<P>
   Although business models vary, these sites make money through
advertising, which can include a company's logo on the site, banner
advertising and underwriting. Most links are to sites offering
services like online tutoring, research tools and encyclopedias.
Some sites, like Scholastic's, offer products for sale, but sales
pitches are made on only the section of the site aimed at parents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to tools that a school can use to build a Web site,
these education-based companies offer electronic services like
teacher training and curriculum building. They also offer sites
where parents can discover how and what their children are learning
or what children need to know to pass state achievement or
proficiency tests. There are also links to online reference sources
and educational products.
</P>
<P>
   Even though thousands of schools have signed up for Web services
_ HighWired, for example, said it had signed up about 8,000 of the
nation's 20,000 high schools _ few schools are using them. An
impressive roster of schools is registered for each service, but a
quick check of school Web pages revealed that most are blank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pretty consistent error that companies make and educators
make is they underestimate the degree to which it's labor intensive
to put up and maintain the information on a Web site even if the
site sits somewhere else,'' said Peter Grunwald, the president of
Grunwald Associates of San Mateo, Calif., a market research and
consulting firm that focuses on the technology link between home
and school.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Carson, the chief executive of the Family Education Network,
said: ``The local stuff takes time. There's a three- to four-month
lag between sign-up and training.'' Some 9,000 schools have
registered for the company's template-based service, but Carson
acknowledges that actual use has been slow.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers may be reluctant to get class Web sites up and running
for a number of reasons: teachers are often pressed for time, some
suffer from technophobia and others suspect that giving parents so
much access may not have positive results, say educators and
experts who are studying school technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear to the educators what the benefit of it is,''
Carson said. ``They're getting pulled into it. We now know that if
we get two or more teachers that get excited about the whole notion
of building a classroom Web site, it starts to spread in the
school. The first wave is happening now, and it's been with the
lunch menu.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson said parents who rely on the Internet for the mundane
aspects of school-to-home communication were primed to open other
windows that school Web sites can provide.
</P>
<P>
   Patti O'Neal, the office clerk at the Bright Star Elementary
School in Douglasville, Ga., said that her main job was operating
the photocopier and supervising the school's Opportunity Room, a
newfangled name for a detention room. O'Neal said she used her free
time to maintain the school's extensive Web site, including typing
in the daily homework assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers say feedback from parents has been overwhelmingly
positive, and O'Neal said the phone calls and e-mail messages that
take her to task for typos _ the school was flooded with questions
and complaints after she typed teriyaki beer instead of teriyaki
beef on the lunch menu _ proved that parents were paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lunch menus and sports schedules are going to be an
important hook,'' said Grunwald, who noted that parents who found
blank sites or out-of-date sites would visit them only a few times
before writing them off as a waste of time. ``The challenge for
educators and companies is creating a vibrant community around the
information,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Dorothy Dike, a mother of a fifth grader in
Suzanne Marcus' class at the Cardinal Forest Elementary School in
Springfield, Va., appreciates the nightly homework posting at
Copernicus' free SchoolNotes.com site.
</P>
<P>
   Dike checks her daughter's homework assignments nightly before
heading home from work. Her daughter used to say little about
school, Dike said, but she is now more than happy to volunteer
information about her day at school because she knows her mother is
paying attention.

PARENTS HESITANT TO SEND TEACHERS E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In September, Tricia Zarro, a first-grade teacher at Springhurst
Elementary School in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., furnished her e-mail
address to the parents of her 19 pupils in the hope of making
herself more accessible. Since then, only four parents have sent
her e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Zarro's experience is not atypical. Though many teachers have
been quick to supply their e-mail addresses to students and
parents, parents have not been using them.
</P>
<P>
   Even David Leahy, a fifth-grade teacher at Greenaway Elementary
School in Beaverton, Ore., whose Web-based activities are well
publicized in his school, said that on average, he receives only
one e-mail message every other week from parents of his students.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers, though, may be secretly relieved by the parental
silence. ``A teacher's worst nightmare is that they get 30 e-mails
from all the parents they never had to respond to before,'' said
Jonathan Carson, chairman of the Family Education Network, a group
of online sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of educators still have some doubts as to how closely
they want to be communicating with parents,'' said Peter Grunwald,
president of Grunwald Associates, a consulting firm in San Mateo,
Calif. They seem to be concerned that they may have to give up some
of their autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Leahy said, an e-mail note from a parent to quickly
explain that a child is having a hard time at home, which may
affect his behavior at school, could be helpful. He said he looked
forward to a time when a parent did not hesitate to send him e-mail
with news. ``It isn't happening yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be that parents who did not do well in school may
feel intimidated, said Barbara Stein, a senior policy analyst at
the National Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   Or they just might fear getting back e-mail that has been graded
and checked for spelling.

SEARCH SOFTWARE THAT COMPARES APPLES AND ORANGES
</HEADLINE>
 (Circuits) 
(af) 
By LISA GUERNSEY  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, experts in digital imagery have been puzzled by a
major technical challenge: Can technology be developed that enables
people to search for images by visual characteristics alone? Will
searchers someday be able to find photographs of, say, a basketball
game by searching for an image of a basketball, instead of relying
on keywords tagged to that photograph?
</P>
<P>
   Many high-tech engineers are now willing to admit that the
challenge is much more difficult than originally envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you can search for a basketball, explained Carlos
Montalvo, vice president for marketing at Virage, a company that
has developed image-searching tools and applied them to video.
``But you are just as likely to get an image with an orange or a
sunset,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of striving for perfection, several companies and
research laboratories are taking a different tack. Driven by the
proliferation of online images and digital cameras, engineers have
started to think about how even low-level technology can meet the
needs of a typical consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have concluded, for example, that people might be
satisfied with the ability to search through their digital
photographs by looking for relatively simple characteristics, like
colors or patterns, instead of specific images.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a new generation of image-searching technologies
that are ready for the consumer market, or nearly so. The majority
of them use low-level image searching, then incorporate keywords,
speech-recognition systems and other data, like the time a
photograph was taken, to refine the searches.
</P>
<P>
   One is called Shoebox, a project at AT&AMP;T Labs. It starts with
the concept at the crux of digital-image searching: matching visual
features (which are in essence bits of data) with mathematical
representations.
</P>
<P>
   A specific color, for example, is assigned a specific
mathematical code. An image containing several colors in a pattern
is represented by a combination of codes.
</P>
<P>
   When Shoebox's software is applied to a batch of digital
photographs, the program is able to index those photographs
according to the codes that signify their features. ``We do an
analysis of the color, texture and shape of that image,'' said Ken
Wood, a research scientist who manages the Shoebox project
(www.uk.research.att.com/dart/shoebox).
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for example, the software analyzes a picture of a polar
bear. First it segments the picture by tracing regions that are
differentiated by color. Then it labels those segments and prepares
to find similar ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can say, This is a white fuzzy region with the following
shape and texture properties,'' Wood said. ``Then we can look at
the database and find other images that have white fuzzy regions
with similar shapes and sizes.''
</P>
<P>
   Corresponding pictures are shown with thumbnail images; some of
them, like a photograph of a woman in a white fur coat, may be
false matches. That is where the science of image searching ends
and the human brain comes in. A person looking at those thumbnails,
Wood said, could simply discard the fur coat picture. ``As long as
you can see immediately what you want, you can continue to narrow
your search,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wood also expects that people using the software might at least
tag photographs they have taken, either with the time stamps that
are automatically applied by digital cameras or by annotating the
images with keywords or recorded audio snippets. When the
technology is licensed by a manufacturer and ready to be sold,
which Wood said might happen within a year, it will probably
include a combination of those features.
</P>
<P>
   International Business Machines has incorporated some of the
same principles in its work on a technology it calls Query By Image
Content, or QBIC. QBIC, which was developed more than five years
ago, analyzes how colors and patterns are arrayed in an image.
</P>
<P>
   Now office-software makers like Lotus are starting to embed some
elements of the technology in their products so people can search
for things like presentation slides by typing in information about
a slide's layout and background colors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The technology is not as precise as some researchers would like,
said Dragutin Petkovic, the IBM scientist who started the QBIC
project. But he said that it would still have some significant
commercial applications, especially for e-commerce sites that sell
clothing or interior design products.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future,'' Petkovic said, ``you could take a piece of
fabric from your neighbor and then find all the Web sites that sell
similar fabric.''
</P>
<P>
   A demonstration on QBIC's Web site (wwwqbic.almaden.ibm.com)
shows how the technology works when applied to a database of stamp
images. If you are looking at a stamp with a green tint, for
example, you can request a color search and find a sample of stamps
with that tint.
</P>
<P>
   Petkovic is now applying the principles he learned in QBIC to a
more complex project called Cue-Video that combines image searching
with speech- and voice-recognition software.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, video searching is considered by many engineers to be
the next major application to use image analysis. One company that
has already decided to focus on video searching is Virage, which
has impressed television executives in the past year by
demonstrating how video clips of broadcast news can be archived and
searched.
</P>
<P>
   To index a video, Virage's technology watches for changes in the
color and patterns of each frame. A drastic change _ like a switch
from an anchorwoman sitting at a desk to a shot of a traffic jam _
is detected by the software, enabling it to tag those frames as a
new segment or idea.
</P>
<P>
   Those segments are then displayed on a computer screen as
sequential thumbnail images that offer a storyboard of the video.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Virage's technology integrates other elements of the
broadcast, like audio transcripts and the text that might go with a
graphic, into the index of the video clip. The company's next
endeavor, sales representatives say, is to add face recognition. By
analyzing famous people's photographs for features like the
distance between their eyes and the color of their hair, the
software finds matching images in live or stored video.
</P>
<P>
   Virage's primary clients are corporations and television
networks that can afford such advanced technology. But the company
is also offering a free program called MyLogger (it can be
downloaded at Virage's Web site, www.virage.com) that incorporates
some of Virage's basic tools for searching images and transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some people have a more basic request: they simply
want to search the Web for images instead of text. Some search
sites, like AltaVista, have offered help over the years by letting
people search for keywords that might show up in image file names
(like basketball.jpg). Now a handful of sites are trying to add
image analysis to the process.
</P>
<P>
   One is WholeWeb.net, a search-engine company that is creating a
program that its founders say will be able to match scanned
photographs to an index of images found on the Web. Another site,
Ditto.com, is already using some low-level image analysis, in
combination with keyword searching, to sort online images
discovered by its Web crawlers. Recently, the site has been
attracting as many as 10 million visitors each month, said John
Treacy, vice president for product management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly,'' Treacy said, ``the Internet has moved way, way
beyond enabling people to search for text.''

THE MARKET FOR DOG PAINTINGS REFUSES TO PLAY DEAD

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the John Emms painting of dogs called ``A Jack
and Two Knaves'' sold on Tuesday for $140,000, more than three
times the low estimate, the audience let out a collective whoop _
and the auctioneers breathed a sigh of relief. Only two lots
before, another Emms painting ``Sailor and Bramble'' did not sell
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was Dog Day at the William Doyle Galleries. With the
Westminster Kennel Club show packing dog lovers in at Madison
Square Garden, the auctioneers hoped this would be an ideal time to
auction hundreds of dog pictures, many of debatable value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these things that would only go for $100 or $200 in
one of our regular sales are bringing $400 or $500,'' said Alan
Fausel, the senior vice president in charge of European and
American painting at Doyle. ``In a regular sale, they would be lost
in the shuffle.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first such sale last year, Charles O'Brien, Fausel's
counterpart at Bonhams auction house in London, was ``stunned by
the prices Americans pay for the paintings,'' Fausel said. For his
part, O'Brien was a bit more circumspect. ``Americans,'' he said,
``really love the dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   So Doyle, joined by Bonhams, saved up dog paintings (and a few
cats), collected some dog sculptures and memorabilia, published a
color catalog and ``threw the net wide,'' said Kathleen M. Doyle,
the company's chairwoman. ``We got bidders from the Shetland
Islands, from London, from Texas, Ireland, Greece and New York,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Doyle said the sale had netted $743,000; a
mere doggy tidbit at an Old Master's sale, but a cause for delight
for a group of paintings that included a lot of brown hounds, some
dachshunds ripping apart an accordion, and a small portrait of
``Lady Yule's Favorite Poodle, Fifi,'' which sold for $3,250.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the usual crowd of decorators _ Mario Buatta paid $7,187
for a small painting of ``three sissy-looking dogs'' _ the
auctioneers sought dog breeders in town for the kennel club show,
hunters and anglers and dog painting collectors.
</P>
<P>
   While the hunters and anglers were not immediately apparent, the
collectors were, especially the younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Flannery, 27, and her husband, Will Flannery 3rd, 26,
who run a software consulting business in Houston. They came up for
the auction, with their 3-month-old son, Will IV.
</P>
<P>
   Flannery, who wore a silk shirt patterned with brown English
setters, said she and her husband knew they wanted to collect art.
``Then we went to Paris a year ago and bought our first dog
painting, and now we're hooked,'' she said. ``So we're having fun
collecting. My husband's a big hunter. He loves to quail hunt,
pheasant hunt, deer hunt.'' They bought Lot No. 8, ``By the Day's
Bag,'' of an English pointer and a Labrador retriever, for $2,530
and No. 97, ``English Setter Working a Wood,'' for $2,300.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd much rather collect dog memorabilia than spend money on
food,'' Flannery said with a laugh. ``We've been having fun buying
$5 dinners in diners and delis, and eating hot dogs on the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Steve Faigen, an aspiring collector who lives in New York, was
taken by the picture of the dachshunds going wild with the
accordion. ``I especially love pictures of dogs behaving badly,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although they were clearly enjoying themselves, some of the
newer collectors may not have been making the best investments,
auctioneers and dealers alike say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's straight dog portraits, and not paintings by Stubbs or
one of the great 18th-century painters, as far as their intrinsic
worth goes, I don't think they're any great shakes,'' said John
Rosselli, an art and curio dealer. ``They're decorative art.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosselli has begun reproducing some of the more appealing
decorative dog paintings in oils and acrylics, which he sells for
$1,000 to $1,500. ``People buy five or six and hang them together
on a wall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   J.J. Smith, a dealer in New Haven, Conn., said the market for
dog paintings is specialized but growing. ``Until 10 years ago,
your run-of-the-mill dog pictures were a plague on the market, seen
as not very serious, a sort of hee-hee,'' he said. ``Then all of a
sudden, they were like teddy bears: people started collecting
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Victorians particularly liked anthropomorphic images,'' he
continued. ``They seem a little gooey for modern tastes, but dog
lovers are used to looking at their animals, speaking to them,
misconstruing their looks _ although now they're finding that dogs
do smile.''
</P>
<P>
   While a lot of dog paintings may not be worth much as an
investment, Smith predicted that ``serious prices will be paid for
some of the top names.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's sale, it was clear he was right.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Emms painting ``Jack and Two Knaves'' which brought
$140,000, another large oil of four beagles by Wright Barker sold
for $60,000, the high estimate. A Victorian picture of puppies
playing with a British naval officer's jacket and sword, called
``Defense of the Realm'' brought $24,150. ``Study of the Head of a
Hound'' by Heywood Hardy, small and damaged but well painted, went
for $11,500 after spirited bidding.
</P>
<P>
   An almost surrealistic ``Group of 10 Black Labrador Retrievers
on a Beach,'' by Reuben Ward Binks (described in the catalog as the
Sargent of the dog world), brought $9,775. The auction house had
estimated that the work would sell for $1,800 to $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 66 out of 220 works sold for under $1,000. So far, there
has not been a dog picture that has surpassed ``Portrait of a
Newfoundland Dog,'' painted by George Stubbs for the Duke of York
in 1803, an oil that Sotheby's sold in November for $3.695 million.
Now that was a serious price.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: There is a DRIP directory put out by some 900 company for
people who want to invest without going through a broker. Where can
I get this? _ B.D., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several groups providing information on companies
that offer dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs).
</P>
<P>
   One is the Direct Purchase Plan Clearinghouse, which mails a
free prospectus and enrollment information for more than 350
companies. For information, call (800) 774-4117 or visit the Web
site www.dripinvestor.com.
</P>
<P>
   Another is the National Association of Investors, a nonprofit
group offering a low-cost investment plan, ``Better Investing''
magazine and other services to members who pay $39 a year. Write to
Box 220, Royal Oak, MI 48068, or call (877) 275-6242.
</P>
<P>
   DRIP investors automatically have their stock dividend applied
to the purchase of more shares in a company. Once you have acquired
a share in a company that offers this kind of plan, you can
purchase additional shares directly from the company instead of
going through a broker.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Where can we find ``Kukla, Fran and Ollie'' videos? _
A.C.
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ New Kid Home Video is selling five color videos and
planning 34 more. Current titles are ``Be a Clown, Be a Clown; Get
on the Dragon Wagon; Kukla Discovers America; Madame O's Merry
Musical;'' and ``'Tis the Season to Be Ollie.''
</P>
<P>
   Each video sells for $14.95 plus $4.95 shipping and handling. To
order, call (800) 309-2392 or write to Box 10443, Beverly Hills, CA
90213-3443.
</P>
<P>
   The original ``Kukla, Fran and Ollie'' TV series ran from 1947
to 1957 and was followed by specials, guest appearances and live
performances through the early 1980s. The show was improvised by
puppeteer Burr Tillstrom and actress Fran Allison.

   Q:.MDNM/ What does the ``WG'' on a Copenhagen tobacco can stand
for? A colleague claims it is short for ``with glass'' because the
product contains ground-up fiberglass to cut the mouth and ensure
fast absorption. _ P.D., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ The insignia is actually ``WC'' and stands for
``Weyman's Copenhagen,'' according to manufacturer U.S. Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Weyman was the founder of Copenhagen in 1822,'' said

HOW NOT TO BE A ZOMBIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1977 film ``Telefon,'' dozens of otherwise ordinary Good
Guy citizens were secretly hypnotized and brainwashed by the Bad
Guys. They lived and worked among their fellow Good Guys for months
or years. Then one day, a simple telephone call from the Bad Guys
triggered these pre-programmed Good Guys to stop whatever they were
doing and, like zombies, to start attacking military bases and
assassinating their own leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It is a brilliant science fiction concept, so brilliant, in
fact, that it has been copied by computer hackers in the recent
wave of attacks against well-known Internet commerce companies like
Yahoo, Amazon.com, eBay, Buy.com, E-Trade and CNN.com.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds, maybe thousands, of Good Guy computers were secretly
programmed by the Bad Guys to use their Internet connections to
attack prominent Web sites like Amazon. Instead of a telephone
call, the trigger was the sending of a packet or two of information
over the Internet, along the lines of ``attack Yahoo today from 2
p.m. to 4 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   The targeted sites were knocked off line for a few hours, long
enough to make the point that hackers still rule the Internet.
Hackers ruled the Net long before Amazon sold its first book, and
the recent attacks served notice that they can shut down parts of
the Internet any time they choose. While Amazon and other
electronic commercial sites were the targets this time, next time
it could be the eastern United States, a big bank, an Internet
service provider or the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Common wisdom has it that ordinary computer users are unlikely
to be attacked by hackers, when there are so many high-profile
targets on the Internet. Why, after all, should a hacker bother
with my pathetic little Quicken files when so many big companies
store thousands of their customers' credit card files in vulnerable
databases?
</P>
<P>
   But as last week's attacks made clear, the fashion among hackers
appears to be attacking the little guys and secretly using their
computers as launching points for bigger, coordinated attacks on
the big companies.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that there are software tools available, some
of them free, to reduce the likelihood that Bad Guy hackers will
break into your home computer, infect it and turn it into a
``Telefon''-like zombie.
</P>
<P>
   Cable modem and DSL connections are particularly vulnerable, in
part because they are persistent connections, keeping the computer
online for hours or days at a time. That makes them sitting ducks
and greatly increases the odds that a hacker trolling for open
connections will find your computer. Dial-up connections to the
Internet typically last only a few minutes or hours, which means
that a hacker would have to be very lucky to scan your computer
when it was online. But because the scanning tools used by hackers
work so quickly, even dial-up systems are at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Short of turning off your cable or DSL machine, here is how
hackers work and how to protect yourself:
</P>
<P>
   The ``Telefon''-type attack, which is technically known as the
distributed denial of service attack, begins with a Bad Guy hacker
using one of several commonly available (in the hacker underground,
at least) automated scanning tools that sweep across the Internet
looking for connected machines that have some sort of
vulnerability. Vulnerabilities include things like an open
connection port used for tasks like sharing files or printers on a
network, serving Web pages to customers or even for browsing Web
pages.
</P>
<P>
   It is the digital equivalent of a burglar walking through a
neighborhood jiggling doorknobs to see which ones are unlocked,
except that the scanning tools allow a hacker to jiggle tens of
thousands of doorknobs an hour.
</P>
<P>
   A harmless but scary way to get an idea of what the hacker sees
when he (or she) scans your computer is to visit Steve Gibson's
excellent ShieldsUP! Web site (www.grc.com). Visitors can ask
Gibson's scanners to probe their machines for open ports and other
security leaks, like the name of the computer user, the name of the
computer itself and the name of the network connection.
</P>
<P>
   Once the scanner program finds a vulnerable computer, the hacker
can insert a malicious program onto the victim's hard disk (or copy
unprotected files from the hard disk, but that may not be as
interesting unless you have files with names like ``Passwords to
the FBI Computer Network'' or ``My Swiss Bank Accounts''). The
detection and insertion process takes just a few seconds, if there
are no annoying safeguards like anti-virus programs or password
protection schemes, which, although not foolproof, provide
additional safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   The malicious program is instructed to hide in the computer and
lie dormant until a future date, which can be months away, long
enough so the intruder's trail goes stale.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent attacks, the zombies were mostly running the
Solaris operating system, but they just as easily could have been
Windows, Macintosh, Linux or other Unix machines. The
vulnerabilities are essentially the same.
</P>
<P>
   When the trigger call arrives from the Bad Guys, as it
apparently did last week, hundreds of compromised computers
simultaneously start their attacks against one or more target
sites. The target site computers are suddenly overwhelmed by a
torrent of bogus requests for information and are typically forced
to shut down. Imagine a million people telephoning your house from
pay phones for a couple of hours, and you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web sites can detect and block a denial of service assault
from a lone computer, but when hundreds of distributed computers
gang up on them in a surprise attack, there is no effective
defense, at least not at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the system administrators can trace the attacks, what
they find is merely another victim _ the zombie computer, not the
evil master.
</P>
<P>
   There are steps a computer user can take to discourage hackers
and still enjoy the many benefits of using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   First, make sure your anti-virus program is up to date. It
cannot stop hackers from breaking into your computer, but it can
detect the most common Trojan Horse programs that the hackers may
try to install on your system.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then, go back to Steve Gibson's ShieldsUP! Web page and, after
non-invasively testing your own security settings, read his
excellent tutorial on computer security. It tells how to disable
the standard Windows settings that enable two or more Windows
machines to share files and network resources. They aren't needed
unless you run a network in your home.
</P>
<P>
   File and Printer Sharing opens a port on your machine that is
especially popular among hackers. But there are more than 65,000
ports on your machine, and guarding them all calls for a software
firewall.
</P>
<P>
   A software firewall inspects all the Internet traffic coming
into your computer and blocks unauthorized packets of information.
There are several that are designed for home computer users, and,
given the scariness of these new hacker attacks, more will be
arriving soon.
</P>
<P>
   These programs include two that I've tested, BlackIce Defender
($40 from Network Ice, www.networkice.com), and Norton Internet
Security 2000 ($55 from Symantec, www.symantec.com).
</P>
<P>
   But my favorite is a free program called ZoneAlarm 2.0, which
can be downloaded as a 1.5 megabyte file from www.zonelabs.com. It
was introduced just a few weeks ago, but it appears to be the
easiest and most comprehensive personal firewall and computer
security program for Windows PC users.
</P>
<P>
   ZoneAlarm allows even nontechnical users to lock down possible
security vulnerabilities, and it pops up an alert when someone
tries to scan your system. The program alerted me to probe attempts
within minutes after I installed it.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, ZoneAlarm also monitors the programs on your
computer to see which ones _ legitimately or not _ are trying to
send information back out to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Along with an anti-virus program, personal firewall software may
soon become required safety equipment on your personal computer.
</P>

 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many craftsmen have a favorite hammer or other hand tool that
was purchased many years ago or one that was inherited from a
relative.
</P>
<P>
   Older tools are apt to have traditional wooden handles fashioned
from hickory. The main problem with wooden handles is that with
rough use, they can crack, split or break. It is unsafe to use a
hammer _ or any tool _ with a damaged handle. The only way to
salvage the tool is by replacing the handle.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing a hammer handle is not a difficult task, but first you
must remove the old handle. Begin by sawing off the damaged handle
just below the base of the hammerhead. Use a punch to drive the
remaining portion out of the ''eye.'' If this piece is firmly
wedged in and proves difficult to punch out, use a power drill to
bore out as much wood as possible, then punch out the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Some do-it-yourselfers try to burn the wood out of the head with
a torch. This is not a good practice because it will destroy the
temper of the steel.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to buy a replacement handle. These are
available in hardware stores, lumberyards and home centers. Even
though most stores stock one or two common handle sizes, it's still
a good idea to take along your hammerhead to check the fit.
</P>
<P>
   When you buy a new handle, you should also get two metal wedges
as part of the package.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the new handle by clamping it in a vise between blocks
of scrap wood and cutting two slots across the top with a back saw.
The slots should be about two-thirds of the hammerhead's depth.
Drive the head onto the handle. If the handle is too large to
accommodate the head, use a file to remove some wood, but don't
overdo it; the handle must fit tightly.
</P>
<P>
   After tapping the head onto the handle as far as it will go, cut
off any projecting wood so that the shaft is flush with the top of
the head.
</P>
<P>
   Next place the hammer in a 150-degree oven for an hour. This
will dry and season the wood thoroughly and assure a tight-fitting
handle.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, drive the two metal wedges into the slots that you
previously cut into the shaft. Tap each wedge alternately to spread
the wood evenly in the eye. File the handle flush with the top of
the head. Finish by sanding lightly then brushing on a coat of
linseed oil to protect the exposed wood.
</P>
<P>
   The same technique can be used to replace an ax or hatchet
handle. One difference in replacing an ax handle is that there is
only one metal wedge; the other is wood. Cut the slots to receive
these wedges at right angles to each other. The wooden wedge, which
is the larger of the two, is driven first into the slot cut across
the long axis of the handle top. Drive the metal wedge into the
other, smaller slot.
</P>
<P>
   Finish the job by filing the top of the handle flush with the ax
head, then sand and coat it with linseed oil.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing a broken shovel handle is a little more difficult
because the old handle is usually riveted in place. In addition,
the new handle usually must be cut to length and the end shaped to
fit the shovel socket. Part of the old handle will be riveted into
the shovel socket, so you will have to remove the rivet before you
can pull that piece out. Use a small grindstone chucked into an
electric drill to grind off the rivet head. Then drive the rivet
out with a hammer and punch.
</P>
<P>
   If the handle stub is broken off near the rim of the socket,
there may not be enough wood projecting to grip the stub and pull
it out. Try driving a three-inch wood screw into the handle stub.
Clamp the head of the screw in a vise and hit the shovel shoulder
with a mallet. This should drive the shovel away and leave the
handle stub and screw in the vise.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a new shovel handle at a home or garden center. Use the
assembled pieces of the old handle to determine the length of the
new one. The end of the new handle must be filed to a taper so it
can fit into the shovel socket.
</P>
<P>
   Again, use the old handle stub as guide to see how much material
you will have to shave off.
</P>
<P>
   When the taper is correct, fit the handle into place, then tap
it on the end to drive it home. Locate the rivet hole in the shovel
socket and drill a pilot hole into the handle. Drive a round-head
wood screw to secure the handle in the shovel.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I want to hang some vinyl wallcovering on my kitchen walls.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the homes I've seen, the electric outlet plates are
covered with the same decorative wallcovering so that they are
hardly noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Is this something an amateur like me can do, and if so, are
there any suggestions or tips you can offer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although simple to do, it does require some care and patience
if you want the pattern on the outlet plate to match the pattern
around it.
</P>
<P>
   Start by cutting out a piece of the wallcovering a few inches
bigger than the size of the outlet plate, but cut this piece out of
a section where the pattern approximately matches the section where
the electric plate is located.
</P>
<P>
   Hold this piece of material against the wall and hold the outlet
plate against it, moving the pattern around until the small piece
of material matches the pattern around it.
</P>
<P>
   Mark the corners of the plate on the piece of wallcovering by
using a pin or ice pick, then lay the piece of wallcovering face
down and cover the back of it and the front of the wall plate with
adhesive.
</P>
<P>
   Paste the wallcovering over the plate, making sure the pin
perforations in the corner exactly match the corners of the outlet
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Then cut off the four corners of the wallcovering at a diagonal
and use a razor blade to cut two diagonal lines across the material
covering each opening in the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Fold the flaps created into the holes so the material sticks to
the back of the plate, then wrap the excess around all four sides
of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Each time I flush my toilet there is an inch or two of water
left in the bowl. As a result the paper and solid waste does not
always get flushed away with just the one flush.
</P>
<P>
   The tank fills up OK, but a plumber I called said he had no
solution. Can you suggest what the problem might be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sounds as though there is not enough water coming into the
bowl with each flush.
</P>
<P>
   This usually means that the water level inside the tank is not
high enough when the tank is full.
</P>
<P>
   All toilet tank ballcocks (inlet valves) can be adjusted to
regulate the height of the water in the filled tank, so try
adjusting this valve to make the tank fill up to a higher level
than you have now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The summer cottage I recently bought has ceilings covered
with untreated cedar sheets and there are water stains on these
ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to leave the ceilings untreated if possible, but
can you tell me how to remove the water stains?
</P>
<P>
   A: When you refer to ``cedar sheets'' I assume you mean cedar
plywood _ or wood of some kind. If so, removing the stains would be
almost impossible unless you use a wood bleach.
</P>
<P>
   But this means bleaching all the wood, not just the stained
areas. Otherwise you would end up with a blotchy appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you do bleach the entire ceiling, chances are that the
overall color would not be uniform unless you applied a stain or
sealer of some kind.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The varnished woodwork in my old house had an overall blond
color that showed the wood grain.
</P>
<P>
   I used a remover to take off all the varnish, but now it still
shows the white stain in some places but not in others.
</P>
<P>
   I like the original blond effect and want to restore this with a
white stain, but am not sure what to do about the uneven appearance
of the present woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   I tried applying a white stain, but it hid the grain in some
places and not in others.
</P>
<P>
   How can I duplicate the original blond or white stain effect?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is likely that when you used the remover you did not get
all of the old varnish off, so that some sections are still at
least partially sealed. In these places the stain cannot soak in.
</P>
<P>
   I think you need to go over these sections with another heavy
coat of varnish remover, using a semi-paste heavy duty type that
will work longer and do a better job of stripping down to the bare
wood.
</P>
<P>
   Then you should be able to get the effect you want by using a
white stain and wiping only part of it off to show the grain.
</P>
<P>
   Allow this to dry, then apply your varnish.
</P>

AFRICAN-AMERICAN SITES LOOK BACK AND FORWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIC V. COPAGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sepia-colored words are evenly spaced and have a
schoolmarm's pedantic forward tilt. Looking at the letter quickly,
you might think it a recounting of a debutante's ball, not the
correspondent's matter-of-fact telling of being sold five times in
as many years, and the hope that her current owner will buy her
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was written by Vilet Lester in August 1857 and can be
found in an online archive of 19th-century letters from
African-American women. Brought face to face with it on your
computer screen, you are suddenly confronted with the smells,
sounds and mossy humidity of history.
</P>
<P>
   It's paradoxical that at a time when there is so much talk of a
digital divide, there are an unprecedented number of resources for
black history online.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 9-year-old daughter needed `Up From Slavery,' by Booker T.
Washington, and we just downloaded it,'' said Bianca Floyd, a
writer who has done research for The Chronicle of Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
   F. Leon Wilson, who is writing a book called ``Black Pioneers of
the Internet,'' said: ``Web sites are collecting information that
is not available through formal textbooks because they are not up
to date. The Web is allowing students to tap into this new
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens and enlightens a whole new discussion, not just for
African-Americans, but for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   There are online resources available for the scholar and the
schoolchild. They include photographs and documents, like the
slave's letter, that at one time were confined to musty libraries,
perhaps many miles from the inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the resources were previously available only to those
affiliated with a college or university.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd lauded the exponential growth in black historic Web sites
and credited academics for making information available. ``The
scholarly community should be commended,'' Floyd said. ``Many don't
get paid to put the information online. They just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some important caveats regarding the use of the
Internet to search for information on black history, Floyd added.
``For instance, you can't just use a search engine and type in
`black women,''' she warned. ``You are likely to get all these
links to pornographic sites and links to racist Web sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd said that when she was helping her young daughter, she
started with institutions like Duke University, the University of
Pennsylvania, the University of California at Los Angeles and
Harvard, which link to one another and other reliable sources.
``That way, you avoid the crackpots,'' she said.

   Lee D. Baker, an associate professor of anthropology and
African-American studies at Columbia University, cautioned against
certain sites that were ``on the edge in terms of legitimacy,''
like those put online by amateur history buffs. He also recommended
starting with academic sites as a way of finding reliable
information.

   Mystery by Night
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am originally from the Philippines, and one of my fondest
memories was going home after a long day at work. I knew that by
the time I reached my place, I would be able to smell the very
fragrant Dama de Noche (Lady of the Night). I am referring to a
flowering plant that blooms at night and emits a very strong, sweet
fragrance. The flowers are white and five-pointed like little
stars, and they appear in clusters. I haven't found it here in the
United States. Do you know anything about this plant and can you
tell me where to find it?
</P>
<P>
   A. The nocturnal timing of the fragrance, wafting over a garden
or through a room, romantic and exotically alluring, gives Cestrum
nocturnum both its botanical and common names. In some cultures, it
has been compared to a picturesque lady of the night, because
Cestrum is unnoticed by day (its small greenish-white, narrow
tubular flowers are closed), heavenly by night and just a pleasant
memory by morning.
</P>
<P>
   Another common name, night-blooming jessamine, leads to
confusion with jasmine, but they are not related. Cestrum belongs
to the nightshade family Solanaceae, along with peppers, tomatoes,
petunias and nicotiana. It is a 12-foot-tall rangy evergreen shrub
in its native West Indies, but Cestrum nocturnum is grown in most
parts of the United States as a houseplant, blooming in the summer
and occasionally on and off later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Cestrum nocturnum is available from Glasshouse Works, P.O. Box
97, Church Street, Stewart, Ohio 45778, (800) 837-2142; and Kartuz
Greenhouses, 1408 Sunset Drive, P.O. Box 790, Vista, Calif. 92085,
(760) 941-3613. Each catalog is $2.
</P>
<P>
   Basement Nursery
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last year, in an effort to improve on my usual method of
growing seedlings in a sunny window, I installed a fluorescent
fixture with grow lights in my basement. The resulting seedlings
were weak. I set a timer for 18 hours of light. Where did I go
wrong? Could the problem be proximity to the oil burner?
</P>
<P>
   A. You were right to move the seedlings into an environment
where the light can be controlled and the day and night
temperatures don't fluctuate wildly. Even the sunniest windows
rarely offer more than a few hours of really bright light each day,
and that doesn't count the losses because of cloudy days or, no
offense intended, a light covering of dust or dirt on the window
glass.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the fluorescent lights on for 18 hours, the
seedlings probably weren't getting enough light. While a
fluorescent light looks bright to us, to a seedling expecting to
bask in the sun, it is a poor substitute. To provide enough light,
use two four-foot-long, two-bulb shop fixtures (available at any
hardware store), suspended just two to six inches above the
seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   Special grow lights aren't magic. Often, there is just a blue
coating on the inside. The overall amount of light is reduced, and
the seedlings think they have sunglasses on. A mix of warm white
and cool white tubes will give the right kind of light, and more of
it.
</P>
<P>
   A small fan is needed nearby to move the air, helping to prevent
fungus diseases and to flex those little seedling stems, enabling
them to grow stronger and thicker, just like going to the gym. But
don't get carried away trying to make little Arnold
Schwarzenpeppers.
</P>
<P>
   Most seedlings like it comfy _ temperatures in the 60s and room
to grow. If they are too crowded, or if that furnace is overheating
them, they will become stretched and spindly. Perhaps they are
trying to grow up quickly and get away.
</P>
<P>
   Buy your seeds now while there are still lots of choices, but
don't start them too early. Look on each package for the right
timing, and mark your engagement calendar.

 &HT;    BILL TO END SOCIAL SECURITY EARNINGS TEST MOVING IN THE HOUSE
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a rare display of unity, a congressional panel
Wednesday unanimously agreed to eliminate the Social Security
earnings test that reduces benefits for workers aged 65 to 69.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be remembered as one of our best days,'' said Rep.
E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., moments before his Social Security
subcommittee approved the bill. ``We're doing the right thing and
doing it in a bipartisan way.''
</P>
<P>
   A House vote could come March 2, after which action would shift
to the Senate, where a similar bill has been sponsored by Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, workers between 65 and 69 are penalized $1 in
benefits for every $3 in earnings above $17,000. The bill would
eliminate that penalty for anyone over the full retirement age,
which will gradually increase to 67 by 2027. About 630,000 workers
would be affected this year.
</P>
<P>
   A provision in the law that penalizes workers who file for early
Social Security benefits between age 62 and 65 by $1 for every $2
earned above $10,080 would remain in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said he expected quick passage in the House, but worried
that the bill could become a vehicle for other Social Security
reforms in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been stymied on any reforms to Social Security for
the past two years as it has struggled with various proposals to
completely overhaul the program, which supports 44 million elderly
Americans and survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Repeal of the earnings test is the first change to Social
Security that shows any sign of becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who called for repeal of the earnings test
two years ago in his State of the Union message, said Monday he
would sign the repeal if Congress sent him a ``clean bill'' without
other provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's panel held a hearing on the bill Tuesday and Wednesday's
action took about 10 minutes, including opening statements and a
staff explanation of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eliminating the earnings penalty is the right thing for
seniors who have spent a lifetime working for their Social Security
benefits,'' Shaw said. ``They should get the benefits they earned
and paid for, regardless of whether they keep working.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would be effective retroactively to Jan. 1,
would cost the Social Security trust fund about $22.7 billion over
10 years, but its long-term impact would be minimal, according to
estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In London, Washington and, most recently, New York,
attendance at the traveling exhibition on Charles and Ray Eames,
the postwar design mavericks, broke museum records. But people
filing by to marvel at their plywood molding experiments _
prototypes that did not cut it and (eureka!) ones that did _ were
unaware that nearly every major American institution had passed up
the chance to buy the Eameses' legacy of furniture invention.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art were
among those that turned it down, leaving the Eames family facing
huge inheritance taxes, the threat of eviction from their offices
and the prospect of selling off the products piecemeal to resale
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cherry-picking would have paid a lot more to the family,''
said Eames Demetrios, the designers' grandson. In 1988, the Vitra
Design Museum in Germany came to the rescue, acquiring 400 Eames
objects. It has gobbled up the estates of the American designers
George Nelson, Harry Bertoia and Alexander Girard, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The preservation movement that routinely takes up arms to
protect buildings of established cultural significance has yet to
take an active role in saving America's modern design legacy. While
any museumgoer can inspect the preliminary studies of great
painters, Donald Albrecht, a guest curator at the National Building
Museum in Washington and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum
in New York, is one of many experts who fear that the lack of
interest in the design process, from objects to blueprints, will
mean a loss of ``intellectual underpinnings, and the context that
explain how our world is put together,'' as well as inspiration for
future generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very shortsighted of American institutions not to be
going after the great designers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Raymond Loewy, the industrial designer who stamped his
streamlined vision on such familiar objects as Greyhound buses and
Lucky Strike packages, died in 1986, his widow auctioned his best
concept drawings in Europe, where they disappeared from view. The
widow of Minoru Yamasaki, the architect of the World Trade Center,
destroyed her husband's papers and drawings when no institute
expressed interest in taking them.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do these things slip away?'' asked David A. Hanks, a
museum adviser in New York. ``It's an ongoing tragedy, because the
public doesn't realize the importance of archives.''
</P>
<P>
   Architects of the predigital generation like Frank O. Gehry,
Richard Meier, Michael Graves and Robert A.M. Stern are filling
storerooms to the I-beams with their prototypes and correspondence
but say they have yet to find serious takers for the accumulations
of their lifeworks. ``It's a big problem,'' said Terence Riley, the
chief curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern
Art. ``The approach in America is all too often helter-skelter.
There ought to be a big national archive of American design.''
</P>
<P>
   The de facto attics for American design have been university
libraries, private European museums, corporate collections,
foundations, government institutions and the Library of Congress,
to which Charles and Ray Eames donated their papers, drawings and
photographic images. But these institutions collect scattershot
only those donations they can afford to preserve and maintain,
squirreling them away for persistent scholars but rarely exhibiting
them for public enrichment. It took the Library of Congress about
10 years to pull together the Eames exhibition, with the help of
Vitra, IBM, the Herman Miller furniture company and the Eames
family. (It opens Saturday at the St. Louis Art Museum.)
</P>
<P>
   The Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles did not express
interest in buying the architectural outpourings of Richard Meier,
even though he designed the Getty Museum. The institute prefers to
collect single projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archives since the postwar period have grown incredibly in
size,'' said Wim de Wit, the head of special collections at the
Getty Research Institute. ``The number of drawings are gigantic.
You'd need warehouses for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, well-financed European institutions are
methodically and aggressively pursuing the creative overflow of
significant living architects and designers, among them the
Netherlands Architecture Institute; the Fonds Regional d'Art
Contemporain, a state-financed archive of art and architecture
outside Paris; and the Royal Institute of British Architects.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal
scooped up the archive of Peter Eisenman and the works of a handful
of other American architects as part of its program to focus
exclusively on projects and people ``who make new proposals to the
international current of ideas,'' said Nicholas Olsberg, chief
curator at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Archives tell the story of the invention process and the
evolution of new ideas, said Stephen VanDyk, who presides over the
archives of Henry Dreyfuss and Donald Deskey, which were donated to
the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see their thinking,'' he said. Dreyfuss, for example,
designed the 20th Century Limited and innovative household
appliances. ``You can look at drawings showing how he made a round
thermostat'' by analyzing rectangular ones already in use and
watching how people handled them, VanDyk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the inventor in him at work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the John Lautner Foundation was established with an
annual budget of just $13,000, gleaned from private donors and
copyright fees. Its goal is to assure that awareness of Lautner,
the iconoclast who designed the Chemosphere House and other Los
Angeles architectural landmarks, will be kept alive through
exhibitions, publications and educational events. (Both the Getty
Research Institute and UCLA made offers that the foundation found
all too easy to refuse.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ultimate goal is to move into a building designed by
Lautner, like the Corbusier Foundation,'' said Frank Escher, the
archive administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Some living architects are more interested in getting top dollar
for their work than wide exposure. Frank O. Gehry thinks he is
sitting on a golden egg.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's worth something it would be nice to get something for
it before I die,'' said the 70-year-old architect, who has
meticulously saved just about everything he has ever produced, from
cardboard chair prototypes to silver-paper models of the Guggenheim
Museum at Bilbao, Spain. He said that work pertaining to an unbuilt
house in Ohio for the patron Peter B. Lewis fills 200,000 square
feet of storage space.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry says he does not know what will happen to his archive. But
Olsberg of the Canadian Center for Architecture said: ``I know
Frank sees it as multiple millions, and it will be. It ought to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Olsberg, whose center asked to buy only the Lewis house
documents, added: ``There are a hundred major architects out there,
and their archives are worth one to three million dollars each.
They all aren't going to find buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The architect Michael Graves has not been approached by the
institutions that are known for going after archives. ``The usual
suspects don't go after me,'' said Graves, whose Tuscan watercolors
at the Max Protetch Gallery in 1979 set off the craze for
collecting architectural renderings. ``My 15 minutes are over. I'm
a dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   His archive is now ``in a warehouse somewhere out on Route 1''
in New Jersey, said Graves, who hopes to make his own home an
archive open to the public, and might possibly donate it to
Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   The Getty Research Institute would be pleased if Richard Meier
donated his materials related to the Getty building that he
designed. But Meier said, ``I would like my things to go to an
institute that would keep them all together and make them
accessible, and not just be a repository.''

   If the value of a design archive is its ability to convey to a
future generation an appreciation for the past _ its design
history, social commentary and labors of love _ then it is perhaps
odd that no institution has pursued the archives of Robert A.M.
Stern, the architect who so acutely represents the nostalgic
yearnings of certain well-to-do Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he plans to give them away. ``One day some
university will see a truck pulling up with all my papers inside,''
said Stern, who is dean of the architecture school at Yale
University.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the question of who is going to get what may be
moot. If the next generation of designers relies on a computer
mouse more than a pencil, its archives will all be stored
digitally, by the gigabyte. Cocktail-napkin doodles will go the way
of celluloid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scary thing,'' said Bernard Tschumi, dean of
architecture at Columbia University. ``We are a generation in
transition.''

PARKS FACE PRESSURE TO BAN OFF-ROAD VEHICLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Feb. 20)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big Cypress National Preserve in Florida, 729,000 acres of
wetlands and sodden stands of cypress in the Everglades, may not
seem to be a likely place for driving through roadless back
country. But it has one of the most active off-road-vehicle
programs in the nation, issuing about 2,000 permits a year to
drivers of sport utility vehicles, airboats, all-terrain cycles and
behemoths known locally as swamp buggies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Swamp buggies, which ride on immense tractor-style tires and can
weigh tons, are especially destructive to the soft soils and
sensitive vegetation in the swamp, ecologists say. As a result, the
National Park Service, which has already closed four areas of the
preserve to vehicles, is drafting a new control plan for the park.
</P>
<P>
   But local environmentalists say the Big Cypress plan does not go
far enough, and at the same time, a national coalition of
environmental groups is pressing the park service to ban off-road
vehicles altogether in the nation's parks to prevent noise,
physical damage, and harm to endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   The damage to Big Cypress is especially severe, making it a case
study for what the environmentalists want to prevent elsewhere. An
aerial study by the University of Georgia found that there are
about 30,000 miles of vehicle tracks in the preserve, which is
nearly as big as Rhode Island, many of them still visible years
after they were created. The study found that as much as 148,000
acres _ more than 10 times the area of Manhattan _ in the preserve,
which is home for endangered panthers, manatees and other species,
have been affected. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The park service's proposal for managing off-road vehicles in
the preserve has been criticized as not being tough enough. It
includes stricter limits on how vehicles are used, how big they can
be, the size of their tires, the noise they can produce and where
they may enter and leave the park. Fees would be raised, and
enforcement of rules would be tougher. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say that the park service should have issued
stricter limits on tire and vehicle size, and should have included
newly acquired land to the zones where off-road use would be
limited. They especially want to protect habitat of the endangered
Florida panther. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say that Big Cypress is not the only park
being damaged by off-road vehicles. In December, 68 organizations
filed a petition with the National Park Service calling for a ban
on off-road vehicles in all the parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Off-road vehicles are killing wildlife, destroying peace and
quiet, polluting air and water, and endangering visitor safety,''
said Russell Long, the executive director of the Bluewater Network,
a project of the Earth Island Institute that is leading the
petition drive. ``Our public lands shouldn't become sacrifice zones
for motorized cowboys to get their kicks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ed Waldheim, the president of the California Off-Road
Vehicle Association, said the idea of a total ban was overreaching
by ``environmental extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are conservationists,'' he said of his group, which he said
maintains trails and educates its members on responsible behavior.
``We want to preserve anything in as natural a way as possible, but
we want to enjoy it, too. And we want to share it with equestrians,
hikers and everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The environmental coalition said that off-road vehicles are used
in 56 of the 108 large national parks it surveyed. Twenty-three
parks permit their use in back-country roads, the survey found. But
rangers in 40 parks reported significant illegal use of the
vehicles, and 38 parks reported serious damage to park resources as
a result.
</P>
<P>
   Many parks are cracking down on the use of off-road vehicles, at
least in very sensitive areas. In November, the park service
proposed a permanent snowmobile ban in the core of Denali National
Park in Alaska. The ban would affect two million acres, but would
not affect most use of snowmobiles in four million acres that were
added to the park 20 years ago, including the popular riding areas
close to roads. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The park service said that snowmobiles hurt air and water
quality with their two-stroke engines, which give off lots of
exhaust that leaches into the water. They also damage soils and
vegetation, disturb animals and interfere with cross-country skiing
and dog-sledding. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The environmental groups contend that the law controlling the
mission of the park service calls on it to leave its resources
``unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations,'' and that
the damage to terrain and wildlife from off-road vehicles does not
meet that test. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Its petition seeks an immediate ban on the use of all-terrain
vehicles, dune buggies, sand buggies and four-wheel-drive vehicles
on all off-road areas in the national park system, including
beaches, primitive trails and back-country roads. The exceptions
would be subsistence use by indigenous people in Alaska,
traditional uses like transportation and hunting, law enforcement,
search and rescue and park administration, and access to private
land within the parks.

 &HT;    The Political Ticker: Some Christian conservative weight to
McCain
 &HT;    EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conservative activist and recent presidential candidate Gary
Bauer endorsed John McCain Wednesday. Speaking at a rally in
Greenville, S.C., Bauer called McCain the GOP's ``best shot'' at
winning the White House in November. Bauer also said McCain wants a
political system that is ``not a money bags democracy, but a system
built on civility and decency and honor.'' In a twofer, McCain also
gained the endorsement Wednesday of California Secretary of State
Bill Jones, who defected from George W. Bush's camp. McCain is
hoping the Bauer endorsement will help with Christian conservatives
in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH'S BANKROLL GOING FAST
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's campaign is spending close to $3 million a
week, a rate that alarms his top fund-raisers and has forced Bush
finance officials to schedule a number of unplanned money-raising
events in the coming weeks. The campaign raised an unprecedented
$70 million, but a spending spree in the early primaries,
intensified with an ad blitz in South Carolina this week, has left
roughly $20 million in Bush's campaign treasury. Bush aides
confirmed Wednesday that he spent a record-setting $50 million so
far. Aides to John McCain said their man has spent about $26
million and had $10 million left in the bank on Jan. 31
</P>
<P>
   TIGHT RACE
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby/Reuters tracking poll of likely Republican voters in
South Carolina, conducted Monday and Tuesday and released
Wednesday, shows George W. Bush slightly ahead but the race still a
statistical dead heat. The poll, with a 4 percentage point margin
of error, gave Bush 43 percent, John McCain 40 percent and Alan
Keyes 4 percent, with 13 percent still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER DEBATE COME AND GONE
</P>
<P>
   Debating familiar differences in sharpened tones, George W. Bush
and John McCain each tried to prove the other guilty of negative
campaigning, without offering Republican primary voters any new
evidence on which to judge their rival bids for the White House.
Again, as in debates before, there were no breakthroughs and no
blunders, nothing apt to change the close, testy campaign for the
primary. Alan Keyes was there, too, denouncing the two
front-running leaders. The ninth installment in the Republican
debate series was Tuesday night in Columbia, S.C., broadcast
nationally by CNN as a ``Larry King Live'' special.
</P>
<P>
   NO ENDORSEMENT FOR PHOTO EDITOR
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes received endorsements today from the Congress of
Racial Equality and Jews for Morality. CNN reported that CORE
Chairman Roy Innis blasted the New York Times and the Daily News
for choosing South Carolina debate photos for today's editions
where Keyes is not visible. Keyes is the only African-American
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   THE POLITICS OF HEATING ASSISTANCE
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley's campaign released a document alleging New Yorkers
were ``left out in the cold'' when the Clinton administration
released federal emergency heating assistance through the Low
Income Home Energy Assistance Program. The document shows New
Hampshire residents got an infusion of assistance Jan. 26, a week
before the state's primary, while New York, which holds its primary
March 7, got its largest chunk of money Feb. 10. ``The timing is
interesting,'' Bradley said. ``I realize I'm running against
entrenched power,'' and part of entrenched power is helping a
favored candidate.
</P>
<P>
   POINTING THE CANNONS AT BOTH TARGETS
</P>
<P>
   John McCain's surge has unsettled some prominent Democrats, who
worry that his compelling biography would overshadow his
conservative record and find broad appeal among Democrats and
independents in a general election. As a sign of that concern, Al
Gore has moved from castigating only George W. Bush and begun
concentrating on McCain. According to the New York Times, some
Democrats close to the White House, who for months had been bracing
for a contest against Bush, have begun in recent days quietly
putting out negative information about McCain's record.
</P>
<P>
   MORE THAN JUST ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   John McCain tried to bolster his anti-abortion credentials in
the face of criticism from abortion foes that he isn't zealous
enough. At a question-and-answer session with several hundred
voters in South Carolina, McCain touted his ``17-year pro-life
voting record'' in Congress. But he also sought to change the
discussion by urging all Republicans, Democrats and independents to
go beyond single-issue voting to weigh his ``vision for the future
of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK ADS WITHOUT THE ATTACKS
</P>
<P>
   Now that John McCain has sworn off negative advertising, he's
making sure voters know it. ``John McCain has elevated the race for
the presidency back to where it should be,'' says a man in a radio
ad in South Carolina. The ad doesn't mention that less than a week
ago McCain was tossing as much mud as his opponent _ and George W.
Bush wants voters to remember that. Bush is continuing to air ads
that go after McCain, including one that says: ``Politics is tough,
but when John McCain compared me to Bill Clinton and said I was
untrustworthy, that's over the line.''
</P>
<P>
   `E-PRESIDENT' LESS THAN E-LECTRIFYING
</P>
<P>
   His supporters have said he would be ``the e-president,'' but in
the latest lap of the race for Silicon Valley's campaign
contributions, Al Gore ran dead last. A Cox Newspapers computer
analysis of Federal Election Commission records shows that in the
last quarter of 1999, Bill Bradley led all candidates in that
high-tech battleground of Silicon Valley's 25 cities, as follows:
Bradley, $108,225; George W. Bush, $48,208; and John McCain,
$42,906. Gore, who has bragged about his role in developing the
Internet, trailed with $35,415. For all of 1999, Bradley also came
in first, raising $617,475, compared to $574,476 for Bush, $302,095
for Gore and $84,696 for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   CROSSOVER PROTEST IN MICHIGAN
</P>
<P>
   Some black leaders in Detroit are urging the city's largely
Democratic residents to vote for John McCain in the Michigan
primary Tuesday to embarrass Gov. John Engler, a staunch supporter
of George W. Bush. The Rev. Wendell Anthony, president of the
Detroit chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, and state Rep. LaMar Lemmons III said Engler had
not supported moves to help Detroit retain its tax base. Michigan
Democratic caucuses are in March.
</P>
<P>
   BUT WHAT IF MCCAIN'S SUPPORTERS ARE DIE-HARDS, TOO
</P>
<P>
   The George W. Bush campaign is a little worried about
fair-weather friends of John McCain; namely, the independents and
crossover Democrats who might come out in large numbers in the
Saturday primary to vote for McCain, especially if the weather's
nice. Bush's people are hoping the predicted rain Saturday will
come to pass, keeping many McCain supporters home while die-hard
Republicans flock to vote for Bush in conditions fair or foul.
``We've been conjuring up some rain dances,'' said Heath Thompson,
Bush's state director.
</P>
<P>
   TROOPER WAS A REAL TROUPER
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina state trooper who pulled over John McCain's
campaign bus last week just so he could meet him was worried he
would lose his job because of it. Trooper Michael O'Donnell stopped
the McCain bus on its way to Charleston, but the senator was on
another bus headed to Columbia. The unconventional roadside stop
caused some consternation in the state. Department of Public Safety
Department spokesman Sid Gaulden said someone from McCain's staff
called and urged that O'Donnell not be fired, but said that played
no role in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   SOMEBODY'S WATCHING
</P>
<P>
   What the Rev. Floyd Flake, an ex-Democratic congressman, said at
his Allen A.M.E. Church in Queens, N.Y., Sunday was: ``I don't do
endorsements from across the pulpit, because I never know who's out
there watching the types of laws that govern separation of church
and state. But I will say to you this morning, and you read it
well. This should be the next president of the United States.'' He
was referring to Al Gore, who was in the church. But Americans
United for Separation of Church and State went ahead and filed a
complaint with the IRS, charging Flake with knowingly violating tax
laws.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET PRIMARY COULD CRASH
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Democrats are struggling to save their plan to hold the
nation's first Internet presidential primary. The party faces
several hurdles, including a lawsuit alleging that voting by
computer would discriminate against minorities and the poor. It
also has yet to receive federal approval of its March 11 primary or
support from all three state universities, which have about 100,000
potential student voters with generally easy access to computers.
State Democrats also need approval from the Justice Department
because of past violations of the Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   A DIFFERENT VOICE OF JOURNALISM
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one publication that is all but shouting its
hostility toward John McCain: World magazine, a little-known, North
Carolina-based newsweekly for evangelical Christians. In a scathing
article and sidebar, World, which claims a subscription-based
circulation of 109,000, attacks McCain and the media that it says
adore him. The cover article on McCain was written by Bob Jones IV,
scion of the family that founded the fundamentalist Christian Bob
Jones University. Its editor, Marvin Olasky, has served as an
informal adviser to George W. Bush's presidential campaign and,
according to the New York Times, was one of the inspirations for
Bush's credo of compassionate conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF COMPUTERS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, speaking at Morgan State University in Baltimore,
called for government and industry to work together to give all
households access to the Internet and to help teachers use
technology to improve instruction. He was vague about how he would
turn his ambitious technology agenda into reality, and his aides
said later that he would rely on relatively modest amounts of
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   A TIP FROM TIPPER
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore journeyed into the heart of Bill Bradley territory _
New Jersey _ and collected almost $55,000 for her husband's
campaign. Speaking at a Princeton country club, she ``skimmed
over'' her husband's positions on health care and education, said
the Newark Star-Ledger, while touting his endorsement from the
National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. Tipper
Gore suggested that the next president may be able to appoint three
to five Supreme Court justices.
</P>
<P>
   THE DOCTOR IS IN
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley told about 150 health care workers at Brooklyn
Hospital Center in New York that his health care proposals are
realistic and affordable. Bradley's aides tried to draw attention
to a new study by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, which
they said showed that Al Gore's health plan would neglect about
715,000 low-income adults in New York. Gore's plan would continue
Medicaid, which does not cover healthy childless adults; Bradley's
would provide subsidies for those people to get insurance.
</P>
<P>
   BIG LABOR PUSH IS ON
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO said it would spend more money than ever before to
help elect worker-friendly candidates to the White House and
Congress, and would devote more resources to mobilizing volunteers.
At the labor federation's winter meeting in New Orleans, president
John Sweeney said trade unions would focus on races in 71 swing
congressional districts and on electing Al Gore for president.
</P>
<P>
   NO STADIUM NAMING RIGHTS, EITHER
</P>
<P>
   Larry King apparently doesn't allow free advertising. Six huge
signs promoting the sponsor of the Republican presidential debate,
the South Carolina Business and Industry Political Education
Committee, had been set up as TV backdrops for the 1 1/2-hour
debate in Columbia on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' But they were
removed and replaced with wordless signs showing images of the
American flag.
</P>
<P>
   ALL KINDS OF SURPRISES LURK IN FAMILY HISTORIES
</P>
<P>
   John McCain's ancestors owned as many as 52 slaves on their
plantation in Mississippi, campaign officials confirmed Tuesday.
``I did not know that,'' McCain said, after being shown
documentation by reporters for Salon, an online magazine. Salon
gathered documents from the Carroll County, Miss., area, including
slave schedules from 1860 that list ``W.A. McCain'' as the owner.
McCain declared the information ``fascinating,'' and a surprise
because he had always pursued his family history through the
military. He said he knew, for example, that William Alexander
McCain had fought in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   BUT BRADLEY GOT THERE FIRST
</P>
<P>
   Splitting from President Clinton, Al Gore said he would not have
nominated Bradley Smith, a Republican who opposes the overhaul of
the campaign finance system, to the board of the Federal Election
Commission, and that he would urge the Senate to reject the
president's nomination. Clinton nominated Smith as a concession to
Republicans in order to advance his judicial nominees who have not
been confirmed. But Bill Bradley said last Saturday the
administration was making ``a major retreat on campaign finance
reform'' by naming Smith.

WANT THAT HOUSE TO SELL? CAST A SPELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barrie Dolnick has a spell to eradicate most household
nuisances, such as poltergeists and bad energy fields that lurk
behind major appliances. She also has them for houses that won't
sell and for major holidays. There are enchantments that will
infuse a room with coziness or playfulness or ease the tension.
</P>
<P>
   Dolnick has written several books on spells, one for love,
another for success, and now ``Simple Spells for Hearth and Home:
Ancient Practices for Creating Harmony, Peace and Abundance''
(Harmony Books, $18 hardcover).
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't offer a firm explanation for how spells work, but it
seems that they somehow transport your prayers and wishes into a
realm where anything can happen. It just takes a leap of faith on
your part to ask for what you want,'' writes Dolnick, who even has
a spell that will help with concentration and studying. It requires
a house plant, a sprig of rosemary, a glass of water and a blue
candle. Most of Dolnick's spells require sources for fire, water
and earth.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's your heart's desire to sell your house. Dolnick
calls upon Vesta, the Roman goddess of hearth and home for the
house-selling spell.
</P>
<P>
   Dolnick says invoking these spells will not make you a reborn
pagan; instead, they are acknowledgments, celebrations and remedies
that can incorporate your religious affiliations. Spells are not
about casting power over a person or a room, they are for making
the best experience possible.
</P>
<P>
   SPELL FOR ATTRACTING THE RIGHT HOME BUYER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a Friday during a waxing moon and in the second hour after
sunset, light a pink candle and a green candle. Place some pink
flowers in a vase with water.
</P>
<P>
   Say aloud: I ask for Vesta's blessing and for the cosmos to lend
its gentle hand in sending me the right buyers for this property. I
release my control and fear around making this sale. On this day of
Venus power, I ask that people of right hearts and minds find
connection to this space and that these walls will be filled again
with love, life and connection to mystery and miracle. I trust in
this process and affirm that I receive the right price in the right
time. For the greater good, I say, so be it. And so it is.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, light the candles when prospects come to see your
house. Refresh the flowers in the vase as needed, keeping fresh
flowers in the house during the selling period.

   TESTS FOR 'AT RISK' ELDERLY DRIVERS
</P>
<P>
   1. Walk along a 10-foot strip of masking tape while being timed.
(Measures mobility and balance.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Sit in a chair. Raise one arm all the way up. Lower it and
raise the other arm all the way up. (Measures mobility.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Sit in a chair with feet on the floor. Turn around and read a
cardboard clock held behind driver. (Measures upper body mobility.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Sit in a chair with loose-leaf notebook binder between feet.
Tap right foot on one side of binder and then on the other side 10
times while being timed. (Measures leg mobility.)
</P>
<P>
   5. A volunteer gives driver three easy words to repeat and
remember. Later in the test the driver will be asked to recall the
words. (Measures memory.)
</P>
<P>
   6. The driver is shown a wide strip of paper with various
geometric symbols such as a triangle and a square. The driver is
asked to identify the symbols without turning his or her head.
(Measures vision and scanning ability.)
</P>
<P>
   7. The driver is shown a sheet of paper. At the top is a
geometric figure. Beneath it are several incomplete figures. The
driver is asked to pick which of the incomplete figures would match
the top figure if the lines were filled in. This is repeated 10
times. (Measures visual perception and spatial relationships.)
</P>
<P>
   8. The driver is shown a computer screen with a group of
randomly placed dots with letters and numbers. The driver is asked
to tap them in order 1-A, 2-B, 3-C, etc. Then the driver is asked
to do the same thing on a computer screen where the dots are
displayed over a video of typical roadside scenery. (Measures
divided and selective attention.)
</P>
<P>
   9. The driver is asked to identify figures displayed with high
contrast and low contrast. (Measures vision, particularly night
vision.)
</P>
<P>
   10. The driver looks at a computer screen and is shown a
flashing picture of a car or truck in the middle and another
vehicle at some point on the periphery of the screen. The driver
must identify whether the vehicle in the middle was a car or truck
and where the other vehicle was on the periphery. (Measures useful
field of vision.)

 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SILVER SPRING, Md. _ Naomi Coale sits in a chair and taps her
foot. On the floor in front of her is a loose-leaf binder.
</P>
<P>
   She touches the floor on one side of the binder. Tap.
</P>
<P>
   She picks up her foot, crosses the binder, and touches the floor
again. Tap.
</P>
<P>
   Coale, an 81-year-old resident of Leisure World, a seniors
community north of Washington, D.C., is taking a test. It's a test
that might save her life, and yours.
</P>
<P>
   She's part of a $10,000 multi-year study to determine whether
there are tests that can determine which elderly drivers may be a
risk on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Age itself is not the issue,'' said Dr. Robert L. Raleigh, 74,
a physician who is chief of the Medical Advisory Board and director
of driver safety research for the Maryland Motor Vehicle
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the issue is, how does any individual change regarding
those capabilities that potentially impair their ability to drive
safely?'' Raleigh said. ``Impaired driving is a public health
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Since November 1998, more than 3,000 drivers age 50 and older
have taken the battery of 10 tests. The tests focus on visual,
perceptual and memory attributes that have a relation to driving.
</P>
<P>
   Because administering the full battery of tests would take too
long and be too costly for motor vehicle departments to do, Raleigh
is hoping his tests will identify one or two quick tests that might
help identify which drivers need more in-depth testing.
</P>
<P>
   Participation in the tests, which take about 15 minutes, is
voluntary. The results of each driver's test are confidential and
are not used to restrict any individual driver's license. However,
therapists and doctors who are experts in dealing with the elderly
review the results with the participants and may recommend
curtailing some driving or getting remedial help such as physical
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland is the only state conducting the study on behalf of the
Federal Highway Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the tests will be analyzed and then
cross-referenced against accident reports for the next several
years to determine whether any of the tests could be used as a
predictor for future accidents.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the foot-tapping test measures the time it takes to
move from a gas pedal to a brake pedal. Drivers who have difficulty
performing this function may have difficulty applying the brake.
</P>
<P>
   Another test involves a participant sitting forward in a chair
and then turning just his upper torso to look at a cardboard clock
held by a volunteer behind him. Drivers who cannot turn around far
enough to see vehicles behind them may be involved in more
accidents changing lanes than those who can turn around.
</P>
<P>
   Once it is determined which tests are helpful, Raleigh hopes
doctors will use them to advise their elderly patients about
possible remedies, such as exercises that improve mobility, or
possible driving restrictions, such as not driving at night or on
major roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Screening people for cancer and heart disease and getting them
to treatment may lengthen their time,'' Raleigh said. ``Screening
for fitness to drive is the same as screening for cancer and heart
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Raleigh expects doctors may notify motor vehicle
departments of patients who have problems. In December, the
American Medical Association passed a resolution requiring doctors
to report patients who refuse to restrict their driving or get help
for potential driving problems.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA decided that the public health responsibility to report
dangerous drivers outweighed the physician's oath of patient
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Whether motor vehicle departments decide to use the tests to
screen elderly drivers and restrict their licenses has not been
determined, Raleigh said. Using his tests might allow officials to
tailor restrictions to the needs of elderly drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal, literally, is how do we keep people on the road as
long as they're safe?'' Raleigh said. ``A lot of people think of
MVA as a place where you get your license taken away. We're asking,
'is there a remediation potential so that if they get treatment
they can come back and we still license them?' ``
</P>
<P>
   After completing her tests, Coale waits to talk to an
occupational therapist about the results. She's happy she
participated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very good,'' she said. ``I've limited my
extensive driving for a couple of years. Most of my driving is
around Leisure World and the shopping center.''

JAMES K. POLK DESCENDANT TRACES NOTABLE FAMILY'S HISTORY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (``Polk's Folly: An American Family History''; Doubleday, $29.95) 
 
By FRITZ LANHAM 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you add up the families that have accomplished notable things
in American public life over several generations, you don't get a
large number.
</P>
<P>
   The Adamses and Roosevelts and Rockefellers come to mind. Until
now, few would have put the Polks on the list. But the just
published ``Polk's Folly: An American Family History'' (Doubleday,
$29.95) makes a persuasive case that we should.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: The Polks can claim one president, James K., elected
in 1844. Leonidas LaFayette Polk, a leader in the late-19th-century
agrarian movement, might well have been the second if cancer had
not killed him in 1892.
</P>
<P>
   The family tree groans under the weight of soldiers and
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   There was Leonidas Polk, the Episcopal bishop who became a
skilled and respected Confederate general. His death in 1864, the
result of a well-placed Union cannon shot witnessed, ironically, by
a Polk from the Northern branch of the family, was an enormous loss
to the South's cause.
</P>
<P>
   Leonidas' nephew also was a Confederate general. Later,
officer-rank Polks fought with the American cavalry that chased
Pancho Villa unsuccessfully across northern Mexico and with Gen.
George Patton's Third Army during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Polks have been governors of Delaware and Missouri, the first
lady of Maryland and acting undersecretary of state for Woodrow
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   George Polk III, a pioneering broadcast reporter for CBS, was
murdered under mysterious circumstances in Greece in 1948. Today,
one of the most prestigious awards in journalism is given annually
in his name.
</P>
<P>
   And when Martin Luther King was arrested in Memphis, Tenn.,
shortly before his assassination, he hired Lucius Burch, a
respected local attorney and a Polk on the maternal side. Burch's
long support for desegregation in his hometown was especially
important because the Polks a hundred years before had been
slaveholders and plantation owners in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polk's Folly'' _ the title comes from the tract of Maryland
swamp purchased in 1687 by the first Polk to arrive on American
shores _ is the work of William R. Polk.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Fort Worth, Texas, Polk had a lengthy career as a
professor of Middle Eastern history at Harvard University, where he
earned his doctorate, and the University of Chicago before moving
to the south of France 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Courtly and polished, the 70-year-old author has more of the
Continent than of Cowtown in his manner. But his book began, he
explains, in Texas, with the family stories he heard as a child
from his aged grandmother. Born two years before the outbreak of
the Civil War, Mary Harding Polk was the granddaughter of a man
born before the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the remarkable thing was that with two memories I had the
whole history of the United States laid out for me,'' Polk
explains. ``And I think that's the reason I became a historian. I
had this very intimate view of American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Polk told these family stories to his children
and grandchildren. But his published books bore titles like ``The
Arab World Today'' and ``Neighbors and Strangers: The Fundamentals
of Foreign Affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally I decided I would really do something I had never done
before and just bury myself in American history and learn enough to
write this book.''
</P>
<P>
   He delved into public records and the holdings at research
libraries and engaged in ``a tremendous amount of digging in
people's trunks in their attics.'' Before he started he knew
nothing of half the people he ended up writing about.
</P>
<P>
   What struck him most was the ``different America'' this project
opened up for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studying American history, you hear all about people doing
things in Philadelphia and Boston and New York. But the really
interesting things in the early part of the American Revolution
happened out on the frontier,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A year before the Declaration of Independence was drafted in
Philadelphia, nearly a hundred ``declarations of independence''
were drawn up by small groups out in the boondocks. In May 1775 in
North Carolina's Mecklenburg County, for example, the local
equivalent of the Colonial assembly drafted the ``Mecklenburg
Resolves'' and directed two of its members, Col. Thomas Polk and
Dr. Joseph Kenedy, ``to purchase 300 lb. of powder, 600 lb. of
lead, 1,000 flints, for the use of the militia of this county.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What interested me was not genealogy, not just the Polk
family, but the family encapsulated in American history, what they
showed us about the way people lived _ what they ate, how they
dressed, what they slept on, what they were afraid of,'' Polk says.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to tell the story of America through the lives of
one clan.
</P>
<P>
   ``One after another, in every generation, I was able to find
somebody who had been in some interesting activity,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Not every story involves war, politics and other affairs of
state (although most do involve male Polks _ the book devotes
relatively little space to the women of the family). Among the more
colorful offerings are those about the Polks in Texas in the rowdy
post-Civil War period.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there's the story about how Polk's grandfather,
James H. Polk, shot the sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Polk was in Laredo to buy cattle for the stockyard he and his
brother Rufus had established in Fort Worth. In a Laredo saloon, in
a foul mood because whoever was supposed to deliver the cattle
hadn't shown up, Polk made no effort to hide the fact that he was
carrying a large sum of money.
</P>
<P>
   When he went up to his room that night, he expected trouble and
took a spot in the corner instead of on the bed. Sure enough, a
short time later the door quietly opened, and a man holding a
pistol eased himself in. Polk fired. The sheriff dropped. ``Greedy
fellow'' was the only comment from Polk, who apparently suffered no
legal consequences for his deed.
</P>
<P>
   James H.'s contemporary, George Washington Polk, had a big role
in bringing the railroads to West Texas and was on hand to witness
some of the shenanigans of Judge Roy Bean, so-called ``Law West of
the Pecos.'' George Polk told the story of how the judge discovered
$44 and a pistol on the body of a dead man and declared the man
guilty of carrying a concealed weapon, ``fined'' him the $44 and
pocketed the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried first of all to find all these stories and to tell
them but then to be sure that I authenticated them and that I knew
that they'd actually, really happened,'' says William Polk.
</P>
<P>
   What does he think of the most famous Polk, the president?
</P>
<P>
   He laughs and says he was struck by Bill Bradley's comment that
Polk ``was the best president we ever had,'' a statement unlikely
to elicit general agreement among historians.
</P>
<P>
   President Polk had been a protege of Andrew Jackson, serving as
speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and as governor of
Tennessee before winning the White House on the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   He was a workaholic at a time when the presidential staff
consisted of one aide and by convention the chief executive never
closed his office door. (``Gosh, that would have saved us such a
lot of trouble,'' the author quotes his Washington, D.C., friends
as saying, thinking of more recent history).
</P>
<P>
   Everyone from school choirs to frantic office seekers strolled
into the presidential office. Casual passers-by sometimes wandered
in during Cabinet meetings and took a seat.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the major event of his four years was the
Mexican-American War, which resulted in U.S. acquisition of
California and the Southwest. That war was controversial then as
now, but Polk prosecuted it successfully, and when he left office
the country had nearly doubled in size.
</P>
<P>
   William R. gives James K. mixed marks, praising him, for
example, for his tolerance toward the persecuted Mormons. A
slaveholder himself, President Polk also tried to keep the issue of
slavery out of national politics and in this opposed the rising
tide of Southern nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   But the president isn't the author's favorite Polk.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite is his late brother, George Polk III, the CBS
reporter killed in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go into his story a great deal because I'm going to
write another book on him,'' he says. ``That's my next project.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Polk's Folly'' he discusses his brother's death briefly.
Stationed in Greece during the civil war between communist
insurgents and a corrupt, oppressive, right-wing government, Polk,
though no communist sympathizer, had alienated the government by
his reporting. He was murdered in Salonika on May 8, 1948,
becoming, in the words of journalist I.F. Stone, ``the first
casualty of the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the official line was that the communists killed him,
those who have delved into the case over the years have pointed
fingers at the Greek government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm calling the book `The Good American,''' says William Polk,
who was very close to his brother and speaks of him movingly.
</P>
<P>
   William Polk declines to say who he thinks responsible for his
brother's death, but he has ``some pretty firm feelings about it.''
He hopes to get access to long withheld American government
documents that clear up the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty confident I'm going to get to the bottom of
it.''

   ``Letters of the Century: America 1900-1999'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Edited by Lisa Grunwald and Stephen J. Adler &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nonfiction &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dial Press/Random House, $35 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, husband-and-wife journalists Lisa Grunwald
and Stephen J. Adler embarked on an inspired project: putting
together a book filled with other people's mail. What closet voyeur
would be able to resist?
</P>
<P>
   The resulting compilation, ``Letters of the Century,'' provides
an incredibly intimate glance into the soul of the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Writing a personal letter, after all, tends to be a soul-baring
exercise. People put pen to paper to document their most profound
experiences or thoughts, to produce a hard copy of otherwise
intangible images and feelings. More casual and less self-conscious
than words written for publication, private letters resonate with
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the missives in ``Letters of the Century'' are personal.
There are letters written to newspaper editors (Attorney Clarence
Darrow to the ``Chicago Tribune'' and Unabomber Ted Kaczynski to
``The New York Times)'' and letters exchanged by heads of state
(Dwight Eisenhower to South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem).
There are letters passed between people who have never met, and a
couple of famous pseudoletters, such as Martin Luther King Jr.'s
exquisite ``Letter From Birmingham Jail,'' an essay never meant as
a private communication.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the senders and receivers have recognizable names: Elvis
Presley to Richard Nixon, Ayn Rand to Frank Lloyd Wright, Janis
Joplin to her parents, Monica to Bill. But at least as many of the
authors and their intended readers are regular folk: witnesses to
history and barometers of the times they lived in. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   In 1922, a desperate mother of two whose deliveries nearly
killed her writes to birth-control pioneer Margaret Sanger seeking
help: ``I am only 25 now and my two babies are one year and two
years old, and I would have had two more if a good kind doctor had
not helped me ... So I am slowly killing myself ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Cpl. H.W. Crayton sends a letter to the parents of Raymond and
Bedford Hoback after finding Raymond's Bible on Omaha Beach the day
after the 1944 D-Day invasion: ``... You have by now received a
letter from your son saying he is well. I sincerely hope so. I
imagine what has happened is that your son dropped the book without
any notice. Most everybody who landed on the beach D-Day lost
something ...'' In actuality, both Hoback boys had been killed in
action June 6.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous viewer of the TV show ``Ellen'' in 1997 decides to
tell her mother she is gay after the show's lead character comes
out of the closet. ``I totally understand that this will probably
freak you out,'' she writes. ``I thought that writing you a letter
would be easier _ I've always been able to express myself better in
writing anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters by famous writers highlight this collection. Mark Twain
turns a complaint to Western Union into a hilariously deadpan rant.
Dorothy Parker's lengthy 1942 description of the Philadelphia
military enlistment office, written to friend Alexander Woolcott,
(she had accompanied her husband to enlist) paints war's reality in
painfully sharp detail.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many fascinating gems in ``Letters of the Century''
that you'll want to read aloud to just about anyone willing to
listen.
</P>
<P>
   Grunwald and Adler divide their chapters by decade, introducing
each with a laundry list of trivia (''1916: In Fort Worth, Texas, a
doctor advertises efficient cures for `blood poisoning, gonorrhea,
gleet piles, fistula, cancer, night emissions and lost
vitality'.''). They also provide a short introduction to each
letter, placing it in context; occasionally, the explanation is
more fascinating than the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Will the new century leave humanity with letters as fluent and
poetic as the last? As Grunwald and Adler note, the post office
reports that less than 2 percent of all mail sent today is
personal; the telephone has turned many of us into lazy
communicators.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some people have suggested that electronic
mail will revitalize the oft-bemoaned ``lost art of letter
writing.'' Disagree? I look forward to hearing from you _ in
writing, of course. &QL;

 &HT;    SCIENTISTS TO COMPARE RESEARCH AT AAAS ANNUAL MEETING
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of America's largest and arguably most
influential scientific organization meet here Thursday to exchange
descriptions of their research and talk about public policy issues
important to science.
</P>
<P>
   From chocolate to land mines, from honeybees to gorillas, topics
that have attracted the interest of members of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science will be explored in more
than 1,000 research papers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the association's 152nd annual meeting, known
formally as the ``Annual Meeting and Scientific Innovation
Exposition,'' will include seminars and special lectures on topics
ranging from the relationship between science and religion to the
relationship between politics and the U.S. Census.
</P>
<P>
   A special session will give 80 teenaged scientists from
throughout the country a chance to describe their research. They
include a New Jersey youngster's demonstration of a deciphering
technique that he believes makes ``uncrackable'' computer codes
vulnerable and a Georgia student's search for a biological control
of the kudzu vine.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in the last four annual meetings of the
association, sessions will be devoted to scientific consideration
of chocolate. This year's deliberations will be devoted to the
question of whether it's good for you.
</P>
<P>
   Topical lectures will be devoted to topics such as whether
stress makes you sick and believing makes you well, the surgical
history of U.S. presidents, hostile exploitation of biotechnology
and many others.
</P>
<P>
   The AAAS, which likes to be called the ``Triple-A-S,'' was
founded in Philadelphia in 1848 and is among the oldest scientific
societies in America. With more than 143,000 members worldwide, it
is by far the largest.
</P>
<P>
   Details about this year's annual meeting and scientific
innovation exposition are available on the Internet at

GORDON FIGHTS HUMPTY DUMPTY LABEL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAT ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ A lot of people are looking at Chevy's
Jeff Gordon a little bit like he's Humpty Dumpty.
</P>
<P>
   That's because once crew chief Ray Evernham was released to head
up Dodge's racing program last September, Gordon ``had a great
fall,'' and ``all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't
put Gordon back together again.''
</P>
<P>
   So Jeff Gordon will have to do it by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Evernham, a brilliant chassis guy and
organizer who was always one step ahead of the curve, left, Gordon
won two straight races.
</P>
<P>
   But those were in cars left behind by Evernham, and in the final
five races of the year, for the most part, Gordon was a non-factor.
</P>
<P>
   He ran well at the Winston 500 in Talladega, Ala., and was
ging for the win right up to the end. Then, he got hung out
to dry and finished 12th, but again, that was in a car essentially
crafted by Evernham.
</P>
<P>
   Over the final five races, the best Gordon could do was a pair
of 10ths, and the leaders left him behind in the last four.
</P>
<P>
   That has a lot of his detractors smirking as he heads into 2000
and, in the minds of many, into the unknown. Not only is Evernham
gone, so is his pit crew, which deserted to Dale Jarrett. So is Ed
Guzzo, one of the top mechanics on Gordon's team, and so is Bill
Dees, Gordon's chief fabricator. They went with Evernham to Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   The Hendrick organization, with whom Gordon signed a lifetime
contract after Evernham left, has the resources to replace people.
The question is who replaces the leadership Evernham brought to the
table.
</P>
<P>
   By default, Gordon must step into the role. Now a part owner of
his team, Gordon becomes the key decision maker.
</P>
<P>
   He has made moves. Engineer Brian Whitesell, crew chief after
Evernham left, is now team manager and Robbie Loomis, who ran
Richard Petty's two-car operation last year, is the new crew chief.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Evernham loyalists are gone and the new
players are eager to prove, as is Gordon, that this was not a
one-man show.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways it's an advantage,'' Gordon said of the changes.
``You don't want people around second-guessing what's going on. You
don't want people saying `Ray didn't do it that way.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Evernham's imprint is still on this team. When
he left, Evernham said that if Gordon collapsed, then he hadn't
done his job very well, that this team should be able to carry on
without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian does a lot of things the way Ray did them,'' Gordon
said. ``And Robbie has his way of doing things. I think that's
good. You don't want to get stagnant. This sport is constantly
changing, and you always want new ideas, a fresh approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to this level, there's tremendous pressure to
stay there,'' Gordon said. ``Our expectations are high. We still
think we can be competitive. We all want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how to win, we've done it,'' Gordon said. ``We know
what it's like to be on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some unknowns as far as working together, but I really
feel good about the things we did in the offseason, and I really
feel good about the cars we're building,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Something to consider: There has been a lot of complaining from
the Chevy teams at Daytona this week, who feel they are at a
disadvantage to the Fords.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Chevy team has been relatively quiet, Gordon's. They
think they can win the race.

CONSTRUCTING A REAL-LIFE POTATO HEAD

   FACES: THE ULTIMATE COMPOSITE PICTURE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (InterQuest, $49.95; Windows 95 and higher, Mac OS 7.1 or
higher.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to never forget a face. It is another to
reproduce an image of that face, not only the deep-set eyes but the
Roman nose and square chin. But Faces: The Ultimate Composite
Picture offers users a chance to try.
</P>
<P>
   Its makers bill Faces as a game to build observational skills as
well as a crime-fighting tool. It relies on a smorgasbord of facial
components _ eyes, nose, lips, hair, beards, smile wrinkles and
even glasses _ to produce on a computer screen a composite
portrait, similar to those distributed by law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The manual for Faces says, ``Victims and witnesses can actively
participate in the fight against crime, completely revolutionizing
the way subjects are tracked down and identified.'' But the market
for Faces as a game may be limited.
</P>
<P>
   Young children, even would-be Rembrandts, might have difficulty
discerning the fine distinctions in component images, and most
teen-agers would probably be more excited about a role-playing or
an action game. And although fans of television shows like ``Cops''
could presumably create imaginary perpertrators just for fun, it
seems that the novelty of this software would quickly wear off.
Think about how long you might play with a real-life version of
Potato Head.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the interface is well designed and simple to learn. Users
choose a basic head shape. Facial components like noses, eyes and
hairstyles can be displayed on one side of the screen, and users
click on the images to construct a face. The facial features _
almost 4,000 of them _ are from photographs of real people.
</P>
<P>
   Except for their slightly different versions, the component
images have no context. At first glance, for example, 24 pairs of
eyebrows look more like birds flying in a strange formation than
like examples of facial hair with subtle distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   There are subcategories of features to refine a search, like
narrow or deep-set eyes, or noses that are either narrow or hooked
(shown from an angle where you can see the nostrils or not see
them). But there seem to be too few choices for elements like hair
and hats.
</P>
<P>
   Faces also has a section that lets users test their powers of
recall and observation by looking at a pre-drawn face and trying to
reproduce it. Even at a medium skill level, that can be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   With practice, users can learn to study real people more
carefully, discern characteristics in an individual's eyes or mouth
and reproduce an image using the software. But it would take
considerable practice to become good enough to build faces
accurately and quickly: sorting dozens of eyes to select the exact
shape can be tedious.
</P>
<P>
   Once a user gets past throwing together random features,
building a portrait and clicking through different hairstyles to
make funny faces, or even bouncing the portrait's eyebrows up and
down like Groucho Marx's, Faces just isn't that much fun.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential of Faces as a crime-fighting tool, it may
not catch on with law enforcement agencies. The New York City
Police Department hires forensic artists to draw composite
portraits. Their skill is not only in drawing the facial features
of a suspect but in drawing out descriptive details from a witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art of composite drawing is in the understanding and
retrieval of information from the witness,'' said Det. Stephen
Mancusi, who has been a forensic artist with the department for 16
years. It is not important, he said, whether you are recording the
information with a pencil or a computer program.
</P>
<P>
   The Faces software lets users share the files they make. The
manual emphasizes the potential for building a ``huge information
network'' of composite portraits and personal data. Each portrait a
user builds has a string of identifying numbers that can be sent by
phone or e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   There are also information sheets with places for a physical
description and a description of the ``incident in question,'' and
places to list aliases, occupation, address, port of entry, the
people the individual lives with, type of vehicle, clothing,
weapons and criminal partners.
</P>
<P>
   While law enforcement officials have a reason to collect data on
suspects, the specter of people compiling homemade databases raises
questions about privacy. Civil libertarians would shudder at the
idea of cadres of people passing around software-generated mug
shots of law-abiding people and information about them. You may
shudder, too. How much does your neighbor know about you, anyway?
And do you want him to tell his cousin Fred? &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Some of the most popular computer-based games today are
invitations to grab a joystick and enter exquisitely rendered,
full-color combat zones in which players assume the identities of
superhuman gladiators whose survival depends upon their being able
to turn opponents into canned ham _ without the can.
</P>
<P>
   The games _ generally described as first-person shooter games _
came under a great deal of scrutiny and criticism after news
reports that they were a favorite pastime of at least one of the
teen-agers who went on a murderous rampage last year at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, for the old days of computer games when everything was
black-and-white. No one ever charged the maker of Pong with
hastening the fall of civilization as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   Two new versions of popular games in this gory, heart-thumping
genre were recently released and are showing up on store shelves
side by side: Unreal Tournament and Quake III Arena. Both games are
sequels, but they bear little resemblance to their predecessors,
Unreal and Quake II.
</P>
<P>
   If the criticism that followed the rampage at Columbine affected
game manufacturers, you could not tell by Quake III and Unreal
Tournament. ``It blew over,'' John Carmack, a chief creator of the
Quake series (and its older brothers, Doom and Doom II), said in an
interview this week. ``It comes in cycles, when senators are waving
around their Doom boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Both games wear their amorality on their sleeves. The back story
for Unreal Tournament, which is explained in a stylish opening
video clip, is that in 2291 Earth's leaders begin sanctioning
bloody public exhibitions among brutal deep-space miners to vent
their violent tendencies. Some 50 years later these contests have
evolved into a multibillion-dollar professional league. Game
players are beckoned to compete in the league play ``to crush your
enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are a bit more mysterious in Quake III. Somehow a group
of characters who look like the members of Kiss on steroids show up
to fight monstrous demons in spooky yet spectacular settings.
</P>
<P>
   The play in both games is blazingly fast, thanks to very
powerful game engines. That translates into a lot of shooting and
getting shot at while running, ducking and hiding.
</P>
<P>
   The weaponry used to accomplish this mayhem is varied and coolly
efficient. The packaging for Quake III marvels over a futuristic
handgun ``perfect for close-range and splatter-proof surprise
attacks.'' In addition to single-shot handguns, both games offer
shoulder-held rocket launchers and high-energy plasma guns that
spew a kind of green lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Practically everything in these games goes boom thanks to finely
articulated sound designs that make everything from your own
footsteps as you run for your life to the grunts and groans of the
computer-generated slain and wounded sound bigger than life.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the taunts. Characters in Unreal Tournament speak
fluent macho, taunting faltering players as ``weak'' and dubbing
them with various unflattering locker-room names.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Quake III, Unreal Tournament's game characters are
rendered to look and act like people, not demons. When one of the
characters is killed, the game goes into overdrive to make the
killings as realistic as it can. Small-weapons fire usually drops
opponents where they stand, making them crumble to the ground with
a scream or final moan. Larger weapons, particularly if they are
fired at close range, cause bodies to explode into bloody mush,
sometimes sending heads and limbs ricocheting off walls to the
disquieting sounds of splats and bloody dribbles.
</P>
<P>
   Both games are rated Mature, for players 17 and older. While the
games' computer-generated violence among comic-book-style figures
can't approach the realistic blood and gore confronted by human
actors in popular films like ``Scream 3,'' it does push computer
animation to new heights _ or depths, depending on your perspective
_ in rendering the demise of game characters.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be a mistake to believe that the considerable
technology behind these games is all in the service of more blood
and gore. Both Quake III and Unreal Tournament are packed with
randomizing elements, so that no two scenes _ not even the death
scenes _ play exactly the same. The effect is to make the game's
action seem purely spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   In both games, player scores and status are kept in the borders
of the screen in heads-up displays. But Unreal Tournament adds
convincing detail by putting working LCD read-outs right on
weapons, telling the user how many rockets, for example, are left
in the trusty rocker launcher. Unreal Tournament, my pick for the
more engaging single-player action, also offers little touches like
supplying a marksman's glove whenever a player reaches for a
sniper's rifle.
</P>
<P>
   The games are not easy to play. For the novice, both Unreal
Tournament and Quake III have clever training levels for players.
These should be explored before players take on challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Both games possess exceptional artificial intelligence that can
convincingly animate opponents for single-player modes, but it is
Unreal Tournament's that really shines. In single-player mode,
Unreal Tournament can create the illusion that a player is playing
a team sport. Actually, the game directs the computer to animate
and control groups of virtual players, or bots; one group plays
with the human player and the other does its digital best to defeat
the player and his bots.
</P>
<P>
   Where Quake III truly succeeds is in its multiplayer modes,
where human players get to play other human players on the
Internet. The game's developer, id Software, in particular, seems
to have put most of its efforts into creating an exceptional online
gaming experience. Both games have streamlined the once difficult
and often confusing process of playing online. Quake III's approach
to online multiplayer gaming is quickly becoming an industry
standard among serious online gamers. It offers lots of
frighteningly fast action, richly detailed landscapes and interiors
with sophisticated visual effects like smog and cinematic lighting
without noticeable degradation in its translation to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; How to choose between the games? If characters in Quake III
Arena and Unreal Tournament met one night in a dark alley, I'd have
to put my money on the Unreal warriors. Both games have fighters
with big guns and polygon-rendered muscles, but the Unreal guys
talk more trash.
</P>
<P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inclement weather will expand rapidly across the central Plains
and Mississippi Valley Thursday as a vigorous low-pressure system
moves east from the central Rockies. A broad flow of mild, moist
air from the Gulf of Mexico will glide over a cold air mass farther
north, resulting in a burgeoning area of snow from the east slopes
of the northern Rockies to the central Plains. The snow will become
heavier later Thursday across eastern Nebraska and Iowa. Farther
south where the cold air mass is eroded by the advancing mild air,
a mixture of sleet and freezing rain will glaze surfaces over
northern parts of Kansas and Missouri. The snow and sleet will
streak into the Great Lakes states and northern Ohio Valley
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and some strong thunderstorms will develop during the
midday and afternoon in the increasingly mild, moist air across the
southern parts of the Plains States and Mississippi Valley. Late
Thursday, a jet stream disturbance will streak east over these
regions, heightening the risk of scattered severe thunderstorms and
isolated tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Expansive high pressure will crest across the Northeastern
states bringing chilly conditions with ample sunshine. Clouds will
begin to increase over the interior late Thursday as the storm
system over the nation's mid-section moves east.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, snow will linger along many west-facing slopes from
northern California to central Colorado. Dry weather and ample
sunshine will develop over much of the Pacific Northwest and
northern Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Tornado Season
</P>
<P>
   Tornado season first begins in late winter near the Gulf of
Mexico as strengthening sunlight increases evaporation rates,
providing increasing supplies of moisture for severe thunderstorms.
As spring arrives and Gulf moisture stakes a claim to a larger
area, tornado season begins in earnest from the central Plains and
the Ohio Valley to the southern Middle Atlantic states. By early
summer, tornado season arrives for the northern-tier states from
the Dakotas to the Great Lakes to New England as Gulf moisture
combines with strong solar heating and a weakened but still active
jet stream.

AN AMERICAN SELLS BRITONS `THEIR' ROSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)  (js) 
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Elton John sang ``Goodbye England's Rose'' at Westminster
Abbey in 1997, who knew it would lead to ``Hello Garden Sales''?
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Masterson, who runs a little company called Collectible
Commemorative Gardens out of Tulsa, Okla., calls it ``one of life's
little miracles.'' Lt. Col. Kenneth Grapes, the director general of
the Royal National Rose Society in England, thinks it is ``the most
extraordinary coincidence you ever heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   And Cynthia Woodson in Tulsa, who introduced herself on the
telephone as ``assistant to the vice patron of the Royal National
Rose Society'' (the vice patron being her lifelong friend Bonnie
Belle), said: ``Guess what? I'm not selling real estate anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The players, with their collision of rolling Southern accents
and clipped British voices, are all counting on profits to roll in
from a new rose dedicated to Diana, princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first rose in her honor _ in fact, a Jackson &AMP;
Perkins rose and a dahlia from Spring Hill Nurseries are already
bearing her name, and earning contributions to the Diana, Princess
of Wales Memorial Fund _ but the bush named England's Rose is a
fine crossbreeding of American ambition and English taste. And
despite a scheme pandering to the world's unbelievably long
mourning period for Diana, this latest trinket is a glorious
flower. It had been under development for 10 years by the famed
English rosarian David Austin, who crossed a big yellow Graham
Thomas with a plush pink Heritage. All it wanted was a name.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Austin thinks it's the best he's ever bred,'' said
Grapes, an artillery man for 30 years before he turned to roses.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big, fat creamy white, with a blush of apricot and the
fragrance of myrrh.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw it, I wanted to eat it with a spoon,'' said
Masterson, who had a vision of such a rose in her bubble bath
shortly after Diana's death. ``I knew it was the one I was looking
for.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea came to her when she was in need of a new product to
market. She had not had a big hit since she designed the Winniest
Bear, a teddy bear to celebrate the famous football coach Bear
Bryant and his University of Alabama team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to combine something beautiful with business,'' said
Masterson, who calls herself a visionary. ``I started thinking of
that poor woman and her tragic life and those poor boys. I'd heard
the name England's Rose, so I called Cynthia, who's a gardener,
too, and said, `Have you ever seen an England's Rose in the
catalogs?' And she said, `No, I don't think so.' So I called the
trademark lawyers. Because I knew if there wasn't an England's Rose
there needed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   She trademarked the name but did not yet have a rose to attach
to it. And she did not see just one rose, but a dozen new roses,
bred by world-famous nurseries, all dedicated to the memory of
Diana and planted in a garden in her memory. She saw sales to fans
around the world, with part of the proceeds going to the garden,
and to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. But first
Masterson needed a royal connection. And finding the first rose
wouldn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I got on the Internet,'' she said. She found the Royal
National Rose Society, which was looking for money to expand its
garden.
</P>
<P>
   It took a couple of months before Grapes responded to
Masterson's e-mail messages, but she was not the type to get
discouraged. When she cooked up her Winniest Bear idea, she
recalled, ``I called for 45 days straight before I got Coach on the
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the bear is in the Paul W. Bryant Museum in Tuscaloosa.
</P>
<P>
   In England, Grapes began to admire the scope of Masterson's
plan, although, he admitted, ``I was slightly ashamed we hadn't
thought of it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He started trawling the international waters for worthy roses,
from Austin in England to Sam McGreedy in New Zealand to Tantau in
Germany. The possibilities, the tie-ins, were all there: a memorial
garden at the society's languishing headquarters in St. Albans,
north of London, a ball on Diana's birthday, in July, to introduce
the new roses. The Queen Mother, the society's patron, seemed
receptive to the idea. So Grapes invited Masterson to England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to cross the ocean,'' Masterson said of her
first trip to Europe. ``But my sister kept saying, `You're dealing
with the Royal National Rose Society, you understand. You have to
go over there.''' When Masterson arrived at St. Albans, the members
of the rose society raised their glasses to her, and a venture was
born.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides remain in admiration of each other. Grapes, she
said, reminded her of a cross between David Niven and Colonel
Mustard in the board game Clue: ``very proper, with badges, very
witty.'' For his part, Grapes said he discovered a woman ``not at
all as one had envisaged, but really interesting, knowledgeable and
extremely professional.''
</P>
<P>
   In the joint venture, the Royal Society has already sold 2,000
of the 5,000 rose bushes available this year. Masterson has sold
another 400 in the United States. England's Rose sells for $35,
plus $10 for shipping, through www.englands-rose.com or by calling
(800) 863-1572. The Web site has a picture of Masterson (who looks
like Kathy Bates) and Grapes (who indeed looks like Colonel
Mustard). England's Rose looks as peachy and soft as Diana's
complexion, and there's music on the site, Ravel's ``Pavane for a
Dead Princess.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, Grapes says he is amazed that the rose can be made
available in the United States. When Masterson said she wanted to
sell the new roses here, he told her that the quarantine laws of
the U.S. Agriculture Department would stop her for some time.
</P>
<P>
   But she contacted the department ``and discovered that by
providing certain bits of paper, it's perfectly possible,'' he
said. And so England's Rose is available here (except in the states
of Washington and Oregon).
</P>
<P>
   Grapes has been negotiating with the Diana, Princess of Wales
Memorial Fund to put its imprimatur on England's Rose, in return
for which the society would make a substantial donation to the
fund, which supports the kinds of causes the princess made her
concern. The fund has to be careful about what it approves, because
it has been deluged by tacky proposals for everything from
``Princess Diana colonic irrigation kits to underwear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Masterson says she will not rest until her royal rose empire
includes spinoffs ``like chinas and other things.''
</P>
<P>
   And meanwhile, Masterson has been made a vice patron of the
society. ``There's another one that's Lord and Lady So-and-So,''
she said. ``But I'm the only American that has ever been a vice
patron.''
</P>

perks befalling a vice patron of the Royal National Rose Society.
Last summer they were invited to take tea with the Queen. ``We

crumpets in the back yard of Buckingham Palace.''

NORTH CAROLINA TOURISM BOOK PROMOTES BLACK HERITAGE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ In a bid to boost heritage tourism in North
Carolina and promote the state's African-American history, state
tourism officials released a 64-page book this week intended to
bolster both efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The book, entitled ``The Rich Heritage of African Americans in
North Carolina,'' is more of a tourism guide than a history, but it
has some of that as well. In an essay describing how African slaves
were left near Cape Fear in the 16th century by Sir Francis Drake,
state archives director Jeffrey Crow traces the growth of blacks in
the state, a progression marred by slavery and racial turmoil but
also accompanied by cultural traditions that endure today.
</P>
<P>
   A group of state officials worked for two years to compile the
book. Commerce Secretary Rick Carlisle said it was the first
state-sponsored document celebrating African-American heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The book includes a list of historic sites, famous black
leaders, festivals and events that celebrate black heritage and
prominent artists. It was produced at a cost of $115,000, most of
which came from corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read through every word of the galleys, what I
concluded was that the citizens of North Carolina have much to
offer visitors,'' said Dot Redford, a state historian.
</P>
<P>
   The book was unveiled Tuesday in Shaw University's Estey Hall, a
spot with historical significance. The university is the oldest
historically black institution in the South, having been chartered
in 1865 by Baptist missionary Henry Martin Tupper. It was renamed
10 years later for benefactor Elijah Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Estey Hall, built in 1873, was the nation's first dormitory to
house women on a coeducational campus and where the Student
Nonviolence Coordinating Committee organized in 1960 to advocate
for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The book mentions historic sites or people in connection with 47
different counties. For example, the book tells about David Walker,
a free black from Wilmington who fought for the abolition of
slavery in the 1820s. A festival every September now celebrates
Walker's life.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent people mentioned include James Shober, who was the
first black physician in North Carolina to have a medical degree;
James Benson Dudley, former president of what is now North Carolina
A&AMP;T University, and acclaimed Pender County artist Minnie Evans.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they included every African-American site
that is already on the National Register of Historic Places as well
as people or places who have been recognized by state historical
markers.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the book are being distributed to tourism
representatives and to state welcome centers. Officials said they
plan to make the book's text and photos available on the state's
tourism web site at www.visitnc.com or by calling 1-800-VISITNC.

`CONVERSATIONS IN WORLD CINEMA': WHY THEY BECAME FILM DIRECTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CARYN JAMES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Terrifying'' is Jane Campion's description of working with
actors back when she was a fledgling director. ``I was like a
control freak. I thought, actors are going to have their own ideas!
Terrible. No way.'' It wasn't until her third and breakthrough
feature, ``The Piano,'' that she embraced the concept that actors
sometimes have ideas better than her own. Casual, witty and
exceptionally lucid about her creative development, Campion is the
first guest on a new monthly series, ``Conversations in World
Cinema,'' and she gets it off to a smashing start.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Sundance Channel and the Film Society of Lincoln
Center, ``Conversations in World Cinema'' only sounds as if it's
for film geeks. While most intelligent discussion shows about film
come with a heavy dose of pomposity, this one is modest and
surprisingly lively. (The premiere is Thursday night at 9.)
</P>
<P>
   The program begins with a brief overview of Campion's career,
narrated by the host, Richard Pena of the Film Society. Her first
film, ``Sweetie,'' now acknowledged as an influential gem, was
booed at the Cannes Film Festival. In an equally quick, but sleekly
produced and informative piece narrated by Campion, she talks about
her earliest influences when she was growing up in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Watching ``Swiss Family Robinson'' at 8, she saw a pile of logs
roll down a hill and thought they were going to come off the screen
and crush her; though she was almost hit over the head by the idea,
she still didn't think of becoming a filmmaker until she was in art
school after college. She saw ``Performance'' as an adolescent,
when it was the hippest of films, starring a young Mick Jagger. She
loved it and had no idea what it was about. That was the beginning
of what she calls a ``romance with mystery,'' not a bad description
of her own passionately evocative, enigmatic films.
</P>
<P>
   Though this series focuses on directors rather than actors, the
format has a passing resemblance to ``Inside the Actors Studio,''
with an interviewer and subject sitting onstage before a small
audience. The crucial difference is that ``Conversations in World
Cinema'' does not have that show's self-aggrandizing host, 
been deliciously skewered on ``Saturday Night Live.'' As an
interviewer, Pena knows how to ask a sharply defined question _
about the influence of Australian directors on Campion or her
method of working with cinematographers _ then get out of her way.
</P>
<P>
   Future guests include Atom Egoyan (interviewed by Wendy Keys of
the Film Society, also a regular host) and Kevin Smith. Next month
Pena talks to Mike Leigh. Asked why he was drawn to the story of
Gilbert and Sullivan, the subjects of his current film
``Topsy-Turvy,'' Leigh's answer reveals him to be a born iconoclast
and suggests that this series will continue to be refreshing. ``It
is so unfashionable, so politically incorrect to even admit that
you whistle it in the bath,'' he says of the music in their comic
operas. ``I thought it would be rather good to confront that. It is
fascinating, the way they did suffer hugely to produce this deeply,
deeply trivial stuff.''

   Idolizing Landry was natural for a young fan
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
To a young boy growing up in Waco in the 1960s, Tom Landry was God.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know it's sacrilegious to refer to Landry or any man as
God, but to impressionable kids who loved to eat, drink and sleep
Dallas Cowboys football, he came closer than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Waco was and still is a Cowboys stronghold. For many of us, a
rite of passage was experiencing the thrill of a Cowboys victory
and the agony of their defeat. Tom Landry was the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Landry made an impact on our lives because he was a symbol of
our youth, a role model who transcended football and shaped many of
our beliefs. Landry stood for everything that was good.
</P>
<P>
   During games, Landry's calmness gave us confidence and made us
feel safe. Even if Vince Lombardi or George Allen was on the
opposing sideline, we knew Landry would outfox them and find a way
to lead the Cowboys to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Because Landry had been fighting a gallant and courageous battle
with leukemia, his death Saturday wasn't a surprise. Still, it's so
hard to believe that he will no longer be around.
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to the family of Buddy Holly, as far as I'm
concerned, Feb. 25, 1989, was the day the music died. When Landry
was fired that day, I surrendered my allegiance to the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   I became a Cowboys fan the moment they were awarded an NFL
expansion team. I've often thought how different the NFL would be
if Landry had accepted the first pro football job he was offered _
by Bud Adams, who owned the Houston Oilers of the fledgling
American Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine how different so many of our lives would have been
if Landry had not politely declined Adams' deal and later accepted
Clint Murchison's offer to become the first coach of the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how bitter the defeat or how sweet the victory, Landry
was always the personification of class and dignity. He was easy to
spot because he wore a suit with his trademark hat. No matter what
kind of game the Cowboys played, old stone face never smiled or
frowned.
</P>
<P>
   I suffered through the early years of defeat, then celebrated
when they finally began to win and came tantalizingly close to
winning a championship. But they always fell short, and even though
my faith in the players waned, I always believed in Landry.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I saw Landry in person, I was too nervous to get
close to him. He came to Waco to speak at our church. On Sundays
during football season, I always sat in the back close to the exit
so I could leave a few minutes before noon and run to my
grandmother's house in time for the Cowboys' kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   But on this Sunday night in the offseason, I sat closer to the
front but not as close as I had hoped. With Landry in the pulpit,
it was kind of like sitting in the front row at school and being
called on to answer a question. I never sat in the front row at
school, and I guess that night I was afraid that Landry might
actually look at me.
</P>
<P>
   Because Landry was an icon, we were mesmerized by his words, and
transfixed by his stare. I listened intently to every word he said,
but they didn't hit home. Even though his sermon was captivating,
the entire time I watched him, I couldn't help but think about
certain plays and games and wonder what he had been thinking at
that time.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when I became a sportswriter at the Waco Tribune-Herald
and the Chronicle, I covered some Cowboys games. Even if I was
supposed to be in the opposing dressing room, I still went to
Landry's postgame session just to hear him speak.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, the Ice Bowl and Jim O'Brien still cause nightmares.
No matter how hard I try, I still hate Bart Starr, who is one of
the most likeable and well-respected players in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I go to Lambeau Field to cover a Packers game _ and
I've traveled to Green Bay many times through the years _ I can't
help but remember the Ice Bowl. When Starr sneaked for the winning
touchdown to ruin the Cowboys' season for the second consecutive
year, I thought the Packers were almost superhuman, robots created
in a lab by Lombardi, who, like Landry, was also larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   I've talked to many Packers who played in the Ice Bowl. To this
day, they are extremely humble because they know how fortunate they
were to win a game that is one of the greatest and most memorable
in sports history.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, I respect the late George Allen, and I believe he
should be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, even though I hated
everything about him for so many years. Even though I like his son,
Raiders executive Bruce Allen, I still have this deep-rooted
resentment for Allen because he was able to do what others couldn't
_ torment Landry and the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Because Landry had been ill for so long, it's comforting to know
that he will not suffer any more. For a while, though, those of us
who admired him and appreciated what he accomplished on and off the
field will suffer without him.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The short story, a genre that has been more or less
remaindered by book publishing in recent years, seems to be having
a revival of sorts, and within the last couple of weeks it has been
very visibly celebrated. The New Yorker, the premiere showcase for
short fiction, observed its 75th anniversary on Monday with its
book awards entertainment at the public library, and two of its top
winners were short-story collections.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more interesting, if only for the very freshness of the
idea, was the third-anniversary gathering last week for the
magazine Zoetrope: All-Story, a quarterly founded by Francis Ford
Coppola to promote the short story. There is something curious and
fun about a moviemaker, rather than a publisher, being so
passionate about a literary form that he tries in some small way to
bring fresh juice to it and make it popular and profitable for the
writer the way it was in the '30s. And moviemaker-friendly also.
</P>
<P>
   The major brawn in short-story publishing is arguably that
applied by Bill Buford, the fiction editor of The New Yorker, who
buys up to 100 short stories a year and publishes about 60. Buford
said: ``Great short stories are few, but great novels are few. In a
good year, we publish eight or 10 great stories. They go straight
to the nerve of our readership and create an excitement that they
don't get from other forms. There's the patter, the word of
mouth.'' So not surprisingly the magazine's book award winner for
best fiction in 1999 was Annie Proulx's collection ``Close Range:
Wyoming Stories'' (Scribner) and for the best debut was
``Interpreter of Maladies'' (Mariner Books/Houghton Mifflin),
stories by Jhumpa Lahiri about Indian immigrants trying to adjust
to life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Besides The New Yorker, Harper's, The Atlantic and Esquire are
among major magazines that publish short stories, and, of course,
the bookish countryside is stippled with small literary reviews and
university publications largely devoted to short fiction.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these are quite like Coppola's Zoetrope: All-Story.
The magazine is not glossy but is printed on paper little better
than newsprint. Its color reproduction and illustration style, even
when the artist is being most modern or almost abstract, gives it a
1930s pulp magazine muscularity. (One sometimes expects to see
Flash Gordon burst from a page; indeed, its latest issue has Tarzan
on the cover, one of its eight stories a tale of Tarzan's and
Jane's first kiss.)
</P>
<P>
   How and why was this created? Coppola explained: ``The magazine
grew from the thought that in the old days many, many short-story
magazines were published. My great heroes were Hemingway and
Fitzgerald, who did short stories, and I wondered if possibly the
strong screenplays of the '40s were weaned on this type of short
fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something strangely luxurious about the way the
magazine acquires short stories. Writers, of course, submit them,
sometimes at the rate of 50 to 100 a day, according to the editor
in chief, Adrienne Brodeur. (Payment ranges from $1,400 to $5,000
for a story.) But Coppola also commissions them, which is truly
singular for fiction. He gets an idea, sums it up in a paragraph
and sends it to Brodeur, who finds several possible writers. That's
the way it worked with the magazine's greatest success thus far.
Coppola read a review of ``The Rules: Time-Tested Secrets for
Capturing the Heart of Mr. Right'' (Warner Books, 1995) by Ellen
Fein and Sherrie Schneider and wrote his paragraph, and it landed
in the hands of a young writer named Melissa Bank.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote ``The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing,'' in which
``the rules'' failed a young woman, for the magazine's
first-anniversary issue. But they certainly did not fail the
magazine or Bank. A collection of her short stories, published
under ``The Girls' Guide'' title, then was sold to Viking Penguin
for a $275,000 advance, a mighty sum for such a collection, and was
optioned to Disney. The book was on the New York Times best-seller
list for 14 weeks, now has 250,000 copies in print, and succeeded
in making Zoetrope: All-Story an important fiction magazine beyond
its 40,000 circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola is sensitive to suggestions that the magazine was
founded to supply stories for his moviemaking, a development office
in disguise. He does believe, he said, that the two most important
talents needed for film are writing and acting, and he added,
``Melissa illustrated that maybe a few dollars invested in the
cultivation of fiction writers _ without making a film _ is
worthwhile.'' His purchase of a story includes the first movie
option, but Coppola said: ``I wanted to be pure about it. I told
Adrienne to buy stories without thinking of movies. At best only
one or two of them might be suitable for films.'' So far, only a
few stories, including Bank's, have been optioned, all by Disney,
with whom Coppola did have a working arrangement but no longer
does.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of writers out there only
occasionally producing something that could become a film or a
play, but this is a long-term thing,'' he said. ``I'd like to put
film back in the literary tradition and introduce writers to actors
and actors to writers like the old-fashion mixers where you
introduced boys to girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur said: ``There's no pressure on me to find movie stories.
Francis, in truth, if he just wanted a development office, it would
have been much less expensive to hire a development person to read
all the magazines and find stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoetrope: All-Story has a $200,000 annual budget, with most of
the cash coming from Coppola's winery, and has yet to operate in
the black. One successful movie from one story will pay for the
operation for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the idea that a major filmmaker, or anyone else for that
matter, is enthralled by short stories shouldn't be too surprising.
People have been fascinated by them as far back as the time of the
Bible, which, when one thinks of it, is a collection of collections
of short stories.

   Landry's image belied person
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
He was the man with the Dick Tracy hat and lantern jaw, and a
starched, straight-as-a-steel-rod image. A Dallas cartoonist once
drew a strip with six panels captioned, ``The Many Moods of Tom
Landry.'' In each panel, he wore the same unsmiling, pencil-lipped
expression.
</P>
<P>
   For 29 years, he was the only head coach the Dallas Cowboys had
ever known, and he was the first to be fired. When Landry lost his
battle with leukemia Saturday at twilight, surrounded by his
family, it was not his exit from the team he helped create that you
wanted to remember.
</P>
<P>
   His illness was diagnosed nine months ago, and no one tried to
pretend he had long to live. Yet he went through it pretty much as
he had gone through most things, with dignity and without false
hope or complaint. Landry was 75, and he spent roughly 50 of those
years engaged in football.
</P>
<P>
   He was the Man from Mission, an aptly named town in the Valley.
He went on to become a star fullback at the University of Texas,
and a solid defensive back with the New York Giants, where he began
his coaching career on the same staff as Vince Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't actually give us America's Team; that kind of glitz
and puffery was beneath him. But he gave Cowboys fans the success
and the consistency that made it stick. Even those who rooted
against the Cowboys could not dislike honest Tom Landry. His teams
won 13 division titles and 270 games, including two Super Bowls
(out of five).
</P>
<P>
   His career was not without contradictions. Duane Thomas, then a
young back with a puzzling attitude, described him as a ``plastic
man.'' Don Meredith, the devil-may-care quarterback, once said that
if Landry were in a personality contest with Bud Grant, the
Minnesota coach, there would be no winner.
</P>
<P>
   And Jerry Jones, on his first day as the owner of the franchise,
ushered Landry out the door, suggesting the parade had passed him
by.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had gone three years without a winning record. In
his last season, 1988, they finished with three wins and 13 losses.
But Landry was far from disheartened. He felt confident he could
turn the team around, as he had done in the beginning, when they
didn't reach the .500 mark until 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Few remember _ why would anyone want to? _ that Dallas was the
only expansion team in NFL history to go into its first season
without the benefit of a college draft.
</P>
<P>
   In what might have been a whimsical mood, he once confided he
thought he had done his best coaching job with his first Cowboys
team. His most vivid memory of that virginal 1960 season was of the
only game the Cowboys didn't lose. They didn't win it either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember the score,'' he said, ``or whether they came
from behind or we did. I'm not sure if Eddie LeBaron or Don
Meredith was our quarterback. But the game was at Yankee Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   The pint-sized LeBaron played the whole game and completed four
TD passes, the last to Billy Howton to tie the score at 31 in the
darkening seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the way home,'' Landry said, ``we considered it a
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had lost their first 10 games and the tie kept them
from having a perfect record. A week later, they ended the season
by losing to the Detroit Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they had given the rest of the league a 40-year head
start, the Cowboys lost only four games by more than 12 points. Out
of it came a trend that spread throughout the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have much to give us hope,'' Landry said. ``But it
forced us to comb the free-agent ranks and to take a good, hard
look at the all-black schools, something not all the teams had
done. We found the Jethro Pughs and the Rayfield Wrights and, in
time, that made us a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry's preference for the dedicated, clean-cut types, the
Roger Staubachs and Bob Lillys and Lee Roy Jordans, was well-known.
But he tolerated the rebels, up to a point, and won with them:
Meredith, Tony Dorsett, Pete Gent, Hollywood Henderson, to offer an
interesting cross section.
</P>
<P>
   Always, the enduring picture of Landry was that of an aloof,
mechanical kind of man, dry as a Santa Clara prune. For sure, he
was not a back-slapper, nor one who needed an audience. He rarely
chose to reveal himself.
</P>
<P>
   But Landry had a dry sense of humor. Once, asked by a
sportswriter what kind of field position he preferred, he replied,
``Frankly, I'm partial to my opponent's one-inch line.''
</P>
<P>
   When he relented during one Super Bowl trip and allowed the
wives to share a hotel room with their husbands, he explained that,
``Everyone enjoys a change now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall and taciturn, his face during a game revealed about as much
emotion as a lamp post. Somewhere along the line he became typed as
a conservative coach, but the record doesn't support that label. It
was Landry who revived the shotgun formation for Staubach in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Landry, as an assistant with the Giants in the late
1950s, who invented an alignment called the 4-3 defense. In the
opinion of some pro observers, that accomplishment put him right up
there with Eli Whitney and the cotton gin.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi was the backfield coach under Jim Lee Howell and
Landry, still playing in the secondary, was a coach on the field.
Kyle Rote, who starred as a halfback and receiver, recalls walking
down the hall during training camp, peeking in the office doors,
and seeing Landry in one room running a film projector, and
Lombardi in another room, doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the hall, Howell, the head man, was reading a
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew then that there was a wonderful competition going
on, perhaps not even Lombardi and Landry. Both would become Hall of
Famers, and legendary figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' said Frank Gifford, the key back in Lombardi's
run-to-daylight philosophy, ``I learned more playing under Tom and
I don't mean that as a putdown of Vince. Landry taught. Lombardi
inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   In a game against the Redskins, Gifford, playing both ways,
intercepted a pass and was about to be tackled inside the
Washington 10-yard line. As he went down, he spotted Tom out of the
corner of his eye and lateraled to him. A startled Landry loped
over for the touchdown. On the sideline, he chewed out Gifford for
improvising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one I admired more than Tom Landry,'' said
Gifford, who moved on to television and Monday Night Football. ``I
wrote him a letter a couple of years ago and tried to say that. I'm
not much for writing fan letters, but I did it this once. We create
images and we can't erase them. People would mistake his intensity,
his discipline, for coldness. But he was really very special. His
relationship with his wife, Alicia, and his kids, the closeness,
was marvelous to see. He was a great coach and an exemplary
person.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their corporate image under Landry, the history of the
Cowboys was anything but bland. They were for years a party team in
a fairly decent party town. Old-timers recalled fondly the days
when Meredith walked into the huddle singing a medley of his
favorite country songs. Then the Cowboys started winning, and
Meredith realized he was the only one still singing.
</P>
<P>
   Landry created the flex defense and the Cowboys introduced the
computer to pro football. He had his critics, early and late, but
he tolerated them.
</P>
<P>
   What Thomas Wade Landry couldn't tolerate was losing. He was
clearly bitter when Jones fired him, but at the same time he felt
sympathy for the task that faced the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot harder to start from scratch now,'' he said, ``than
it was in 1960.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was no longer his, and he made an interesting
discovery: ``I never realized how much pressure I was under, until
it wasn't there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   His place in pro football lore is permanent, and so is the image
of the man in the hat.

   Violence has forced NFL out of bounds
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Violent acts by NFL players this season created so much controversy
that critics are calling it the National Felony League.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day it seems as if another player is being charged
with a crime, making the league a convenient target for criticism
from those who believe the owners are more concerned with making
money than cleansing the NFL of the criminal element that provides
a bad role model for the youth of America.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's public relations machine counters with statistics that
show the percentage of crimes committed by players is less than
society in general. The league contends that because the NFL is so
popular, it is going to be under the microscope more than other
industries and that everything is going to be magnified.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've definitely got to be careful in this league,''
Jacksonville offensive tackle Leon Searcy said. ``Any time we do
something, it's public. Association brings on assimilation. The
people you associate with can put a damper on your reputation.
We've got to be careful about who we hang out with. We've got to
let them know, `When you do something, it reflects on me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Players have to avoid those situations and learn not to get
involved in circumstances that lead to consequences. Everything you
do is going to be magnified by 100, whether you're innocent or
guilty. And you're going to be perceived as guilty until proven
innocent because of your stature. It's unfortunate, (but) we know
coming into the NFL that we have to use better judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of NFL players are being branded by the actions of
a few, which doesn't sit well with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of players who aren't involved in anything
illegal or violent,'' Buffalo guard Ruben Brown said. ``That should
let you know there isn't some trait in a football player to be that
type of violent person society knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who don't play football commit those crimes.
To think we're exempt is ridiculous. We're no different from the
rest of society in that some of us are good and some of us are bad.
Just because we play football doesn't mean we're going to run
around killing people or doing things of that nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Violent crime is not new in the NFL. Former Carolina receiver
Rae Carruth wasn't the first player to be charged with committing a
murder during the season. In 1951, Pittsburgh Steelers receiver
Jerry Nuzum was arrested for allegedly murdering a waitress in New
Mexico. A judge dismissed the case for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Murder accusations get the attention of the news media, not just
the sports media. It also attracts the interest of non-sports fans.
The media fuel interest.
</P>
<P>
   When Carruth was charged with first-degree murder in the
shooting death of his girlfriend, who was pregnant at the time, it
received worldwide publicity. She died, but the baby lived.
</P>
<P>
   When Baltimore middle linebacker Ray Lewis, who had been voted
as a starter in the Pro Bowl, was charged with double murder
resulting from a fight outside an Atlanta nightclub after Super
Bowl XXXIV, interest skyrocketed. And the media feeding frenzy
began.
</P>
<P>
   Like Carruth, Lewis remains in jail. Many have an opinion about
why they are there and what they could have done to avoid their
situations, but Cleveland Browns owner Al Lerner might have put it
best.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about Lewis, Lerner said: ``He was trained to be a great
athlete. He was never trained to be a multimillionaire. He was
never trained to handle that kind of exposure and the things that
got shoved in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times do we remember walking away from an incident
and it was good that we did? These kids may not know enough about
just walking away.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams have programs to educate and help players.
Psychologists and doctors participate in the programs, which cost
each team about $1 million a year to provide.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis plays for the Ravens, who had a seven-part lecture series
during the last offseason on how players should conduct themselves.
Topics covered in the series involved drug counseling,
accountability both personally and professionally, and
relationships with women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't tolerate and we don't condone misconduct,'' NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. ``We do strike a balance between
that and giving people a second chance, recognizing that some of
the misconduct by NFL players has occurred before they were NFL
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have in place a very comprehensive, very active set of
programs, and they focus on prevention, and they are all tied
together. We have counseling on a league-wide basis. We have
treatment. We have prevention and we have discipline, and I think
the players respond in a very positive way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we separate ourselves from society? Of course not. Can we
predict when a player such as Rae Carruth is going to have a
problem? Of course not. We can't predict that any more than others
in society can predict that students are going to shoot other
students or that workers are going to shoot other workers in the
workplace. You can't predict when there is going to be aberrant
behavior. Nor can you understand it after it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL players have been involved in many other recent incidents,
but fans have become almost immune to them.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Indianapolis defensive back Steve Muhammad was
charged with battery in the beating of his pregnant wife. He was
cleared in the deaths of his wife and stillborn child that resulted
from a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Miami rookie running back Cecil Collins, who was on probation,
was charged with two counts of burglary of a dwelling. The married
woman whose apartment he entered said Collins had been stalking
her. Collins, who was waived by the Dolphins, remains in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City receiver Tamarick Vanover repeatedly has been
mentioned in a federal investigation involving a huge cocaine and
marijuana ring that has been smuggling drugs into Kansas and
Missouri. Vanover hasn't been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Former Chiefs running back Bam Morris was a passenger in a Ford
Expedition that pulled out of Vanover's driveway and was stopped by
police. The Expedition had been stolen. The driver, Morris' friend
and former college teammate, Dewayne Bryant, was charged with
felony theft.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who was on probation, retired from the Chiefs in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina running back Fred Lane's car was stopped. He was
arrested on drug and weapons charges. New York Jets receiver Wayne
Chrebet and Indianapolis fullback Keith Elias were arrested outside
a New Jersey bar at 4 a.m. last Sunday. They had been involved in a
fight that some witnesses described as a melee. Chrebet was charged
with disorderly conduct. Elias was charged with disorderly conduct
and resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Many players who get into trouble off the field are involved
with friends or acquaintances, not with teammates. Alcohol or drugs
also can play a role. So can where the players hang out, not just
with whom they hang out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friendship goes out the window when the law gets involved,''
said former 49ers/Raiders/Jets defensive back Ronnie Lott, who is a
member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame class of 2000. ``Many of
the problems guys have are because of people they're surrounded by.
Guys have to understand the law doesn't care if you're with your
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys say, `I'm not going to turn my back on my friends.'
That's a tough thing for other people to understand. I'm not saying
don't hang with old friends. But when a moment of truth comes, you
have to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City tight end Tony Gonzalez said it's easier said than
done for players to disassociate themselves with friends they grew
up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize these players have grown up with those
guys since they were little kids,'' he said. ``You can tell them to
change, but it's hard to do. These are the people who were there
before you became who you are today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell someone like that, `Hey, I can't hang out
with you anymore. Even though you've been with me my whole life,
now I can't talk to you anymore.' I mean, that's a hard position to
be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee rookie defensive end Jevon Kearse, who was voted to
the Pro Bowl, grew up in Fort Myers, Fla. His father was murdered
before he was born. One brother was shot to death. Another brother
is in prison. When Kearse goes home, he's careful to avoid people
and situations that could get him in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no proper way to teach people,'' he said. ``Sometimes
it's hard to not associate with the friends you grew up with.
Everybody knows right from wrong, but they don't always do the
right thing. I can be walking down the street with regular Joe
Blows and get into trouble. We have to realize that most people
don't have as much to lose as we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go home, there are some friends I could get in trouble
with if I'm not careful, but I'm careful. I might just drive by
them and say, `What's up?' and keep going. I know that's not a
place for me now, and they pretty much understand it. I've moved on
from that part of my life. If I'm with guys like that and something
goes down, they'll probably just get a slap on the wrist, but it
could ruin my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sociologists who study the NFL say violent behavior off the
field is to be expected because the players are coached to play
violently. Players disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough man's game, but you can't take it home with
you,'' said Tampa Bay safety John Lynch, who is one of the league's
hardest hitters. ``You learn how to separate the two as you get
older. The best way to stay out of trouble is to stay away from
places where trouble can find you.''

says, spur economic growth, calm ethnic strife, reduce corruption
and even slow the spread of AIDS. Yet, despite all that, Ouattara
is glad that a coup in December forced his country's president out

hinder, democracy. Ouattara plans to run for president in elections
he hopes the Carter Center will monitor. (Melvin, Atlanta

however, came when the church learned a few months ago that the
federal government plans to deport the deacon because of a 1996

LOOPHOLE MAKES LOWERED-FLAG TRIBUTE MORE COMMON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was a little kid in the early 1960s, I was so overly
versed in flag etiquette that I feared lightning bolts would strike
if the U.S. flag touched the ground or was otherwise mistreated.
Lowering a flag to half-staff was cause for alarm. The president
had ordered it. A national leader had fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, society is more tolerant of alterations to traditional flag
protocol. Once looked upon as a symbol of our government, the flag
now is being used more as a symbol of its people. As such, it is
lowered more frequently. It's put at half-staff not just for
high-ranking government officials but also for ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The sports world, for example, offers two recent illustrations:
The Dallas Cowboys lowered the flag at Texas Stadium in Irving
after legendary former coach Tom Landry died Saturday. Last week,
flags over Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri were lowered to half-staff
when Kansas City Chiefs star Derrick Thomas died unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, this could seem inappropriate. Federal law says
that in addition to certain holidays such as Memorial Day, the flag
should be lowered by order of the president upon the death of a
``principal figure'' in U.S. government, a foreign dignitary or a
governor. Some interpret that to mean that only the president
should issue the order to lower the flag.
</P>
<P>
   But the code also offers this loophole: ``In the event of the
death of other officials or foreign dignitaries, the flag is to be
displayed at half-staff according to recognized customs or
practices not inconsistent with law.''
</P>
<P>
   That clause, ``recognized customs or practices,'' means that
schools, cities, anyone can lower flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``That clause allows local communities to decide how they want
to grieve for significant deaths that affect the community,'' said
Marc Flake, spokesman for Tarrant County administration. Federal
law offers specific guidelines for how the president should respond
but leaves the door open for others to decide when to lower the
flag, Flake says.
</P>
<P>
   Texas law is more clear than national law in flag-lowering
decorum. By law, the governor can order it for any ``individual.''
</P>
<P>
   In North Texas, the U.S. flag flew at half-staff over Fort
Worth, Arlington and Tarrant County buildings after the shootings
at Wedgwood Baptist Church last September, not by order of the
president, but by order of city and county officials. The city of
Arlington lowered its flag after the Texas A&AMP;M bonfire tragedy, and
it has lowered its flags when Arlington police have been killed in
the line of duty. Fort Worth's city administration and Tarrant
County administrators ordered U.S. flags lowered on city and county
buildings after Fort Worth Police Chief Thomas Windham died Jan.
12.
</P>
<P>
   ``That didn't bother me,'' says Douglas Kingston, a Veterans of
Foreign Wars officer in Fort Worth. ``It's honoring the
individual.''

 (Eds: Barry Singer's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was
about a new recording of Edith Piaf's songs by the cabaret singer
Raquel Bitton; lyrics can be in italics.)  
 By BARRY SINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Name the most important lyric writers of the past half-century.
Stephen Sondheim, without question; the lyricist who
single-handedly deepened the American song tradition with
penetrating verbal invention and an enlivening dose of
psychological complexity.
</P>
<P>
   But also Bob Dylan, Paul Simon and Joni Mitchell, folk
balladeers who infused lyric writing with the imagery and
confessional aspect of modernist poetry. Their innovations created
an entirely new tradition, or perhaps anti-tradition _ that of the
self-absorbed singer-songwriter for whom, in the name of personal
expression, all lyric-writing rules could be broken.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tradition that still dominates, having produced hordes of
disciples, including many truly gifted lyricists, ranging from
Bruce Springsteen and Lou Reed to Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder
and Billy Joel, from Elvis Costello and Tom Waits to Beck, Rufus
Wainwright and Fiona Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, though, to write in the classic, urbane style of
Hart, Gershwin, Berlin, Porter and Sondheim is to discourse in a
dead language. Their notion of lyric writing as a craft, a verbal
equivalent of melodic composition, grounded in wit and elegant
wordplay, is today so thoroughly antiquated that one can barely
find a context for it.
</P>
<P>
   It has no place, either stylistically or thematically, in the
aesthetic of anomie and instant gratification that informs most
contemporary music. Nor has it much to do with the slipshod
language of hip-hop, where rapped lyrics are mis-stressed and
mis-rhymed in simplistic service to rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Composing lyrics in the classic tradition of American song has
always demanded a respect for, if not slavish adherence to, laws:
of form, function, poesy. That's the fun of it. The challenge. The
ideal.
</P>
<P>
   We live, however, in the grip of a music culture that venerates
rebelliousness. The intricacies of lyric writing have thus been
reduced to brute effusion. Worse than a chore, adherence to craft
is actually seen as a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Yet craftsmen still persist. Not in the pop realm, but,
unsurprisingly, in the world of musical theater, where a handful
perpetuate the painstaking art of matching words to music. None are
revolutionary thinkers like Sondheim. Few seek to expand the form
beyond its long-preserved limits. Collectively, however, they
ensure that an endangered vernacular treasure endures.
</P>
<P>
   Working with the composer Stephen Flaherty, Lynn Ahrens has
risen through the ranks, moving from Off Broadway to Broadway in
the 1980s with the Tony nominated ``Once on This Island,'' and more
recently winning her first Tony Award for ``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Her signature remains a colloquial eloquence, as in the mordant,
jingoistic empathy of ``Journey On'' from ``Ragtime.'' Here, Ahrens
uses a pair of well-placed rhymes _ ``ship'' and ``trip,''
``danger'' and ``stranger'' _ to reveal whole vistas of subtext and
characterization:
</P>
<P>
   A salute to the man
</P>
<P>
   On the deck of that ship!
</P>
<P>
   A salute to the immigrant stranger.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows why you'd make
</P>
<P>
   Such a terrible trip.
</P>
<P>
   May your own god protect you from danger . . .
</P>
<P>
   A salute to a fellow
</P>
<P>
   Who hasn't a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Journey on.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Birkenhead is a multidimensional lyricist for hire. Though
the lack of a constant composing companion may blur her identity a
bit, Birkenhead's work has been extraordinarily consistent
regardless of context. She has helped toe dancers sing (in ``The
Red Shoes,'' written with the composer Jule Styne) and a jazz
legend dance (Jelly Roll Morton, her posthumous collaborator on
``Jelly's Last Jam'').
</P>
<P>
   Her most widely applauded creation appeared halfway through the
first act of ``Triumph of Love,'' a musical adaption of the French
play by Marivaux. Here in the sensuously conflicted ``Serenity''
(music by Jeffrey Stock), the insistent stresses of Birkenhead's
lines communicate the sad resignation and the exhilarating
expectation of giving oneself up to forbidden love:
</P>
<P>
   And now without warning you appear
</P>
<P>
   So passionate, young and fair,
</P>
<P>
   Assaulting the thing I hold most dear
</P>
<P>
   With a toss of your sunlit hair . . .
</P>
<P>
   Serenity.
</P>
<P>
   Since his inaugural collaboration with the legendary composer Cy
Coleman on ``City of Angels'' brought him a Tony Award, David
Zippel has gone on to success in Hollywood, contributing lyrics for
animated Disney features, anthems for the teen-age singer Christina
Aguilera and the theme for the Pokemon movie (a lesson in how a
talented lyricist is forced _ or may choose _ to survive in today's
music business).
</P>
<P>
   Zippel's most indelible work remains the double-edged drollery
he framed for ``City of Angels,'' an insouciant complement to
Coleman's jazz-inflected score. An exchange between the show's
detective-writer protagonist and his fictional creation in ``You're
Nothing Without Me'' is indicative of Zippel's style. His brazen
interior rhymes capture two glories of lyric writing at its best _
terseness and wit:
</P>
<P>
   You gloating ignoramus.
</P>
<P>
   You haven't any shame.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I'm a famous shamus
</P>
<P>
   And most people don't know your name.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for their work in cabaret, Craig Carnelia and Mark
Waldrop have also known theatrical success Off Broadway. Carnelia,
who is also a distinctive composer, provided the music and words
for Craig Lucas' widely admired musical play ``Three Postcards.''
Waldrop created the often hilarious lyrics for Howard Crabtree's
two epic costume revues, ``Whoop-De-Doo'' and ``When Pigs Fly''
(music by Dick Gallagher).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It could be said that the often introspective Carnelia is much
the miniaturist and the often extroverted Waldrop is not. But that
would be too simple. There is also the pensive Waldrop of
``Laughing Matters,'' deploying a profusion of rhymes to express
the gentlest of messages:
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   How to take a brighter view
</P>
<P>
   When your noodle's totally fried,
</P>
<P>
   Human spirits need to be
</P>
<P>
   Leavened by a little levity . . .
</P>
<P>
   Keep your humor, please,
</P>
<P>
   Because don't you know it's time like these that laughing
matters
</P>
<P>
   Most of all.
</P>
<P>
   And the almost rhapsodic Carnelia of ``What You'd Call a
Dream,'' using minimal rhyme to express maximum emotion:
</P>
<P>
   There are two men out
</P>
<P>
   And it's in the ninth
</P>
<P>
   And the score is 4-3,
</P>
<P>
   There's a man on first
</P>
<P>
   And a man at bat
</P>
<P>
   And the man at bat is me.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm sort of scared
</P>
<P>
   And I'm sort of proud
</P>
<P>
   And I'm stronger than I seem,
</P>
<P>
   And I take a swing
</P>
<P>
   And my dad is there
</P>
<P>
   And it's what you call a dream.
</P>
<P>
   There are others, of course, a community of younger aspirants
and just-established talents like Adam Guettel and Michael John
LaChiusa. Both have received extensive attention of late as
composers, yet both are promising lyricists too.
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa is a true classicist, as tart as he is smart, while
Guettel, in his yearning pursuit of spiritual release, conjures a
lyrical realm quite unlike anything heard before in American song.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Childs is an utterly original lyricist-composer who has
shaped the sha-la-la of '60s girl group refrains into revelatory
expositions about race in her forthcoming musical ``The Bubbly
Black Girl Sheds Her Chameleon Skin.''
</P>
<P>
   The shrewdly satirical lyricist-composer John Foster, though not
ideally displayed last season in his own Off Broadway revue, ``A
Good Swift Kick,'' is nevertheless that rarity, a lyricist who just
writes funny. Even a writer like Willie Reale, in composing lyrics
over the last two decades for his children's theater, the 52nd
Street Project, has quietly yielded more lyric cleverness and
offhand sophistication than Broadway has heard during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   All of these lyricists labor in a painfully long shadow, one
that both encompasses and excludes them. This becomes especially
clear when examining the evolution of the 92nd Street Y's ``Lyrics
and Lyricists'' series, which last month began celebrating its 30th
season.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago this coming Dec. 13, one of America's greatest
lyricists, Yip Harburg, took the stage at the Y's Kaufmann
Auditorium to explain for the first time in a formally designed
evening just what he did.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 12 years, nearly 50 more followed Harburg, a roll
call of giants, from Sammy Cahn to Johnny Mercer. These programs,
moderated by the Broadway conductor Maurice Levine, proved a
revelation to all concerned, a reprieve from the neglect that was
the lyric writer's lot as songwriting's often forgotten link.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, one could hear the clock ticking. By the end
of the 1970s, many of these lyricists were dead, their Y
appearances a collective epitaph. It's been four years since living
lyricists (the husband and wife team Marilyn and Alan Bergman) last
headlined a program. Before that, one would have to go back to 1980
(and Leo Robin).
</P>
<P>
   As the direct links disappeared the series and its audience
seemed to grow ever narrower in their taste, convening solely for
scripted nostalgic song tributes. Sadly, an institution that has
for three decades championed the art of classic lyric writing today
all but ignores it as a living tradition.
</P>
<P>
   That none of the lyricists mentioned here have yet achieved the
brilliance of their predecessors is hardly remarkable. Once
lyricists developed by writing for vast, avid audiences and an
insatiable song industry. No longer. Merely striving to maintain
any standard at all in the face of the power of commercial pop is
an accomplishment in itself.
</P>
<P>
   Such steadfastness ensures that these lyric writing does remain
a living tradition, its present uncertain, its future open to
potentially inspiring questions. As in the words of Guettel:
</P>
<P>
   Are we everywhere?
</P>
<P>
   Are we anywhere at all?
</P>
<P>
   . . . Only heaven knows how Glory goes,
</P>
<P>
   What each of us was meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the starlight, that is what we are.
</P>
<P>
   I can see so far . . .

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Americans consumed 130 million tons of steel last
year. Some were extremely fussy about it.
</P>
<P>
   The minimalist vogue has elected crude metal the interior
material of the moment. From the Tse boutique at 827 Madison Avenue
to Gianni Versace at No. 815 to the Giorgio Armani offices and
showroom at 114 Fifth Avenue, enough steel, aluminum and bronze
have gone in recently to make New York City the newest Rust Belt.
</P>
<P>
   Architects adore it, including Richard Gluckman, who designed
the two-story aluminum walls inside the Versace store; Peter
Marino, who created an aluminum conference table for Chanel's new
offices; and Philippe Starck, who is specifying stainless steel
medicine cabinets for Ian Schrager's new West Side residence.
</P>
<P>
   But as important as what you do with the stuff in this town is
who you get to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hand, a metalworker and ex-sculptor with a studio on
Leonard Street in TriBeCa, is the cold-rolled-steel set's current
``It'' Boy.
</P>
<P>
   Superman, the Man of Steel, might have the trademark. Hand has
the clients. He has worked with every architect worth his or her
metal oxide, from Steven Holl to Tod Williams and Billy Tsien. His
last big job was 3,000 square feet of Cognac-colored steel for
Clarissa and Edgar Bronfman's East Side town house, designed by
Peter Rose. (His next big job: a rust-orange steel-arc staircase in
the style of Richard Serra for an apartment on the Upper East Side
of .)
</P>
<P>
   Though independent, Hand gets much of his work through the Clark
Construction Corp., one of the city's ``It'' general contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Design at the moment includes a lot of decorative metal
elements, on the contemporary end,'' said Chris Clark, the
president. ``I'm doing 15 major residences all over town right now,
and Tom will be involved in half of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a kid-glove touch on an unlikely material like steel has
made it newly popular as a warm, not cold, element in modern
design.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all the hand finishing,'' Hand said recently at his
studio, a dirty ex-garage on a block closed to traffic because it
is clogged with loft-development crews. Hand has the hesitation of
an artist in answering questions; his speech is as soft as his work
is hard.
</P>
<P>
   Large metal pieces are sheared, bent or rolled to size by
subcontractors. Hand and his team weld, cure and polish them. ``All
those ceiling panels in the Bronfman residence _ they're cut by
laser, plotted in C.A.D. drawings, but the finishing was all done
by hand,'' Hand said.
</P>
<P>
   Steel is ``pickled,'' he explained, with an acid application to
remove the ``blue scale'' it arrives with, then chemically sprayed
and scrubbed by hand, as if it were being waxed, to achieve the
required color and patina. Rose, the architect, asked for a
black-brown for the Bronfmans' steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wash it down, then scrub it again, several times,'' Hand
said. ``In the process, you get a reflective quality and a
hand-rubbed quality. There's a subtle modulation in the surface
that makes it gentler than steel.''
</P>
<P>
   Hand worked as an apprentice, then taught at the Johnson Atelier
Technical Institute of Sculpture _ a school and foundry in
Mercerville, N.J., whose clients include George Segal, Joel Shapiro
and the Museum of Modern Art _ before establishing his New York
studio 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taught to be a craftsman,'' he said. ``It wasn't
something I learned by accident. We lived and slept metal. We lived
in little farmhouses _ we barely made money. I apprenticed to be a
metalworker, and that's common in Europe, but not common in
America. It's an Old World tradition I have no reservations
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any craftsman, Hand does not discuss his chemical formulas.
George Ranalli, an architect who worked with Hand on the Fashion
Center Building at 38th Street, said: ``All artisans, when they're
really good, have secret techniques. He has quite a few: formulas
or finishes for blackening steel, so it won't rust; sealing metals
with wax; the way he oxidizes copper. He just knows metal very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hand's other talent is working with architects. ``I never try to
impose any design sense on them,'' he said. ``Some metalworkers I
know, they try to be designers. That's not their place. I can draw
the distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Success has created its stresses, especially on Hand's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best situation is when craftsmen are candid, and say,
`This is my schedule,' and we go along with it or not,'' said David
Piscuskas, at 1100 Architect, who worked with Hand on the Tse
boutique. ``Tom knew his steel, but frankly he was slow. The
clients want the architecture. And they want the architects to get
it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Hand was quick to share the distress. ``You take on these big
jobs, and you can't handle it,'' he said, standing before a pushpin
board that held a working drawing for a metal desk destined for the
new SoHo offices of Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, the advertising agency. The
original metalworker had been removed from the project by the
architect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rough doing the custom work,'' he said. ``It's very
labor-intensive. You could bid a job at 150 hours and easily spend
300. Staying small, you can't always pump things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Temerian, a metalworker and colleague who has worked in the
last year on the Nicole Farhi store and New York residences for
Calvin Klein and Robert Redford, agreed that, despite its sparks of
celebrity, the craft can involve a life as unforgiving as steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-end metalwork is a hard way to make a living,'' he said.
``The materials are expensive. You make a mistake, and you can just
throw it out. Everyone I know who does it wants to be a
carpenter.''
</P>
<P>
   Hand, who lives with his wife in Westchester County in an old
house that he calls his hobby, talked recently with Temerian about
giving up the big city and its big assignments, but the country is
a project he does not have time for right now.
</P>
<P>
   His cellular telephone rang. Then it rang again. Then it rang
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone seems to like steel this year,'' he said.

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A proponent of the California measure to limit the definition of
marriage claims that ``Proposition 22 is exactly 14 words long:
`Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in
California.' That's it! No legal doubletalk, no hidden agenda. Just
common sense.''
 &HT;    And not entirely true.
 &HT;    Proposition 22 is much larger than 14 words. It embodies a
national moral argument _ frankly, a theological argument _ about
homosexuality. The not-so-hidden agenda is religion.
 &HT;    The theological case against homosexuality is, in the minds of
many, quite clear. In the beginning, God created ``Adam and Eve;
not Adam and Steve.'' God intended marriage for one man and one
woman.
 &HT;    The Hebrew scriptures teach, ``You shall not lie with a male as
with a woman; it is an abomination.''
 &HT;    And likewise the Christian New Testament: ``For this reason, God
gave them up to degrading passions. Their women exchanged natural
intercourse for unnatural, and in the same way also the men.''
 &HT;    Accordingly, homosexual persons were either condemned to death
(Lev 20:13) or consigned to Hell (Rom 1: 28-32). Since male-female
marriage is at the heart of God's plan for creation, homosexuality
is the ultimate violation of Judeo-Christian values.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, many Proposition 22 supporters are members of
or have ties to religious right organizations. Many more are
conscientious church people who want to do the right thing for the
sake of their children and society. And they are seeking to follow
what they believe to be a ``common sense'' biblical mandate.
 &HT;    The problem is, however, this interpretation of the Bible lacks
common sense.
 &HT;    The Hebrew Bible prohibition against homosexuality occurs in a
portion of scripture referred to as ``the purity code.'' The book
of Leviticus sets out literally hundreds of laws and regulations
governing the life of ancient Israel.
 &HT;    Included are such commands as ``You shall rise before the aged,
and defer to the old,'' ``You shall not hate in your heart anyone
of your kin,'' ``A leper shall wear torn clothes and let the hair
of his head be disheveled,'' and ``You shall not touch the skin of
a dead pig.''
 &HT;    Few contemporary people, even strictly observant Jews, keep the
entirety of the purity code. Leviticus, and the supposed
prohibition against homosexuality, only makes sense in the context
of its history. It was intended to set up boundaries of religious
practice between the Israelites, God's people, and the pagan tribes
surrounding them.
 &HT;    Most Jewish believers interpret these commands spiritually and
not literally _ the full measure of God's Law being the Ten
Commandments. And they say nothing about homosexuality.
 &HT;    Even those who take the purity code literally only follow it
selectively. Leviticus 25 commands a practice known as the Jubilee.
``You shall hallow the fiftieth year and you shall proclaim liberty
throughout the land.'' During the jubilee year, prisoners and
slaves are to be freed; stolen property returned and debts
forgiven.
 &HT;    If biblical literalists are so insistent that society condemns
homosexuality as ``unbiblical,'' why are they not equally insistent
that the nation's jails be emptied or Third World debt be forgiven?
 &HT;    The use of these Hebrew Bible texts against homosexuality is a
relatively recent development _ almost no ancient Christian
authority invoked them.
 &HT;    Historical theologian John Boswell asserts, ``The assumption
that the creation of humankind through heterosexual union in
Genesis and subsequent emphasis on marriage throughout the Old
Testament demonstrates tacit rejection of gay sexuality is
insupportable in a modern context, and it does not seem to have
occurred to early Christians.''
 &HT;    The New Testament writings against homosexuality are equally
unclear and irrelevant. Actually, the word ``homosexual'' never
occurs in the Bible. Hebrew and Greek terms used to describe some
forms of homosexual activity simply do not condemn any modern
notion of ``same-sex marriage'' or monogamous homosexual
partnerships.
 &HT;    Although a controversial point, it appears the New Testament
condemns male prostitution and sexual violence (both homosexual and
heterosexual) but not gay and lesbian sexuality per se.
 &HT;    What is perfectly clear, however, is that the Bible does not
condemn gay and lesbian persons. All people are created in God's
image and deserve love, respect and freedom. All human beings are
equally flawed, shortsighted, and selfish. No one group has a
monopoly on sin.
 &HT;    As C.S. Lewis once pointedly remarked, ``Those who do not think
about their own sins make up for it by thinking incessantly about
the sins of others.''
 &HT;    So, where does this leave us? I'd like to counter the
Proposition 22 with 16 other words: ``Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof.''
 &HT;    Let's be people of uncommon good sense and keep theology out of
the California Family Code.

`LITTLE RICHARD' BY NUMBERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Embargoed until Sunday, Feb. 20; tonight is SUNDAY in this
story. Note ITALICS below. Fact box below) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Little Richard'' has everything a good _ or bad _ rock 'n'
roll biopic should have. Got your notepads ready? Let's begin.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy childhood? Check. Richard Penniman's father (Carl
Lumbly) doesn't understand him and, thinking him not macho enough,
forces him into a boxing ring, where he is promptly KO'd.
</P>
<P>
   Dumb/lucky break? Check. Richard (Leon) slips out the back of
the diner where he works, sees a piano, starts banging on it and is
promptly given a job in a vaudeville act.
</P>
<P>
   Tragic bump in the road on the way to the top? Check. While he's
knocking 'em dead in a nightclub, his father is murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Bone-chilling encounter with racism (if performer is black,
he/she endures it stoically; if white, he/she valiantly protests)?
Check. The cop investigating the murder declares that it ``just
ain't that much of a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Spontaneous decision that changes everything? Check. After a
disastrous studio session, Richard impulsively bangs out
``Tutti-Frutti'' on a piano; it quickly becomes the song he records
to spectacular success.
</P>
<P>
   Life-is-sweet montage of the record rocketing up the charts?
Check. And, because white radio stations won't play his version,
Pat Boone's jets up right beside his _ one of the best scenes in
the film intercuts between Richard and Boone recording the same
song in their distinctive (using the term advisedly in Boone's
case) styles.
</P>
<P>
   Complaint that the record company ripped him off? Check. That
doesn't prevent him, of course, from being able to buy his mother a
pink mansion in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Director Robert Townsend has deliriously sent up this kind of
material before _ in the enjoyable Lifetime movie ``Jackie's Back''
(starring Jenifer Lewis, who plays Richard's mother here) _ and
offered an even more earnest take on it with the theatrical release
``The Five Heartbeats.'' What makes this worth viewing is the
fairly electric performance of Leon (``The Temptations,'' ``Waiting
to Exhale''), who captures Little Richard's flamboyant wit and
early on-stage abandon.
</P>
<P>
   The film is actually pretty faithful to Penniman's story (it
does omit, however, that some of Richard's early rock performances
_ in blues bars _ weren't particularly well-received; little did
they know). It even flirts pretty heavily with portraying
Penniman's homosexuality, though that or the word ``gay'' is never
actually used _ ``sissy'' is the closest they get here. Richard's
lifelong struggle between his sacred beliefs and allegedly profane
(and more profitable) music isn't convincingly depicted _ Jerry Lee
Lewis was beset by the same conflicting passions, and ``Great Balls
of Fire'' made a mess out of conveying that battle as well.
Nonetheless, whenever Leon lets loose, ``Little Richard'' is
something to behold. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE WISHING TREE''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Wishing Tree,'' a high-octane lawyer named Clara (Alfre
Woodard) returns to her hometown of Savannah, Ga., to attend her
mother's funeral, and confronts her past. Her mother was a famed
storyteller, and one tale in particular, which gives this film its
name, concerned a tree in the Savannah woods that miraculously
carried a young slave girl to her freedom some 150 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Clara's childhood friend ventures with a pal into the
woods in search of the tree, certain it will help end the need to
eat broccoli forever. Instead, they confront a mysterious, mute man
who lives in the woods and has magic rattling around in his bones
(Blair Underwood, dashing even under an unkempt Afro wig). Clara
becomes privy to their secret rendezvous and keeps it quiet, which
seems to become a tragic mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Grant Scharbo and directed by Ivan Passer, ``The
Wishing Tree'' is the kind of unassuming, humanistic and offbeat
story that John Sayles might tell (Woodard, in fact, starred in
Sayles' film ``Passion Fish,'' which shares a fondness for the
storytelling tradition). Even if it becomes a smidgen too
melodramatic in its third act, and if Passer relies a little too
heavily on child performances that aren't quite up to snuff, it's
still a laudable family film that is quietly affecting in its own
fashion. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON''
</P>
<P>
   From Matthew Modine's mawkish performance on down, everything
about the remake of Daniel Keyes' beloved novel, ``Flowers for
Algernon,'' is shamelessly manipulative piffle.
</P>
<P>
   Made in the '60s as ``Charly'' (Cliff Robertson won an Oscar for
his performance in the title role), it's the story of a retarded
man surrounded by oafish palookas who tease him mercilessly _ any
big, dumb mistake is named after him _ a Charly Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Charly's given the chance for brilliance through a radically
experimental operation, which is successful _ but only until a
tragic discovery is made. Whereas Robertson, in the first film, had
a chance to enjoy his time as a genius, Charly here turns bitter
the second he crests the learning curve.
</P>
<P>
   The only improvement this film has on its predecessor is that it
eschews its dated, ultra-groovy split-screens. Otherwise, it's all
too maudlin by half. This movie (BEGIN ITALICS)is(END ITALICS) a
Charly Gordon. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ It was such a classic tale of rags to riches that
Oprah Winfrey featured it. So did the ``Today'' show. A
500-year-old painting that had been lying face down in the attic of
a Massachusetts rectory, a work that a parishioner had described as
``huge, gold and gaudy,'' turned out to be worth $1 million.
Experts at Sotheby's auction house estimated that the painting,
believed to be by the Italian Renaissance artist Andrea del Sarto,
would sell for $1 million to $1.5 million. At an important sale of
old master paintings on Jan. 28, it went for $1.1 million, a record
price for the artist.
</P>
<P>
   But at that point the tale begins to unravel. Before the sale
Sotheby's failed to disclose that in early December the leading
expert on del Sarto, John Shearman, had written to experts in
Sotheby's old masters department to say that he believed the
painting was not wholly by the artist.
</P>
<P>
   In the scholarly world of old master paintings, debates about
authenticity are common and constitute a kind of blood sport.
Experts and art historians often agree to disagree. But opinions
pro and con are generally disclosed, either in a sale's catalog or,
if the discovery has come after the catalog has gone to the
printer, in a salesroom notice. That did not happen this time.
</P>
<P>
   The night before the auction, word leaked out to some of the
world's top dealers in old masters that Shearman, an art history
professor at Harvard University's School of Fine Arts and the
author of a definitive two-volume study of del Sarto, had written
to Sotheby's expressing doubts about the painting, ``Madonna and
Child,'' an oil on panel. Part of it was painted by del Sarto, but
a larger part was probably done by an assistant, Shearman
contended.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Shearman confirmed that he had seen the
painting and infrared photographs of it before the auction. The
same week he viewed the painting in early December, he told
Sotheby's about his findings, he said, but the house ignored his
concerns and made no note of them when its experts wrote the
catalog entry.
</P>
<P>
   An expert at Sotheby's said that Shearman's concerns were
omitted from the catalog because of a problem in communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called John Shearman to see if we could include the letter
in the catalog, but he didn't respond to our phone call,'' said
George Wachter, director of Sotheby's old masters painting
department worldwide. ``We never hid the letter. We showed it to
whoever asked to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shearman, however, said Wednesday: ``I'm very surprised. I
generally return phone calls, and I don't remember getting a
message from Wachter.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's maintains that the work was painted entirely by del
Sarto.
</P>
<P>
   Such controversies over authenticity are fairly common in the
old masters world and this one did not seem to faze the buyers.
Although few people bid at the auction, the painting was sold to
three London dealers, among them Patrick Matthiesen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it baffling I wasn't shown the letter,'' said
Matthiesen, adding that he had nonetheless learned of its existence
just before the sale. ``I am waiting for Sotheby's to send it to
me. Shall we say they are being coy about it?''
</P>
<P>
   The painting depicts the Virgin Mary behind a stone ledge,
holding a book in her right hand and the Christ child in the left,
against a dark background. Shearman said that del Sarto (1486-1530)
painted the Christ child and an underdrawing visible in some areas.
The Virgin, however, was probably painted by one of the artist's
assistants, he said, explaining, ``It's rather hard and
simple-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   The process is murky. The canvas could have been started by the
master and then left lying around his studio, where an assistant
may have picked it up and worked on it. The background was not
finished by del Sarto or an assistant; experts believe it was
painted much later.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 24, four days before the auction, the ``Today'' show on
NBC featured the ``Madonna and Child'' and interviewed the Rev.
William Murray of All Saints Episcopal Church in West Newbury,
Mass. The church received the painting under a bequest from Clara
Winthrop, a parishioner who died in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the show was Christopher T. Apostle, a senior vice
president in Sotheby's old master paintings department. When Ann
Curry, one of the show's anchors, asked Apostle if there was a
chance that the painting was not by the artist, he replied
emphatically: ``There's no question. The universal agreement seems
to be that the painting was made by him.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of ``Madonna and Child'' presented Sotheby's with
an irresistible marketing opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's catalog says that an All Saints Episcopal Church
history refers to the painting as ``a copy made about 1800 of the
original by Andrea del Sarto.'' It hung in the choir stall of the
church until about 20 years ago, when some parishioners who
disliked it had it moved to the rectory attic. From there it
somehow made its way to a closet where Father Murray hangs his
coat.
</P>
<P>
   When the church needed to raise money to repair its building, it
called in Sotheby's and Christie's to appraise the painting.
Anthony Crichton-Stuart, head of Christie's old master paintings
department, visited the church last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was aware of the existence of another version, which is in
the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa and which the museum
believes is by del Sarto,'' Crichton-Stuart said. ``That makes
authenticating this painting more difficult because one would then
be dealing with the question of which version is correct. I thought
this was a most interesting painting, probably from del Sarto's
studio but with condition problems.'' He told the church it was
worth only about $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's experts were more upbeat. ``While all the old
documents said it was a copy, when I saw the painting I realized it
was high quality and from the 16th century,'' Apostle said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Sotheby's old master experts had brought in
scholars who examined the painting with infrared reflectography,
which reveals the drawing beneath a painting's surface. ``We showed
it to curators from the Metropolitan Museum, the National Gallery
in London and an Italian scholar,'' Wachter said. ``They all
thought the painting was by del Sarto.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Sarto was known for his skill as a draftsman. He would often
first make a detailed full-size drawing, blacken the back of it
with carbon and pin the drawing to a panel as if it were tracing
paper. He would then use a stylus to trace the design onto the
panel before painting it. Some of this drawing is visible through
the painting.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers in the old master field who were interested in buying
the painting said that when they asked Sotheby's experts if the
work had been X-rayed to see what was underneath the background,
they were told that there had been none and that an X-ray was not
necessary. (Infrared studies pick up primarily underdrawings made
of carbon; X-rays detect heavy pigments containing lead, used by
16th-century artists, and are considered the best tool for viewing
changes made by an artist.)
</P>
<P>
   Matthiesen, one of the three buyers, who studied under Shearman
at the Courtauld Institute in London, disagrees with the
professor's findings. ``I looked at the painting and came to my own
conclusions,'' he said. ``I feel we have to get the painting into
conservation before we know anything definitively.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was on the ``Today'' show, Apostle talked of the
painting's condition. ``It has great quality despite what you see _
the little specks on the surface,'' he said. ``It's in very good
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   But Matthiesen and several other dealers in old masters called
the condition appalling. White gesso, a plasterlike material used
as an undercoat by artists of the period, is visible, and there are
general signs of wear and of an earlier restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The painting couldn't have been shown in a worse possible
way,'' Matthiesen said. ``It has been cleaned on the figure, and
they were worried what might happen to the background so they left
it alone. They weren't prepared to take that risk.'' The
restoration was ``half-baked,'' he said. ``They couldn't have tried
to make it look worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Matthiesen said, he considered the purchase a good
gamble. ``One is compelled to take risks,'' he said. The three
dealers are having ``Madonna and Child'' restored in Europe, a
process that could take more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he thought Sotheby's acted as it did, Matthiesen
concluded: ``That's salesmanship. It's rather like going to a
secondhand car dealer who says the gloss on the body is perfect but
there's no engine inside.''

 &HT;    Sierra Leone horrors air tonight on CNN
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The boy, 12, was suspected of being a rebel, so armed soldiers
dragged him out onto the street to a pickup truck. He was stripped
naked, thrown into the back of the truck, and the soldiers stomped
on him with their heavy boots while he screamed piteously.
</P>
<P>
   Sorious Samura taped the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used the only weapon I had,'' Samura says. ``My camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Samura, a native of the West African country of Sierra Leone and
a cameraman for a United Nations agency, spent much of last year
videotaping the agony of his country, documenting scene after scene
of gut-wrenching atrocities committed by both sides in a brutal
civil war. His video, which is almost unwatchable at times,
receives its first full airing in the United States tonight on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The government's election slogan during the 1999 campaign had
been ``The future is in your hands,'' which inspired the rebel
forces to cut off the hands of anyone they suspected of being
pro-government. We see adults and children with bloody, unbandaged
stumps; soldiers pumping machine gun fire into a bound man lying on
the ground; public whippings; decaying corpses crawling with flies.
</P>
<P>
   What was it all about? Diamonds, says Samura, the only real
wealth in Sierra Leone. ``Ninety percent of the people in this
country had never seen a diamond, and there they were, having their
arms and legs chopped off.''
</P>
<P>
   Samura's original documentary is 27 minutes long. The hour
special starts out with CNN international anchor Jim Clancy
providing the context, the who's who and why. It's a difficult
story to follow in all its intricacies and could have been
explained better.
</P>
<P>
   Then Samura's documentary runs, without commercial interruption;
you just can't cut away to a funny dot.com commercial after seeing
a baby with one foot. Afterward, Clancy interviews Samura and other
key players in the Sierra Leone conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC would not show Samura's documentary, shot at great peril
to his own life, because it was too graphic. It is as rough as
anything that's ever been shown on U.S. television, but because it
is inarguably important news, without even a whiff of the
sanctimonious hand-wringing that sometimes accompanies tragic news
stories, CNN made the correct, and gutsy, call to air it.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a gutsy call because the folks at CNN know this
special will barely register on Nielsen's radar. International news
stories that don't involve American lives tend not to attract
viewers; stories about Africa are among the worst.
</P>
<P>
   That is the sad truth. The people of Sierra Leone know a lot
about sad truth. The people who have the guts to watch tonight will
know a little more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cry Freetown.''
</P>
<P>
   10 tonight on CNN

`WHAT NIETZSCHE REALLY SAID': A TOP 30 LIST OF MYTHS ABOUT
NIETZSCHE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now many readers have at least an inkling of how much
misunderstanding has surrounded the ideas of the German philosopher
Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), who has been blamed for everything
from killing God to advocating nihilism to inspiring Nazism with
his promotion of the Ubermensch and ``the will to power.''
</P>
<P>
   Such misunderstanding has greatly receded, for after all, as
Robert C. Solomon and Kathleen M. Higgins point out in ``What
Nietzsche Really Said'': ``Nietzsche has had enormous influence on
the 20th century, and he seems to be starting out as the premier
philosopher of the 21st.'' He ``is now the most often cited
philosopher in the Western tradition. His name gets dropped in
novels and movies, from Herman Hesse's `Steppenwolf' and Milan
Kundera's `The Unbearable Lightness of Being,' to `Blazing Saddles'
and `A Fish Called Wanda.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, further clarification of Nietzsche's ideas can never
hurt, and the authors do a useful, even amusing job of it in this
latest entry in Schocken's What They Really Said Series, which so
far has covered Freud, Jung and Darwin. Solomon and Higgins, both
professors of philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin,
employ a number of gimmicks, like lists of Nietzsche's virtues and
digests of his books, to summarize his ideas, yet they also manage
to convey the spirit of his elusive philosophy sensitively.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble, the authors suggest, is that Nietzsche's writing
contains no systematic account of what he thought. His books were
often disjointed, self-contradictory, obscurely aphoristic and
intentionally difficult. His life appears to have been unhappy,
full of pain and suffering and ending in madness in his final
decade. Then there was his sister, Elisabeth, a proto-Nazi married
to a notorious anti-Semite. Their fascist legacy became attached to
Nietzsche's name in the mind of posterity.
</P>
<P>
   To clear this overgrowth, Solomon and Higgins begin with a
section of 30 rumors about Nietzsche that they say should be
forgotten. These range from ``Nietzsche hated Jews'' (not only
didn't he, but he also eventually turned against Wagner because of
the composer's anti-Semitism) to ``Nietzsche had no sex life'' (the
authors give credit to a theory that he may have been gay) to
``Nietzsche sees the Ubermensch as an evolutionary goal'' (on the
contrary, he saw it more as the ideal aim of spiritual development
than as a biological objective).
</P>
<P>
   Following a chapter on Nietzsche's books in which the authors
stress, among other points, how Nietzsche's extreme irony can often
be misleading, they offer ``Nietzsche ad Hominem (Nietzsche's Top
10),'' in which they list both the philosopher's favorite and
unfavorite writers, some of whom, like Socrates, Wagner, Kant and
Schopenhauer, appear on both lists, as Nietzsche's best and worst.
</P>
<P>
   Such playfulness is not only witty and entertaining, it also
allows the authors to approach the same points from several
directions, shading in the varying nuances that Nietzsche brought
to his crucial ideas in different contexts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet interspersed with these faintly gimmicky sections are
chapters that try to reach deeper into Nietzsche's thinking and
stress the positive aspects of his most famous attacks. Two of
these take up his wars against Christianity and morality,
emphasizing that he tore them down only in the hope of replacing
them with something better.
</P>
<P>
   What was that to be? In answering this question, the authors
engage Nietzsche's most elusive ideas, his exhortation that
individuals strive to become more themselves (Be all that they can
be, in the words of the U.S. Army's advertising slogan), by
learning to love their fates (``Amor fati'') and embracing what he
called ``eternal recurrence.''
</P>
<P>
   This last, most difficult-to-define idea the authors see not as
``a theory about the basic structure of time, but a psychological
test'' in which you ask yourself how you feel about repeating your
life. They continue: ``Relishing one's life, with all of its pains
as well as its pleasures, is the affirmation of life. Resentment,
regret and remorse, by contrast, suggest an unwillingness to live
one's life again, exactly as it has been.''
</P>
<P>
   They conclude, ``Life is suffering, Nietzsche asserts (with
Schopenhauer), but the proper response to this is not resentment or
disengagement (as Schopenhauer proposed), but instead wholehearted
`Dionysian' acceptance.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Nietzsche's love of fate, the authors write, ``It is a
judicious outlook for a writer wracked with infirmity, wholly
ignored by the public, to dream of a generation of future readers,
`philosophers of the future,' who would appreciate him.''
</P>
<P>
   This book is simply further evidence that Nietzsche's dream has
come true. Solomon and Higgins not only appreciate him; they also
help us share their understanding.

 &HT;    N.C. FARMERS JOIN $69 MILLION LAWSUIT AGAINST TOBACCO INDUSTRY
 &HT;    450&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By GINGER LIVINGSTON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A $69 million class-action lawsuit was filed
against the nation's top four cigarette makers Wednesday, claiming
they conspired to reduce producers' income by manipulating the
federal system that sets tobacco prices.
</P>
<P>
   The suit by 4,010 farmers and tobacco quota holders, including
1,700 from North Carolina, was filed against Philip Morris Inc.,
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp.,
Lorrillard Tobacco Co. and several of their subsidaries. British
American Tobacco Co. Ltd. was also named.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also names as co-conspirators the 14 attorney generals,
including North Carolina's Mike Easley, involved in the 1998
settlement of the states' health care lawsuits against the
cigarette industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``These farmers and growers have followed every rule and have
been the most loyal to the tobacco companies and are now being cut
out almost overnight,'' said the farmers' attorney, Alexander J.
Pires Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that the tobacco companies violated federal
antitrust laws by manipulating the federal quota system that allows
farmers to grow tobacco. It contends that the tobacco companies set
the quota amounts, even though the program is operated by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also alleges that the tobacco companies encouraged
farmers to oppose federal legislation that would have awarded the
farmers $28 billion in compensation to end the quota system, and
then reached a settlement with the states that provided the growers
with only $5.15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Lorillard officials said, ``It is always
unfortunate when customers are sued by their suppliers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies are not responsible for recent market changes
that have frustrated farmers, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we share many of the same frustrations, we do not
believe a frivolous lawsuit, organized and encouraged by a
Washington D.C. trial lawyer, can possibly play any constructive
role in addressing the many issues facing the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Pires settled a $1.2 billion civil rights class action against
the U.S. Department of Agriculture involving 19,000
African-American farmers. He predicted Wednesday that another
25,000 of the nation's 525,000 tobacco farmers would join the
lawsuit by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, currently presiding
over the federal antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft Corp., has
been assigned the case.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Farmers at the news conference said tobacco industry
representatives led them to believe tobacco purchases would remain
constant and perhaps increase if the legislation was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be part of this lawsuit. I was one of the
last to join,'' said farmer Sammy Tant of Rocky Mount, N.C. ``But
they already hung us out to dry and all but cut us out of the
formula for making cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Harnett County, N.C., farmer Keith Parrish said joining the suit
was a difficult decision for most tobacco farmers.
</P>
<P>
   He said tobacco companies want to eliminate quotas so they can
directly contract with tobacco farmers instead of buying through
auction. That would be a system ``where you are a serf, an employee
of the company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish acknowledged that tobacco company representatives never
explicitly said they would keep purchasing tobacco at mid-1990s
levels when persuading farmers to lobby against the compensation
program.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish said the farmers were told, ``if you like what we did
last year (1996), you'll like what we do next.'' Since quota
amounts went up in 1996, Parrish said farmers assumed that would
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers had no reason to distrust tobacco industry
representatives, Tant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to the mail box and the mail's there every day you
expect it's going to be there every day,'' Tant said. ``They worked
with us for so long, were there for us and called us family for so
long that we started to believe we were family.''
</P>
<P>
   However, quotas for flue-cured tobacco, the type grown in North
Carolina, were reduced more than 18 percent this year, and farmers
predict it could be reduced another 20 to 30 percent in coming
years.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers attending Wednesday's press conference said their share
of the settlement would compensate them for less than 10 percent of
their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Tant farmed 173 acres of tobacco in 1997 and will farm 108 acres
this year. He said he has invested $200,000 to $300,000 in new
equipment and tobacco allotment purchases. The value of that
investment has dropped between 50 percent to 75 percent, he said.
The harvester he spent $70,000 on would only bring him $20,000
today. A single tobacco barn cost $15,000 in 1997, he said, and
``I'd have to hold a gun to someone to sell it for $4,000.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A $69 million class-action lawsuit was filed
against the nation's top four cigarette makers Wednesday, claiming
they conspired to reduce producers' income by manipulating the
federal system that sets tobacco prices.
</P>
<P>
   The suit by 4,010 farmers and tobacco quota holders, including
1,700 from North Carolina, was filed against Philip Morris Inc.,
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp.,
Lorrillard Tobacco Co. and several of their subsidaries. British
American Tobacco Co. Ltd. was also named.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also names as co-conspirators the 14 attorney generals,
including North Carolina's Mike Easley, involved in the 1998
settlement of the states' health care lawsuits against the
cigarette industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``These farmers and growers have followed every rule and have
been the most loyal to the tobacco companies and are now being cut
out almost overnight,'' said the farmers' attorney, Alexander J.
Pires Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that the tobacco companies violated federal
antitrust laws by manipulating the federal quota system that allows
farmers to grow tobacco. It contends that the tobacco companies set
the quota amounts, even though the program is operated by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also alleges that the tobacco companies encouraged
farmers to oppose federal legislation that would have awarded the
farmers $28 billion in compensation to end the quota system, and
then reached a settlement with the states that provided the growers
with only $5.15 billion.

ARTS ABROAD :  EUROPEANS CELEBRATE THEIR FREEDOM TO DWELL IN
HOLLYWOOD'S SHADOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ For its 50th anniversary edition, the Berlin Film
Festival has moved its headquarters from the former West Berlin to
Potsdamer Platz, a new urban complex that symbolizes the
unification and rebirth of this long-divided city. Yet while the
festival now has a home fit for the 21st century, the Berlinale, as
it is widely known, is still struggling to find a new identity 10
years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, things were often easier in the past. Veteran movie
directors from Eastern Europe can still be heard lamenting that
capitalism has proven to be a stricter censor than Communism. It
was always possible to find obtuse or allegorical ways of telling
the truth under Communism, they say, but there is no way of
circumventing the restrictions imposed by commercial budget and
distribution systems.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a parallel in the Berlinale. When this was a
divided and occupied city, the West Berlin festival had a clear
political mission, first as a showcase of democratic freedom, then
as a cultural bridge between East and West. Now, with Berlin
reunited and the Soviet bloc a thing of the past, the festival
seems to be adrift in the no man's land that divides the global
movie industry between the United States and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   This year's 10-day festival, which ends on Sunday, is therefore
a less than satisfying compromise. It is presenting a half-dozen
big-budget American movies, which have been released in the United
States and are merely using this festival as a springboard for
European distribution. But the Berlinale needs the glamour of
Hollywood stars: the world learns about it only because
photographers are willing to mob the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio
(here to promote ``The Beach'') or Gwyneth Paltrow (here for the
showing of ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'').
</P>
<P>
   This in turn reflects a reality beyond the festival's control:
the United States so dominates world cinema that it leaves little
room for anyone else. In most of Europe, including Germany,
American films account for 80 to 90 percent of ticket sales; only
in France, where government subsidies have kept the movie industry
alive, does the American share drop to around 70 percent. Thus if
few foreign-language movies reach the United States, few also find
markets elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting scores of smaller movies from around the world,
the festival offers ample evidence that cinema is alive and well
outside the United States. Actors and directors from Spain to Japan
may wander around Berlin unnoticed, although even winning the
festival's awards, known as Bears, is no guarantee of wider
recognition. The talents and concerns of moviemakers working
outside the glare of Hollywood can nonetheless be seen here.
Perhaps surprisingly, politics are still an issue. A comedy from
Croatia called ``Marsal'' (known in English as ``Marshall Tito's
Spirit''), directed by Vinko Bresan, illustrates that country's
confused transition from Communism to capitalism by telling of an
apparition of Tito on a Croatian island. The mayor, having
privatized government properties and bought them on the cheap for
himself, now spots a new business opportunity: he invites veteran
Tito loyalists to contact the ghost and turns the island into a
Communist theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Balkans have proven adept at tackling their recent
tragedies with dark humor. ``Nebaska Udica'' (``Sky Hook''), which
was made by the Serbian director Ljubisa Samardzic during NATO's
bombing of Belgrade last April, tells of a group of beer-swilling
layabouts, including Kaja (Nebojsa Glogovac), whose 7-year-old son
has been struck mute by the bombing. Their main concern is to
rebuild their devastated basketball court, but the underlying theme
is their inability to influence the conflict disrupting their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piao Ling Ma Ma'' (``Breaking the Silence''), directed by Sun
Zhou, also deals with contemporary events, this time in a China
hurriedly embracing the profits and perils of capitalism. This
serves as the background to a touching tale of a divorced mother,
played by the Chinese star Gong Li, as she struggles to have her
deaf 8-year-old son accepted in a regular school. Even with cuts
demanded by the Chinese authorities, the film captures the hardship
faced by many ordinary Chinese with the arrival of a market economy
and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, ``Russkij Bunt'' (``The Captain's Daughter''),
directed by Alexander Proshkin and adapted from two stories by
Pushkin, is a ``Dr. Zhivago''-like epic set in the 18th century. It
blends a love story with an account of the peasant uprising led by
an impostor posing as the czar, Yemelya Pugachev (Sergei
Machovecki). For all the film's snow, beards, swords and horses,
however, the director believes it to be topical. ``Our age, like
the times of Catherine II, is an age where morals have lost their
value, an age of swift career making and instantaneous downfalls,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A certain nostalgia also permeates Akira Ogata's first film,
``Boys' Choir,'' which is set in a Japan of the early 1970s where a
student movement with revolutionary dreams is facing defeat and
leaving an entire generation feeling pessimistic about the future.
The story focuses on two boys in a Christian boarding school where
a young pastor is trying to create his own version of the Vienna
Boys Choir. His past as a radical, however, catches up with him.
</P>
<P>
   Volker Schloendorff's new movie, ``The Legends of Rita,'' also
goes back to the radical movement of the 1970s, this time in West
Germany. When the movement collapses, Rita Vogt (Bibinana Beglau)
flees to East Germany, is given a new identity as a factory worker
and confronts the grimness of life under Communism. But when East
Germany finally implodes, she cannot escape responsibility for her
earlier terrorism in the West.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Still, most new movies from Europe show little interest in
politics, although several reflect the gradual blending of European
culture. Francois Ozon, an up-and-coming young French director, has
adapted an unstaged 1970 play by the German director Rainer Werner
Fassbinder, ``Water Drops on Burning Rocks,'' for the screen. Even
more of an international cocktail is ``Signs and Wonders,'' a new
film by the American director Jonathan Nossiter: it was financed by
a French company, made in English and set in Athens. It stars a
Swede (Stellan Skarsgard), a Briton (Charlotte Rampling), an
American (Deborah Kara Unger) and a Greek (Dimitris Katalifos).
</P>
<P>
   These films also offer human close-ups rather than social
statements. Ozon's movie, for instance, tells of a middle-aged man
who takes a young male lover only to find their menage a deux
disturbed by their former girlfriends. In ``Signs and Wonders'' a
man leaves his wife for a younger woman; when he decides to return
home, his wife has found happiness with another man, but his
pre-teen-age daughter proves to be a perverse ally.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf Thome's ``Paradiso'' tells of a composer who celebrates
his 60th birthday with the seven most important lovers in his life.
Some critics described the film as a male fantasy; Thome said he
was being ironic.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the festival's Hollywood imports, which also include
``Three Kings,'' ``Magnolia,'' ``The Hurricane,'' ``Any Given
Sunday'' and ``Man on the Moon,'' there are other English-language
movies, not only small independent films from the United States but
also fare from the British Isles, including ``Saltwater,'' an
impressive directing debut by the young Irish playwright Conor
McPherson (``The Weir''), who also wrote the screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Branagh's latest Shakespeare, ``Love's Labour's Lost,''
though, seems closer to Hollywood in the 1950s than London in 1600.
Starring Alessandro Nivola as the king of Navarre and Alicia
Silverstone as the princess of France, with Branagh's Berowne
busily wooing Natascha McElhone's Rosaline, the film is peppered
with songs by Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and George Gershwin and
dance numbers inspired by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. In a nod
to Esther Williams, one scene even has the princess and her ladies
in waiting performing synchronized swimming. All of which goes to
prove that Shakespeare can survive anything.

SPRINGER SPANIEL LEADS DOGGIEDOM INTO THE NEW CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The century of the springer? At the country's most
prestigious dog show Tuesday night, at Madison Square Garden, the
first dog of the new millennium turned out to be a jaunty little
liver-and-white English springer spaniel named Samantha, or, as
she's officially named, Ch. (Champion) Salilyn 'N Erin's Shameless.
</P>
<P>
   If this top dog foretells our future, we are in for 100 years of
unfussy, handsome, good old American can-do style _ with a little
bit of sentimentality thrown in, too. This dog has just the kind of
background that the aficionados of the Westminster Kennel Club
love.
</P>
<P>
   After months and years of campaigning purebred dogs in shows
around the country, 2,500 champions of record, representing 156
breeds, land at this dog show, the second-oldest sporting event in
the country and the Super Bowl of canine conformation. The price of
getting here can run as high as $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Westminster is glitz, glamour, and drool. With black-tie events
(one of the hottest tickets being the Ken-L Ration dinner), awards
ceremonies, schmoozing, gossiping, and, of course, dog showing.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, individual breeds are judged. In the evening, they
compete to represent their group. Working, terrier, toy, and
non-sporting on Monday night. Sporting, hounds, herding, and best
in show, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That 2,500 turned into just seven hot dogs at about 10:30
Tuesday night. There was the standard poodle, a moving topiary of
white hair. A sleek Doberman pinscher. The superstar springer. A
lamb-like Bedlington terrier (who took a moment to relieve himself
at the entrance). The Shih Tzu with the blue hair doodad. The
almost comically dignified basset hound. And the foxy little
Pembroke Welsh corgi. All trotting out onto that trademark green
carpet.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, a titan of the dog show world and president of
Westminster, Chester Collier, focused on the dogs as they strutted
in front of him. Despite the buzz that the poodle, 1999's
top-ranked Ch. Lakecove That's My Boy, nicknamed Treson, would be a
shoo-in, and despite the crowd's enthusiasm for that sad-eyed
basset, Astro, it was Samantha, with her flowing skirt of perfectly
groomed hair, who swept the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted it,'' Collier said later, confusing this bitch, as
they say in these parts, with a dog, ``and he got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though this 5-year-old girl has quite a winning record, she
was not an expected winner. She really did prove herself Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Her handler, Kellie Fitzgerald, kept saying that she represents
her ancestors. Samantha's father, Robert, or Ch. Salilyns Condor,
took best in show in 1993. That was a memorable win, in part,
because one of his owners, a 92-year-old beloved grande dame of the
sport, Julia Gasow, surprised everyone by coming to the Garden at
the last moment despite the fact that her husband had recently
died. That night turned out to be her first best-in-show win at
Westminster.
</P>
<P>
   Gasow, who died last year, also co-owned Samantha. When this
spirited little springer took the top trophy, the crowd cheered and
co-owner Carl Blaine took a moment to look up past the Garden's
rafters, and say, ``This is for you, Julie.''
</P>
<P>
   Samantha, for her part, wagged her stub of a tail as she sat on
the purple winner's rug. Cameras clicked and reporters from around
the world shouted questions to Fitzgerald. Dave Frei, one of the
hosts of USA Channel's Westminster coverage, put his arm around
Fitzgerald just before the cameras rolled and whispered to her that
she should do ``Good Morning America'' with him the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha is scheduled for a busy press day, a lunch at Sardi's,
where she is supposed to get steak, and then retirement. Sort of.
All this fame will give way to romance. Her pups will be worth a
lot and she is due to come into season very soon. She is expected
to carry on a line that goes back more than 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night in Madison Square Garden, Blaine remembered the
evening when he and Gasow sipped gin and tonics after the win. She
had it absolutely right, he recalled. ``She said there's nothing
like it in the world.''

   Apple made no new-hardware announcements at its big Macworld
computer show in San Francisco last month, but it made up for the
lapse in Japan Wednesday when it unveiled new and upgraded versions
of its PowerMac, PowerBook and iBook product lines.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to capitalize on the surprising success of the
graphite-colored iMac Special Edition desktop computer that it
introduced late last year, Apple introduced a special edition of
its iBook notebook. But aside from a new color scheme and a modest
increase in processing power, the new iBook SE is not as special as
its desktop counterpart, whose appeal included more memory, a
bigger hard disk and a DVD drive.
</P>
<P>
   The new iBook SE ($1,799) has the cool graphite-and-ice color
scheme of the iMac SE, and it has a 366-megahertz G3 processor, up
from the 300 MHz offered in the original iBooks. Otherwise it has
the same 64 megabytes of RAM, 6 gigabytes of hard disk space and
CD-ROM drive that Apple offers in its upgraded orange and blue
iBook siblings.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 300-MHz iBooks, still available in either
orange or blue models, remains unchanged at $1,599, despite the
doubling of memory and hard disk capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The more impressive portable Macintosh announcements came at the
high end, as Apple substantially upgraded the performance of its G3
PowerBooks. The new PowerBooks keep the same physical design but
come in 400-MHz and 500-MHz models. Both have an Airport wireless
networking antenna, a DVD drive, better 2-D and 3-D graphics, and a
pair of high-speed Firewire (IEEE 1394) ports for working with
digital video.
</P>
<P>
   The new 500-MHz PowerBook, which costs $3,499, has 128 MB of
memory and a 12-GB hard disk. Apple says it weighs 6.1 pounds with
a high-capacity battery. For an extra $500, the hard disk capacity
swells to 18 GB. The 400-MHz PowerBook comes with 64 MB of memory
and a 6-GB hard disk and costs $2,499.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements of new and more powerful versions of Apple's
G4 desktop computers were somewhat anticlimactic, in that Apple had
originally announced them last year but failed to deliver when it
could not get enough of the high-end chips from Motorola. Apple now
says it has a reliable supply of the 500-MHz G4 chips, so it simply

   New Online Photo Network For Speedier Processing
</P>
<P>
   For people who are tired of hanging around the mall waiting for
photos to be processed at the one-hour photo developing store, help
is on the way. Canon USA and PhotoLoft.com, an online photo-sharing
site, have joined forces to create the HyperPhoto Network, which
will provide a number of services for picture takers.
</P>
<P>
   To use the HyperPhoto Network, customers just drop off film or
digital camera cards at a photo lab that is participating in the
program. While at the lab, customers receive a password and album
identification number. With that data, they can log on to the
HyperPhoto Network (available from a link on www.imageland.net) and
view their photographic efforts online on their home computer less
than 24 hours later. The user can also order prints of the images,
send personalized photo cards and decorated gift items through the
Postal Service, and fire off customized electronic cards.
</P>
<P>
   The HyperPhoto Network is now partially operating, with full
services expected in the spring; the network is aiming to sign up
50,000 dealers nationwide. Because of the network's coverage, users
will also be able to drop off their film in one location and have
the finished prints made available for pickup someplace else _ even
a different state. If it all works, it could make for some very
satisfied grandparents around the country. &QL;

   For Home Users, No Need To Rush Out for Windows 2000
</P>
<P>
   Most home computer users can safely ignore Windows 2000, which
goes on sale Thursday as the newest version of Microsoft Corp.'s
flagship operating system software. Windows 2000 is designed mainly
for large corporations and network-intensive businesses. Even
Microsoft concedes that it is not designed for the majority of
individual PC users.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 does have features that could appeal to small
businesses and even some portable computer users. It is less likely
to crash than the Windows NT software it replaces and is much more
stable than Windows 98. But that is partly because it does not even
attempt to work with the wide variety of common software
applications and peripheral devices that most home PC users have
installed on their Windows 98 systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is developing another version of Windows, called the
Millennium Edition, or Windows ME, specifically for individual
users. Windows ME is scheduled for release later this year, a
Microsoft product manager said, and will replace Windows 98 as the
basic operating system on millions of new personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who are sorely tempted to pay $219 to upgrade to
Windows 2000 Professional from Windows 98 ought to remember that
every new Microsoft operating system invariably contains bugs that
are addressed in a follow-up service pack a few months later. It is
always prudent to wait for the second edition of new software.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse
gets the cheese. &QL;

   Tantalizing Hope: Looking for Yeti
</P>
<P>
   In the past nine months, the SETI(at)home screen saver has
become a huge hit. The program has been loaded onto more than
1-and-a-half million home and office computers, where it is eagerly
crunching through recorded radio signals from space (distributed
via the Web) looking for signs of extraterrestrial life.
</P>
<P>
   So far not a single alien sitcom has come wafting through the
ether. The site, however, has proved that there is life on the
Internet: it has spawned a Web spoof, YETI(at)home.
</P>
<P>
   The YETI site (www.phobe.com/yeti) captures the look and feel of
the SETI site (www.setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu), down to the
teasing come-on about the ``small but tantalizing possibility''
that the user will detect not alien life forms but ``the faint
footsteps of a hairy monster,'' otherwise known as Sasquatch,
Bigfoot or the Abominable Snowman.
</P>
<P>
   The YETI site says that anyone with a computer, a digital
camera, a window and a backyard can participate and that the
resulting images will be processed by millions of computers in
``the largest completely unscientific study of nonexistent
phenomenon to date.''
</P>
<P>
   YETI(at)home doesn't offer any software, but you get the sense
that even so, the site's author thinks the odds of finding a yeti
are better than the chances of finding E.T. &QL;

ROOKIES REVVED UP FOR DAYTONA RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Tony Stewart established a standard for
NASCAR Winston Cup rookies last year. The 28-year-old driver of the
No. 20 Home Depot Pontiac compiled three victories, two pole
positions, 12 top five finishes, and 21 top 10s in winning
$3,190,149.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart finished fourth in the final Winston Cup point standings
to become only the third to make the top five. Even though he ran
away with Rookie of the Year honors, Stewart knows he would have
been hard-pressed to achieve those feats if he were in this year's
class of Winston Cup rookies, regarded by many veterans to be the
deepest and most talented crop in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rate 'em pretty high,'' said Stewart. ``They've got a good
batch of credentials and they're all here because they deserve to
be in Winston Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   To say NASCAR's eight-man rookie class is an eclectic group
would be an understatement. All of them will be gunning to qualify
for the 42d Daytona 500 when they line up Thursday in the Gatorade
Twin 125s, a pair of 125-mile qualifiers that will set the 43-car
field for Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty impressive class of rookies, that's for sure,''
said Jeff Gordon, a three-time Winston Cup champion who was the
1993 Rookie of the Year. ``I don't know how anybody is going to top
what Tony Stewart did last year. That was pretty amazing. But if
anybody could do it, it's this rookie class that we've got coming
up this year.''
</P>
<P>
   They will be led by reigning two-time Busch champion Dale
Earnhardt Jr., who will drive a Budweiser-sponsored Chevrolet for
his father, the seven-time Winston Cup champion. ``I'm so pumped up
for Daytona,'' said Earnhardt Jr. of his much-anticipated rookie
campaign. ``It's like waiting for a package to come in the mail.
You can't wait to open it and play with the toy inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr., 25, most likely will be challenged by Matt
Kenseth, 27, a familiar Busch rival who is considered to be the
Roush Racing protege of veteran Mark Martin; Scott Pruett, 39, a
former open-wheel driver from the CART who was the fastest rookie
(lap of 189.47 miles per hour) at Saturday's pole qualifications in
his Tide-sponsored Ford Taurus; and Dave Blaney, 37, a former USAC
and World of Outlaws sprint car champion who was the second-fastest
rookie (189.31) when qualified 10th in his Amoco-sponsored Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, most of the attention is on Dale Jr.,'' Gordon
said. ``But I'll tell you what, Matt Kenseth is a talented driver,
and he's got Roush behind him so I think he and Junior are going to
have some more battles out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the rookies will be distinguished by yellow stripes on
their rear bumpers, the elder Earnhardt believes it is a formality
in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they come into the sport, they're a lot more in tune _
and smarter _ to what's going on in Winston Cup racing with the
cars,'' Earnhardt said. ``So it's really not totally like being in
the dark when they hop in a Winston Cup race car. But I think the
rookie crop's been really good for the last couple of years, and
it's getting better, it seems, every year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Class of 2000 will be rounded out by former NASCAR Craftsman
Truck drivers Stacy Compton, 32, who will drive the No. 9 Kodiak
Ford Taurus for Mark Melling; Mike Bliss, 34, who will drive A.J.
Foyt's No. 14 Conseco Pontiac; and Jeff Fuller, 42, of Auburn,
Mass., a former Busch Rookie of the Year and NASCAR Featherlite
Modified champion who will pilot Eel River Racing's No. 27 Viagra
Pontiac that is owned by Boston businessman Jack Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '95, we came down here and we were a rookie (in the Busch
Series), people see the yellow stripe on the bumper, which is a big
giveaway to being a rookie,'' Fuller said. ``But sometimes you have
concerns about which rookies you can race and which ones you can't,
and a lot of that is due to the respect you get from other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they know you came up the hard way and paid your dues, then
they're more likely to cut you some slack and let you in line or
cut you a break. I think that, with the drivers in the Winston Cup
series, we're going to adapt just fine. I think this is going to be
a pretty competitive class, maybe the strongest class that NASCAR
has ever seen. Obviously, every one of us is looking forward to it
and we fully expect to be a contender for Rookie of the Year.''

LEADER OF GERMANY'S CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS ABRUPTLY QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The crisis of the conservative party that has governed
and stabilized Germany for most of the postwar years deepened
Wednesday with the abrupt resignation of its leader, Wolfgang
Schaeuble.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Schaeuble, who was handpicked by former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl to be his successor as party chairman in
1998, leaves the opposition Christian Democratic Union rudderless
at a time of profound shifts in the political landscape of
German-speaking Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Joerg Haider's Freedom Party in Austria has
illustrated the potential attraction of a nationalist right in a
Europe now more fearful of globalization than communism.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, the plight of German Christian Democracy,
the only mass movement of the moderate right here, is causing
widespread concern.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble directly addressed those concerns Wednesday as he
quit. ``The crisis of the Christian Democratic Union must not be
permitted to become a crisis in our democracy,'' he said. ``For
that reason it is imperative that the Christian Democrats remain
the main integrating force at the center of German politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But battered by a financial scandal that has included
disclosures that Kohl accepted $1 million in cash from anonymous
donors while he was chancellor, can the party that has governed
Germany for 37 of the postwar years remain such a crucial
``integrating force''?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Konrad Adenauer guided the reconstruction of West
Germany after World War II, operating under the slogan ``no
experiments,'' the party has embodied German conservatism while
dampening nationalist or extremist temptations. Its current debacle
has therefore opened the possibility of a troubling void on the
German right.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the deepest moment of the party's troubles, but I
still don't see a total dismemberment,'' said Hans-Peter Moeller, a
political analyst. ``German Christian Democracy is a resilient
beast, but one now desperately in need of new blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Who among a generation of Christian Democrats now in their 40s
could provide such an injection of new energy remains unclear. What
is clear is that this generation is being hurriedly pushed toward
national responsibility at a time when the party is morally and
financially close to bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble, 57, represented the old school, one now tainted by
its association with the system of illicit financing put in place
by Kohl. Schaeuble vowed repeatedly to see his party through the
crisis, but in the end, his credibility lay in tatters, and even
his most loyal lieutenants had deserted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian Democratic Union is in the midst of the worst
crisis of its history,'' Schaeuble acknowledged Wednesday.
``Violations have been committed against party laws and the
principle of transparency in ways we never imagined possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The party was fined $21 million Tuesday by the speaker of
Parliament, Wolfgang Thierse of the governing Social Democratic
Party. The punishment was for the Christian Democrats' acceptance
of tens of millions of dollars in illegal contributions during the
1980s and 1990s. Article 21 of the German constitution says parties
``must publicly account for the sources of their funds.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The last two months have seen almost incessant disclosures about
the illicit practices of the Christian Democrats during Kohl's
16-year rule, which ended in 1998. Accounts of cash donations in
paper bags and payments from secret Swiss accounts have had a
shattering effect on the party.
</P>
<P>
   The gravity of the illegal transactions was brought home by the
size of the fine announced by Thierse. ``The official recognition
that the party will have to carry this enormous financial burden
was the straw that broke the camel's back,'' wrote Johann Michael
Moeller in the conservative daily Die Welt.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble's resignation accentuated pressure on Kohl to quit the
party and give up his seat in Parliament. The former chancellor,
whose enormous achievement was to unite Germany while reassuring
its Western allies that the old Adenauer slogan of ``no
experiments'' still applied, has disappeared from public view.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has stubbornly refused to reveal the donors who gave him $1
million between 1993 and 1998, saying that he gave them his ``word
of honor'' that he would protect their anonymity. In effect, he has
placed his ``honor'' above the Constitution to which he swore
allegiance each time he took office as chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   This defiance has had a troubling effect on Germany, a country
that places particular store by the rule of law because of the
wholesale way in which the law was flouted by the Third Reich. A
recent survey showed that 72 percent of Germans now believe that
Kohl should resign from parliament and his party.
</P>
<P>
   But he is well known to be a man of unusual obstinacy and up to
now there has been no sign that he intends to change his position.
As long as he remains silent, the efforts of the Christian
Democrats to overcome their crisis will clearly be complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The post-Cold War years in Europe have already seen the
disintegration of the Italian Christian Democratic party that
governed Italy for decades after World War II, and crises of
British and French conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   At least two basic problems of these parties are shared: the
disappearance of the old communist enemy against which definition
was simple, and the move of the left toward centrist and pro-market
positions once occupied by conservatives. But nowhere does a crisis
of the moderate right raise more alarming specters than in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in German-speaking Europe, Haider's anti-immigrant
party has seen its support surge to more than 27 percent from 5
percent in the past 15 years. Also, Christoph Blocher's Swiss
People's Party has increased its vote share to more than 20 percent
with a message carrying nationalist echoes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is for this reason that Gerhard Schroeder, the Social
Democratic chancellor, has repeatedly said that Christian Democracy
must and will survive. At times, however, he has appeared to insist
too much.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble clearly decided Wednesday that his own ambitions to be
chancellor could no longer outweigh an obligation to save the
party. ``Without a clear change in personnel, we will not be able
to liberate ourselves from this crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two days, he has been bitterly criticized by
party leaders in two states _ Schleswig-Holstein and North
Rhine-Westphalia _ facing elections over the next three months.
These regional officials had clearly perceived that the party was
heading for a rout unless it changed its leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are leaderless and lame,'' Kurt Wuerzbach, the party chief
in Schleswig Holstein said earlier this week. ``I don't think
Wolfgang Schaeuble would be well advised to run again for his
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurgen Ruttgers, the party's candidate in a critical state
election in North Rhine-Westphalia in May, had also said ``a new
beginning'' was essential. Aged 48, he will now be one of the
candidates to replace Schaeuble when a decision is made at the
party congress in April.
</P>
<P>
   Other leading candidates include Angela Merkel, the 45-year-old
general-secretary of the party, whose evident outrage at the
revelations over the past two months and equally evident
determination to root out corruption in the party have furthered
her cause.
</P>
<P>
   What is already clear is that whoever is chosen will have to
prove that the Christian Democrats can still represent the
deep-rooted strains of German conservatism in a way convincing to
what is now a skeptical and troubled electorate.

SPRINGER SPANIEL LEADS DOGGIEDOM INTO THE NEW CENTURY

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The century of the springer? At the country's most
prestigious dog show Tuesday night, at Madison Square Garden, the
first dog of the new millennium turned out to be a jaunty little
liver-and-white English springer spaniel named Samantha, or, as
she's officially named, Ch. (Champion) Salilyn 'N Erin's Shameless.
</P>
<P>
   If this top dog foretells our future, we are in for 100 years of
unfussy, handsome, good old American can-do style _ with a little
bit of sentimentality thrown in, too. This dog has just the kind of
background that the aficionados of the Westminster Kennel Club
love.
</P>
<P>
   After months and years of campaigning purebred dogs in shows
around the country, 2,500 champions of record, representing 156
breeds, land at this dog show, the second-oldest sporting event in
the country and the Super Bowl of canine conformation. The price of
getting here can run as high as $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Westminster is glitz, glamour, and drool. With black-tie events
(one of the hottest tickets being the Ken-L Ration dinner), awards
ceremonies, schmoozing, gossiping, and, of course, dog showing.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, individual breeds are judged. In the evening, they
compete to represent their group. Working, terrier, toy, and
non-sporting on Monday night. Sporting, hounds, herding, and best
in show, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That 2,500 turned into just seven hot dogs at about 10:30
Tuesday night. There was the standard poodle, a moving topiary of
white hair. A sleek Doberman pinscher. The superstar springer. A
lamb-like Bedlington terrier (who took a moment to relieve himself
at the entrance). The Shih Tzu with the blue hair doodad. The
almost comically dignified basset hound. And the foxy little
Pembroke Welsh corgi. All trotting out onto that trademark green
carpet.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, a titan of the dog show world and president of
Westminster, Chester Collier, focused on the dogs as they strutted
in front of him. Despite the buzz that the poodle, 1999's
top-ranked Ch. Lakecove That's My Boy, nicknamed Treson, would be a
shoo-in, and despite the crowd's enthusiasm for that sad-eyed
basset, Astro, it was Samantha, with her flowing skirt of perfectly
groomed hair, who swept the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted it,'' Collier said later, confusing this bitch, as
they say in these parts, with a dog, ``and he got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though this 5-year-old girl has quite a winning record, she
was not an expected winner. She really did prove herself Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Her handler, Kellie Fitzgerald, kept saying that she represents
her ancestors. Samantha's father, Robert, or Ch. Salilyns Condor,
took best in show in 1993. That was a memorable win, in part,
because one of his owners, a 92-year-old beloved grande dame of the
sport, Julia Gasow, surprised everyone by coming to the Garden at
the last moment despite the fact that her husband had recently
died. That night turned out to be her first best-in-show win at
Westminster.
</P>
<P>
   Gasow, who died last year, also co-owned Samantha. When this
spirited little springer took the top trophy, the crowd cheered and
co-owner Carl Blaine took a moment to look up past the Garden's
rafters, and say, ``This is for you, Julie.''
</P>
<P>
   Samantha, for her part, wagged her stub of a tail as she sat on
the purple winner's rug. Cameras clicked and reporters from around
the world shouted questions to Fitzgerald. Dave Frei, one of the
hosts of USA Channel's Westminster coverage, put his arm around
Fitzgerald just before the cameras rolled and whispered to her that
she should do ``Good Morning America'' with him the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha is scheduled for a busy press day, a lunch at Sardi's,
where she is supposed to get steak, and then retirement. Sort of.
All this fame will give way to romance. Her pups will be worth a
lot and she is due to come into season very soon. She is expected
to carry on a line that goes back more than 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night in Madison Square Garden, Blaine remembered the
evening when he and Gasow sipped gin and tonics after the win. She
had it absolutely right, he recalled. ``She said there's nothing
like it in the world.''

CUBA IS SPREADING INTERNATIONAL MESSAGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Nieves Dinora graduated from high school in Nicaragua
with good grades and no prospects. Since her father, a farmer, had
no money to send her to college, she figured marriage and
motherhood were her only options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many of my friends there, I thought I would take the
nine-month career,'' she said. ``It does not cost anything, just
nine months. Easy, no?''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than having babies, Dinora is now learning how to
deliver them. She is among 1,900 students at the Latin American
School of Medical Sciences who are enrolled in a six-year program
that is a unique twist on the old concept of overseas medical
schools. While many people think a Caribbean campus is the
last-ditch resort for foreign students with fat wallets but slim
grades, this one is the exact opposite, giving full scholarships to
smart youths from poor rural areas in 18 Latin American and
Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
   The medical school is the Cuban government's response to the
devastation from Hurricanes Georges and Mitch, which ripped through
the region in 1998, killing thousands as they destroyed villages
and spawned public health problems. While Cuba sent medical teams
to help, officials realized that it would be better in the long run
to help educate a new generation of doctors who would return to
their impoverished countries and work in remote communities where
medical care was spotty and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life has shown us some lessons that we cannot forget,'' said
Juan Carizo Estevez, the school's rector. ``That is the necessity
of the right to health care that these countries have. We have a
responsibility that these students return to their own countries
with a solid foundation for dealing with the problems of public
health they will find.''
</P>
<P>
   The new medical school is the culmination of the Cuban
government's decades of reliance on its reputation as a medically
advanced society to burnish its international image. Starting in
1963, when it sent a team of doctors and nurses to Algeria, the
government has gone on to establish medical schools in the Third
World, send thousands of Cuban doctors for long-term overseas
assignments and offer scholarships to study alongside Cuban
students in the island's medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   Medical aid was as important an aspect of President Fidel
Castro's aid to the Third World as his nation's training of
guerrilla and terrorist groups was during the Cold War. While Cold
War conflicts have died down, Cuba's latest experiment in medical
education is still tinged with the passions from that era.
</P>
<P>
   ``By doing good, particularly in the field of health and
education, Cuba would look better than the United States,'' said
Julie Feinsilver, author of ``Healing the Masses'' (Berkeley,
1993), which examined the role of health care in Cuba's foreign and
domestic policy. ``This is a symbolic war, not that the U.S. looks
at it that way. But Fidel said when he finished the revolution, his
real destiny was war against the U.S. The war is not a material
war, but a symbolic war. Anything that Cuba does that enhances its
prestige on the world stage, which medical diplomacy and providing
scholarships does, is a battle won for Cuba vs. the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The school's very location is a sign of the changing
battleground _ it occupies 82 blue and white buildings that hug the
ocean along the campus of what had been an academy for naval
officers and merchant mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Students were selected through tests and interviews and are
mostly chosen by their home countries. The first contingent, from
Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador, the areas hit hardest by the
hurricanes, arrived almost a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials said they started the school as a gesture of
international good will, and that they did not intend to politicize
the students. Still, many students spoke about how many doctors in
their countries were interested only in making money while the poor
languished and children died from preventable diseases, echoing a
common Cuban critique of modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Edmundo Blandon, 20, recalled how his mother in Nicaragua
suffered from pains for years, being told all the time that she
only had a kidney infection. Unable to see a specialist, she
suffered and waited for two years until her daughter took a loan
from a co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a child, you see how in your family there are needs for a
doctor to help you,'' Blandon said. ``When she was 59, she finally
learned she had advanced cancer. She could not have had the medical
tests done earlier, because we did not have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   She died soon after he enrolled in the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had felt bad because she thought I would leave this school
because of her,'' he said. ``But she told me that in the first
place, nothing could be done for her. So, if I was left alone with
nobody to look after, I should take advantage of this
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The students begin with six months of pre-medical studies in
basic sciences like physics, chemistry and biology. They proceed to
two years studying embryology, biochemistry and other medical
subjects, followed by four years studying and working in Cuban
hospitals and clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers said they follow a curriculum that combines textbook
lessons with practical experience, with an emphasis on problem
solving and preventive care. It hews to the Cuban approach to
health care, which stresses community-based medicine and public
health.
</P>
<P>
   Although students from the same country live together in
dormitories to ease their homesickness, the classes have a cross
section of races and ethnicities, including a significant number of
Central American Indian youths. Some students encounter other
ethnic groups from their own nation for the first time at the
school.
</P>
<P>
   This month, 1,500 more students will arrive at the school, which
is expecting to ultimately enroll some 5,000 students. Already,
workers have been busy preparing new dormitories and lecture halls.
</P>
<P>
   Like students everywhere, they grouse that the grind is rough,
leaving them with little free time. But many said it was a small
sacrifice for the chance to become a professional instead of a
cabdriver or farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Norlan Lopez spent his high school years in Nicaragua getting up
at 4 a.m. to work as a fisherman. He was still doing that when he
was accepted into medical school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had more pressure on me when I was in high school,'' he
said. ``It was a hard life that I would not wish on anyone. That is
why I am happy to be here.''

   RUSSIA-BANK (New York) _ Two leading figures in the Bank of New
York money laundering investigation told a federal judge Wednesday
that a scheme to move billions of dollars from Russia was
originated and controlled by politically connected Russian banks.
In detailed confessions in Manhattan federal court, Lucy Edwards, a
former Bank of New York vice president, and her husband Peter
Berlin described how between 1996 and last year more than $7
billion moved out of Russia illegally and into a network of front
company accounts at the Bank of New York, which were controlled by
Berlin. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-KOHL (Berlin) _ The crisis of the conservative party
that has governed and stabilized Germany for most of the postwar
years deepened Wednesday with the abrupt resignation of its leader,
Wolfgang Schaeuble. The departure of Schaeuble, who was handpicked
by former Chancellor Helmut Kohl to be his successor as party
leader in 1998, leaves the opposition Christian Democratic Union
rudderless at a time of profound shifts in the political landscape
of German-speaking Europe. By Roger Cohen. 1,300 words.

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Grozny, Russia) _ Grozny is more than a
landscape of shattered buildings. It is also a city of broken
lives. The limited access Russian forces have granted to the
capital make it difficult to systemically chronicle the human
rights violations there. But accounts provided by residents during
a two-day period appeared credible and pointed to abuses by both
sides. Some of the most chilling allegations involve the Russian
troops who battled their way into the city. Anxious to avenge their
fallen comrades, some took out their frustrations on Grozny's
defenseless civilians. By Michael R. Gordon. 900 words.

the state's textile industry died, former Gov. Carroll Campbell, a
Republican, felt the answer could be found in modern manufacturing
and lured the biggest possible prize to the state: a BMW factory.

   NY-DIALLO-TRIAL (Albany, N.Y.) _ As witness testimony in the
Diallo trial came to a swift conclusion Wednesday, both the defense
and the prosecution moved to let the jury consider charges below
second-degree murder. Should the judge agree, he could let the jury
consider manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide, lesser
charges that could mean little or no prison time for the accused
New York City officers should conviction result. By Dan Barry.
</P>
<P>
   LABOR-IMMIG (New Orleans) _ The American labor movement, after
long regarding immigrants as a threat, adopted a sharp change in
policy Wednesday and called for amnesty for illegal immigrants and
an end to most sanctions against employers that hire such
immigrants. In decades past, many labor unions saw immigrant
workers as the enemy, often accusing them of pulling down wages and
breaking strikes. But the AFL-CIO's executive council adopted a
more sympathetic approach toward immigrants Wednesday, saying the
nation's immigration rules have too often enabled employers to
exploit undocumented workers. By Steven Greenhouse.

school fast food shows that pizza, cookies, chips and other junk
food comprise 70 percent of all food sales on a majority of

planning. By Rick Orlov. (Will move in the ``a'' national and ``n''

<P>
   LONG-ISLAND-FILMS (New York) _ For me _ a fanatical filmgoer
from an early age _ the real proof that Long Island was nowhere was
that I never saw it in the movies. It obviously wasn't important in
the way New York, London, Paris and Dodge City were. The lonely
exception to the silver screen's general embargo on images of Long
Island was that sequence in ``North by Northwest'' in which the
urbane Cary Grant was kidnapped outside the Plaza Hotel and taken
to a mansion on the North Shore, where he would barely survive an
attempt on his life. All this would change, though, in part thanks
to the rise of independent film, with its fondness for depicting
quirky people in ordinary settings (or, perhaps more to the point,
in cheap locations). By Terrence Rafferty. (Moved). &QL;

<P>
   NY-ART-DIRECTORS (Undated) _ A talk between two of the most
prominent figures in the New York art world, Philippe de
Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and

   BEACH-FILM (Undated) _ In ``The Beach,'' Danny Boyle's film
adaptation of Alex Garland's popular novel, Leonardo DiCaprio is
Richard, a pleasure-seeking backpacker who finds himself alone and
itching for adventure in swinging Bangkok. Richard's vague search
for heaven on earth (with some requisite danger thrown in) leads
him to a secret commune on a remote coastal island that can be
reached only by swimming to its shores. At first, paradise appears
to be everything he has been looking for. Against a backdrop of
perfect sunsets and moonrises, its international brigade of
post-hippie sybarites (so preposterously well-tended that they
resemble the cast of ``Baywatch'' on a Club Med holiday) while away
their days in peppy beachside games of soccer and volleyball.
Utopia only begins to pall after a tragedy reveals Richard's fellow
exiles to be a bunch of selfish party animals willing to sacrifice
lives to keep their pristine enclave a secret. By Stephen Holden.

   MIFUNE-FILM (Copenhagen, Denmark) _ ``Mifune,'' is a touching
love story set on an isolated farm in southern Denmark. The film,
by the Danish diredtor, Soren Kragy-Jacobsen, 52, which won a
special jury prize at the 1999 Berlin film festival and is
Denmark's Academy Award nominee for best foreign language film this

   WASHINGTON-BALLET-SCHOOL (Washington) _ It was once a private
home, but now the four-floor white building at the intersection of
Wisconsin Avenue and Porter Street is filled with studios, offices
and dressing rooms. In a way it is still a home, but now to the
Washington School of Ballet, founded in 1944 by Mary Day and Lisa
Gardiner, and the Washington Ballet, founded by Day in 1976. In the
1980s, Choo San Goh, who was the resident choreographer,
transformed the company from a regional ballet troupe into an
internationally respected entity. Goh died in 1987, and after
several successors had come and gone, the company appointed its
present artistic director, Septime Webre, last June. By Kate
Mattingly. (Moved).  &QL;

<P>
   JULIO-BOCCO-DANCE (New York) _ Julio Bocca, a dashing star of
American Ballet Theater, did not look himself as he rehearsed in a
mid-Manhattan studio early this month. With his toes turned in, his
back arched and his hands placed on his hips, not a trace of
Albrecht or Romeo could be discerned in his demeanor. While still
jet-lagged from a flight from Buenos Aires and worn from rehearsing
his own company, Ballet Argentina, for its recent performance at
the World Financial Center Winter Garden, he was trying to absorb a
choreographic style as different from Petipa as night from day. And
he had to learn it fast, because last Tuesday he was to make his
Broadway debut in the Tony Award-winning musical ``Fosse.'' By

besieged by high-powered customers demanding tables. Written by
Becky Mode, a friend of its star Mark Setlock, and directed by
Nicholas Martin, opened to raves in September at the Vineyard
Theater and moved to a commercial run at the 180-seat Cherry Lane
in December. By Jesse McKinley. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   CARUSO-2000-MUSIC (Undated) _ Have you ever wondered what it
would be like to hear your favorite Caruso recordings freshened up:
say, with the great tenor's voice, exactly as it was captured by an
acoustic recording horn in the days before microphones, newly
cloaked in the lush timbres of a modern symphony orchestra recorded
in digital stereo? No, of course you haven't. Why would you? Why
would anyone? Yet someone not only did but also suspected that
other people might. Thus we have ``Caruso 2000,'' a production of
the Austrian Broadcasting Corp., released on CD by RCA Victor. By

<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLASSIC-LYRICS (Undated) _ Composing lyrics in the classic
tradition of American song has always demanded a respect for, if
not slavish adherence to, laws: of form, function, poesy. That's
the fun of it. The challenge. The ideal. We live, however, in the
grip of a music culture that venerates rebelliousness. The
intricacies of lyric writing have thus been reduced to brute
effusion. Worse than a chore, adherence to craft is actually seen
as a sellout. By Barry Singer. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GRAMMY-AWARDS (Undated) _ Yet another chapter in pop's latest
bout with adolescence unfolds this week at the 42nd annual Grammy
Awards. The nominee list, as undependable as ever in predicting
music's real history-makers, does crackle with one present
conflict, between the parent figures who run the event and the kids
now paying their allowances. Those kids get on adults' nerves with
their obvious commercial music, but these hit makers, sometimes
unwittingly, are pointing toward pop's future. A likely sweep by
the night's deserving front-runner, Carlos Santana, will reassure
those baby-boomer voters far too old to really understand the
chart-topping teenage nominees like Britney Spears, Christina
Aguilera and those ever-present, thrice-nominated Backstreet Boys.

   ED-LOGUE-ARCHITECT (New York) _ For many New Yorkers, Ed Logue's
name evokes an era when the quality of urban life was measured by
something more than skyrocketing real estate prices, the banishment
of homeless people from public sidewalks and the glitter of
confetti falling from the sky. The ideal of social equality also
figured in the equation. Logue, born in Philadelphia in 1921, was
among the last of the master planners to practice urban renewal on
an epic scale. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

<P>
   CREWDSON-PHOTOGS (Lee, Mass.) _ Chaos may lie behind Gregory
Crewdson's work, but you would hardly know it from looking at his
pictures of suburbia, where an eerie calm always prevails. Since
1998, the 37-year-old photographer has been creating a series
titled ``Twilight,'' which now includes 20 meticulously detailed,
richly colored pictures, all taken in and around the outskirts of
Lee, ranging from domestic interiors to landscape views. The
photographs, featuring the local townspeople, are always shot at
dusk. Twelve of Crewdson's most recent ``Twilight'' photographs are
now on view at Luhring Augustine Gallery. By Elizabeth Hayt.

   TV-TALK-WALLS (Undated) _ Three years after they became the most
publicized, criticized, scrutinized gay couple in Hollywood, if not
the country, Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche have had enough. Not of
each other. Far from it. They have a new outlook and are eager to
declare, despite predictions that theirs was a relationship founded
on Hollywood-style eccentricity and star madness, that they are
still, as Ms. Heche put it, ``crazy happy'' together. As recently
as last July, when Ms. Heche and Ms. DeGeneres sat down for an
interview in their trailer on the set of ``If These Walls Could
Talk 2,'' the HBO film in which both women have had a prominent
hand, they were still anguished over the lack of enthusiasm their
pairing up had inspired. By Bill Carter. (Moved). &QL;

BUSH'S MISSING MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any political front-runner victimized by a major upset faces two
challenges: to take the shine off his opponent and to strengthen
his own appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush has been working frantically to
achieve the first goal since he lost the New Hampshire primary to
Arizona Senator John McCain. The results have been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Less successful still has been his effort to establish a
convincing rationale.
</P>
<P>
   In their debate Tuesday night in South Carolina, Bush said:
``Our objective is to end the Clinton era in Washington, D.C.'' Of
course, the Clinton era will end next January, willy-nilly. But
what does Bush offer to replace it? He talked about ``common sense
and integrity'' but continues to put very little flesh on those
meager bones.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the self-definition Bush has attempted since New
Hampshire has been by contrast with McCain. This has only pushed
McCain into position as the campaign's acknowledged agenda-setter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says that, compared with McCain, he is the political
outsider, but then he touts his many endorsements from GOP
congressmen and governors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he is the true, proven reformer, but then suddenly
proffers a pale substitute for McCain's campaign finance reform
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush makes the convoluted argument that Democrats and
independents may vote for McCain in South Carolina this Saturday
because he would be the weaker candidate in November, while
national polls show just the opposite _ McCain would be the
stronger nominee. And this should be no surprise, since Bush is
targeting his campaign overwhelmingly to GOP regulars, who can't
supply enough votes on their own to elect a president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush accuses McCain in the debate of a ``low blow'' for an ad
likening Bush's tax claims to the untrustworthy statements of
President Clinton. But minutes later Bush says McCain's criticism
of his tax plan ``sounds exactly like Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has already spent more money than any presidential primary
candidate ever. Money is powerful in politics _ far too powerful _
but it will not guarantee victory to a candidate without a message.

<P>
   TOKYO _ Seiji Ozawa will visit Vienna in 2 1/2 weeks to meet
with friends and to assess, firsthand, the political climate of
Austria in the wake of the ascendancy of an ultraright leader who
once praised Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa, who has agreed to assume the music directorship of the
Vienna State Opera at the conclusion of the 2001-2 Tanglewood
season, Tuesday told reporters during a news conference here that
he could no longer ignore developments in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, music must be away from the political movement. I am
not thinking of changing my mind about my musical life because of a
politician but, again, I must go and see,'' said Ozawa, who is
relinquishing his musical directorship with the Boston Symphony
Orchestra to go to Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan, Ozawa
voluntarily raised the subject during a session called to announce
the formation of a new training program in Tokyo for young Asian
artists. Ozawa asserted he has no political party affiliations;
nonetheless, he was clearly pained about recent news reports from
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it deeply what is happening in the world, especially in
Austria right now,'' Ozawa said slowly, the only time his
ebullience left him during his two hours with reporters. He
recalled how his own countrymen rejected him at age 27 as
non-Japanese when he returned from training abroad to direct the
NHK Symphony, Japan's prestigious classical ensemble. ``I never
forgot that kind of shock,'' Ozawa said. ``All my life my belief is
to include everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Inclusion is at the heart of debate in Austria. About two weeks
ago, the European Union condemned Austria after the government's
conservative People's Party formed a coalition with the ultraright
Freedom Party. Joerg Haider, a politician who wants to impose
stringent immigration restrictions in Austria, leads the Freedom
Party and has in the past praised Hitler's employment restrictions.
Haider's rise to power has sparked demonstrations in Vienna and
outrage worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should not talk about politics but, in life, if you
won't see things, you don't know,'' Ozawa said. ``I really must go
there now and meet and learn what is this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Volpe, managing director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra,
said Tuesday, ``Seiji's mantra has always been that music
transcends political boundaries, but let's not kid ourselves, music
and musical institutions have been used for political purposes for
generations. Seiji is philosophically inclined to be inclusive, and
he is reserving judgment until he gets to Vienna and has contact
with the situation and experiences the dynamics there. I don't read
this as he's going to quit in Vienna, but this is an issue, and he
is going to have to sort it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the potential impact on Boston if Ozawa were to
resign his Vienna post, Volpe said, ``Let's not skip several steps
in the logic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa, who was scheduled to leave his family's home in Tokyo and
return to Boston Thursday, met with reporters to announce the
formation of an opera academy for young instrumentalists who will
receive two months of intensive coaching and perform Mozart operas.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Seiji Ozawa Ongaku-juku, or Music Academy, the
program will begin this spring with approximately 40
instrumentalists under the age of 30 who will play five
performances of ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' with an internationally
prominent cast in early June. Ozawa will lead those performances as
well as productions of ``Cosi fan tutte'' in 2001 and ``Don
Giovanni'' in 2002. Ozawa's aides said $1.5 million from the Rohm
Corp., and ticket sales will fund the academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important for you if you go to a concert is that
something in you is moved because of a feeling the performer gives
the audience,'' Ozawa said. Asian musicians, he said, are often
technical masters but ``too shy to give feeling or hesitate to
become more involved with what is on stage.'' Ozawa said he hopes
his academy can be a catalyst for infusing passion into Asian
classical performances. Opera, he added, was the best medium to
accomplish his goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opera has many feelings,'' Ozawa said. ``What you see is more
realistically there: happiness, sadness, aggressiveness. When you
see opera, there are wider or deeper expressions. All (emotions)
visually are there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa said the academy would not conflict with his commitment to
the education program at Tanglewood Music Center, nor his remaining
tenure as music director of Boston Symphony Orchestra and
Tanglewood's summer program. Ozawa also said his penultimate dream
is that, some day, his new academy could work in a partnership with
Tanglewood, the Saito Kinen Orchestra _ his Japanese-based ensemble
_ and opera houses around Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa said the impetus for the new academy is continuing twin
desires: to teach promising talent, thereby repaying debt to his
mentors, and to embrace opera as much as possible. Asked whether,
in Austria, he will attempt to introduce female artists into the
all-male Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, Ozawa said that the
Philharmonic is drawn from members of the State Opera Orchestra,
which he will lead. While he may introduce women to the opera
orchestra, Ozawa said he would not have direct influence on the
self-governing Philharmonic.

IS GRISHAM ABOUT TO DUMP THE LEGAL EAGLES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This month's publication of ``The Brethren'' (Doubleday,
$27.95), John Grisham's 10th legal-themed thriller in 10 years, may
someday be seen as a turning point in the megabestselling author's
career.
</P>
<P>
   It will not involve any slackening of typical Grisham book
sales. ``The Brethren'' was No. 1 on amazon.com two weeks before
hitting bookstore shelves. Doubleday ordered a 2.8 million-copy
first printing, almost three times as many copies as most
blockbusters get. No other writer _ not Stephen King or Tom Clancy
or Patricia Cornwell _ sells more hardcover books than John
Grisham.
</P>
<P>
   And Grisham isn't breaking ground with ``The Brethren,'' either.
Lawyers still are at the heart of this one, albeit three ex-judges
in a federal prison running mail scams on rich, middle-aged gay
men. Oh, Grisham is obviously pushing to include new plot twists,
and ``The Brethren'' finds its three blackmailers inadvertently
inserting their slimy schemes into the middle of a presidential
election masterminded by the CIA. But it's still a book Grisham
fans would recognize; nobody else crafts fiction in quite this way.
Critics who regularly pan Grisham will find the same reason
(well-written but with predictable plot lines) to fault him this
time out.
</P>
<P>
   Those critics would be wrong. More than ever in ``The
Brethren,'' Grisham demonstrates an exceptional ability to pull
together story lines that apparently have little relationship. His
narrative jumps around _ from the Florida minimum-security prison
where authorities allow the three incarcerated ``brethren'' to keep
kangaroo court for other inmates _ to all sorts of stops on the
campaign trail of Arizona U.S. Rep. Arthur Lake, picked by the CIA
as a figurehead candidate because he would support doubling the
U.S. defense budget if elected.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the book, it turns out that the one Lake vice
the CIA hadn't anticipated has put the next president squarely in
the power of the three cons. With the power to instigate terrorist
attacks halfway around the world or raise an instant $60 million
for Lake's campaign war chest, CIA Director Teddy Maynard suddenly
finds himself matching wits with three very greedy crooks who
consider their freedom more important than America's ability to
bomb enemies into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   OK _ it was obvious early on that the brethren and Lake would
cross paths _ but Grisham's tying-together at book's end is pretty
clever (bad guys win _ and lose), and ``The Brethren'' is certainly
a literary step up from recent bestselling potboilers by Nelson
DeMille and Dean Koontz.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Brethren'' may be significant for a reason other than
book sales. It could mark Grisham's last legal-themed book and his
final title for longtime publisher Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   The January/February edition of ``The Oxford American,'' a small
Mississippi-based literary magazine, contained the first of six
installments of ``A Painted House,'' a new Grisham yarn about a
family-run cotton farm in Arkansas and the menacing migrant worker
who arrives there in 1952. The surprises here are not that Grisham
would choose ``The Oxford American'' to run his serialized novel _
he owns the publication and serves as its publisher _ but that
Grisham would write something so radically different from his usual
style, and that he'd have its first chapter published at just about
the same time Doubleday released ``The Brethren.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports persist in the book industry that ``The Brethren''
concludes Grisham's current contract with Doubleday. He hasn't
spoken about it, and Doubleday spokeswoman Christina Brenner said,
``We can't give that (information) out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oxford American'' editor Mark Smirnoff, who is also Grisham's
private editor on books written for Doubleday, has said that ``John
owns `A Painted House,' '' and that he expects the six installments
eventually to be published in full book form, much like Stephen
King's ``The Green Mile,'' which originally appeared in six
mass-market paperbacks.
</P>
<P>
   All of this could leave Grisham in a powerful bargaining
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if his contract is through with Doubleday or
not,'' said Kenneth Kirkland, a publishing-industry analyst. ``But
if it is, and he was available for a new contract, bringing `A
Painted House' would mean Grisham's new publisher could practically
have an instant Grisham book to publish. Which publishers would bid
anything under those circumstances? The question is, which ones
wouldn't?''
</P>
<P>
   Grisham doesn't have to change publishers or genres. Doubleday
has long since allowed the author to choose his own publicity
appearances, and it has placed ``The Brethren'' literally anywhere
Grisham fans might care to shop. Tom Thumb grocery stores and Best
Buy appliance megastores have prominent displays of the book. It is
featured on almost every Internet bookstore site. Even Grisham's
Web site, www.jgrisham.com, offers tantalizing glimpses of the
newest title, with five free excerpts online even before the book
was published.
</P>
<P>
   But if Grisham is bored with churning out annual legal
thrillers, public response to ``A Painted House'' could indicate
whether his fans will embrace something new.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it seems they will. Smirnoff said that the
``The Oxford American's'' usual run of 50,000 copies had increased
to 260,000 for January//February when the first ``Painted House''
installment ran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks now as though that may not satisfy the demand,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Smirnoff is editing ``A Painted House's'' second chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, John Grisham can do whatever he wants,''
Kirkland concluded. ``It will be interesting to see how this turns
out.''

U.S. OFFICIALS TELL OF GROWING THREATS TO COMPUTER SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A week after still-unidentified hackers paralyzed
several well-known commercial Internet companies, the country's
chief law enforcement and legal officers said Wednesday that
threats against computer networks have outstripped the government's
efforts to keep up with them.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before a Senate panel on Internet security, Attorney
General Janet Reno said last week's attacks on popular Web sites
illustrated the necessity of a coordinated law enforcement
strategy. ``How we deal with cyber-crime is one of the most
critical areas we face,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno proposed a five-year plan that would include tougher
penalties for hackers and standardized investigative technologies.
Such a step could lower the astronomical cost of security and
detection gear in an environment in which, she said, equipment is
obsolete almost as soon as its installed.
</P>
<P>
   Louis J. Freeh, the FBI director, told senators that the
investigation of last week's attacks was moving aggressively.
``There are fast-developing leads as we speak,'' Freeh said of the
search for those who barraged the computer systems of companies
like Yahoo, eBay and Amazon.com with meaningless data to clog the
paths of customers attempting to reach the sites.
</P>
<P>
   He said the investigation was being conducted in the United
States as well as in Germany and Canada. Scores of agents from FBI
offices in Atlanta, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle
are at work on the attacks, known within law enforcement circles as
``distributed denial of service'' cases.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, law enforcement officials have said they are
interviewing several people, including some computer hackers,
although they did not yet have evidence clearly indicating who was
responsible for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the seriousness of the problem, Freeh cited the
growing number of such cases, to 1,154 last year from 547 such
cases in 1998. The cases range from minor attacks by teen-age
vandals and disgruntled employees to highly sophisticated
intrusions possibly directed by foreign intelligence services, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said that in 1998, 399 cases were closed, in contrast to
to 1999, when 912 cases closed. Almost none of the cases resulted
in prosecutions. The FBI closes a case when the agency decides
there is no basis for further investigation. The cases do not
include other major categories of cyber-crime, like Internet fraud
or child pornography.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Freeh acknowledged the difficulties
computer cases pose for law enforcement. ``In short, even though we
have markedly improved our capabilities to fight cyber intrusions,
the problem is growing even faster and thus we are falling further
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer crime is one of the most dynamic problems the FBI
faces today,'' Freeh said. ``Just think about how many computers
you have owned and how many different software packages you have
learned over the past several years, and you can only begin to
appreciate the scope of the problem we are dealing with in the
fast-changing era,'' Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony by Reno and Freeh followed a White House meeting
convened Tuesday by President Clinton with technology experts and
Internet executives about how to improve the security of the
country's computer networks. Clinton adopted a reassuring tone,
saying the assaults were not an ``electronic Pearl Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry officials have said they want strong action
against computer criminals but fear that government intervention
and new criminal laws could unintentionally stifle the phenomenal
growth and creativity of the technology industries.

 &HT;     McCAIN SHOWCASES BAUER ENDORSEMENT IN BIBLE BELT  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL and DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Sen. John McCain struck back Wednesday at
Texas Gov. George Bush's bid to sow doubts about his anti-abortion
credentials, unveiling the endorsement of right-to-life advocate
Gary Bauer in a predominantly Baptist region known as ``the buckle
on the Bible belt.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaign aides said they hoped that the endorsement by
Bauer four days before the Saturday South Carolina presidential
primary would help bolster McCain's support among the 20 percent of
South Carolina voters who identify themselves as members of the
religious right.
</P>
<P>
   The Zogby-Reuters polls released Wednesday showed Bush outpacing
McCain among ``born-again'' Christians, 50 percent to 34 percent,
in South Carolina. The same poll showed Bush leading McCain, 43
percent to 40 percent. The poll was conducted Monday and Tuesday
and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain called Bauer's endorsement ``one of the most wonderful
events of this entire political campaign'' because it would help
him reach a faction of the Republican party that has favored rival
GOP candidates for president.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said he was endorsing McCain ``without any hesitation''
despite their disagreement on exceptions to a ban on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bush favor a ban on abortion but allow for three
exceptions: to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or
incest. Bauer and the GOP platform oppose any exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is ``the best shot we have to end the era of Bill and
Hillary and Al Gore,'' Bauer told a rally at Furman University
where his endorsement was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, a former Reagan administration official who made his
anti-abortion stance a hallmark of his own campaign, said McCain
``by and large'' has an anti-abortion voting record. Bauer, who
calls the right to life an inalienable right protected in the
Declaration of Independence, said he hoped to persuade McCain to
support a more complete ban on abortion in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   McCain favors bringing the GOP platform into line with the
position that he and Bush share. Bush supports leaving the
hard-fought platform alone. Bush enjoys the support of the
Christian Coalition, led by Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show that a minority of voters supports an absolute ban
on abortion. But the issue sharply divides competing wings of the
Republican party, fomenting a constant struggle.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been peppered with questions about his position
almost daily, including at a question-and-answer session with
voters in Newberry, S.C., en route to his endorsement by Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told several hundred people gathered in the opera house
on the town square that he personally believes exceptions are
warranted and that his view is the ``generally held view by the
majority of pro-life people.'' McCain said his disagreement with
any voters who support an all-out ban ought to be treated merely as
``an open and honest and respected disagreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Curtis Waters, 70, a Baptist minister in Greenville, S.C.,
said Bauer's endorsement could help McCain stem the loss of support
in northwest South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Waters said Bauer was ``a fine moral person'' well known to
voters across this predominantly Baptist region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his support will help McCain,'' Waters said. ``I think
it may make a turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Davis, McCain's campaign director, said Bauer's endorsement
was welcome because it ``will help reassure people that Sen. McCain
has a good record on right to life,'' adding: ``This will help cut
through all the misrepresentations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and the National Right to Life Committee have showered
South Carolina voters with campaign fliers urging the election of
Bush on the basis that he would support a tougher ban on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush brushed aside the Bauer endorsement of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   `Everybody's got a right to endorse who they want to endorse,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the announcement by California Secretary of State
Bill Jones _ the state's highest ranking elected Republican _ that
he was switching his support from Bush to McCain, Bush replied: `If
Bill wants to be on the winning team, he ought to stay here. If
he's interested in being on the team that's going to win the
Republican nomination, he made the wrong decision. I'm going to win
the Republican nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush downplayed reports of financial troubles in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   `I know we're on plan,'' he said. ``We've got a strategy in
place that's working. I like my chances'' in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported Wednesday that Bush's campaign
finance chiefs are concerned that Bush faces a potential money
shortfall in the wake of a $37 million spending spree through Dec.
31. The actual figure of what Bush has spent to date by now is
probably closer to $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman, acknowledged the campaign has
an unspecified number of fundraising events on tap for March and
April to replenish Bush's coffers. But she insisted those events
have been in the works for months and do not reflect any
last-minute desperation.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's next federally required campaign expenditure
report, to be filed Feb. 20, will report $20 million in the bank as
of Jan. 31, according to Hughes.

MEDICAL REPORT REVEALS BRAIN DAMAGE IN PINOCHET, SPANISH PRESS
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See sidebar PINOCHET-AILMENTS) 
(js) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Two Spanish newspapers, citing copies of a secret
British medical report they had obtained on Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
reported Wednesday that he suffered brain damage from minor strokes
last year and is no longer mentally fit to stand trial in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   In similar articles, the newspapers El Mundo and ABC quoted from
a report signed by three British physicians on Jan. 6. They said
that the general was suffering from loss of short- and long-term
memory and that he was not fully able to grasp complex sentences
and questions. They also said he cannot express himself clearly and
suffers periods of fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which the newspapers said was translated from
English into Spanish, noted that the damage to the blood vessels of
the brain appeared in the frontal and temporal lobes and was the
likely result of several recent minor strokes.
</P>
<P>
   If the report is authentic, then it alters little of what was
previously published about the health of the 84-year-old former
Chilean dictator. But the disclosure of the confidential documents
could further complicate the legal wrangling over Pinochet's
release and make his 16-month house-arrest in England even longer.
</P>
<P>
   After a ruling by the London High Court on Tuesday, Britain
reluctantly provided the medical report to the London embassies of
Belgium, France, Spain and Switzerland, which are seeking
Pinochet's extradition on charges of grave human rights violations
in Spain. The High Court said that the four countries were entitled
to see the medical report for the sake of ``transparency and
fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   But in its ruling, the High Court also said the four countries
could see the medical report only ``under conditions of strict
confidentiality.'' They were given until Feb. 22 to send their
reactions to London.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain Wednesday, angry government officials said they had
asked Spain to investigate who leaked the secret document. Lawyers
in Madrid said the publication of court documents was a violation
of Spanish law and could lead to charges of contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the Spanish reports Wednesday agree with a statement
released by Britain's home secretary, Jack Straw, who said in
January that the 84-year-old former Chilean dictator's health had
deteriorated and that he was not fit to stand trial. Therefore,
Straw said he was inclined to end the 16-month-long British house
arrest of the ailing general and let him return to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   In Madrid, where the Pinochet case has become intensely
politicized, it was the leak, more than the medical details, that
caused an uproar. Opposition leader Joaquin Almunia blamed the
Madrid government, which has long opposed having a Pinochet trial
in Spain. He said the government had been ``indecent'' in leaking
the document to two pro-government newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Baltasar Garzon, the Madrid judge who initiated the charges
against Pinochet and asked Britain for his arrest, said he had
received the doctors' report but had put it under seal and had not
leaked it. Various Spanish government spokesmen also denied that
the document came from them.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Garces, a Spanish lawyer representing the victims of the
Chilean dictatorship, said the leaking of the documents was one
more effort ``to keep the Pinochet case out of the courts, because
in court he keeps losing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The foreign ministers of both Britain and Spain have been trying
to solve the complex Pinochet question politically. Britain's
foreign minister has been quoted as saying he does not want
Pinochet to die in England.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's foreign minister has said he does not want to see
Pinochet tried in Spain. Also, the Madrid government is worried
that a prolonged fight could further disrupt relations with Chile,
where Spain has many business interests.
</P>
<P>
   Although the British medical report apparently provides lengthy
details about Pinochet's many physical ailments _ such as diabetes,
unsteadiness, pain in his knees, deafness and more _ lawyers said
only a person's mental fitness to stand trial counts.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC newspaper, in its Spanish translation of the report,
quoted the doctors as saying, ``In our opinion, Senator Pinochet is
presently not mentally fit to participate fully cognizant in a
trial.'' They said his memory problems and his difficulties in
processing information, apparently aggravated by minor strokes in
September and October, are not likely to improve.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors added, ``At the moment he shows no signs of clinical
depression.'' They said the trial could provoke stress that could
increase the damage to the blood vessels in the brain. But they
said they had been told in the past that Pinochet ``has shown
remarkable capacity to control stress. We are therefore unable to
give any useful opinion about the effects a trial may have on his
health.''

McCAIN PICKS UP BACKING OF BAUER 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ John McCain, who has largely kept religion
out of his Republican presidential campaign, was endorsed Wednesday
by former rival Gary Bauer, a leader in the Christian conservative
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement could prove significant Saturday in the tight
South Carolina primary between major candidates McCain and Texas
Gov. George W. Bush. Bauer dropped out of the race earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer announced his support for McCain at a rally at Furman
University in the heart of this state's conservative Christian
center.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Arizona senator was the ``best shot we have to end
the era of Bill and Hillary and Al Gore.``
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bush have been fighting for the votes of religious
and social conservatives, who could exert great influence over the
outcome of Saturday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who gained tremendous momentum with his upset victory
over Bush in the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary, needs another
victory to keep his insurgent campaign alive, some observers
believe. And Bush, the early front-runner, will need to score a win
to revive his struggling campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In another potentially key development Wednesday, California
Secretary of State Bill Jones, the highest elected Republican in
that state, switched his allegiance from Bush and endorsed McCain.
California will hold its primary March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Los Angeles, Jones said he switched to McCain
because his message of campaign-finance reform would reach beyond
Republican stalwarts and help build the party. California, like
South Carolina, allows voters to choose in which primary they will
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message I hear from South Carolina from some of the GOP is
your vote doesn't count as an independent or crossover unless you
vote for Bush,'' Jones said. ``That isn't the message of
California.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bush oppose abortion rights, which Bauer made a key
target of his campaign. But unlike Bauer, McCain and Bush also
would allow abortions in cases or rape, incest or to protect the
life of the mother. And McCain has earned the wrath of other
anti-abortion groups because he favors federal funding of fetal
tissue research.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said that while both candidates opposed abortion rights,
``I weighed the relative merits of the men, and I'm convinced from
an honesty standpoint, trustworthiness standpoint, a values
standpoint that Sen. McCain is clearly the best choice.``
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, former head of the Family Research Council, said that he
believed McCain was guided by the ``central moral idea of
America,'' which he said was the protection of life principle
embodied in the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that John understands those words. I know that he
agrees with me that because of those words we must work to make
sure that every child is welcomed into the world and protected by
the law,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   He also praised McCain, who has made campaign-finance reform a
key issue of his presidential race, for wanting an ``American
political system that is not moneybags democracy, but a system
built on civility and decency and honor.``
</P>
<P>
   McCain told reporters he valued Bauer's endorsement as a means
to help him gain the support of religious conservatives. McCain is
not an overtly religious man and his only reference to religion in
the campaign has been to recount that he led prayers with his
cellmates in the North Vietnamese prisoner of war camp in which he
was held for nearly six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view Gary's support as a very important element in my effort
to broaden our base both within and without the Republican Party,''
McCain said. ``I view him as a trusted adviser, a person who will
provide lines of communication for me in parts of the party that my
lines of communication are not as strong as I would have liked them
to be.``
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the Bush campaign were at the rally and immediately
after Bauer's announcement distributed a written statement from
many of his former supporters, who was now backing the Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot recall feeling more hurt or disappointed than I feel
today,'' state Sen. Mike Fair, Bauer's former South Carolina
campaign chairman, is quoted in the statement. Fair is now
supporting Bush.

   TREASURY-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ Last week, Secretary of
Treasury Lawrence Summers predicted that by 2013, the $3.6 trillion
in U.S. Treasury debt held by the public would be eliminated,
repurchased by funds from budget surpluses. The result, he said,
would be an even stronger economy and lower interest rates for all.
But in the meantime, the Treasury's plan to reduce its debt is
roiling the financial markets. By Gretchen Morgenson.

would be an even stronger economy and lower interest rates for all.

NEWS REPORTS ON PINOCHET'S HEALTH LEAVE QUESTIONS UNANSWERED 
</HEADLINE>
  (With PINOCHET-HEALTH) 
(js) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spanish news reports citing a confidential report by British
doctors on the health of Gen. Augusto Pinochet said he suffers from
a number of ailments that make him mentally unfit to stand trial.
But the news accounts were based on excerpts of the full doctors'
report and leave unanswered many medical questions about what ails
the 84-year-old former Chilean dictator.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial question is how many times the British doctors
examined Pinochet before issuing their report. A report based on
repeated examinations is often more meaningful than one written
after one examination.
</P>
<P>
   Another important question is what are the 16 ailments Pinochet
is said to have. The news reports cited two medical problems:
memory loss and difficulties in comprehension from recent and
progressive cerebro-vascular damage, and nerve damage to his legs
as a complication of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   But the news reports did not say whether Pinochet's brain damage
resulted from a stroke, Alzheimer's disease or some other
neurological condition.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes can damage blood vessels throughout the body, including
the brain, and increase the risk of strokes.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 11 drugs that Pinochet was said to be taking daily
were named in the news reports. They said he had been receiving
appropriate therapy for his ailments during his 16-month house
arrest in England.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of which drugs were prescribed and at what time could
be important in Pinochet's case because his condition deteriorated
seriously last September and October, the news reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Many drugs interact to cause mental confusion and difficulty in
communicating. The mental changes can mimic or aggravate the
symptoms of Alzheimer's and strokes, particularly in the elderly.
Mental problems can increase if the amount of drugs is not reduced.
The news reports did not say whether the British doctors' report
excluded drug reactions as a possible cause of Pinochet's mental
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The front portion of Pinochet's brain has deteriorated, the news
reports said. In many elderly people, the brain shrinks in size,
but the shrinkage does not necessarily lead to mental changes. Many
elderly people have small brains yet are mentally alert. The news
reports did not say how many neurological examinations and brain
scans Pinochet had and over what period.

MERGER SPECULATION ABOUNDS IN EUROPEAN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Europe's automobile industry has gone into
overdrive _ at least when it comes to merger speculation.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive day, shares of PSA Peugeot Citroen
jumped Wednesday on rumors that it was in talks with
DaimlerChrysler AG Those rumors followed persistent speculation
about Daimler seeking to acquire the automobile business of Fiat
SPA.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, British and German newspapers speculated that
Volkswagen AG might take over Rover Cars, the ailing British
subsidiary of BMW AG.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts believe that more car mergers are inevitable,
because manufacturers are under pressure to keep prices down and
yet roll out new models faster than ever.
</P>
<P>
   That said, most of the merger predictions thus far have been
wrong. One reason is that the most desirable or at least needy car
companies are still controlled by their founding families _ the
Peugeots of France, the Agnellis of Italy and the Quandts of
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those families has rejected the idea of selling out.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Peugeot once again denied it is in merger talks,
following rumors on Tuesday that DaimlerChrysler had offered 35
shares of its own stock and 10 euros for every 10 shares of
Peugeot.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Martin Folz, Peugeot's president, said in Paris Wednesday
that the company wanted to remain independent and had the ability
to do so. ``We want neither a merger nor an acquisition,'' Folz
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger question is, why would DaimlerChrysler want to
pursue it?
</P>
<P>
   Each new rumor about a big Daimler acquisition has sent its
share price down.Daimler's stock has declined 13 percent this year,
while the DAX index of leading stocks has climbed about nine
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Daimler's decline reflects investor unhappiness about
possible takeovers of small-car makers like Fiat or Peugeot.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a capital markets point of view, we would rather see the
company say they are not going to do anything in small cars and
will return free cash flow to shareholders,'' said Christian
Breitsprecher, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's chairman, Juergen E. Schrempp, has left no
doubt that he badly wants to build up his small-car business _ the
one area that neither Mercedes Benz nor Chrysler have any real
strength.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts are overwhelmingly unhappy about a big push into
small cars. For one thing, the price competition in that segment is
brutal and the profit margins are much lower than for Mercedes
luxury cars or Chrysler's light trucks and sport-utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the margins available in the markets served by
Fiat and Peugeot are nowhere near comparable to those of
DaimlerChrysler,'' said Andrew Blair-Smith, an analyst in London at
Commerzbank.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, analysts worry that companies like Fiat or Peugeot
will require substantial new investment and management time.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts generally agree that Europe's smaller and weaker car
companies are under considerable pressure. Fiat lost money through
the first nine months of 1999, though it is now experiencing an
upswing and is believed to have turned a profit in the final
quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Peugeot fared better last year, with its automobile revenue
climbing 11.5 percent to 32.6 billion euros, or about $33 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But with an annual output of 2.5 million vehicles, far behind
the 4 million produced both by Volkswagen and DaimlerChrysler,
Peugeot faces the problem of trying to spread out the development
costs for new models over fewer vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, investors in Peugeot have been more than happy
about the merger speculation. Peugeot's stock jumped by 6 percent
on Tuesday and a further 1 percent Wednesday to reach 218.2 euros
per share.
</P>
<P>
   Peugeot and Daimler held extensive talks last fall about
collaborating on a new ``platform,'' or underlying blueprint, for
Daimler's troubled line of Smart subcompact two-seater cars. Those
talks broke off, apparently because of reservations by Daimler's
top executives, but they did not put end to Daimler's interest in a
full-scale acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor racing through Paris on Tuesday was that members of
the founding Peugeot family, who own 25.1 percent of the stock and
control 37.4 percent of the voting rights, had become more
receptive to a deal.

 &HT;    CLINTON TALKS OF STEPS TO COUNTER RISING OIL PRICES
 &HT;    610&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With oil prices bounding to a nine-year high,
President Clinton Wednesday became the first president since Jimmy
Carter to formally caution the nation on the subject of rising oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   In his first news conference of the new year, Clinton called for
$725 million in emergency aid to help poor people pay their heating
bills.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of other ways to fight a supply crunch that is already
driving up prices ast the gas pump, such as dispatching his energy
secretary to press world oil producers for production hikes and
possibly drawing down the nation's strategic oil reserve.
</P>
<P>
   In a throwback to the oil shocks of the 1970s, Clinton discussed
high-efficiency vehicles and exotic alternatives to petroleum-based
fuels. He even hinted at the possibility of government subsidies
for large energy users that switch to petroleum alternatives, such
as natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Support for those ideas was all but abandoned by the government
two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters that he has ordered Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson to produce, within 60 days, a report on measures the
government might undertake to help businesses and households reduce
their reliance on petroleum-based fuels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to examine ... what are the institutional barriers for
businesses and
</P>
<P>
   individuals converting away from home heating oil to heating
sources that are more commonly used in other places,'' Clinton
said. ``What are the costs? Are there any federal actions that
might be undertaken, in concert with the states or with the private
sector, to help minimize those costs and facilitate a conversion?''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is also girding for a diplomatic mission to key
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
in the coming weeks, to caution them against further production
curbs that have helped spark a tripling of oil prices over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   With prices surging this week to $30 a barrel _ their highest
since U.S. forces drove Iraqi troops from the oil fields of Kuwait
in 1991 _ Clinton said Richardson would caution OPEC members that
further increases could squeeze global growth, eventually crimping
demand for fuel and forcing down prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the price stayed up for any period of time, it would make
non-OPEC members who could produce oil more likely to do it, which
would further drive the price down,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the OPEC members understand that,'' Clinton said in
his wide-ranging White House press conference, ``and I think that
there is an interest in stable prices at an acceptable level.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the remarks during an hour-long press conference
touching on subjects ranging from international affairs to the
presidential primary races.
</P>
<P>
   On other subjects, Clinton said that:
</P>
<P>
   _ He is considering adding a visit to Pakistan, where a military
junta recently overthrew the democratically elected government,
when he journeys to neighboring India late next month.
</P>
<P>
   _ He is open to compromise with congressional Republicans on the
question of strengthening gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   _ Asked about attacks on his character by Republican
presidential candidates, he responded, ``people are really smart,
you know, and ... it's pretty hard to convince them that they
should hold anyone responsible for someone else's mistake,
particularly a personal mistake. I mean, I can't imagine any voter
ever doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he could vouch for the integrity of Vice President
Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner, Clinton said, ``He was always
brutally honest with me.'' He added, ``in all my dealings with him,
he has been candid in the extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, consumers have been hit with the highest
gasoline costs in a decade in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states, bitterly cold
weather has converged with rising prices for home heating oil to
make life miserable for low-income families, many of whom have been
forced to choose between heat and food.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had ordered the immediate release of $125
million in emergency fuel assistance for low-income families on top
of the $175 million already paid out since January.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton announced that he would send Congress a
request over the next week or so for an additional $600 million in
emergency funding for fuel oil assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a reporter's question, Clinton said he was
considering opening the spigot on the strategic oil reserve,
millions of barrels of crude oil stored underground in Louisiana as
a national security hedge against supply disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would await a response to Richardson's mission
to OPEC before assessing further action, but added, ``I wouldn't
rule out using the petroleum reserve.''

 &HT;    Goodwill takes first winter step
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ The Goodwill Games wasn't even a glimmer in
Ted Turner's eye the last time the world came here for a major,
multi-sport winter event.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly 20 years ago, Eric Heiden and the ``Miracle on Ice''
Olympic hockey players skated through this small Adirondacks
village giving Americans reason to cheer. Then the U.S. boycotted
the Moscow Olympics, the Soviet Union retaliated by staying home
from the Los Angeles Games, and Turner decided the world needed a
little Goodwill in the international sports arena.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the 1986 Goodwill Games in Moscow, Turner's
Atlanta-based company has staged four summer events to provide
original programming for the TBS network. After nearly a decade of
discussing a cold-weather format, TBS will show the inaugural
Winter Goodwill Games today through Sunday. About 450 elite
athletes from 22 countries will compete, by invitation only, in 11
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the time was right for us to venture into the
winter arena,'' said Mike Plant, president of the Goodwill Games.
``There was really only one multi-sport event, the Winter
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Goodwill Games no longer considers itself an
alternative to the Olympics, but rather a complementary sporting
venture. Some of the events aren't the same, other traditional
winter sports have been left out completely, and it offers the
bonus of prize money.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes in 10 sports will compete for a pot

 &HT;    More troubles for Maradona
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sad images of Diego Maradona beginning a treatment program
for drug abuse in Cuba last month apparently are only a small part
of the problems for the fallen Argentine idol.
</P>
<P>
   His former Barcelona teammate, Julio Alberto, told a Spanish
newspaper this week that the 1986 World Cup hero ``will die unless
he leaves Havana.''
</P>
<P>
   Maradona, 39, fled to a rehab facility in Cuba after being
hospitalized over the New Year with heart troubles that his
handlers initially denied had anything to do with drugs. But
Alberto, who recently visited Maradona, said his familiar
surrounding cast of friends and family members isn't doing him any
good in what might be his final chance to end a long-time
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't find a cure where he is,'' Alberto said in an
interview in Sport newspaper. ``Where he is at the moment, with all
those people and friends, he's living the same life as before.''
</P>
<P>
   A bloated Maradona, who recently died his hair bright orange,
has less than half his heart capacity working because of the damage
done by drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Africa: Violence mars upset
</P>
<P>
   Even if Cameroon had not taken the African Nations Cup in
controversial fashion over homestanding Nigeria on Sunday, a
disturbance probably would have happened anyway. Cameroon won 4-3
on penalty kicks after the two teams were tied 2-2 after extra
time, and mini-rioting broke out quickly, as it had after nearly
every Nigeria match. Police fired tear gas into mobs in and around
the Surulere Stadium in Lagos to regain control. A penalty-kick
goal by Nigeria's Victor Ikpeba was waved off despite a replay that
showed the ball had crossed the line, which set off the initial
unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Euro 2000: Hooligan pact signed
</P>
<P>
   Dutch, Belgian and German authorities signed an agreement this
week that provides police escorts for some fans traveling to and
from this summer's European Championships. Authorities will get a
dry run to try out some of the new measures Wednesday when Germany
plays The Netherlands in a friendly in Amsterdam. The two countries
have some of the most severe hooligan problems in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Cup: Americans advance
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. advanced to the quarterfinals of the CONCACAF Gold Cup
even before its final Group B match against Peru on Wednesday,
thanks to a 1-1 draw Monday between Peru and Haiti. The Americans
will play either Colombia or Honduras on Saturday at the Orange
Bowl in Miami.... Mexico, winners of the last three Gold Cups, is
rolling in Group C, thanks to a 4-0 pounding of Trinidad and Tobago
and is set in the quarterfinals on Sunday in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Spain: Comeback in Madrid
</P>
<P>
   Frighteningly close to the relegation zone after the holidays,
Real Madrid has found new life and now is in third place in the
Primera Division, after a 1-0 win over Valladolid on Tuesday.
Madrid, which made a coaching change and has been racked with
internal strife, is just four points behind leaders Deportivo La
Coruna.... Madrid's bitter enemy Barcelona is on a slide and has
earned only one point out of its last four matches, including a 2-1
defeat to Real Betis on Saturday.

   Four Premier League teams have been charged with misconduct by
the Football Association because of on-field melees over the
weekend. Leeds defender Ian Harte was cited for stepping on a prone
Chris Perry of Tottenham, while Dennis Wise of Chelsea and
Wimbledon's Kenny Cunningham started a 20-player brawl after their
match Saturday. The British House of Commons has condemned the
incidents.... Manchester United has signed an endorsement deal of
nearly $30 million with British cell-phone company Vodafone; it is
believed to be a world record for a soccer team.

   Scotland: Celtic ousts Barnes
</P>
<P>
   After a humiliating loss to first division Inverness Caledonian
Thistle in the Scottish Cup, Celtic canned first-year manager John
Barnes after only eight months on the job. The former England and
Liverpool star came under intense scrutiny from the start, and had
an unhappy locker room to boot. He will be replaced by director of
football operations Kenny Dalglish with the club in second place in
the Premier League, six points behind Rangers.

   Argentina: River coach quits
</P>
<P>
   Less than two days before the start of the Clausura (closing)
season last weekend, River Plate coach Ramon Diaz resigned, citing
the club's refusal to sign more players. River, which won the
Apertura title in December, features 18-year-old phenom Javier
Saviola, but Diaz wanted to provide him with more help. River won
four Argentine titles and the South American Copa Libertadores
crown under Diaz. On Sunday, the club defeated Cordoba 2-1 with a
caretaker manager.

   NEW YORK _ E-Specially My Barney, expected in stores by August,
comes with a cord so the purple plush figure can be plugged into
the nearest computer, where information can be downloaded daily
from a Web site and ``personalized'' for a particular child.
</P>
<P>
   A toy called V-Mail lets 5-year-olds send and receive their own
voicemail messages (they get PIN numbers, too). Then there is the
Kick Start Busy Crib Center, featuring a chirping electronic
lullaby activated when a baby whacks a colored part of the toy with
a foot.
</P>
<P>
   These are just a few of the latest offerings from the nation's
toymakers, who converged in New York for the annual ritual known as
Toy Fair, which ends Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the five-day fair, the epochal event in the toy-selling
business, it was abundantly clear that technology had become an
essential component in toys for the nation's children. That is true
for toys intended for children practically from the moment of their
birth _ often reconfiguring the kinds of inanimate objects once
considered playthings and supplanting adult involvement in
activities like learning the A B C's and singing an infant to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The trend appears to be breathing new life into toys whose sales
might otherwise have trailed off. The president of the Fisher-Price
unit of Mattel, Neil Friedman, estimated that three years ago, less
than 10 percent of the division's toys relied on any form of
electronics. This year, he said, more than 60 percent use some kind
of technology to deliver what he calls ``all the things we want for
the child and what the child wants for fun and enjoyment.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Toy Manufacturers of America, Peter Eio,
said at a news conference that ``the most surprising new category
to reflect the influence of technology is in the infant and
preschool segment,'' noting that sales of such toys grew 7 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon has its critics, though, with child-development
experts expressing concern that many of the newer electronic toys
have effectively eliminated the need to interact with another
person, either a too-busy parent or another child, and may
short-circuit a child's social and intellectual development.
</P>
<P>
   But defenders of the products counter that high-technology toys
merely reflect the times, that there is an advantage in being
exposed to technology early and that interactive toys open up a
wealth of possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are very toy-centered, as opposed to
child-centered,'' noted Dr. Timothy J. Kasser, an assistant
professor of psychology at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill., who has
studied the relationship between people's values and their
psychological states. ``We just got this Barney book, and it's a
book where my child wouldn't need me at all to read it to him. He
can press the buttons, and all the words come out.''
</P>
<P>
   The array is impressive. Diva Starz is a set of dolls from
Mattel that ``not only interact with each other, they can interact
with the girls, too,'' according to the showroom sales pitch. The
Intelli-Table, developed by Microsoft and Fisher-Price, promises to
teach children who press its buttons about colors, letters, numbers
and musical concepts _ the last with animal sounds, like the baaing
of sheep, set to snippets of a Mozart sonata.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a self-directed, self-rewarding process,'' said Erik
Strommen, a developmental psychologist who is on the Microsoft
research staff. ``In our testing, we saw 9-month-olds play with it
for 15 or 20 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   A talking McDonald's Happy Meal Drive-Thru from Hasbro, which
also makes the talking Barney and the Busy Crib Center, features a
computerized voice that asks, ``May I take your order?'' Toots the
Train, from Mattel, responds by opening its eyes when a child says
``go'' and makes comments of its own, like ``Gee, it's dark in
here!'' when inside a tunnel. Zip the Robot, a computer game for
5-year-olds from Oregon Scientific, announces, directly enough,
``Hi, I'm Zip, your robot friend inside the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Many toys, including old standbys like Barbie, now come with a
computer tie-in, either to a Web site or a CD-ROM, if not to a
television show that in some cases can be downloaded directly into
the toy.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is often borrowed from other industries. The
V-Mail toy, made by Toy Biz, uses telemetry once found only in
medical instruments, a company spokesman said. Companies like
Microsoft and IS Robotics have formed partnerships with toymakers,
applying the knowledge that drives adult-oriented businesses to
products aimed at younger consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The critics say there is nothing fun or gamelike about many of
the toys. ``My concern about all of these toys, whether it's a
Furby or an edutainment game, is that they tend to squash
creativity,'' said Michael Rich, a Boston pediatrician who is a
member of an American Academy of Pediatrics committee that tracks
children's use of television, computers and other electronic
entertainment. The committee recently recommended that children
under 2 not watch television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tends to lead them to look for a right response, rather
than to encourage the kind of free play that used to happen in the
sandbox with water and sticks,'' Rich said. ``It forces people into
predetermined decision pathways.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Toy Manufacturers of America, which
sponsors Toy Fair, said children's play had always reflected
society, and thus the increase in technology in toys was a mirror
of the rest of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are not losing something, they are gaining
something,'' said the spokeswoman, Terri Bartlett. ``They respond
faster, and their senses are heightened, because in society,
everything is coming at them faster.'' She added: ``We're all into
doing more things. The times they are spending on various types of
toys is being shortened. It's like they are multitasking with their
toys.''
</P>
<P>
   Some toy-store owners see the boom in high-tech playthings
helping, not hurting, particularly as the technology becomes more
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to not carry anything with electronics because it came
back for returns 70 percent of the time,'' said Cynthia Gerdes, who
owns a six-store chain called Creative Kidstuff in the Minneapolis
area. ``But something has really changed in the last 12 months. I
just saw a toy called the Babbler, a soft toy that babies can play
with. When they hit it, the pads light up and babble in Japanese,
French, English and Spanish. It's a wonderful cause-and-effect
toy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Gerdes said, technology seemed to drive the toys,
but she considers some newly developed toys to be more thoughtful.
``Finally, it's making sense,'' she said. ``Every year there has
been something out there that scares me. When I went to my first
vendor in 1982, he said to me, `Here's the section of shut-up toys.
That's the stuff that appeases kids, and they will leave you
alone.'''
</P>
<P>
   At Hasbro, the Barney toy with its computer connection was
developed so that parents could continually enhance Barney for
their children, said Lorrie Browning, a vice president of
marketing. ``We are giving Mom the tool to be the thrill-maker,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company believes that technology should support existing
patterns of play, Browning added. ``Parents believe that children
learn through play,'' she said, ``and as their experiences outside
the home become advanced, the experiences we provide at home with
toys need to keep pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, child-development experts say that a steady diet of
electronic toys can lead to boredom, isolation and worse. ``The
real essential element that seems to cause children's development
to unfurl is love and a feeling of warmth and relationship,'' said
Mary Pipher, a clinical psychologist who is the author of
``Reviving Ophelia'' and ``The Shelter of Each Other,'' studies of
contemporary family life.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``With all children, and especially teen-agers, it's all about
social development,'' she added. ``The kids who are the least
competent are the ones who are most likely to withdraw into
machines. They miss a real critical phase in terms of learning the
kinds of social skills we have to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Taylor, executive director of the Center for a New
American Dream, a Washington nonprofit group that promotes
``responsible consumption,'' said technology-based toys were
interfering with children's natural abilities, even as parents
believed they were providing their children with important learning
tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the love affair with technology and computer microchips,
we're actually dumbing-down our children's play,'' she said. ``We
are disconnecting children from the play opportunities that really
let them use the endless creativity that young children have.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers who worry about children's short attention spans may
have such toys to blame, the critics say. ``Many of the things you
learn in school are not easy, on-off or right-wrong answers,'' Rich
said. Electronic toys can instill a desire for instant
gratification and easy victory, and that can become an issue in the
classroom. ``It creates learned attention deficit because children
become used to the constant stimulation.''
</P>
<P>
   One expert said there was no substitute for parental
involvement, even if toys suggest otherwise. ``Parenting is a
time-based function,'' said Donald Shifrin, a Seattle pediatrician
who is also a member of Rich's committee. ``You are the door the
youngster will walk through on his way to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   So pervasive is technology's influence on the toy industry that
even bland board games have been swept up in the trend. Some have
been remade in electronic hand-held forms, and others have been
converted for online play.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the old-fashioned game of Life, invented 40 years
ago and updated by Hasbro for the present age. It is still in board
form, but now the squares are marked with requirements like ``Have
Web site designed _ pay $45,000.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MISIONES, Argentina _ As an evening commuter bus rumbles over
the red-earth sierra of Argentina's northeast province of Misiones,
which is a thumb of land poking into Brazil and bordering Paraguay,
a passenger stoops by the driver, reaches for a thermos mounted
beneath the windshield and refills a palm-sized gourd with hot
water.
 &HT;    The 40-something man, in pressed casual wear, offers the gourd
to a lean woman seated on the aisle in the front row. She receives
it as if the ritual were familiar and sips from the protruding
metal straw until slurping the last liquid. Then she returns the
gourd to the man, who refills it and passes it on.
 &HT;    While intriguing to an outsider, this intimate scene is as
ingrained in Argentine culture as tango or soccer. The liquid
they're drinking is mate (pronounced ma-tay), a tea known for its
healthful and medicinal properties. And this agrarian route, from
the town of Apostoles to the provincial capital of Posadas, is in
the epicenter of South America's mate-growing country.
 &HT;    Indeed, the region's iron-rich tierra roja and subtropical
micro-climate provide the world's only suitable growing conditions
for shrubby mate trees. Despite attempts to grow them as far away
as Asia, they prosper only in a limited area encompassing southern
Brazil, Paraguay's Itapua region and _ primarily _ Argentina's
provinces of Misiones and Corrientes.
 &HT;    In Argentina, the US$365 million mate industry accounts for
about 35 percent of Misiones' economy, second only to timber and
pulp. A quarter of a million bushy yerba mate trees grow on 422,000
acres.
 &HT;    For a visitor riding from Buenos Aires 300 miles north into the
gaucho province of Entre Rios, and then continuing another 250
miles to Misiones, mate sightings pop up everywhere, being enjoyed
across the generations. At a Sunday morning soccer match in the
Entre Rios hamlet of San Gustavo, it seems everyone cradles
thermoses and sip on gourds, from teens lounging on the grass to
grandparents; even the parrilla man tends a grill full of meat with
a mug in his free hand. The scene is similar that afternoon at a
nearby track where local farmers enter their steeds _ even a jockey
resting along the rail between races has a mate with his family.
Upon reaching Posadas, it is no surprise to encounter a policeman
walking his late-night plaza beat with thermos under arm.
 &HT;    The slow-paced city of Posadas is situated on the Alto Parana
bordering Paraguay. Among several mate concerns, it's the base of
Grupo Amanda, the country's oldest and fourth-largest producer. Its
president is Juan Alfredo Szychowski, called by everyone ``Don
Pancho.''
 &HT;    The antithesis of Buenos Aires pretension, Don Pancho greets a
visitor with understated old-world modesty. Slightly rumpled in an
open-collared shirt topped by a thin sweater, he has a striking
facial resemblance to Rodney Dangerfield. Don Pancho's office, with
its worn desk, could be mistaken for the plant foreman's.
 &HT;    Don Pancho integrates mate sips into his early morning
conversation with the ease of a pipe smoker. Although gourds can be
lavish, even gilded, Grupo Amanda's president sips from a chipped
white porcelain, mass-produced model. Under his desk glass are
snapshots of a son, two daughters and 14 grandchildren. Framed
portraits of his parents and Amanda's founders, Juan and
Bronislada, are mounted on the wall.
 &HT;    Don Pancho credits his parents with ingraining the ``moral
capital'' of humility and simplicity. After introductions, he is
eager to pace his visitor with mate lore and the story of his
parent's journey from Poland.
 &HT;    Mate derives from the Quechua word mati, or cup. Long before the
Jesuits arrived in 1609, the Guarni Indians steeped mate leaves
from their rain forest trees as a medicinal and energy drink. They
dubbed it ``the drink of the gods'' and even placed mate leaves in
the tombs of their chiefs. But the Jesuits initially regarded it as
``the devil's drink.'' It seems that mate's diuretic properties
made it impossible for the indigenous people to sit through a
church service.
 &HT;    Don Pancho's father was 11 years old when his family sailed to
Buenos Aires from Poland in 1897 in response to government land
offers. They journeyed upriver to Posadas, then rode oxcarts for
four days to Apostoles. Once there, the family settled on 200
acres.
 &HT;    Life was harsh, early crops were meager and child mortality was
high. Juan recalled the ordeal to National Geographic in 1956:
``The second year, we harvested our first corn. We ground it by
hand with a stone, and when mother baked the first fresh bread, the
whole family came in from the fields to eat it hot. Nothing has
ever tasted so good since. But it was four years before any of us
really had enough to eat.''
 &HT;    Feeling defeated, Juan and his father left for Buenos Aires in
1914, intending to earn the family's passage back to Poland. The
First World War scuttled those plans. They returned to Apostoles
and began to grow rice and mate, building farm machinery with
skills Juan learned in the capital as a blacksmith's apprentice.
Much of the handiwork is displayed in Amanda's museum, with
surround-sound narration, at its plantation outside Apostoles.
 &HT;    The town is a rural cocoon. It claims the dual titles of ``City
of Flowers'' and ``National Capital of Yerba Mate.'' Reflecting the
heritage of many of its 30,000 residents, two central churches are
filled either with Polish or Ukrainian ornaments, and a cafe buffet
might offer pirogis as well as empanadas. Amanda's farm is 13
kilometers from town, the last seven bouncing down a dirt road. En
route, trucks brimming with harvested leaves lumber along Apostoles
country roads, evidence in May that the cultivating season has
begun.
 &HT;    The plantation is called La Cachuara, which comes from the
Portuguese word cachoeira, or cascade. Early Brazilian workers
helped dig a canal from a river on the property to feed a water
wheel that powered a hand-built turbine.
 &HT;    Hanging on the walls of the farm's office are two icons _ a race
car with the Amanda logo and the Pope. Setting out to tour the
plantation, its chief engineer, Bernardo Kotik, points out the
trees' cluster of shoots, rather than one trunk. Tender and slow to
mature, the leaves aren't harvested until their fourth year and
aren't in full canopy for eight years. By then, the survivors are
hardy through rain or drought, remaining productive for decades.
 &HT;    Labor-intensive cultivation with machetes is gradually being
mechanized. The drying by fire, or secado, within a day of cutting
the leaves, remains critical. It shrivels one tree's 25-kilogram
yield of leaves to about 8 kilograms of yerba mate canchada. This
is finely chopped and packed into 50-kilo burlap bags and stored
for six months to two years, an aging process that's known as
estacionamiento. Quality control is important: Outside a storage
warehouse, a worker mounts a truck and, with a dagger, randomly
slashes into a few bags sent from storage en route to bins for
filtration and packaging.
 &HT;    Final packaging contains varying combinations of palo (stem),
hoja (leaf) and polvo (powder), depending on the final consumer.
Amanda's Argentine blends are 25 percent stem and a little powder.
Paraguayans like more stem and powder, Uruguay drinkers don't like
stems and Chileans don't like stems or powder.
 &HT;    Until a few years ago, Argentina's consumers were loyal to their
brands, rarely switching. Today, the industry is in upheaval with
overproduction, sinking prices and fierce new competition. The top
five brands' market share has dropped to under 50 percent from
about 70 percent.
 &HT;    Opportunities for upstarts grew out of the opening of the
economy in 1991 and the dropping of stringent production controls
dating to 1937. Since then, the national harvest has jumped 80
percent to 810,000 kilos, with yerba canchada ready to be sold
rising from 150,000 to 270,000 kilos. There's so much supply,
producers aren't converting all their raw material into final
product.
 &HT;    Competition on store shelves has become fierce, too, with 145
brands, up from about 80 a decade ago. Consequently, the retail
price of a kilo package has plunged in two years from $2.50 to
$1.75, with some brands aggressively priced as low as $1.
 &HT;    While a bonus for consumers, the country's 28,000 growers have
seen their price drop to 35 cents a kilo from more than 65 cents a
kilo a few years ago. At the same time, their labor costs are
rising due to competition for labor from Misiones' robust lumber
and pulp industry. Adding to the woes, exports to Brazil have dried
up due to the real's devaluation and growing Brazilian yerba
production. As a result, 1998 exports to Brazil of 18,816 tons
valued at $10.3 million fell to an estimated 6,000 tons worth about
$3 million this year.
 &HT;    The dire market conditions have added impetus to expanding
export markets, including the United States. But producers like
Amanda have met with only modest success. Shipments to the United
States have grown only 31 percent since 1990 and remain nearly
inconsequential at 312,000 kilos. This is dwarfed by Syria's
consumption of 11,400 tons, a jump from 6,052 tons in 1990. Even
so, with the price collapse, the value of those exports has risen
only 38 percent to $12.55 million.
 &HT;    Presumably, the Syrian taste for mate was acquired by immigrants
to the Southern Cone who later returned home. Remarkably, some
Syrian towns rate among the world's highest per capita consumers of
mate, well exceeding Uruguay's annual eight kilograms per capita
and Argentina's six kilos.
 &HT;    Syria has become such an important market for Amanda, its 4
million kilos of exports account for 20 percent of company sales.
``In the Mediterranean region, in every living room, no matter how
lavish the house is, there is a gas stove so that kettles of hot
water (for making mate tea) can be heated,'' says Edgard Omar
Figueredo, an Amanda liasion to Syria. He says it's mere
coincidence that Amanda's distribution plant serving the Middle
East is located in Yabroud, President Hafez al-Assad's home town.
 &HT;    In recent years, Chinese delegations have toured Misiones,
raising hopes that Asian millions might one day take to drinking
yerba mate cocida, which is packaged in tea bags. Amanda is also
stepping up U.S. marketing by introducing fruit-flavored mate
cocido (peach, lemon, apple) in new packaging to emphasize the
herbal qualities, and hopes to identify a Miami distributor.
 &HT;    However, the most formidable obstacle may be cultural. Says Don
Pancho: ``You have to take time to drink mate.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    YERBA MATE: A NEW CANCER FIGHTER?
 &HT;    One often hears unsubstantiated claims that mate may ward off
cancer as well as provide cardiovascular, nervous system and
muscular system benefits. Still, there appears to be scant hard
evidence to support these claims.
 &HT;    The cancer claim comes from a 1995 study in the Australian
journal Biochemistry and Molecular Biology International. It
concluded that mate does have antioxidant properties.
 &HT;    Earlier, a 1964 Pasteur Institute study concluded, ``It is
difficult to find a plant in any area of the world equal to mate in
nutritional value.'' It also stated that yerba mate contains
``practically all of the vitamins necessary to sustain life.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MISIONES, Argentina _ As an evening commuter bus rumbles over
the red-earth sierra of Argentina's northeast province of Misiones,
which is a thumb of land poking into Brazil and bordering Paraguay,
a passenger stoops by the driver, reaches for a thermos mounted
beneath the windshield and refills a palm-sized gourd with hot
water.
 &HT;    The 40-something man, in pressed casual wear, offers the gourd
to a lean woman seated on the aisle in the front row. She receives
it as if the ritual were familiar and sips from the protruding
metal straw until slurping the last liquid. Then she returns the
gourd to the man, who refills it and passes it on.
 &HT;    While intriguing to an outsider, this intimate scene is as
ingrained in Argentine culture as tango or soccer. The liquid
they're drinking is mate (pronounced ma-tay), a tea known for its
healthful and medicinal properties. And this agrarian route, from
the town of Apostoles to the provincial capital of Posadas, is in
the epicenter of South America's mate-growing country.
 &HT;    Indeed, the region's iron-rich tierra roja and subtropical
micro-climate provide the world's only suitable growing conditions
for shrubby mate trees. Despite attempts to grow them as far away
as Asia, they prosper only in a limited area encompassing southern
Brazil, Paraguay's Itapua region and _ primarily _ Argentina's
provinces of Misiones and Corrientes.
 &HT;    In Argentina, the US$365 million mate industry accounts for
about 35 percent of Misiones' economy, second only to timber and
pulp. A quarter of a million bushy yerba mate trees grow on 422,000
acres.
 &HT;    For a visitor riding from Buenos Aires 300 miles north into the
gaucho province of Entre Rios, and then continuing another 250
miles to Misiones, mate sightings pop up everywhere, being enjoyed
across the generations. At a Sunday morning soccer match in the
Entre Rios hamlet of San Gustavo, it seems everyone cradles
thermoses and sip on gourds, from teens lounging on the grass to
grandparents; even the parrilla man tends a grill full of meat with
a mug in his free hand. The scene is similar that afternoon at a
nearby track where local farmers enter their steeds _ even a jockey
resting along the rail between races has a mate with his family.
Upon reaching Posadas, it is no surprise to encounter a policeman
walking his late-night plaza beat with thermos under arm.
 &HT;    The slow-paced city of Posadas is situated on the Alto Parana
bordering Paraguay. Among several mate concerns, it's the base of
Grupo Amanda, the country's oldest and fourth-largest producer. Its
president is Juan Alfredo Szychowski, called by everyone ``Don
Pancho.''
 &HT;    The antithesis of Buenos Aires pretension, Don Pancho greets a
visitor with understated old-world modesty. Slightly rumpled in an
open-collared shirt topped by a thin sweater, he has a striking
facial resemblance to Rodney Dangerfield. Don Pancho's office, with
its worn desk, could be mistaken for the plant foreman's.
 &HT;    Don Pancho integrates mate sips into his early morning
conversation with the ease of a pipe smoker. Although gourds can be
lavish, even gilded, Grupo Amanda's president sips from a chipped
white porcelain, mass-produced model. Under his desk glass are
snapshots of a son, two daughters and 14 grandchildren. Framed
portraits of his parents and Amanda's founders, Juan and
Bronislada, are mounted on the wall.
 &HT;    Don Pancho credits his parents with ingraining the ``moral
capital'' of humility and simplicity. After introductions, he is
eager to pace his visitor with mate lore and the story of his
parent's journey from Poland.
 &HT;    Mate derives from the Quechua word mati, or cup. Long before the
Jesuits arrived in 1609, the Guarni Indians steeped mate leaves
from their rain forest trees as a medicinal and energy drink. They
dubbed it ``the drink of the gods'' and even placed mate leaves in
the tombs of their chiefs. But the Jesuits initially regarded it as
``the devil's drink.'' It seems that mate's diuretic properties
made it impossible for the indigenous people to sit through a
church service.
 &HT;    Don Pancho's father was 11 years old when his family sailed to
Buenos Aires from Poland in 1897 in response to government land
offers. They journeyed upriver to Posadas, then rode oxcarts for
four days to Apostoles. Once there, the family settled on 200
acres.
 &HT;    Life was harsh, early crops were meager and child mortality was
high. Juan recalled the ordeal to National Geographic in 1956:
``The second year, we harvested our first corn. We ground it by
hand with a stone, and when mother baked the first fresh bread, the
whole family came in from the fields to eat it hot. Nothing has
ever tasted so good since. But it was four years before any of us
really had enough to eat.''
 &HT;    Feeling defeated, Juan and his father left for Buenos Aires in
1914, intending to earn the family's passage back to Poland. The
First World War scuttled those plans. They returned to Apostoles
and began to grow rice and mate, building farm machinery with
skills Juan learned in the capital as a blacksmith's apprentice.
Much of the handiwork is displayed in Amanda's museum, with
surround-sound narration, at its plantation outside Apostoles.
 &HT;    The town is a rural cocoon. It claims the dual titles of ``City
of Flowers'' and ``National Capital of Yerba Mate.'' Reflecting the
heritage of many of its 30,000 residents, two central churches are
filled either with Polish or Ukrainian ornaments, and a cafe buffet
might offer pirogis as well as empanadas. Amanda's farm is 13
kilometers from town, the last seven bouncing down a dirt road. En
route, trucks brimming with harvested leaves lumber along Apostoles
country roads, evidence in May that the cultivating season has
begun.
 &HT;    The plantation is called La Cachuara, which comes from the
Portuguese word cachoeira, or cascade. Early Brazilian workers
helped dig a canal from a river on the property to feed a water
wheel that powered a hand-built turbine.
 &HT;    Hanging on the walls of the farm's office are two icons _ a race
car with the Amanda logo and the Pope. Setting out to tour the
plantation, its chief engineer, Bernardo Kotik, points out the
trees' cluster of shoots, rather than one trunk. Tender and slow to
mature, the leaves aren't harvested until their fourth year and
aren't in full canopy for eight years. By then, the survivors are
hardy through rain or drought, remaining productive for decades.
 &HT;    Labor-intensive cultivation with machetes is gradually being
mechanized. The drying by fire, or secado, within a day of cutting
the leaves, remains critical. It shrivels one tree's 25-kilogram
yield of leaves to about 8 kilograms of yerba mate canchada. This
is finely chopped and packed into 50-kilo burlap bags and stored
for six months to two years, an aging process that's known as
estacionamiento. Quality control is important: Outside a storage
warehouse, a worker mounts a truck and, with a dagger, randomly
slashes into a few bags sent from storage en route to bins for
filtration and packaging.
 &HT;    Final packaging contains varying combinations of palo (stem),
hoja (leaf) and polvo (powder), depending on the final consumer.
Amanda's Argentine blends are 25 percent stem and a little powder.
Paraguayans like more stem and powder, Uruguay drinkers don't like
stems and Chileans don't like stems or powder.
 &HT;    Until a few years ago, Argentina's consumers were loyal to their
brands, rarely switching. Today, the industry is in upheaval with
overproduction, sinking prices and fierce new competition. The top
five brands' market share has dropped to under 50 percent from
about 70 percent.
 &HT;    Opportunities for upstarts grew out of the opening of the
economy in 1991 and the dropping of stringent production controls
dating to 1937. Since then, the national harvest has jumped 80
percent to 810,000 kilos, with yerba canchada ready to be sold
rising from 150,000 to 270,000 kilos. There's so much supply,
producers aren't converting all their raw material into final
product.
 &HT;    Competition on store shelves has become fierce, too, with 145
brands, up from about 80 a decade ago. Consequently, the retail
price of a kilo package has plunged in two years from $2.50 to
$1.75, with some brands aggressively priced as low as $1.
 &HT;    While a bonus for consumers, the country's 28,000 growers have
seen their price drop to 35 cents a kilo from more than 65 cents a
kilo a few years ago. At the same time, their labor costs are
rising due to competition for labor from Misiones' robust lumber
and pulp industry. Adding to the woes, exports to Brazil have dried
up due to the real's devaluation and growing Brazilian yerba
production. As a result, 1998 exports to Brazil of 18,816 tons
valued at $10.3 million fell to an estimated 6,000 tons worth about
$3 million this year.
 &HT;    The dire market conditions have added impetus to expanding
export markets, including the United States. But producers like
Amanda have met with only modest success. Shipments to the United
States have grown only 31 percent since 1990 and remain nearly
inconsequential at 312,000 kilos. This is dwarfed by Syria's
consumption of 11,400 tons, a jump from 6,052 tons in 1990. Even
so, with the price collapse, the value of those exports has risen
only 38 percent to $12.55 million.
 &HT;    Presumably, the Syrian taste for mate was acquired by immigrants
to the Southern Cone who later returned home. Remarkably, some
Syrian towns rate among the world's highest per capita consumers of
mate, well exceeding Uruguay's annual eight kilograms per capita
and Argentina's six kilos.
 &HT;    Syria has become such an important market for Amanda, its 4
million kilos of exports account for 20 percent of company sales.
``In the Mediterranean region, in every living room, no matter how
lavish the house is, there is a gas stove so that kettles of hot
water (for making mate tea) can be heated,'' says Edgard Omar
Figueredo, an Amanda liasion to Syria. He says it's mere
coincidence that Amanda's distribution plant serving the Middle
East is located in Yabroud, President Hafez al-Assad's home town.
 &HT;    In recent years, Chinese delegations have toured Misiones,
raising hopes that Asian millions might one day take to drinking
yerba mate cocida, which is packaged in tea bags. Amanda is also
stepping up U.S. marketing by introducing fruit-flavored mate
cocido (peach, lemon, apple) in new packaging to emphasize the
herbal qualities, and hopes to identify a Miami distributor.
 &HT;    However, the most formidable obstacle may be cultural. Says Don
Pancho: ``You have to take time to drink mate.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    YERBA MATE: A NEW CANCER FIGHTER?
 &HT;    One often hears unsubstantiated claims that mate may ward off
cancer as well as provide cardiovascular, nervous system and
muscular benefits. Still, there appears to be scant hard
evidence to support these claims.
 &HT;    The cancer claim comes from a 1995 study in the Australian
journal Biochemistry and Molecular Biology International. It
concluded that mate does have antioxidant properties.
 &HT;    Earlier, a 1964 Pasteur Institute study concluded, ``It is
difficult to find a plant in any area of the world equal to mate in
nutritional value.'' It also stated that yerba mate contains
``practically all of the vitamins necessary to sustain life.''

 &HT;    CheckFree Net billing now on top
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Far less than 1 percent of the companies that send you
bills do so through the Internet. The other 99 percent print a
paper bill, stuff it in an envelope and pay someone to stick it in
your mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Until late Tuesday, two companies were jostling to
electronically link companies and their customers, to take the
paper and some of the cost out of the billing and bill-paying
industry.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree's plan to buy rival TransPoint for more than $1
billion in stock would leave the Norcross, Ga., company alone on
top and poised to grab the largest chunk of that 99 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, investors treated CheckFree as that kind of leader
in an industry with serious potential. CheckFree shares hit a
52-week high of $125.62 1/2. They finished a manic day up about 47
percent, or $32, closing at $100.25.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 16 million shares traded hands, more than 13 times the
average daily volume over the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This move makes CheckFree the Microsoft of the bill payment
and processing industry, essentially. If you could invest in that,
you would, too,'' said Avivah Litan, who follows the industry for
GartnerGroup. ``This industry will take off. There are no
competitors to speak of, and CheckFree is going to dominate it.
There's no doubt now.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal, expected to close within six months, calls for
CheckFree to issue 17 million shares. Based on Tuesday's closing
price of $68.25, the deal was worth about $1.16 billion. Investors
added more than half a billion in paper value to those shares by
the close of the market Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree shares traded above $100 at the end of 1999. As
recently as Jan. 31, they were selling for less than $60.
</P>
<P>
   The three heads of the companies most involved in the deal,
CheckFree, Microsoft and First Data, said the acquisition would
speed the rate at which consumers and billers would start using the
service in substantial numbers. When the deal closes, TransPoint's
investors will own 23 percent of CheckFree.
</P>
<P>
   More than 350 billers, including phone companies, utilities and
banks, and 3 million consumers use CheckFree to deliver bills and
payments. But the technology has yet to take off, partly because
billers had to choose between CheckFree and TransPoint, each with
its own technology.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Kight, CheckFree's 43-year-old chairman and chief
executive, said the acquisition was motivated by billers, some of
whom did not like having to choose between or adopt two technology
platforms to reach customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the ones who changed our thinking in terms of not
always thinking competitively,'' Kight said.
</P>
<P>
   Kight said the acquisition should increase the speed at which
receiving and paying bills on the Internet becomes as functional
and widely used a tool as e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this merger is going to bring people's bills to them
electronically much faster than if we hadn't done it,'' Kight said.
``Everybody's been reading and hearing about e-commerce. Electronic
bill payment and presentment is really about `me commerce.' It
enables billers and consumers to get exactly what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree plans to be able to deliver at least four bills to the
average consumer through the Internet by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   GartnerGroup's Litan said CheckFree will have a bit of a grace
period in which to produce. She said the company will need to
double, to 6 million, the number of subscribers by next February.
</P>
<P>
   ``CheckFree is it for the time being,'' said Litan. ``They still
have to produce now. They still have to show some numbers. If they
don't generate adoption in the next year, I think the market will
hurt them.''

 &HT;    Plenty of concerns for Braves
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Braves pitchers and catchers will
arrive at the spring training complex at Disney today _ with one
notable exception.
</P>
<P>
   Closer John Rocker will be absent, and the Braves are hoping
that they can focus on the other issues at hand. They have plenty
to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues at hand are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gauging Andres Galarraga's comeback bid from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Incorporating new left fielder Reggie Sanders, second baseman
Quilvio Veras and backup first baseman Wally Joyner into the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   _ Filling in the bullpen gaps, to work around Rocker's absence.
</P>
<P>
   _ Monitoring the health and well-being of Kerry Ligtenberg, Rudy
Seanez, Javy Lopez and, more recently, Eddie Perez, who had
offseason shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   _ Settling on a fifth starter.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers and catchers begin their workouts Friday. The goal is
to be in throwing shape before spring-training games begin on March
2 with an exhibition against the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the team will report Tuesday, with full squad
workouts to begin Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg and Chipper Jones were among the early arrivals,
dropping by the complex on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the 1999 National League MVP, has been in his native
Florida working out, in preparation to try to put up another
MVP-caliber season.
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg was cleared by Dr. James Andrews last week to aim for
being ready by Opening Day. He continues his progress toward
throwing at full strength, to complete his almost year-old
rehabilitation from Tommy John surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga will join the Braves pitchers and catchers on
Friday, four days earlier than when the rest of the position
players report. Galarraga, who weighs just five pounds more than
his usual playing weight, has been swinging a bat since December,
but he hasn't faced live pitching in almost 1 1/2 years. How he
will respond is one of the spring's most intriguing questions.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez was hard at work long before he rejoined the team today.
Lopez, who missed half of 1999 with a knee injury, added exercise
equipment at his home in Atlanta and a batting cage in his
backyard. He is expected to be at full strength by the start of the
season, but his progress will be monitored. Asfor Rocker, his
greatest hope is that baseball arbitrator Shyam Das decides to
reduce his penalty, which might allow Rocker to report to spring
training. But that decision, and what happens with his month-long
suspension, is not expected until early next week.

KELSEY GRAMMER RAISING AWARENESS OF IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Psychiatrists can talk about anything _ especially radio
psychiatrists twice removed, like Dr. Frasier Crane.
</P>
<P>
   Although he doesn't talk specifically about constipation,
diarrhea, bloating and excessive flatulence, Emmy Award winner
Kelsey Grammer has launched a public-education initiative to raise
awareness of irritable bowel syndrome, also known as spastic colon.
</P>
<P>
   Grammer and his wife, Camille, are making radio and TV
public-service announcements in cooperation with the International
Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders. They hope to
make it easier for people to discuss their symptoms with their
doctors, relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hear much about IBS because some of the symptoms
involved relate to subjects traditionally considered taboo by the
public and the press,'' he says. ``However, it's important that we
help people get over their embarrassment. We need to be able to
talk openly about any medical condition that causes so many people
to suffer in silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Camille Grammer has IBS, which was diagnosed about 3 1/2 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBS impacts my life in so many ways,'' she says. ``I am always
fearful that my IBS symptoms will return at any moment, so I always
have to know where the nearest bathroom is. I'm afraid that eating
will result in stomach pain. Traveling is difficult. And IBS often
makes even a simple night out with my husband, to enjoy a concert
or movie, seem impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   IBS is a medical disorder that is estimated to affect as many as
20 percent of all adults in the United States, with female
sufferers outnumbering males by about three to one. IBS is one of
the 10 most frequently diagnosed conditions, more common than
asthma or diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The disorder is characterized by multiple symptoms that include
chronic, recurrent abdominal pain and discomfort and irregular
bowel function, including diarrhea, constipation or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I can remember, I've always had stomach and bowel
problems and have never really known what to do about it. I have
been amazed to learn how so many women have been suffering in the
same way. I hope that my efforts to speak openly about my condition
will encourage others to do the same and get the help they need,''
Camille Grammer says.

H&AMP;R BLOCK REPORTS DATA MIX-UP AMONG SOME OF ITS WEB CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least nine people who logged on to H&AMP;R Block's Web site to do
their taxes last week ended up with data from other customers'
returns mixed in with their own, the company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The problem may have allowed the customers doing their returns
online to see confidential data like Social Security numbers from
another customer's file but did not affect other applications on
the Web site, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no impact, for instance, on customers who used the
site to download Block's free program for preparing taxes on their
home computers because none of their data would have been stored on
Block's server.
</P>
<P>
   Block said it shut down the online service Monday as soon as it
learned of the problem. A review of data has turned up no more than
25 other files that may have been affected out of the 300,000
people who have used the online service, according to Gene
Goldenberg, senior vice president for software and electronic
commerce for Block, which is based in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Those customers are being contacted but any user concerned about
the situation can call Block at (800) 472-5625, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldenberg said the problem was traced to a snippet of software
added by a programmer as part of a project to speed the service. He
said the faulty code had been fixed but the service would not be
restored until Saturday morning, to provide time for thorough
testing. As of Wednesday, afternoon, the company was still unsure
exactly how the faulty code made the program malfunction in the few
cases in which data was shifted. &QL;

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MISIONES, argentina _ Un autobus recorre por la noche la sierra
en la provincia de Misiones, en el nordeste de Argentina, una
franja de terreno entre Brasil y Paraguay. Un pasajero se inclina
junto al conductor, toma un termo y llena de agua caliente una
pequena calabaza ahuecada.
 &HT;    El hombre ofrece la calabaza a una mujer sentada en la fila
delantera. La mujer la toma de una forma que evidencia que conoce
bien el ritual y bebe hasta vaciar el recipiente. Luego se lo
devuelve al hombre, que lo llena otra vez y lo pasa a otra persona.
 &HT;    Esta escena esta tan arraigada en la cultura argentina como el
tango o el futbol. El liquido que toman es mate, un te conocido por
sus propiedades medicinales. Y esta ruta agraria, del pueblo de
Apostoles a la capital provincial de Posadas, esta en el epicentro
de la zona de cultivo del mate en Sudamerica.
 &HT;    La tierra roja de la region, rica en hierro, y el microclima
subtropical, ofrecen condiciones unicas en el mundo para el cultivo
del mate. Se ha intentado cultivarlo en Asia, pero solo se da en
una zona limitada que abarca el sur de Brasil, la region paraguaya
de Itapua y, sobre todo, las provincias argentinas de Misiones y
Corrientes.
 &HT;    En Argentina, la industria del mate, que mueve US$365 millones,
constituye alrededor del 35 percent de la economia de Misiones,
solo superada por la madera y la pulpa. Un cuarto de millon de
plantas de mate crecen en 171.000 hectareas.
 &HT;    El visitante que viaja desde Buenos Aires unos 500 kilometros al
norte, hacia la provincia gaucha de Entre Rios, y luego sigue otros
400 kilometros hasta Misiones, ve mate por doquier. Y es que lo
disfrutan desde hace muchas generaciones. En un partido de futbol
una manana de domingo en la aldea de San Gustavo, en Entre Rios,
todo el mundo lleva termos y bebe de calabacillas, desde los
adolescentes que se echan en la hierba hasta los abuelos. Incluso
el que atiende la parrilla, toma mate con la mano libre. Esa misma
tarde, hay una escena similar en un terreno cercano donde los
granjeros llevan sus caballos; hasta un jinete que descansa entre
carreras, apoyado en la cerca, bebe mate con su familia. Al llegar
a Posadas, no es raro ver a un policia haciendo la ronda nocturna
con un termo bajo el brazo.
 &HT;    El apacible pueblo de Posadas esta en el Alto Parana, cerca de
Paraguay. Entre las diversas empresas dedicadas al cultivo del mate
esta Grupo Amanda, el cuarto y mas antiguo productor del pais. Su
presidente es Juan Alfredo Szychowski, a quien todos llaman ``Don
Pancho.''
 &HT;    Don Pancho, la antitesis de la pretension de Buenos Aires,
saluda al visitante con gran modestia. Viste una camisa un poco
ajada, con el cuello abierto, y un sueter ligero. La oficina de Don
Pancho, con su escritorio gastado, podria confundirse con la del
capataz de la planta.
 &HT;    Don Pancho bebe mate mientras conversa con la misma facilidad
que un fumador experimentado maneja su pipa. Aunque las calabazas
pueden ser lujosas, el presidente de Grupo Amanda usa un modelo
corriente de porcelana blanca. Bajo el cristal que cubre su
escritorio hay fotografias de un hijo, dos hijas y 14 nietos. En la
pared, a su derecha, cuelgan retratos de sus padres y fundadores de
Amanda, Juan y Bronislada.
 &HT;    Don Pancho dice que sus padres le inculcaron el ``capital
moral'' de humildad y sencillez. Despues de la presentacion, relata
inmediatamente al visitante las tradiciones del mate y la historia
del viaje de sus padres desde Polonia.
 &HT;    El nombre del mate viene de la palabra quechua mati, que
significa taza. Mucho antes que los jesuitas llegaran en 1609, los
guaranies usaban las hojas de mate para elaborar una bebida
medicinal que ademas les daba energia. La llamaban ``la bebida de
los dioses'' y hasta colocaban hojas de mate en las tumbas de sus
jefes. Pero los jesuitas la consideraron inicialmente ``la bebida
del diablo.'' Al parecer, sus propiedades diureticas no permitian a
los indigenas quedarse durante toda la misa.
 &HT;    El padre de Don Pancho tenia 11 anos cuando su familia salio de
Polonia rumbo a Buenos Aires en 1897 para aprovechar la oferta de
tierra del gobierno argentino. Viajaron rio arriba hasta Posadas y
luego recorrieron los 64 kilometros que los separaban de Apostoles
en carretas de bueyes durante cuatro dias. Alli se asentaron en un
terreno de 80 hectareas.
 &HT;    La vida era dura, las primeras cosechas eran magras y la
mortalidad infantil era alta. Juan recordo a la revista National
Geographic, en 1956, aquellos tiempos dificiles: ``El segundo ano,
recogimos nuestra primera cosecha de maiz. Lo molimos a mano, con
una piedra, y cuando mi madre horneo el primer pan, toda la familia
vino del campo para comerlo caliente. Ninguna otra cosa me ha
sabido mejor. Pero antes de eso estuvimos cuatro anos sin mucho que
comer.''
 &HT;    Sintiendose derrotados, Juan y su padre salieron para Buenos
Aires en 1914, con la idea de ganar lo suficiente para regresar a
Polonia. Pero la Primera Guerra Mundial frustro sus planes.
Volvieron a Apostoles y se dedicaron a cultivar arroz y mate.
 &HT;    El pueblo, de ambiente rural, reclama para si los titulos de
Ciudad de las Flores y Capital Nacional de la Yerba Mate.
Reflejando el legado de muchos de sus 30.000 habitantes, dos
iglesias estan llenas de ornamentos polacos y ucranianos. La granja
de Amanda esta a 13 kilometros del pueblo, y los ultimos siete no
estan asfaltados. En el camino se ven camiones cargados de hojas de
mate, dando tumbos por los terraplenes.
 &HT;    La plantacion se llama La Cachuara, que proviene de la palabra
portuguesa cachoeira, que significa cascada. Hace tiempo, peones
brasilenos excavaron un canal desde un rio hacia la propiedad para
llevar agua a un molino que daba corriente a una turbina artesanal.
 &HT;    En las paredes de la oficina de la granja hay dos iconos: un
automovil de carrera con el logo de Amanda y el Papa. En gira por
la plantacion, el jefe de mantenimiento, Bernardo Lotik, senala un
grupo de retonos. Las hojas, tiernas y lentas para madurar, se
cosechan en el cuarto ano y alcanzan su plenitud en ocho. Para
entonces, las plantas que han sobrevivido soportan bien tanto la
lluvia como la sequia y se mantienen productivas varias decadas.
 &HT;    El cultivo, que requiere mucha mano de obra, se mecaniza
gradualmente. El secado con fuego, un dia despues de cortar las
hojas, es una parte vital del proceso, que deja 25 kilogramos de
hojas recogidas en unos 8 kilogramos de yerba mate canchada. Esta
hoja se corta muy fino, se empaca en sacos de 50 kilos y se
almacena entre seis meses y dos anos, lo que se conoce como
estacionamiento. El control de calidad es importante: en el
exterior de un almacen, un trabajador se sube a un camion y hunde
una daga en sacos escogidos al azar, cuyo contenido se echa luego
en recipientes para filtrarlo y empacarlo.
 &HT;    El envasado final contiene diversas combinaciones de palo, hoja
y polvo, dependiendo del consumidor final. Las mezclas argentinas
de Amanda tienen un 25 por ciento de palo y poco polvo. A los
paraguayos les gusta mas palo y polvo; a los uruguayos no les gusta
el palo y a los chilenos no les gusta ni el palo ni el polvo.
 &HT;    Hasta hace pocos anos, los consumidores argentinos eran leales a
su marca. Hoy, la industria sufre el trastorno de la
superproduccion, la caida de los precios y una competencia feroz.
La participacion de mercado de las cinco marcas principales ha
bajado del 70 por ciento a menos del 50 por ciento.
 &HT;    Las oportunidades para los advenedizos surgieron con la apertura
de la economia en 1991 y la reduccion de los estrictos controles de
produccion que se remontaban a 1937. Desde entonces, la cosecha
nacional ha aumentado el 80 por ciento, a 810.000 kilogramos, y la
cantidad de yerba canchada lista para la venta se ha incrementado
de 150.000 a 270.000 kilos.
 &HT;    La competencia en los establecimientos de venta tambien se ha
hecho feroz. Hay 145 marcas; hace una decada eran solo 80. Por
ello, el precio al detalle del paquete de un kilo ha bajado en dos
anos de US$2,50 a US$1,75, y algunas marcas fijan audazmente el
precio en solo US$1.
 &HT;    Aunque es conveniente para el consumidor, los 28.000
cultivadores del pais han visto bajar sus precios de mas de 65
centavos el kilogramo hace unos anos a 35 centavos. Al mismo
tiempo, el costo de la mano de obra sube debido a la competencia
por el personal que representa la robusta industria de papel y
pulpa de Misiones. Por si fuera poco, las exportaciones a Brasil se
han agotado debido a la devaluacion del real y a la creciente
produccion de la yerba en el vecino pais sudamericano. Como
resultado, las exportaciones de 1998 a Brasil 18.816 toneladas
valoradas en US$10,3 millones bajaron a un estimado de 6.000
toneladas con un valor de unos US$3 millones este ano.
 &HT;    Las dificiles condiciones del mercado han impulsado la expansion
de las exportaciones hacia distintos paises, entre ellos Estados
Unidos. Pero los productores como Amanda han tenido un exito
modesto. Los embarques hacia Estados Unidos solo han aumentado el
31 por ciento desde 1990 y solo llegan a 312.000 kilogramos, una
cantidad insignificante. Mucho mayor es el consumo de Siria, 11.400
toneladas, casi el doble de las 6.052 toneladas que consumio en
1990. Aun asi, debido a la caida de los precios, el valor de esas
exportaciones solo ha aumentado el 38 por ciento, a US$12,55
millones.
 &HT;    Posiblemente la aficion siria al mate se debe a los inmigrantes
al Cono Sur que mas tarde regresaron a su pais. Curiosamente,
varios pueblos sirios estan entre los mayores consumidores per
capita de mate del mundo, superando los 8 kilogramos per capita
anuales de Uruguay y los 6 kilos de Argentina.
 &HT;    Siria se ha convertido en un mercado muy importante para Amanda:
sus 4 millones de kilogramos en exportaciones representan el 20 por
ciento de las ventas de la compania. ``En la region del
Mediterraneo, en todas las salas, incluso en las casas mas lujosas,
siempre hay un hornillo de gas para calentar agua,'' dice Edgard
Omar Figueredo, el enlace de Amanda con el pais levantino. Afirma
que es mera coincidencia que la planta de distribucion de Amanda
que atiende al Medio Oriente este en Yabroud, el pueblo natal del
presidente Hafez al-Assad.
 &HT;    En anos recientes, delegaciones de China han visitado Misiones,
con la esperanza de que un dia millones de asiaticos se habituen a
la yerba mate cocida, que se empaca en bolsitas de te. Amanda
tambien acelera el mercadeo en Estados Unidos con el lanzamiento
del mate cocido con sabor a fruta (pera, limon, manzana) en un
nuevo envase que enfatiza las propiedades de la yerba, y espera
encontrar un distribuidor en Miami.
 &HT;    Pero el principal obstaculo tal vez sea cultural. Dice don
Pancho: ``Hay que tener tiempo para tomar mate.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    YERBA MATE: PROTEGE CONTRA EL CANCER?
 &HT;    Muchas veces se ha afirmado que el mate puede proteger contra el
cancer y que es beneficioso para el sistema cardiovascular, el
nervioso y el muscular. Pero no hay pruebas concretas que respalden
esas afirmaciones.
 &HT;    La idea de que el mate pueda combatir el cancer proviene de un
estudio que aparecio en 1995 en la revista australiana Biochemistry
and Molecular Biology International. El estudio concluyo que el
mate tiene propriedades antioxidantes.
 &HT;    Antes, en 1964, un estudio del Instituto Pasteur manifesto: ``Es
dificil encontrar una planta en cualquier parte del mundo que
iguale al mate en valor nutritivo.'' El estudio tambien declaraba
que la yerba mate contiene ``practicamente todas las vitaminas
necesarias para la vida.''

 &HT;    Aunque es conveniente para el consumidor, los 28.000
cultivadores del pais han visto bajar sus precios de mas de 65
centavos el kilogramo hace unos anos a 35 centavos. Al mismo
tiempo, el costo de la mano de obra sube debido a la competencia
por el personal que representa la robusta industria de papel y
pulpa de Misiones. Por si fuera poco, las exportaciones a Brasil se
han agotado debido a la devaluacion del real y a la creciente
produccion de la yerba en el vecino pais sudamericano. Como
resultado, las exportaciones de 1998 a Brasil 18.816 toneladas
valoradas en US$10,3 millones bajaron a un estimado de 6.000
toneladas con un valor de unos US$3 millones este ano.
 &HT;    Las dificiles condiciones del mercado han impulsado la expansion
de las exportaciones hacia distintos paises, entre ellos Estados
Unidos. Pero los productores como Amanda han tenido un exito
modesto. Los embarques hacia Estados Unidos solo han aumentado el
31 por ciento desde 1990 y solo llegan a 312.000 kilogramos, una
cantidad insignificante. Mucho mayor es el consumo de Siria, 11.400
toneladas, casi el doble de las 6.052 toneladas que consumio en
1990. Aun asi, debido a la caida de los precios, el valor de esas
exportaciones solo ha aumentado el 38 por ciento, a US$12,55
millones.
 &HT;    Posiblemente la aficion siria al mate se debe a los inmigrantes
al Cono Sur que mas tarde regresaron a su pais. Curiosamente,
varios pueblos sirios estan entre los mayores consumidores per
capita de mate del mundo, superando los 8 kilogramos per capita
anuales de Uruguay y los 6 kilos de Argentina.
 &HT;    Siria se ha convertido en un mercado muy importante para Amanda:
sus 4 millones de kilogramos en exportaciones representan el 20 por
ciento de las ventas de la compania. ``En la region del
Mediterraneo, en todas las salas, incluso en las casas mas lujosas,
siempre hay un hornillo de gas para calentar agua,'' dice Edgard
Omar Figueredo, el enlace de Amanda con el pais levantino. Afirma
que es mera coincidencia que la planta de distribucion de Amanda
que atiende al Medio Oriente este en Yabroud, el pueblo natal del
presidente Hafez al-Assad.
 &HT;    En anos recientes, delegaciones de China han visitado Misiones,
con la esperanza de que un dia millones de asiaticos se habituen a
la yerba mate cocida, que se empaca en bolsitas de te. Amanda
tambien acelera el mercadeo en Estados Unidos con el lanzamiento
del mate cocido con sabor a fruta (pera, limon, manzana) en un
nuevo envase que enfatiza las propiedades de la yerba, y espera
encontrar un distribuidor en Miami.
 &HT;    Pero el principal obstaculo tal vez sea cultural. Dice don
Pancho: ``Hay que tener tiempo para tomar mate.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    YERBA MATE: PROTEGE CONTRA EL CANCER?
 &HT;    Muchas veces se ha afirmado que el mate puede proteger contra el
cancer y que es beneficioso para el sistema cardiovascular, el
nervioso y el muscular. Pero no hay pruebas concretas que respalden
esas afirmaciones.
 &HT;    La idea de que el mate pueda combatir el cancer proviene de un
estudio que aparecio en 1995 en la revista australiana Biochemistry
and Molecular Biology International. El estudio concluyo que el
mate tiene propriedades antioxidantes.
 &HT;    Antes, en 1964, un estudio del Instituto Pasteur manifesto: ``Es
dificil encontrar una planta en cualquier parte del mundo que
iguale al mate en valor nutritivo.'' El estudio tambien declaraba
que la yerba mate contiene ``practicamente todas las vitaminas
necesarias para la vida.''

 &HT;    Home improvement retailers to look at industry changes
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the economy at full steam, home improvement
products are hot sellers. Yet retailers are working harder than
ever at courting the housing market.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Atlanta-based Home Depot has revolutionized the
business of two-by-fours and hardware with its sprawling
warehouses, the industry seems to be remodeling itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is at a crossroads right now. As good as this
business has been, companies are going in different directions,''
said Don Longo, editor of National Home Center News, a trade
publication. ``We're seeing dramatic change, and innovation is the
main buzzword in the industry right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the industry's creative thinkers will gather today in
Orlando, Fla., at the trade publication's inaugural Innovators 2000
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward convenience is sure to be a hot topic.
Retailers in general have been trying to make their stores easier
to shop, and home improvement is following suit, Longo noted.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's new Villager's Hardware chain, which debuted last
year in New Jersey, will be the focus of a planned discussion on
the small-store trend in the industry, Longo said.
</P>
<P>
   Home improvement retailing has shaped up as two extremes:
warehouses and smaller, old-fashioned hardware stores, said Mike
Largent, president of Stambaugh Hardware, a regional Ohio-based
chain.
</P>
<P>
   Taking clues from Gap and Old Navy, Largent revamped his
hardware stores with wide aisles, varnished wood and nostalgic
touches like a rolling ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Female do-it-yourselfers prefer a cozy environment, said
Largent, who'll lead a discussion on small-store formats.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its Villager's Hardware concept, Home Depot has
been trying to tone down the clutter and noise in some warehouses.
A new store in Alpharetta, Ga., for example, provides quiet,
intimate areas along the walls for home decor, kitchen and bathroom
design.
</P>
<P>
   Villager's Hardware and Home Depot representatives are notably
absent from the conference, because of scheduling conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Another topic made more pertinent by Home Depot is forest
certification and the sale of ``environmentally friendly''
products. Those issues are growing more complex because the
industry hasn't agreed on environmental guidelines. Home Depot is
pushing vendors to phase out products from so-called endangered
forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take a look at how you market these
environmentally safe products to consumers and how you can be
profitable at each level of the supply chain,'' said John
Caulfield, executive editor of National Home Center News.
``Consumers and business are all in favor of the environment, but
when push comes to shove, it's hard to market these goods.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference ends Friday.

AFL-CIO SUPPORTING AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Minn., Tenn.)  (rk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Adopting a sharp change in policy, the American
labor movement Wednesday called for blanket amnesty for illegal
immigrants and an end to most sanctions against employers who hire
them.
</P>
<P>
   In decades past, labor unions often saw immigrant workers as the
enemy, accusing them of depressing wages and breaking strikes. But
the executive council of the AFL-CIO adopted a more sympathetic
approach Wednesday, contending that too often the nation's
immigration rules had enabled employers to exploit illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy comes as business groups are pushing for similar
legislative changes to help industry cope with a shortage of
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants comprise an ever-larger part of the nation's work
force, and labor leaders are stepping up efforts to unionize
hundreds of thousands of immigrants who work at farms, hotels,
construction, meat packing and many other industries. Labor leaders
complain that unscrupulous employers often fight off unionization
drives by threatening to fire employees who are illegal immigrants
and support unions, and by calling immigration officials to deport
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The present system doesn't work and is used as a weapon
against workers,'' said John Wilhelm, chairman of the labor
federation's Committee on Immigration Policy and president of the
Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union. ``The only reason a
lot of employers want to hire a large number of illegal aliens is
so they can exploit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders said they hoped their new policy would help
persuade Congress to pass an amnesty law that would enable
immigrant workers to stand up for their rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the AFL-CIO's decision is going to be a shot heard
round Washington,'' said Frank Sharry, executive director of the
National Immigration Forum, an immigrants' advocacy group. ``You
have a variety of employer groups saying, `We need more immigrant
workers and we want our workers to be legal,' and you have the
AFL-CIO saying, `We want more immigrant workers to be legal and
we're willing to talk to employers about their legitimate needs.'
You have the makings of a business-labor compact that could draw
new immigration policies for the next decade.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor federation's resolution calls for blanket amnesty for
the estimated 6 million illegal immigrants in the United States. At
the same time the federation, which is holding its annual winter
meeting here, called on the federal government to maintain efforts
to keep out illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Just 15 years ago, the labor federation's support helped pass
legislation creating sanctions for employers who hire illegal
immigrants. At the time, labor unions said such sanctions were
needed to keep illegal immigrants from flooding the labor market
and undermining union wages.
</P>
<P>
   But union officials said Wednesday that a new policy was needed
because employer sanctions have failed to stem the tide of
immigration and because immigrants represent such a large part of
the work force in dozens of industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very dramatic change in policy that follows a very
dramatic change in our world,'' Wilhelm said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wednesday's action came after union officials in California, the
state with the most illegal aliens, urged AFL-CIO officials to back
an amnesty, telling them that many illegal workers faced low wages
and lives of misery because of the way immigration rules have
enabled unscrupulous employers to exploit them.
</P>
<P>
   Many immigrants have had an ambivalent attitude toward the labor
movement because some unions sought to keep out immigrant workers
and because of labor's past support of employer sanctions. But with
unions straining to organize more workers, labor officials have
concluded that current immigration rules, with their threat of
deportation, have made it hard to unionize industries that hire
many illegal immigrants, like apparel, chicken-processing and
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders pointed to an incident involving a Holiday Inn
Express in Minneapolis, which asked immigration officials to deport
nine hotel maids after they had voted to unionize. The maids were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Labor officials see their new policy as a way to make immigrants
warm up toward labor and to make it easier to unionize businesses
with many illegal immigrants by making it harder for employers to
intimidate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, the labor movement, have to put ourselves in a leadership
position in immigrant rights,'' said Arturo Rodriguez, president of
the United Farm Workers. ``This is a way to help low-wage,
immigrant workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor federation's resolution called for stiffer sanctions
against any companies that use advertisements or recruiters in
other countries to encourage illegal immigrants to come to the
United States to work for them. In support of this measure, the
United Food and Commercial Workers distributed copies of a want ad,
placed in a newspaper in Juarez, Mexico, on behalf of a
chicken-processing plant in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson, vice president of labor policy for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, welcomed the labor federation's new policy.
``It's certainly a departure from organized labor's traditional
position, which was an increased number of immigrant workers is bad
for domestic workers,'' he said. ``I think this is an area where
the business community and organized labor can work together.''
</P>
<P>
   But some advocacy groups criticized labor's change on
immigration. Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for
American Immigration Reform, which has taken a hard line against
increased immigration, said the call for amnesty, coming after the
amnesty granted in 1986, would inevitably encourage more illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``These pronouncements send signals around the world that this
country should continue to be flooded with illegal workers,'' Stein
said.
</P>
<P>
   The labor federation opposed proposals put forward by some
business groups to expand the size of guest worker programs, in
which tens of thousands of foreigners are allowed into the country
temporarily to work. Union officials said many guest workers have
been exploited. The AFL-CIO said that the best way to deal with any
shortage of workers would be to expand job-training programs.

 &HT;    Bush campaign has spent $50 million
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. _ The George W. Bush presidential
campaign, which raised money last year at record levels, is now
spending it at record levels and will soon pump up efforts to
collect more.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials said Wednesday that they have spent more than
$50 million since the campaign set up shop 11 months ago. That
surpasses the record $42.2 million Bob Dole spent to win the GOP
nomination in 1996 and approaches the $66 million that wealthy
publisher Steve Forbes spent in 1996 and this year before dropping
out of the GOP race last week.
</P>
<P>
   So far, all Bush has to show for all that spending are Iowa and
Delaware primary wins tainted by the absence of prime foe John
McCain, and a crushing, campaign-changing loss to him in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Top Bush aides said Wednesday that the campaign finance report
to be filed next week will show that the campaign had $20 million
on hand as of Jan. 31. Total money raised will be about $73
million.
</P>
<P>
   When it became apparent that Bush was no longer the prohibitive
favorite in New Hampshire, the Bush campaign pumped up spending,
though officials won't say by how much.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got Plan A and Plan B,'' said Don Evans, Bush's
national finance chairman. ``Guess what, we're on Plan B.''
</P>
<P>
   A Texan who has raised more than $100,00 for the Bush campaign
said Wednesday of the spending, ``It's shocking. It is shocking.''
He also said Bush campaign officials have been very tight-lipped
when asked about how things are going in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said he is not concerned because his campaign is
spending ``for the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides said the Arizona senator has spent about $26
million and had $10 million on hand as of Jan. 31. McCain,
campaigning Wednesday in Columbia, S.C., said Bush's spending is
``a remarkable expenditure, but we can overcome that.''
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman, Rick Davis, said the spending has minimized the
importance of Bush's record-breaking war chest. ``It's dwindling
down to being not a significant advantage,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, Saturday's South Carolina primary is the most
crucial contest on the political calendar. It is quickly followed
by contests in Michigan and Arizona next Tuesday. McCain wins in
all three states could severely damage Bush's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wins, however, would go a long way toward comforting
supporters _ including ``pioneers'' who each raised more than
$100,000 _ who are becoming concerned about Bush's ability to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to win South Carolina,'' said Bush spokeswoman
Karen Hughes. ``That's what we are going to do to stop that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he remains comfortable with his strategy, a nationwide
effort far different that McCain's targeted campaign. McCain has
concentrated only on South Carolina, Michigan and Arizona, as well
as New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a plan in place that's going to enable me to stay in
this race for the long run,'' Bush said. ``We have been fighting in
every primary state. We're on plan, and I think I've got a good
chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his spending total is high because it includes TV ad
buys in 14 states and Washington D.C. as he competes in all
primaries, while McCain picks and chooses. The return on investment
will come, Bush campaign officials believe, when he starts piling
up wins in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush TV ads began running in expensive California markets on
Tuesday. McCain also is running ads in California, which holds its
key primary on March 7 along with 11 other states.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan now includes going back into fund-raising mode in
March and April, assuming _ as Bush does _ that he will have the
nomination clinched by then. But campaign officials insist that has
always been the plan. They deny that the record spending levels
have forced them to add fund-raising efforts and events to the game
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a contingency budget we had outlined in the eventuality
that we lost New Hampshire in which we would beef up advertising
and voter advocacy in other states,'' Hughes said. ``That's exactly
what we're doing. We are on budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's long-range plan was aimed at clinching the nomination as
early as possible and then having enough money left to continue
campaigning through the Republican National Convention in August.
To that end, and as a result of the record fund-raising efforts,
Bush is not accepting federal matching funds for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, eventual nominee Dole took the matching money for the
primaries and ran out of cash shortly after he clinched the
nomination. His campaign shut down until the federal money began
flowing after the national convention for the general election
race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will take federal money for the general election but is
concerned that Vice President Al Gore, whom Bush believes will be
the Democratic nominee, will be able to use his office to campaign
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the Bush campaign has spent $3.1 million on TV ads
in South Carolina and believes McCain has spent $2.8 million.
Because he is taking federal matching money, McCain is subject to a
$1.5 million spending cap here.
</P>
<P>
   ``In return for taxpayers' money, candidates ought to conform to
the rules,'' Bush said. ``No candidate should be above the rules,
and Senator McCain needs to explain, if in fact he has busted the
spending cap in South Carolina, how on one hand you can be a
campaign funding reformer and on the other hand not live within the
spending caps.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's political director, John Weaver, said federal rules
allow spending of about $3 million on South Carolina, including
television and radio ad buys in neighboring states that are seen by
South Carolinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a dime under (federal spending caps) in New Hampshire,
and we will be a nickel under here,'' Weaver said.

ZIMBABWE FARMERS' GROUP QUIET AFTER A POLITICAL VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ A day after helping forge a major political
victory over President Robert Mugabe, the Commercial Farmers Union,
which represents this country's biggest planters, was not bragging
_ or even talking.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which represents 4,000 commercial growers, most of
them white, no doubt was relieved that voters here rejected a draft
constitution that would have given the government the right to
seize white-owned land without compensation. But the union also
realizes that the issue of land reform is not going away, so
boasting about the vote now could make the situation ahead even
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just sitting back now and waiting to see what
happens,'' said Ian Goggin, administrator of the Zimbabwe
Agricultural Commodity Exchange. ``No one wants to antagonize
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of the country's major players, Wednesday was a day for
taking stock of the political landscape, which was dramatically
reshaped this week when the proposed constitution championed by
Mugabe was voted down. For the 75-year-old former freedom fighter,
it was the biggest defeat of his political career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has been a rude awakening for them, and now they
are trying to strategize,'' said Morgan Tsvangirai, president of
the Movement for Democratic Change, a new party that is expected to
mount a formidable challenge to the ruling party's dominance of
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The new party and its ally, the National Constitutional
Assembly, led the campaign against the constitution, which, they
contended, would have strengthened Mugabe's power. Seizing on
popular discontent with Mugabe and the country's crumbling economy,
the organizations drew thousands of unhappy urban voters to the
polls and won almost 55 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after the results were announced, the silence of the
farmers' union seemed particularly conspicuous. Just a week ago,
the union was running newspaper ads that pointed out flaws in the
proposed constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But now the farmers realize that the vote was not for them, but
against Mugabe, whose popularity has waned as the country's economy
has been worn down by surging inflation and steep unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to gloat,'' said Sam Moyo, who has studied
land reform for two decades and who heads the Harare-based Southern
Africa Regional Institute for Policy Studies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whites here number only about 70,000, but among the country's
12.5 million people, they remain an influential part of the
economy. Nowhere is that more true than in agriculture, which
whites dominate and which, according to the World Bank, supplies
about 40 percent of the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
   The complexion of the agriculture business is a legacy of the
country's white-minority rule that set aside much of the most
fertile territory for whites. An international program to help the
government acquire some of the land and use it to resettle landless
peasants on small plots has been in the planning stage for more
than a year. But it has been hindered in part by the Zimbabwean
treasury's shortage of money.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for Zimbabwe to pay to acquire the land, while
international donors would pay the far larger costs of building the
farms' infrastructure and training new owners.
</P>
<P>
   But further complicating the plan has been Mugabe's proposal
that the government simply take the land _ just as it was taken
from blacks decades ago _ without any compensation. His plan has
particularly unsettled foreign investors that the country so
desperately needs to keep the economy afloat.

EPA TO HANDLE ZONOLITE INSULATION CALLS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Flooded with telephone calls from nervous homeowners,
the federal Environmental Protection Agency is advising people with
questions about Zonolite Attic Insulation to call its Boston
office.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA toll-free number is 1-888-372-7341, available weekdays
between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reported this week that Zonolite Attic Insulation, a
popular product made by W.R. Grace Co. from 1963 to 1984, contains
asbestos, but that Grace officials fought to keep warning labels
off its product.
</P>
<P>
   Zonolite is a loose-fill insulation that was made from
vermiculite, a mineral, and is gold-colored and shaped like small
pieces of bark. The vermiculite that Grace used in its Zonolite
came from a mine it owned in Libby, Mont. The mine also contained
asbestos, which was embedded in the vermiculite. Grace removed
some, but not all of the asbestos in the vermiculite it used in its
attic insulation, documents obtained by the Globe show. Vermiculite
from other mines is used to make products such as cat litter and
potting soil; those mines do not appear to be similarly
contaminated, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's acting regional administrator also said the agency was
putting new information about vermiculite insulation on its web
site (www.epa.gov/region01/qa.html). Some of the EPA's advice:
</P>
<P>
   --If you know or suspect you have vermiculite insulation, you
may want to test it to see how much asbestos is in it. The EPA
recommends that you hire an asbestos consultant to do this, rather
than collecting the sample yourself. Call EPA's toll-free number
for a list of licensed consultants.
</P>
<P>
   -- If you do decide to collect the sample yourself, wet down the
insulation and wear gloves and a cloth face mask, the EPA advises.
</P>
<P>
   -- If you do contact a laboratory directly, use a laboratory
certified by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation
Program. Call the EPA's toll-free number for a list.
</P>
<P>
   -- If the samples show asbestos and it appears that the fibers
may be entering the air in your home, you may want to then have the
air in your house tested, again by a licensed consultant.
</P>
<P>
   -- The decision as to whether to remove the insulation is up to
you, the EPA says. If the insulation is sealed behind walls or in
an enclosed attic, it may be best to leave it alone. The EPA
cautions that removal may cost thousands of dollars.

<P>
   Early in the Peloponnesian War, the remains of Athenian soldiers
killed in battle against the Spartans were interred in communal
tombs outside the ancient city's west gate, off the road to the
academy where Plato taught.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this cemetery in 431 B.C. that the statesman Pericles,
speaking from a high platform at the funeral, described the
greatness of Athens in one of history's most eloquent orations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is for such a city, then, that these men nobly died in
battle,'' Pericles declared, ``thinking it right not to be deprived
of her, just as each of their survivors should be willing to toil
for her sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists think they have found remains of 200 to 250
Athenian citizen-soldiers from that time, perhaps the very ones
memorialized by Pericles.
</P>
<P>
   Their ashes and bones were excavated three years ago at a
construction site in Athens, but now they have been delivered to
Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y., for the first detailed
scientific analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The examination of the remains, expected to take several years,
is being conducted at a university laboratory by Dr. Anagnostis
Agelarakis, a forensic anthropologist at Adelphi and specialist in
Greek archaeology. The excavations were directed by Dr. Charis
Stoupa of the Greek Department of Classical Antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discovery of state burials containing bones dating from
the early years of the Peloponnesian War brings a new sense of
reality to the story of that crucial time in Greek history,'' said
Dr. Andrew Szegedy-Maszak, a scholar of classical studies at
Wesleyan University. He was quoted in an article on the new
findings in the current issue of Archaeology magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bodies had been cremated, as was the custom in
classical Greece for heroes, the remains are not all ash. Many
recognizable pieces of arm and leg bones, skull and jaw and
vertebra and pelvis fragments are among the 200 pounds of bone
being studied by Agelarakis. A preliminary investigation has
already showed that all the bones that could be so classified were
from men.
</P>
<P>
   Agelarakis said Wednesday that further analysis would
concentrate on what the bones could reveal about the age and
physical size range of the soldiers, their diets, the diseases and
accidents they suffered, any evidence of surgical intervention in
treating broken bones, and traces of heavy metals they might have
ingested from vessels they ate and drank from.
</P>
<P>
   An early inspection of the bones, Agelarakis said, hinted at
damage and growth patterns in the bones that might reveal the
occupational stresses of the dead. Some of the clues suggested that
the men had spent much time riding, mounting and dismounting horses
and so must have been members of the cavalry.
</P>
<P>
   But the heat of cremation, the anthropologist said, would have
destroyed the organic material of the bone, including genetic
material like DNA.
</P>
<P>
   While archaeologists and other classical scholars could not
affirm that the bones were from soldiers of Pericles, they said the
evidence was strong.
</P>
<P>
   First, all the remains appear to be those of men. The site of
the burials fits descriptions in literature of the Demosion Sema,
or People's Grave, an honored burial ground in classical times for
statesmen, generals and soldiers who died in combat. The style of
pottery among the burials dated the tombs to 431 to 421 B.C., the
first years of a civil war that dragged on to the surrender of
Athens in 404.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it _ we have the context,'' Agelarakis said in an
interview, noting the evidence supporting the interpretation that
these are remains of soldiers for Athens or one of its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the knowledge of the Peloponnesian War was preserved in
the writings of the historian Thucydides. Scholars said the
circumstances of the newly discovered communal burials appeared to
be in accord with the historian's description of funerals ``for the
first to die in this war.'' The bones of the fallen soldiers, he
wrote, would be displayed in public for two days. Then a procession
of wagons would carry the cremated remains in coffins or urns to be
placed in a public tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists said the bones and ashes were found spread out on
the floors of three of the four communal tombs, known as
polyandreia. Next to the remains were vases decorated with battle
scenes, other emblems for the burial place of heroes.

 &HT;    Ivester may leave Coke ahead of schedule
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Doug Daft may be moving up to the top spots at
Coca-Cola sooner than expected as M. Douglas Ivester moves out.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement could come as early as today when the board of
directors meets in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Deutsch said Wednesday that the company
had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, 52, was supposed to retire as chairman and chief
executive officer at the April 19 shareholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been maintaining an extremely low profile since the
Dec. 6 announcement of the intended leadership change. Since that
time, important company announcements have been made by Daft in his
current role as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the board names Daft as CEO on Thursday, that simply
formalizes what is now reality,'' said John Sicher, editor and
publisher of Beverage Digest. ``Doug Daft is running the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft has been remaking the company from top to bottom in hopes
of regaining momentum lost following several setbacks, including
depressed earnings and a European health scare. The 56-year-old
Australia native has restructured Coca-Cola by decentralizing
operations. He has moved more executives and decision-making from
the Atlanta headquarters to the local markets around the world
where Coca-Cola beverages are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization prompted the decision to cut 6,000 jobs from
the company's global work force. Already, the company has cut about
1,500 jobs in North America, primarily in Atlanta. On Tuesday,
about 500 of those workers lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, Daft's moves have not generated much enthusiasm
on Wall Street. Since Ivester stunned investors and employees with
the announcement that he would retire prematurely, the stock has
dropped more than 21 percent. It closed at $53.75, down $1.93 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   If Daft ascends to the top spots earlier than expected, then
Jack Stahl is also likely to replace Daft as president and chief
operating officer sooner than originally planned. Stahl, 46, was
supposed to get those jobs at the April shareholders meeting.

&HT;        FEDERAL AUDIT TO PROBE BIG DIG, HIGHWAY SPENDING
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 - A team of federal auditors will conduct a
financial examination of the Big Dig and other road and bridge
projects in the state before any more federal dollars are spent,
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater told Massachusetts lawmakers
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the discrepancy of the cost of the project, they
want a full and open disclosure on all the projects that are going
to be put to them before any money is released,'' Rep. J. Joseph
Moakley, D-South Boston, told reporters after a meeting with the
secretary. ``They want to make sure that the financial plan is one
that will fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Slater also told the lawmakers that he would reject any finance
plan from Big Dig officials that steals funds slated for other
Massachusetts road and bridge projects.
</P>
<P>
   Big Dig managers are to release a finance plan by March 15 that
takes into account recent overruns of $1.4 billion, bringing the
project to a total of $12.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Coming one day after Congress grilled him to probe whether Big
Dig officials misled auditors and broke any laws by doing so, the
secretary's pledges eased Massachusett's legislators' fears that
the over-budget Big Dig would threaten other projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that this is what has to be done in this
situation in order for the state to avail themselves of the federal
money that's already there,'' Moakley said.
</P>
<P>
   Moakley said the chances for criminal penalties to be placed on
Big Dig managers were slim. ``The inspector general told me (from)
everything he saw, there was no criminal or illegal actions going
on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Slater reportedly told the lawmakers he would do all that he
could to make sure the Big Dig would be finished on time by 2005,
and that no additional federal dollars would be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to continuing to discuss this matter with not
only your congressional delegation but also (with) the people who
are working on it at the state and local level,'' Slater told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors from the federal highway administration, who will
investigate the project on-site in Boston beginning next week, will
probe whether Massachusetts highway officials have been forthcoming
with spending amounts for all federally-funded highway projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been disagreement as to whether the state has not
(paid) its fair share (for the Big Dig), but (also) in terms of
non-Big Dig road and bridge work, whether those submissions have
been accurate,'' said Rep. William Delahunt, D-Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   Slater's decision to send outside overseers to conduct the audit
demonstrated an apparent distrust of the regional federal highway
administration already charged with overseeing the project, the
lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local people will not be involved in the audit,'' Moakley
said. ``So he (Slater) feels they need some fresh air into that
whole situation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James McGovern, D-Worcester, was less reserved in
criticizing the federal highway authorities in Massachusetts, who
have said they were unaware of the $1.4 billion in shortfalls.
``Clearly they could have done a better job,'' McGovern said.
</P>
<P>
   As Slater reviews a series of recommendations in a 57-page audit
of the Big Dig from the department's inspector general, he is
expected to announce specific actions he will take in days to come.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said Slater would likely approve of the
recommendations in that audit, such as a call for increased
scrutiny into oversight of the Central Artery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether or not he'll add any to those,'' said
John F. Tierney, D-Peabody.

GORE CAMPAIGNS, TAKES TIME TO TOUR TORNADO AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACON, Ga. _ Blurring the line between his presidential campaign
and his vice presidential duties, Al Gore barnstormed through the
South &UR;  &LR; Tuesday, picking up political support while also taking a
detour on a taxpayer-sponsored trip to survey damage from the
deadliest tornadoes to hit Georgia in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Gore belatedly joined Democratic rival Bill
Bradley in opposing President Clinton's nomination of associate law
professor Bradley A. Smith to the Federal Election Commission, at
the behest of Republican senators.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who teaches at Capital University in Columbus, Ohio,
opposes the law that the FEC enforces. ``Campaign finance reform
has turned out to be bad policy,'' he has written. ``The most
sensible reform is a simple one: repeal of the Federal Elections
Campaign Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, ``I neither support this nomination nor agree with
the views of Professor Bradley Smith. The last thing we need is an
FEC commisioner who publicly questions not only the
constitutionality of proposed reforms, but also the
constitutionality of current limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Gore's statement, Bradley said: ``I said it last
week, and he said it this week. That's par for the course. I take a
position and a week later he takes the same position. I'm obviously
sad the adiministration made the appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley asked rhetorically whether Gore would work actively to
block Smith's appointment. ``I would,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore's campaign becoming increasingly confident of winning
the Democratic nomination, the Smith statement was another sign
that Gore is setting his sights on the general election. Republican
candidate John McCain has made campaign finance reform the
centerpiece of his run for the presidency while McCain's rival,
Texas Governor George W. Bush, unfurled his own ideas Tuesday for
cleaning up campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gore spent part of the day campaigning in North
Carolina, a state that doesn't even hold a primary vote until May
2, well after the party's nominee is expected to have been decided.
</P>
<P>
   At a high school in Raleigh, Gore picked up endorsements from
Governor Jim Hunt and Senator John Edwards, the two top Democratic
officialholders. Hunt had endorsed Gore in his 1988 presidential
bid, but Gore campaign officials nonetheless portrayed the
endorsement as significant because of the governor's ties to the
former New Jersey senator. A top Bradley campaign aide, Ed
Turlington, is Hunt's former executive assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a day after winning the endorsement of the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, Gore added Empire
Pride, the nation's largest gay rights group, to his list. Based in
New York, the group of about 12,000 members gave Gore its support
during a conference call before the vice president left Raleigh for
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The train might not quite be leaving the station yet, but a
lot of people are getting on board in anticipation that it will be
soon,'' Chris Lehane, Gore's press secretary, said explaining the
recent wave of endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   With Bradley's biggest threat being that he has more money on
hand than Gore to continue his campaign, the vice president is
looking for ways to boost his profile through his government duties
while keeping down campaign costs.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the campaign scratched the town meeting in Macon,
making only a quick stop on the airport tarmac, while flying off at
taxpayer's expense to Camilla so Gore could tour the devastation
from Monday's tornadoes in southwest Georgia that left 19 people
dead, more than 100 injured and damage estimated at $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was an adjustment that required more than a wardrobe change
for Gore who during the course of the day went from dark suit to
kakhis to blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   In Macon, Gore spoke as Air Force II sat behind him on the
tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I leave here, I'm going to be leaving as vice president
to go down and try to extend help those folks,'' Gore said
awkwardly. ``But while I'm here, I want to ask for your help in my
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has made disaster relief a personal specialty,
normally taking such trips, Lehane said that since Gore was going
to be in Georgia before the tornadoes struck it made sense for him
to go and survey the damage and comfort victims and their families.
He said only ``a very small fraction'' of the cost of Gore's
travels Tuesday that took him from North Carolina to Georgia to
Louisiana would be picked up by taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Said Lehane, ``Al Gore is a candidate for president, but he
still retains the constitutional responsibility and (there will be)
times when he'll be wearing his vice presidential hat.''

BUSH EFFORT EATING AWAY CAMPAIGN FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILTON HEAD, S.C. _ Conceding that his campaign churned through
more than $50 million of its vaunted war chest before Jan. 31,
Governor George W. Bush struggled Tuesday to defend his rapid
spending rate, while his aides conceded that campaign costs have
ontinued to spiral since his surprising loss in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   News of Bush's money situation came on a day when his chief
rival for the Republican nomination, Senator John S. McCain of
Arizona, scored something of a breakthrough on the Christian
conservative front with the endorsement of Gary Bauer, an
anti-abortion activist who abandoned his own presidential campaign
two weeks ago. Bauer may be able to help McCain fend off questions
about the depth of his devotion to the anti-abortion cause.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also won support Tuesday from California's
highest-ranking Republican office-holder, Secretary of State Bill
Jones, who switched from his earlier support of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Following McCain's victory in New Hampshire, Bush has maintained
an aggressive 14-state television advertising schedule costing more
than $3 million in South Carolina alone, where a pivotal primary
will be held Saturday. The expenditures have left Bush with less
than $20 million to fight the rest of the Republican primary race.
The condition of Bush's finances is especially troubling to
Republican supporters who saw his early fundraising boom as his
greatest strength.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters in Hilton Head, the Texas governor
maintained his equanimity about the progress of his campaign.
``We've got a plan in place that's going to allow me to stay in
this race for the long run,'' Bush said. ``We have been fighting in
every primary state, we are on plan, and I think I've got a good
chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning the fundraising tables on McCain, Bush also questioned
whether the senator had surpassed the spending limits in South
Carolina by spending $2.8 million in ads. McCain denied doing so,
under complex campaign finance laws. The limits do not apply to
Bush, who is not accepting federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates are believed to be locked in a close race in
South Carolina, and both men campaigned across the state all day.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer appeared at McCain's side at a rally at Furman University
in Greenville. Though Bauer acknowledged policy differences with
McCain over trade issues with China and gays in the military, he
described the senator as the candidate who represents ``the best
shot we have to end the era of Bill and Hillary and Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   At a subsequent press conference, McCain said Bauer's presence
in his campaign would ``provide a line of communication with parts
of the party where lines were not as strong as I would have liked
for them to have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bauer drew little political support during the
presidential race _ he attracted less than 10 percent of the vote
after waging a vigorous campaign in Iowa and dropped out after
drawing only one percent in New Hampshire _ he has an outstanding
reputation among religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer is the first prominent member of the Christian
conservative movment to endorse McCain. Although the Arizona
senator has insisted throughout the campaign that he is a
``pro-life'' candidate, both he and Bush have been dogged by
activists on the issue because of their support of exemptions for
abortions in cases of rape or incest or danger to the life of the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of Republican debates, Bauer repeatedly demanded
that Bush pledge to name a ``pro-life'' running mate. Bush refused.
Bauer said Tuesday that he realized McCain opposed ``a litmus test,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Other prominent religious conservatives, such as Ralph Reed, the
former executive director of the Christian Coalition, are active in
the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, has been the unquestioned king of campaign
fundraising, drawing in more money for this election than any
candidate in history. Before New Hampshire, many observers believed
his giant funding effort, combined with his broad-based party
support, would make Bush all but invincible in the race.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's Feb. 1 victory punctured that belief. But the
revelations, first aired in the New York Times, about Bush's Jan.
31 FEC filing _ to be officially released next week _ raised a
possibility no one even considered before Tuesday: That Bush might
spend much of his war chest before reaching the general election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides, however, said they were simply following a
longstanding spending plan. Bush communications director Karen
Hughes said the $50 million or so spent before Jan. 31 included
pre-payments for advertising in the months to come. She also said
Bush had arranged a contingency financing plan in case he lost the
New Hampshire race, which the campaign is adhering to now.
</P>
<P>
   And, even with his campaign coffer down to about $20 million,
Bush still has far greater resources than all his opponents
combined.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had $10 million in cash as of Jan. 31, after spending
some $26 million in the race up until then, according to senior
aide Rick Davis. He has also raised several million on the
Internet. Both McCain and Bush plan to hold fundraisers in the
coming months.

 &HT;    Rookies are along for the ride
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daytona Beach, Fla. _ Tony Stewart knows all about being a
rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 rookie of the year in NASCAR's Winston Cup circuit said
the challenges facing this year's bumper crop of novices will begin
long before the drop of the green flag.
</P>
<P>
   Finding your way in and out of the race track and making
required meetings on time can't be taken for granted, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR holds those (rookie driver) meetings early on Friday
morning, and the hardest thing to do is to make yourself get up to
be there on time,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   But once the side issues are out of the way, the eight rookies
entered in the Daytona 500 _Dale Earnhardt Jr., Matt Kenseth, Dave
Blaney, Stacy Compton, Scott Pruett, Mike Bliss, Jeff Fuller and Ed
Berrier _ have a lot to learn, despite success in other racing.
Earnhardt Jr., who comes to Winston Cup after winning two NASCAR
Busch Grand National titles, said the Daytona 500 is a bigger
challenge than he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of downplayed the difficulty of qualifying for the
Daytona 500,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. ``There's a lot more at stake
than I thought, and practice gets kind of hairy sometimes.... There
are a whole lot more gut checks these two weeks than we'll see the
rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the rookies have to learn the drill in NASCAR's top
class, most of them have extensive experience in other divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be listed as rookies, but they're not really
rookies,'' said Bill Elliott, driver of the No. 94 Ford. ``Take
Scott Pruett. He's been in IROC cars and in open-wheeled cars that
are a lot more advanced than the stuff we've got.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, they've got their work cut out for them _ all of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who won three races and finished fourth in points in
winning the rookie title, said he rates the current rookie class
``pretty high.''
</P>
<P>
   His accomplishments ``could be overshadowed pretty quickly this
year,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fuller is the oldest rookie at 42 and has endured a
month-long barrage of questions and jokes about his sponsor,
Viagra. The former Modified racer from Auburn, Mass., has taken the
Viagra comments in stride, but he prefers to talk about his race
car and about being at Daytona as a driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everybody's dream to finally make it to this league,''
Fuller said. ``It took me 26 years to do it, but it's nice to be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuller wrecked his primary car in a practice incident with Greg
Sacks but is soldiering on with a back-up. ``For the most part,
everything is going according to plans,'' he said. ``I hope this
all pays off.''
</P>
<P>
   Berrier was a late addition to the rookie field. He came up with
an 11th-hour plan to drive the No. 90 Ford that belongs to veteran
car-owner Junie Donlavey.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get an opportunity, you have to make the best of
it,'' Berrier said. ``I've been coming here for 20 years, and I've
always wondered what it feels like.''
</P>
<P>
   And how does it feel? ``It's as tough as it gets,'' he said.
``I'll feel a lot better if I can get through (today's 125-mile
qualifying race) and get into the 500.''
</P>
<P>
   The two drivers who have gotten the most pre-season attention
are Earnhardt Jr. and Kenseth, his closest Busch Series challenger.
They are in adjoining stalls in the Winston Cup garage this week.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth, like most other rookies, isn't overly concerned with
what the other rookies are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're here to try to eventually be competitive at
Winston Cup and be able to run like we have in the Busch,'' Kenseth
said. ``My main goal is to qualify for these races and try to
complete as many miles as we can, so we can learn and go back to
these tracks for the second time and be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. and many veteran drivers say the first race
probably won't be a true indicator of who's the top rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daytona isn't necessarily the best place to use as a measuring
stick,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. ``I think after about five or 10 races
you'll have a good idea of which team has jelled the quickest -_
and we're all pretty much good teams.''

 &HT;    Tiger effect: Attention dividend for Tour
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are they angry with Tiger Woods for dominating their tour? Was
there a pre-Buick Invitational meeting last week where the players
banded together over a bonfire of burning range balls and pledged
to beat him?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Other players on the PGA Tour are envious of Woods; a few of
them are even outwardly jealous. But the grousing among the ranks
can't amount to much, because they all benefit hugely from what the
24-year-old phenom has accomplished and will continue to do.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour's last TV contract was the richest by far in
history, and every round of every tournament is televised.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the ``Tiger Effect'' significantly affected
contract negotiations with the networks, and now it's even
stronger. Purses are bulging. Crowds are filling entrance roads
when Woods is in contention. Young people are jamming the fairways
in record numbers. Concession stands are overflowing. TV ratings
are up significantly when Woods plays. The 8.4 rating from San
Diego on Sunday was the highest for a regular PGA Tour event since
1987.
</P>
<P>
   When a Kirk Triplett starts to benefit from the Tiger Effect,
it's widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's talk about Tiger,'' a smiling Triplett, who has yet to
win a tour event, said after a second-round 64 at the Buick. ``I
think it's great to see. I think it's great having all you (media)
guys here, all this interest. I love picking up USA Today and
(having golf) right there on the front page _ not the sports
page.... You turn on the TV and see David Duval doing commercials
for AT&AMP;T during prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fantastic. I mean, everybody thinks golf is a really
neat, great game, and they're excited about it. And a lot of it is
because of Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   It is only February, after all. Much of the nation is still
battling winter and remains two months from even thinking about
playing golf. But here was golf, and Woods, last week representing
the biggest story in sports, as he went for a seventh victory in a
row. The last time golf got so many people interested, Woods won
the Masters by 12 shots in 1997. Before that, Jack Nicklaus won the
1986 Masters at age 46.
</P>
<P>
   It will be like this all year. When Woods gets to the Masters,
April 6-9, he might have won a couple of more times, and the media
zoo will be seen in record proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in San Diego, Woods added about 10,000 fans per day.
The media assemblage grew from 100 to 300 after he won at Pebble
Beach and headed to Southern California. Usually, a half dozen
people are writing late in the day in the Buick Invitational press
room. This year, 10 times were.
</P>
<P>
   When Phil Mickelson managed to beat Woods on Sunday, he was
quick to point out the impact of The Streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Tiger has played the last six events, and prior to
that, he has generated a lot of interest for the game of golf,''
Mickelson said. ``Galleries were so large this week, they couldn't
accommodate it, parking-wise. And I'm a beneficiary of that.... I'm
making more money because Tiger is helping increase these purses.
He's creating more excitement in the game of golf, and all the
players are beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully for the other players, Woods doesn't play every week.
He's at the Nissan Open in Los Angeles beginning today at Riviera
Country Club and then will play next week at the Andersen
Consulting Match Play Championship in Carlsbad, Calif. But he will
skip two weeks and return for the Bay Hill Invitational and The
Players Championship before taking a week off before the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   But now every tournament wants Woods more than ever, and the
events that don't get him might start to resemble tennis
tournaments where Pete Sampras or Andre Agassi don't play. When
Woods failed to defend his title at the BellSouth Classic in 1999,
the tournament still sold out and raised record charity numbers,
but the TV ratings were off from the previous year. In fact, in the
10 tournaments last year with the biggest TV audiences, Woods was
in contention in all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have an incremental advantage of the extra eyes on
television, the extra tickets, which is what Tiger brings,'' PGA
Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said. ``But he has uplifted interest
in the entire sport, and that is paying dividends.''
</P>
<P>
   Such players asDuval, who returned to the tour this year with
the body-fat of a bicyclist, have sought their own edge. In this
country and with the world's other tours, players have been forced
to either improve or get out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it might be good for the game of golf,'' Spain's Jose
Maria Olazabal said. ``I think it's going to make us try harder and
work harder, to take our games to a higher level, so we can compete
against him.''

 &HT;    Aid urged to nurture democracy in Ivory Coast
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Alassane Ouattara, the former prime minister of Ivory
Coast, places enormous faith in democracy. It can, he says, spur
economic growth, calm ethnic strife, reduce corruption and even
slow the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite all that, Ouattara is glad that a coup in December
forced his country's president out of office. Why? Because he
thinks the coup will help, rather than hinder, democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the wrong act for the right reason,'' Ouattara said.
With the ouster of President Henri Konan Bedie, whose government
Ouattara called corrupt and repressive, an obstacle to democracy
has been removed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bedie, who assumed office in 1993 upon the death of 33-year
President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, was re-elected in 1995 with a
startling 96 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara plans to run for president in elections the new
government has promised to hold this year. The ousted president had
declared Ouattara ineligible to run because his father was born
outside Ivory Coast, but Ouattara said he and both of his parents
were born in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara said he had no involvement in the coup, and no advance
notice that it was afoot.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the United States last week to tell U.S. officials
and representatives of nongovernmental organizations that aid to
Ivory Coast needs to continue to ensure that the country's
transition to democracy is successful and quick.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup, which took place on Christmas Eve, the U.S.
government automatically cut off all aid to Ivory Coast. Ouattara
said that is understandable, but he hopes the United States will
use its influence with international lenders to allow Ivory Coast
to suspend payments on its debts for six months or so, until a new
government _ and a new economic plan _ can be put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara, a former deputy managing director of the International
Monetary Fund, came to Atlanta to make his case on CNN and to ask
the Carter Center to monitor the elections, which are scheduled to
be held no later than October.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Carter Center promised to make a favorable
recommendation to former President Jimmy Carter, Ouattara said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the coup, Ivory Coast _ a West African country a little
more than twice the size of Georgia, with a population of 16
million people _ had been seen as an island of stability in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara said it can be that again. The divisions promoted by
the Bedie regime can be healed, he said, adding that the economy
can be revitalized and the per capita income, about $800, can be
doubled in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   If democracy takes hold.
</P>
<P>
   But judging from his visit to Atlanta, Ouattara's self-appointed
primary task of unifying the country may prove difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Divisions among his supporters emerged as different factions
here struggled for control of his agenda. At least one Atlanta
reporter was called repeatedly by different people claiming to
represent Ouattara, each of whom advised the reporter to pay no
attention to the others.
</P>
<P>
   The competition continued even as Ouattara arrived at Hartsfield
International Airport, where, said one person involved in
coordinating the visit, the former prime minister was met by
several limousines.
</P>
<P>
   On other matters, Ouattara said:
</P>
<P>
   _ AIDS poses a major threat to economic development in Ivory
Coast. One of every 10 Ivorians tests positive for HIV, he said.
But he said democracy would lead to reduced corruption _ and
international donations for health care would not be diverted, as
they have been in the past.
</P>
<P>
   _ The war in Congo poses a very serious threat to stability and
economic development of Africa. ``The country is important; it is
at the heart of Africa; it has, what, eight or nine bordering
countries,'' he said. ``It's a very rich country. It has 50 million
people _ 20 percent of the population of sub-Saharan Africa. So
it's very important for us to have a stable Congo leading to a
democratic and developed Congo.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The ethnic conflicts that have bedeviled many countries in
Africa can be overcome through ``participative democracy,'' he
said. ``If you look at how these ethnic conflicts erupted, in each
country it's been because there was an attempt by a group to
exclude the other. So it has to be an inclusive democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Despite the wars that seem to stymie economic development in
many parts of Africa, the continent has seen progress in the last
10 years, both politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have more countries where elections are considered fairer
and more transparent than five or 10 years ago,'' he said. ``You
have multiparty systems in nearly all countries in Africa. Ten
years ago, you did not have that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And on the economic front, you had fairly good developments,
both in terms of growth (and) in terms of inflation reduction. ...
Privatization is no longer a dirty word in any country in Africa.
Ten years ago, when I was prime minister ... my gosh, in 1990, when
we were trying to privatize the electricity company, they would cut
electricity from my home for two days, the trade unions, so it was
terrible.''

DALLAS COMES TOGETHER TO HONOR LANDRY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When he was fired in 1989 after 29 years as coach of
the Dallas cowboys, Tom Landry anticipated that once the spotlight
was turned off, he would recede into the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will forget me quick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not very quick, it turned out. This week Dallas has been
preparing an elaborate eulogy for the man many considered
responsible for bringing more to the city than football
championships.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Landry died last Saturday without realizing
the unique place he occupied in the psyche of Dallas, which spent
decades trying to live down the assassination of President Kennedy
and the image of J.R. Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Since his death, former Cowboys, pundits and old friends have
credited Landry with doing more than any other person to give
Dallas back its self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Being a winning coach was only a part of that process.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a recognized class about him, a style,'' said Tex
Schramm, the team's general manger who hired Landry in 1960. ``He
had character and was honest to the extreme. He was a great man you
would want to look up to. It's like they used to say during the
war: If you're going to charge up the mountain, this is the guy you
want leading you.''
</P>
<P>
   He not only took a rag-tag expansion franchise and turned it
into ``America's Team,'' one of the most recognizable and
marketable organizations in professional sports, he did it without
allowing the job to dominate his life.
</P>
<P>
   Before he accepted the job he warned Schramm that he might not
be suited to the task because football was not his highest
priority. Faith and family ranked higher.
</P>
<P>
   To the crowds and television cameras on game day, he presented a
stern persona, as humorless as artificial turf and as stoic as a
goal post.
</P>
<P>
   Someone once asked fullback Walt Garrison if Landry ever smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Garrison said. ``But, I've only been here nine
years.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind the frozen expression, those who worked with him and
played for him saw another Landry. Carlton Stowers, who covered the
Cowboys for the Dallas Morning News for many years, recalled an
occasion when, to celebrate Landry's birthday, the players hired a
dancer to surprise him at his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was singing and tap dancing,'' Stowers said, ``and he got
up and sang and tap danced along with her.''
</P>
<P>
   When a group of sportswriters covering training camp grew
beards, Landry watched grimly, arms folded, as they approached him
after practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everytime I see you guys, I feel like I should call
security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was one of the most public figures in Dallas, he
guarded his privacy and practiced his faith without fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those closest to him did not know that for more than 20
years he had participated in a prison ministry run by former
Cleveland Brown Pro Bowler Bill Glass. Landry frequently visited
prisons with Glass and other sports figures to minister to inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Glass said he was not surprised this week to see the outpouring
of emotion that followed Landry's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way you could have overvalued him as a human
being,'' he said. ``He was the greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   There were immediate calls from sports columnists and
politicians to rename Texas Stadium for him. The Dallas Stars and
Mavericks began their games with a moment of silence in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   He will be buried Thursday morning in a private ceremony, which
will be followed by a memorial service for family and close friends
at Highland Park United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 p.m. CST, a public memorial will be held in the Morton
Meyerson Symphony Center and, while television cables were being
installed Wednesday for a live telecast, police were grappling with
concerns over security, traffic and crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame members such as Bob Lilly, Roger Staubach, Sam Huff
and Schramm will speak, as will NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Children's Chorus and the Dallas Baptist University
Chorale will perform, and Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene will
provide a color guard. Tommy Loy, whose trumpet solo of the
national anthem opened many Cowboy games, also will play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to keep this a memorial service rather than an
event,'' said David Fisher, interim director of administration for
the symphony center. ``It's a somber event.''

MEETING OF ULSTER LEADERS POINTS UP DIFFERENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British and Irish prime ministers brought the main
parties in Northern Ireland together Tuesday in an exercise that
served mainly to show how far apart they remain on the vexing
questions of disarming the Irish Republican Army and restoring
Belfast's power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, emerged from several hours of meetings at 10 Downing
St., their glum faces offering clear evidence that no progress had
been made on the stalemate that led Blair's administration to
suspend the power-sharing government last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came less than 24 hours after the IRA responded to
the suspension by breaking off contact with an international
commission overseeing the disarming of Northern Ireland's
paramilitary groups. The IRA also withdrew its offer to eventually
put its weapons ``beyond use.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Ahern faced reporters after the talks, and Blair
sought to lower expectations for a quick solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today wasn't the day we were going to do anything other than
discuss what the parameters of the problem were and how to resolve
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern said he wanted to reestablish as soon as possible the
power-sharing government and the cross-border authorities that give
his government a direct role in the affairs of Northern Ireland.
But he offered no solution on how to accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
   Establishment of the short-lived government that includes
Catholic and Protestant parties was a key element of the 1998 Good
Friday Agreement that sought to end decades of sectarian strife in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   There was little evidence to suggest that the British and Irish
governments had repaired the rift between them over the
circumstances that led London to suspend the two-month old Belfast
regime. Dublin believed a last-minute offer by the IRA to discuss
when it would put its weapons ``beyond use'' was enough to avert
suspension, but London pulled the plug anyway, saying the IRA
pledge was too vague to prevent the Ulster Unionist Party from
walking out of the Northern Ireland assembly.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of any substantive progress, recrimination was
the order of the day. Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble blamed
Irish republicans for the impasse, saying they had refused to come
through with a gesture on weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The onus rests on them. They had an obligation and they failed
to deliver,'' said Trimble, who had vowed to resign as leader of
the power-sharing government if the British government did not
suspend it. The British suspended the Northern Ireland assembly and
cabinet rather than see it collapse, hoping it would be easier that
way to resume if the stalemate is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator, who lost his
post as education minister when the government was suspended, said
the power to revive the peace process lay mostly with the British
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Good Friday Agreement is lying in a waste paper bin. The
British government needs to get it out, put it back together again
and be serious about the process of conflict resolution in
Ireland,'' McGuinness said.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said his party, which has close
links to the IRA, could do no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any notion that cajoling, coaxing, pressuring people like us
to get the IRA to do something, when the IRA moved so far only to
have it rejected, is just nonsense,'' said Adams. ``It wasn't us
that pulled down these institutions and it wasn't us that walked
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gloom, there was no suggestion the IRA, or their
loyalist enemies, were about to end the cease-fires that have
underpinned the peace process. But neither was there any indication
that either government had devised a route out of the impasse.

 &HT;    Ramsey confronts Donnan in office
 &HT;    By Chip Towers

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ Any chance of Kevin Ramsey remaining at Georgia as an
assistant football coach probably ended after a heated
confrontation with coach Jim Donnan on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey, demoted as defensive coordinator early Monday morning,
returned to Butts-Mehre Heritage Hall around noon that day and
argued with Donnan in the head coach's office.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey would not confirm what happened in the meeting. Donnan
would say only, ``We've got a legal situation and I'm told I can't
comment on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Claude Felton, associate athletics director for external
affairs, confirmed that a second meeting took place and that it was
``heated.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletics department officials were extremely guarded Wednesday
in their comments on the situation. ``Anything that took place in
that meeting or any other meetings are personnel matters, and we
can't comment on them,'' Felton said.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement negotiations are under way between Ramsey and the
Georgia Athletic Association. Ramsey, who initially was offered the
opportunity to remain as secondary coach, has 4 1/2 months
remaining on a one-year contract at $130,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking to Coach Ramsey, trying to figure out what's
going to happen in terms of his career,'' said Athens attorney Ed
Tolley, who represents the athletic association. ``We hope to have
this resolved, really, in the next 48 hours. That's what we're
really working on, trying to keep everybody happy.''

PRESIDENT RELEASES $125M IN FUNDS TO HELP FUEL POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Tuesday ordered the release of
$125 million in emergency funds to help low- and middle-income
families pay for home heating oil, which has been exhorbitantly
expensive for New Englanders this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``These families have been especially hard hit,'' Clinton said
at a White House news conference. ``That is a serious concern,
because the winter months have been colder this year than in the
past few years.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of the funds depletes for the year the $300 million
allotted to provide not just heating aid, but also money to help
residents in warm-weather states deal with unusually hot summers.
The president said he would ask Congress to set aside another $600
million in supplemental assistance to deal with temperature-related
crises later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the new release of funds, Massachusetts will get
another $13.1 million for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance
Program, on top of the $13.6 million the state has already received
this winter. Maine is set to get another $6.3 million; New
Hampshire, $3 million; Rhode Island, $2.8 million; Vermont, $1.4
million; and Connecticut, $5.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic,'' said Robert Coard, president of Action for
Boston Community Development, a non-profit organization that
funnels the LIHEAP money to qualifying families in the metro area.
``A lot of folks have already exhausted their benefit levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization has been able to provide an average of $660 in
heating assistance to Boston area families this winter and now can
add another $300 to $400 to defray average heating bills of $1,400
to $1,500 for the season, Coard said.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging news conference, Clinton's first of the year,
the president handled questions from the death penalty to the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he does not support a federal moratorium on the
death penalty, although he lauded as ``courageous'' Illinois
Governor George Ryan's decision to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan suspended executions in Illinois until authorities
determine if capital punishment there is administered fairly.
Thirteen death-row inmates in Illinois have been exonerated in
Illinois since 1987 as a result of further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Governor Ryan did the right thing, and it was probably
a courageous thing to do because a majority of American people
support capital punishment, as do I,'' Clinton said. But he said
there are not grounds for a federal moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton drew ire from death penalty opponents in 1992, when he
was governor of Arkansas and in a competitive presidential primary
race in New Hampshire. Clinton interrupted his campaign to fly back
to Arkansas to sign a death warrant for Ricky Ray Rector, a
mentally retarded man.
</P>
<P>
   On questions about the presidential campaign, Clinton brushed
off the sniping among the candidates in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton chuckled when asked how he felt when Texas Governor
George W. Bush told Senator John McCain of Arizona that having his
honesty and integrity compared to Clinton's was ``about as low as
you can get'' in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, they're playing to an electorate most of whom did
not vote for me,'' Clinton said, smiling. ``And secondly, I have a
lot of sympathy with Governor Bush and Senator McCain. I mean, it's
hard for them to figure out what to run on. They can't run against
the longest economic expansion in history, or the lowest crime rate
in 30 years, or the progress America has made in promoting peace
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a tough job and I have a lot of sympathy with them
and I don't want to complicate their problems by saying anything
more about it,'' the president quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended his vice president, Al Gore, whose honesty has
been agreessively questioned by his Democratic opponent, former
Senator Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great strengths he has had as a vice president is
that he was always brutally honest with me,'' Clinton said. ``And I
think the country is better for it.''

RECENTLY-MERGED GLAXO WELLCOME AND SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CITE '99
EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The two British drug makers that merged in January to
create Glaxo SmithKline PLC, the world's largest pharmaceutical
company, posted their 1999 earnings Wednesday and demonstrated what
analysts called the necessity for the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo Wellcome PLC, which acquired SmithKline Beecham PLC for
$76 billion in January, said earnings rose just 3.8 percent on a 6
percent increase in sales.
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline, by contrast, reported a 13 percent rise in earnings
on a 10 percent increase in sales.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons that Glaxo bought SmithKline was that it
hoped a link with the rival would help increase growth and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo's chairman, Richard Sykes, tried to offer assurances that
his company's relatively weak results were simply a blip. ``Our
message for shareholders is hold your nerve,'' he said. ``This is
potentially a very strong company.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the companies announced their merger, shares of both drug
makers have fallen. Shares of SmithKline shares dropped 3 percent
Wednesday, to 674 pence, or $10.84. Shares of Glaxo fell 3.3
percent, to 1,459 pence, or $23.47.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have suggested that the merger was necessary to keep
growth rates competitive with rival drug makers, though they said
they did not expect a significant jump in their combined growth
rate as a result of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Leschly, chief executive of SmithKline, showed off his
company's results Wednesday, saying, ``We're very excited about the
way we are now entering into the proposed merger with Glaxo
Wellcome as a very strong company.''
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline's profits for the year were 1.94 billion pounds, or
$3.10 billion, on sales of 7.75 billion pounds, or $12.4 billion.
Glaxo's profits were 2.772 billion pounds, or $4.44 billion, on
sales of 8.5 billion pounds, or $13.6 billion.

 &HT;    Korean residents rally to fight man's deportation
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Members of the Korean Community Presbyterian Church
were surprised a few years ago when one of their deacons got into a
drunken scuffle and went to prison. The truly shocking news,
however, came when the church learned a few months ago that the
federal government plans to deport Dong Jin Park because of a 1996
immigration law roundly criticized as unduly harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Worry about the deacon's predicament became the flash point for
the first well-organized political effort among the roughly 50,000
Korean immigrants in Georgia. Groups as diverse as the Korean
Literary Club and the Korean Chamber of Commerce of Georgia rallied
to help the deacon. Pastors of about 100 Korean churches in metro
Atlanta told his story as a cautionary tale. Shoppers in Korean
supermarkets signed petitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had this kind of unified voice,'' said the Rev. In
Soo Jung of the Korean Community Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 2, after months of meetings, advocates for the deacon
mailed a petition with 2,709 signatures to Gov. Roy Barnes and the
Georgia Board of Pardons and Parole. They want the board to pardon
Park, an action that would prevent his deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers also mailed the petition to members of Congress. They
want Congress to revise the 1996 law that lowered from five years
to one the minimum prison sentence that triggers deportation
proceedings against someone convicted of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Other incidents in the last 10 years generated attention in the
Korean community, but the legal trouble facing Park has unified
Korean immigrants here as has no cause in recent memory. A few
years ago, for example, Koreans closely followed the story of a
Korean woman who was shot and killed at a beauty shop. They also
paid attention when a Korean grocer sued the city of Atlanta on the
grounds that the city failed to protect his store from looters in
the aftermath of the verdict in California in the Rodney King
police-beating case.
</P>
<P>
   But Korean activists said the possibility that the government
will deport Park has brought together a once-fractured community.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that 70 percent to 80 percent of Korean immigrants
in metro Atlanta are, like Park, legal residents and not U.S.
citizens. Many fear that they, too, could be deported if they get
into trouble with the law, said Eugene Kim, Korean Literary Club
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   After Kim learned more about the 1996 immigration law, he wrote
a column about it for a Korean newspaper in metro Atlanta. Before
long, he was talking about the law during meetings of the literary
club. Other club members began writing columns, too.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Choi, a Korean who heads metro Atlanta's Asian American
Coalition, said the law that led to deportation proceedings against
Park has broken up families through deportations, just as the
Korean War separated families in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are experiencing the same situation in peacetime in
America,'' he said. ``The community feels like it's harsh, it's not
just.''
</P>
<P>
   Other immigrant groups, as well as organizations such as the
American Bar Association, have vigorously opposed the 1996 law.
Hundreds of immigrants across the country have been deported for
relatively minor crimes, and even the Immigration and
Naturalization Service says the law should be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of immigrants from metro Atlanta have been deported for
crimes such as shoplifting a sandwich, a box of doughnuts and a $15
baby outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie McConnell, a spokeswoman for the board of pardons and
paroles, said the state has pardoned a handful of immigrants
convicted of relatively minor crimes so that they would not be
deported. In the case of someone like Park convicted of a serious
violent felony, she said, a pardon would be very rare.
</P>
<P>
   Park, 46, came to the United States in 1979 and lived in Cobb
County with his wife, Han. He owned a camera repair business in
Smyrna. He and his wife have three teen-age daughters _ all U.S.
citizens _ who have played cello, violin and viola in the Atlanta
Symphony Youth Orchestra. Two girls played in the closing
ceremonies of the 1996 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Park ``is pretty much an exemplary churchgoer _ just one
mistake,'' the Rev. Jung said.
</P>
<P>
   About 3:30 a.m. on Jan. 17, 1996, police arrested Park after a
fight in the parking lot of a DeKalb County tavern. They charged
him with public drunkenness at first but upgraded the charges days
later to a felony, aggravated assault, after the victim complained
that the fight left him with a permanent eye injury.
</P>
<P>
   A jury convicted Park of aggravated assault, and a judge ordered
him to serve three years in prison and another four on probation.
That would not have been enough to trigger deportation before
Congress changed the law in 1996, said Bonnie Youn, former
president of the Georgia Asian Pacific American Bar Association.
She said Park started a Bible study group in prison and poses no
danger to society. His prison term expired last month, but he
remains behind bars. He's in INS custody awaiting a deportation
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Park's wife took over her husband's camera-repair business after
his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really unfair. Our children were born in the United
States. We lived here 20 years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Youn said many Korean immigrants were shocked to find a
well-respected businessman and church deacon in such a legal jam.
``When people realized he was facing permanent deportation, they
realized, `Look. We've got to do something,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Church members pray for Park on Wednesday and Friday evenings at
their church building. The church is the largest Korean
congregation in metro Atlanta, and its decision to throw its weight
behind Park also galvanized leaders in the wider Korean community.
</P>
<P>
   Last Oct. 27, Choi went to Washington, D.C., to deliver letters
about Park to members of Georgia's congressional delegation as well
as House and Senate leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The main goal of the petition drive is to persuade Congress to
reconsider changes made by the 1996 law. Another goal is to
persuade Georgia officials to pardon Park. Regardless of the
outcome in Park's case, Korean leaders said, the effort on his
behalf has made the state's Korean community more cohesive and has
given them a taste of political activism that could come in handy
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Alerted to Park's plight by Korean immigrants in metro Atlanta,
Korean groups in Albany, Augusta, Columbus, Hinesville, Macon and
Savannah supported the effort. And leaders in metro Atlanta already
have begun to channel the new activism in the direction of another
Korean immigrant facing deportation _ 23-year-old Un Ho Kim of
Gwinnett County.
</P>
<P>
   His trouble began Oct. 7, 1995, when he and a group of buddies
hatched a plan while eating burgers at 3 a.m. in a Denny's
restaurant. They were talking about a movie in which one of the
characters robs a store. They decided it would be fun to imitate
that character.
</P>
<P>
   They went to a convenience store. One of them pulled out a BB
gun while others stole candy. They drove off and were promptly
pulled over and arrested by Gwinnett County police.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said `You're going to do 10 years in prison.' I thought
they were just playing around,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>

GERMAN FIRM RAISES STAKE IN JAPANESE DRUG MAKER VIA HOSTILE BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A large German pharmaceutical company secured a foothold
in the Japanese drug industry Wednesday through a successful and
unsolicited takeover effort _ something still highly unusual in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase by Boehringer Ingelheim, made through a tender
offer to shareholders, raised its stake in SS Pharmaceutical to
35.86 percent. The move reflected the deregulation that is
reshaping Japan's drug industry, which has increased the ability of
foreign drugmakers to set up shop here and made domestic companies
vulnerable to outside competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of other Japanese drug producers have risen recently on
speculation that they, too, may become part of the industry's
global consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   SS Pharmaceutical had little advance notice. The two companies
have had a long relationship. Boehringer had a seat on SS
Pharmaceutical's 16-member board and already owned 19.61 percent of
its shares, but the bigger stake now will give it greater influence
over decision-making and the ability to veto any major initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having gained a holding of more than 33.4 percent'' _ the
level at which a shareholder gains a limited veto in Japan _ ``the
long-term security of our investment is therefore assured,'' said
Christoph Hohbach, chairman of Boehringer's Japanese subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Boehringer's success was extraordinary partly because of its
novelty in a country where hostile takeovers are rare. It stands in
marked contrast to the failure earlier this week of a widely
watched hostile attempt to acquire Shoei, a real estate holding
company and electronics parts manufacturer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yoshiaki Murakami, a former civil servant who started his own
takeover investment fund, had sought to gain control of Shoei but
fell far short of his goal, collecting only a 6.52 percent stake in
a tender offer.
</P>
<P>
   But there were differences between the two bids, the most
significant being the mix of shareholders. Shoei is a member of the
Fuyo group, or keiretsu, an agglomeration of companies clustered
around Fuji Bank and its sister financial companies and bound by
cross-shareholding. The group, which owned a collective 60 percent
of Shoei, refused to sell its shares, despite a 14 percent premium
Murakami offered.
</P>
<P>
   SS Pharmaceutical, by contrast, is not formally part of a
keiretsu, and so economic considerations prevailed among its
shareholders. In this case, ``this was a matter of going to a broad
spectrum of shareholders and soliciting support,'' said Dean A.
Yoost, head of the financial services advisory practice at
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals accounted for 37 percent of SS Pharmaceutical
ownership before the tender offer, and a spokeswoman said the vast
majority of shares bought by Boehringer had been sold by
individuals. Corporate shareholders accounted for 29 percent, and
institutional shareholders like pension fund managers and banks,
for 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Boehringer also offered a much heftier premium, 42 percent over
the closing price the day before it made its offer. It sent
shareholders letters explaining its offer and urged them to call a
toll-free number for more information. Boehringer said its adviser,
Jardine Fleming, received thousands of calls, particularly after it
ran ads in local papers appealing to SS Pharmaceutical
shareholders.

DALLAS COMES TOGETHER TO HONOR LANDRY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub for minor editing) 
 
By JIM HENDERSON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When he was fired in 1989 after 29 years as coach of
the Dallas Cowboys, Tom Landry anticipated that once the spotlight
was turned off, he would recede into the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will forget me quick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not very quick, it turned out. This week Dallas has been
preparing an elaborate eulogy for the man many considered
responsible for bringing more to the city than football
championships.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Landry died last Saturday without realizing
the unique place he occupied in the psyche of Dallas, which spent
decades trying to live down the assassination of President Kennedy
and the image of J.R. Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Since his death, former Cowboys, pundits and old friends have
credited Landry with doing more than any other person to give
Dallas back its self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Being a winning coach was only a part of that process.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a recognized class about him, a style,'' said Tex
Schramm, the team's general manger who hired Landry in 1960. ``He
had character and was honest to the extreme. He was a great man you
would want to look up to. It's like they used to say during the
war: If you're going to charge up the mountain, this is the guy you
want leading you.''
</P>
<P>
   He not only took a rag-tag expansion franchise and turned it
into ``America's Team,'' one of the most recognizable and
marketable organizations in professional sports, he did it without
allowing the job to dominate his life.
</P>
<P>
   Before he accepted the job he warned Schramm that he might not
be suited to the task because football was not his highest
priority. Faith and family ranked higher.
</P>
<P>
   To the crowds and television cameras on game day, he presented a
stern persona, as humorless as artificial turf and as stoic as a
goal post.
</P>
<P>
   Someone once asked fullback Walt Garrison if Landry ever smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Garrison said. ``But, I've only been here nine
years.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind the frozen expression, those who worked with him and
played for him saw another Landry. Carlton Stowers, who covered the
Cowboys for the Dallas Morning News for many years, recalled an
occasion when, to celebrate Landry's birthday, the players hired a
dancer to surprise him at his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was singing and tap dancing,'' Stowers said, ``and he got
up and sang and tap danced along with her.''
</P>
<P>
   When a group of sportswriters covering training camp grew
beards, Landry watched grimly, arms folded, as they approached him
after practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everytime I see you guys, I feel like I should call
security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was one of the most public figures in Dallas, he
guarded his privacy and practiced his faith without fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those closest to him did not know that for more than 20
years he had participated in a prison ministry run by former
Cleveland Brown Pro Bowler Bill Glass. Landry frequently visited
prisons with Glass and other sports figures to minister to inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Glass said he was not surprised this week to see the outpouring
of emotion that followed Landry's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way you could have overvalued him as a human
being,'' he said. ``He was the greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   There were immediate calls from sports columnists and
politicians to rename Texas Stadium for him. The Dallas Stars and
Mavericks began their games with a moment of silence in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   He will be buried Thursday morning in a private ceremony, which
will be followed by a memorial service for family and close friends
at Highland Park United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 p.m. CST, a public memorial will be held in the Morton
Meyerson Symphony Center and, while television cables were being
installed Wednesday for a live telecast, police were grappling with
concerns over security, traffic and crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame members such as Bob Lilly, Roger Staubach, Sam Huff
and Schramm will speak, as will NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Children's Chorus and the Dallas Baptist University
Chorale will perform, and Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene will
provide a color guard. Tommy Loy, whose trumpet solo of the
national anthem opened many Cowboy games, also will play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to keep this a memorial service rather than an
event,'' said David Fisher, interim director of administration for
the symphony center. ``It's a somber event.''

MARKET PLACE: THE DOWNSIDE OF PAYING DOWN NATIONAL DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawrence Summers, secretary of the U.S. Treasury, is
clearly relishing his role as the man who put the nation on a
no-debt diet. In congressional testimony last week, Summers
predicted that by 2013, the $3.6 trillion in U.S. Treasury debt
held by the public would be eliminated, repurchased by funds from
budget surpluses that the roaring U.S. economy has wrought. The
result, he said, would be an even stronger economy and lower
interest rates for all.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But in the meantime, the Treasury's plan to reduce its
debt is roiling the financial markets and raising the prospect of
far-reaching, unintended effects on the economy and investors.
</P>
<P>
   One immediate effect of the shrinking Treasury debt market,
economists say, is to make it tougher for the Federal Reserve Board
to cool the economy because as it raises short-term interest rates,
long-term rates are not rising in tandem. In addition, the debt
securities that remain in the shrinking market are expected to be
much more prone to wild swings in price and thereby riskier for
investors. Finally, corporations will probably issue more debt to
fill the public demand for bonds, creating a debt burden that could
make it much more difficult for the nation to shake off a downturn
in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surplus has forced the Treasury to change the way they do
business, and we are looking at the consequences,'' said Ward
McCarthy, principal at Stone &AMP; McCarthy Research Associates in
Princeton, N.J. ``It affects everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the market for U.S. Treasury debt is the largest and
most heavily traded in the world, and because investors evaluate
almost every other type of bond using a Treasury security as a
benchmark, even the smallest change in the government's financing
has broad effects at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons the U.S. has been the dominant factor in
the world is we were the only place with a deep, liquid debt
market,'' said Stan Jonas, managing director at FIMAT U.S.A., a
brokerage firm in New York. ``We would not be the leader in the
financial marketplace if we hadn't had the advantage of a huge,
rich Treasury market. Now that market is disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The ripples from a vanishing public market for Treasury debt
have begun to hit investors who buy bonds and the companies that
issue them. Last month, when the Treasury outlined its aggressive
plan to reduce the debt it issues and to buy back debt already in
investors' hands, the market went haywire. There was a mad rush for
long-term government bonds, driving down interest rates on
long-term government debt even as the Federal Reserve Board was
raising short-term rates to try to cool down an overheated economy.
</P>
<P>
   This created significant losses for investors, who had bet that
the Fed's increases in short-term rates would cause rates at the
long end of the market to rise as well. Instead, the effective rate
on 30-year bonds fell well below that of two-year notes. Normally,
investors are given extra incentive in the form of higher rates to
lock up their money for a longer period.
</P>
<P>
   More important, economists and market strategists say, the
Treasury's plan and the ensuing rush to long-term bonds is throwing
sand into the gears that the Fed uses to keep the economy perking
while protecting against inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, who is scheduled to testify
Thursday as part of his twice annual report to Congress, has raised
short-term rates three times since last June in an effort to slow
the economy. But rates on long-term Treasury securities have
fallen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It poses a little bit of a challenge for monetary policy,''
said Henry Kaufman, the noted Wall Street economist.
</P>
<P>
   Few economists say the Treasury's overall plan to reduce the
nation's debt is wrongheaded. Last year's budget surplus of $124
billion, the largest ever, was the direct result of a supercharged
economy and a roaring stock market, which generated huge tax
receipts. As long as the economy and stock markets remain hot and
Congress keeps a lid on spending, budget surpluses will continue.
Reducing debt, the government argues, is a natural use for these
funds.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the government will still issue debt to be held by
the Federal Reserve and the Social Security trust. It is the
publicly held debt that is targeted for extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Treasury securities market is the world's largest
and most influential today, it wasn't always thus. In the 1960s,
for example, when an investor asked what the bond market was doing,
the answer usually involved the price action in an AT&AMP;T bond or an
obligation of a highly rated electric utility.
</P>
<P>
   But as the U.S. government grew and the Treasury began to borrow
more to fund its growth, the significance of the Treasury
securities market rose as well. In the 1980s and 1990s, the
Treasury raised trillions of dollars each year from investors
issuing bonds, notes and bills; the peak was 1996 when the Treasury
auctioned $2.5 trillion in securities. By fiscal 1998, according to
the Treasury, federal debt held by the public had risen to $3.7
trillion, up from $2.1 trillion just 10 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But the days of ballooning Treasury debt are over. Eliminating
the publicly held Treasury debt by 2013, Summers said, will put
downward pressure on all interest rates, helping to reduce consumer
payments on home mortgages, car loans and other forms of credit.
This has not happened yet. Most consumer borrowings are based upon
shorter-term interest rates _ even 30-year mortgage rates are based
on shorter-term rates because homeowners typically pay off their
loans well before their term is up _ and these are rising because
of the Fed's recent actions.
</P>
<P>
   Where the effects have been felt sharply are in the corporate
bond and mortgage markets. A 30-year corporate bond is usually
judged against a 30-year Treasury. But with Treasuries being
hoarded ahead of a possible shortage, the rates on the bonds no
longer represent a good comparison. As a result, the private debt
market has lost its anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street will undoubtedly create a new security to use as a
benchmark for bond issues soon. But until then, uncertainty will
rule the market.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, investors are having trouble assessing new bond
issues and are acting with caution. ``I think everybody has thrown
up their hands at the moment,'' said Carol Levenson, editor of
Gimme Credit, a research service that analyzes high-grade corporate
bonds. ``The market is waiting to see if things are going to return
to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Trading has also dropped off recently in the vast market for
mortgage obligations, which are backed by consumer loans, according
to Mickey Levy, chief economist at BankAmerica. ``With higher risk
in this market, it could make rates higher on the margin'' for the
moment, he said, just the opposite of what Summers has predicted.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some strategists suspect that the bond market may never return
to normal. ``One byproduct of a consequential shrinkage of the
Treasury market is that the U.S. debt markets will be increasingly
comprised of a variety of securities that are riskier than Treasury
debt,'' said McCarthy. ``So in addition to increased volatility, we
are dealing with almost by definition a riskier bond market as
well.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This is quite a change, given that much of the bond market has
been a refuge for investors seeking safety and security in their
holdings. Few observers believe that investors have recognized the
increased risks they will need to take when they invest in bonds as
the Treasury bows out of the market and corporate issuers take its
place.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, investors may not recognize the implications of a big
increase in corporate debt when the nation experiences a recession.
``When you go into an economic slowdown and there is a large amount
of government debt outstanding and a small amount of corporate debt
outstanding, that's not a problem,'' Kaufman explained. ``All you
need is an easing in monetary policy, and off we go again. But when
the private sector is heavily burdened when we slow down, that will
require more stimulation. This is a concern.''
</P>
<P>
   One economist worried that using the budget surplus to fund a
buyback of existing Treasury debt could cause inflation. Robert H.
Parks, a professor of finance at the Lubin Graduate School of
Business at Pace University said: ``This increases the money
supply, and it also increases the reserves of private financial
institutions. It is highly expansionary and potentially
inflationary in an economy that is roaring ahead.''

NATO AND RUSSIA TO RESUME RELATIONS AFTER BREAK OVER KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a sign of his desire to cultivate closer ties with
the West, Acting President Vladimir Putin agreed Wednesday to end
an 11-month estrangement between Russia and NATO and rebuild what
the Kremlin called an alliance aimed at ``a stable and indivisible
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The thaw was announced after a meeting between Putin and NATO's
secretary-general, George Robertson. Formally, at least, it closes
a cavernous divide that opened last March after NATO launched its
air war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But there were few illusions that the resumed partnership
signals any genuine meeting of minds, given the depth of Russian
bitterness over NATO's conduct of the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Wednesday's agreement was seen as one more strategic
move by Putin to shore up relations with the West, the one place
where he can find the money, technology and expertise for
rebuilding Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Putin sent the chairman of the Russian Security Council, Sergei
Ivanov, to Washington Wednesday to discuss arms proliferation and a
potential summit meeting with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Russia struck a deal after almost 18 months of talks
with private Western lenders to reschedule $31.8 billion in bad
debt.
</P>
<P>
   The deal instantly lifted Russia's credit rating and improved
the climate for foreign investment, one of Putin's stated goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to create, let's say, a favorable environment for his
`Russia project,' if you like,'' said Dmitry Trenin, an expert at
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Moscow. Trenin
suggested that Wednesday's agreement was in part a response to
unusually warm comments on Tuesday by Clinton, who praised Putin as
a leader he could work with and offered only muted criticism of
Russia's conduct of the Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's spokesman, James P. Rubin, said the
United States welcomes the accord and that Putin has indicated that
``he regards the centrality of U.S.-Russian relations as larger
than differences on key issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Russia and NATO have never been especially
cordial. The western alliance has continued to expand toward the
Russian border, effectively ignoring Moscow's objections, and
Russia has complained that it has never gotten the consultative
role in NATO affairs that the alliance had seemed to promise.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship fell apart completely last March when the NATO
attack on Yugoslavia led Russia to expel alliance representatives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Kosovo war was a watershed that made it acceptable for
Russian politicians and citizens alike to express long-concealed
suspicions of the West. The estrangement has only deepened as NATO
has criticized Russia's conduct in Chechnya. Both sides agreed to
abide by a 1997 agreement governing relations between NATO and
Russia, and to hew to the U.N. charter _ an apparent sop to Moscow,
which has complained vociferously that NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia
violated U.N. principles.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials stressed that the accord did not signal any
change in military policy in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has courted support from the military.But Robertson said
Wednesday that the decision to resume relations with NATO was
clearly Putin's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he shared my view that the chilly period should come
to an end,'' he said on the Russian television network NTV. ``I
think we've moved from the permafrost onto slightly softer
ground.''

BELL FACES FINES OVER DELAYED CALLING-SERVICE CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp. is facing $100,000-a-day fines from New York
state regulators unless it moves by Friday to clear up widespread
computer problems that have delayed thousands of people trying to
switch their local calling service to rivals such as AT&AMP;T Corp. and
MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of an AT&AMP;T-supported group, the Massachusetts Coalition
for Competitive Phone Service, pounced Tuesday on the k
problems, saying they give further proof Bay State regulators
should move slowly if at all in allowing Bell Atlantic into the $2
billion long-distance calling market here.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, which has already acquired nearly 1 million New
York long-distance customers, hopes to get into the Massachusetts
market by this fall by persuading state regulators it has promoted
strong competition for local service.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the regional Bell
companies are required to show they have opened their local markets
to competition before they can enter the long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on New York's disastrous results, Massachusetts should
proceed cautiously when reviewing Bell Atlantic's claim that it has
opened the local calling market to true competition for
consumers,'' said Michelle Consalvo, executive director of the
Massachusetts coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of New Yorkers have reportedly faced delays in
getting their local service switched over to Bell rivals. MCI
WorldCom estimated that up to 70,000 orders to switch service from
Bell to MCI Local were lost or mishandled by Bell Atlantic, almost
1 in 3 orders for new service.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Public Service Commission late Friday ordered the
phone giant to clear up the problems or face $100,000-a-day fines,
saying Bell's ``performance problems, if unabated . . . could
undermine'' local competition.
</P>
<P>
   Bell spokesman Jack Hoey said ``we're taking this very
seriously. There has been a problem, and we fully expect to meet
the deadline of Friday to complete all the back orders.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Hoey stressed it was a ``start-up paperwork glitch''
that involves how promptly rival carriers get notification that
prospective customers have been switched over to them, not delays
in actually moving people to AT&AMP;T or MCI WorldCom. He also noted
that $100,000 fines are the normal threat for any utility failing
to comply with a PSC order.
</P>
<P>
   While stopping short of accusing AT&AMP;T of hypocrisy, Hoey noted
that AT&AMP;T has faced similarly severe problems in Texas that led it
to rebate long-distance bills for 100,000 customers in December and
delay signing up new customers for its phone-over-cable service
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a surprise or a shock if there weren't some
start-up problems,'' Hoey said. He added that Bell has successfully
moved 400,000 customers to other local carriers, and competitors
now have 1.5 million local lines in New York, compared to Bell's 12
million.
</P>
<P>
   But given that Bell uses many of the same order-processing
systems in Massachusetts and New York, Consalvo said, ``We can save
Massachusetts consumers lots of worry and millions of dollars in
service disruptions, lost dial tone and business costs if we learn
from New York's mistakes.'' He urged that regulators move slowly in
allowing Bell into the Bay State long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts regulators have had no comment on how soon they
will send a recommendation to the Federal Communications Commission
on whether Bell Atlantic should be allowed into the long-distance
market here.

HEZBOLLAH VOWS TO CONTINUE ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAELIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NABIH CHIT, Lebanon _ The leader of the Hezbollah guerrilla
movement said Wednesday that the organization's forces in southern
Lebanon would continue to kill Israeli soldiers despite a pledge by
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel to make an unconditional
withdrawal of Israel's forces from the area by July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the Shiite Muslim cleric who is
secretary-general of Hezbollah, the Party of God, told 3,000
supporters in this village 45 miles east of Beirut that Hezbollah
would press attacks that began in late January and have killed
seven Israeli soldiers and wounded many others in less than three
weeks. Israel responded last week by bombing three Lebanese power
plants, which cut electricity in this nation of 3.5 million by 50
percent and wounded 20 Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Islamic resistance is committed to killing more of the
enemy's soldiers and militiamen,'' Nasrallah said, referring to the
Israeli troops and their allies in the South Lebanon Army, a mainly
Christian militia force, who jointly control a nine-mile ``security
zone'' in southern Lebanon. ``Let them do whatever they want,
whatever the price is and the sacrifices are, we will do whatever
is necessary to liberate our land.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has warned of ``severe'' retaliation if attacks on Israeli
troops continue. But Nasrallah said Hezbollah wanted to be sure
that the Israeli withdrawal did not result in new conditions
restraining Hezbollah's military arm. ``If we stop, Israel will
impose new conditions on us, and we reject any kind of dictation
from them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reference to the possibility of ``new conditions'' for
Hezbollah appeared to involve the stalled Israeli-Syrian peace
talks, and the possibility that Israel, if the talks resume, could
exact conditions relating to Hezbollah's future role in southern
Lebanon from Syria, which effectively controls Lebanon through a
35,000-man military force deployed in Lebanon. Until now, Syria has
rejected diplomatic appeals to rein in Hezbollah, saying it does
not control the group.
</P>
<P>
   In a further taunt, Nasrallah refused to rule out the renewed
use of Russian-made Katyusha rockets, the powerful but notoriously
inaccurate weapon that has caused numerous casualties among
civilians in northern Israel during the 15-year occupation of the
security zone. In its recent offensive, Hezbollah has relied on the
more traditional tactics of guerrilla warfare, including infantry
attacks on Israeli fortifications with mortars and anti-tank
missiles, ambushes of Israeli patrols and roadside bombs. A U.N.
patrol in southern Lebanon last week discovered an arsenal of 48
Katyushas deployed in a gully, one of the largest concentrations of
the rockets the U.N. has seen.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Barak knows that the Katyushas are still in the equation,''
Nasrallah said. Referring to the large-scale evacuation of
settlements in northern Israel during the recent Hezbollah
offensive, and the retreat to underground shelters by many other
settlers, Nasrallah added: ``The Israeli settlers whom he ordered
into the shelters for three days rotted because they knew there was
a possibility the Katyushas could fall at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Katyushas become predictable, they lose their
importance as a weapon. It would be a mistake if our enemy finds
out when we are going to use the Katyushas and when we are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasrallah's appearance Wednesday was considered a surprise,
because he has long been considered Israel's number one target in
Lebanon and had been thought unlikely to risk an Israeli attack. By
showing up and making a fiery speech, he appeared intent on
pressing home the triumphant message that Hezbollah has been
putting out in recent weeks.

AGENCY'S ANTI-SMOKING ADS STIR CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At first glance, a chance to create a national campaign
for antismoking ads seemed like a dream assignment, one of the
largest pieces of business ever awarded to a New England ad agency.
But five months after Arnold Communications of Boston landed the
job, the agency is in the midst of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   This week, two of the first four TV ads developed by a team of
ad agencies led by Arnold were pulled off the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unusual to have a finished spot rejected,'' said
Skip Pile of Pile and Co., a Boston firm that advises clients
looking to hire agencies.
</P>
<P>
   One ad showed body bags piled up outside the headquarters of
Philip Morris Cos. Another ad showed a teenager with a lie detector
pursuing a tobacco executive in search of the truth.
</P>
<P>
   For Arnold, the challenge can be expressed this way: How do you
create ads that grab the attention of teenagers but still can get
by network censors? How do you make antismoking ads that don't
elicit howls of protest from the tobacco companies that are
indirectly paying for them?
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it would seem that ads demonize the tobacco
companies as liars and killers are not the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what could be going through the minds of those ad
agencies,'' said Sue Parenio, an associate professor who teaches
advertising at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Body-bag and lie-detector ads seem ``almost engineered'' to make
tobacco companies mad and networks nervous, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can go over the edge. But to get the message out with
cleverness and wallop _ that's the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   At Arnold, executive vice president Pete Favat professed some
surprise that ads attacking tobacco companies would draw such fire.
For more than five years, he's helped create antismoking ads for
Massachusetts and, in his view, the the Massachusetts campaign as
well as statewide campaigns aired in Florida and California are
just as edgy as the ads that were just pulled off the air.
</P>
<P>
   In the Massachusetts ads, ``We questioned the morals and
conscience of the tobacco industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But as these same themes moved from statewide campaigns to the
national arena, it stirred up a higher level of controversy, Favat
speculated.
</P>
<P>
   The national antismoking campaign is the outgrowth of the 1998
legal settlement between most states and the tobacco industry. The
settlement created the American Legacy Foundation, part of whose
mandate was to hire ad agencies to devise a $1.5 billion marketing
campaign that would discourage smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Believing that it couldn't win the account on its own, Arnold
put together a coalition of agencies that included Crispin Porter &AMP;
Bogusky, a Miami ad agency that had much success with an edgy
antismoking campaign it created in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Arnold learned its coalition had beaten out
several other agencies to win the foundation's business.
</P>
<P>
   Because the ads are aimed at teenagers, a group that sometimes
prides itself on being immune to Madison Avenue appeals, the Arnold
coalition met repeatedly with teenage antismoking activists in
fashioning themes for the national campaign, Favat said.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas for the body-bag and lie-detector ads came out of
``brainstorming'' with teenagers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the foundation has said the true clients of the ad
campaign are teenagers. But if the definition of a client is the
one who pays the bills, then a case can be made that the clients of
this antismoking campaign are the tobacco companies, and they're
angry at having to subsidize their own bashings.
</P>
<P>
   According to the tobacco companies, ads that were pulled off the
air run afoul of the terms of their legal settlement with the
states. As they see it, antismoking ads that vilify tobacco
companies violate the spirit of an agreement under which they could
pay states as much as $246 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the ads were inconsistent with the purpose of the
foundation, which is to educate the public on tobacco-related
health issues,'' said Mary Carnovale, a spokesperson for Philip
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   As a recent Adweek story noted, the chief executive of Philip
Morris is a board member of the company that owns the Fox network,
and speculation abounds that tobacco companies have pressured the
major TV networks to refuse to run some of the antismoking ads,
something Carnovale declined to comment on.
</P>
<P>
   The ads certainly ``put the networks in an awkward position,''
said BU's Parenio, who noted that Philip Morris also owns such
brands as Miller Beer and Kraft Foods. Networks would be reluctant
to offend such a major advertiser, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Networks are not in the business of offending people; nor are
most companies that buy advertising, said Stephen A. Greyser, a
consumer marketing professor at Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception is advocacy groups, which sometimes
deliberately run offensive advertising in hopes of gaining
publicity for their cause, particularly when the advocacy group is
launching a new campaign, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold and the American Legacy Foundation denied that early ads
of its antismoking campaign were part of a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   According to foundation spokesman William Furmanski, the
teenagers who shaped the ads were influenced greatly by the movie
``The Blair Witch Project.'' The teenagers wanted the antismoking
campaign to create an underground word-of-mouth buzz. Similar buzz
turned ``The Blair Witch Project'' into a sleeper hit movie, even
though it lacked a big marketing budget.
</P>
<P>
   The teenagers didn't want the splashy hoopla that accompanies
the launch of most big ad campaigns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Don't do a big launch,' they told us. `Don't do ``Good
Morning, America.'' That's too adult,' '' Furmanski said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the foundation decided this week to pull the two
ads so it wouldn't get bogged down in controversy, hinting that the
same ads may return some day in a revised form.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is not to spend an enormous amount of time debating
two ads when there's a whole campaign to launch,'' said Furmanski,
who noted that the foundation expects to air about 40 ads this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ads don't vilify,'' he said. ``They talk about nicotine
and addiction. They talk about public health in ways kids
understand. We've got to reach these kids before they try their
first tobacco product.''

CHARTER, A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL CHAIN, IN CHAPTER 11 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charter Behavioral Health Systems, the nation's biggest operator
of psychiatric hospitals which has gone into a financial freefall,
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Charter, which is 90 percent owned by Crescent Operating Inc., a
company headed by Richard E. Rainwater, the financier from Fort
Worth, said it made the filing to ``ensure continued services to
patients'' in its units.
</P>
<P>
   Charter listed less than $50 million in assets and more than
$100 million in debts in filings Wednesday at the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   Crescent Operating also said it would seek approval from the
bankruptcy judge to acquire Charter for $24 million. Crescent Real
Estate Equities Co., a real estate investment trust also headed by
Rainwater, already owns the buildings used by Charter's hospitals
and treatment centers.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Charter ran roughly 90 psychiatric hospitals
and treatment centers for more than 8,000 patients, many of them
children. Operations have now dwindled to 37 units with a capacity
of 2,000 patients.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, the Justice Department and the Department of
Health and Human Services have been investigating Charter and
Magellan Health Services Inc., which once owned the chain, for
Medicaid billing fraud and patient abuse.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1997, Magellan Health entered into a complex $400 million
deal in which it sold Charter's buildings to Crescent Real Estate
and a 50 percent stake in the chain to Crescent Operating, an
affiliate of Crescent Real Estate. Because real estate investment
trusts cannot operate companies, Crescent Operating was formed by
Rainwater and his associates to hold the Charter stake.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 deal came as the industry faced cutbacks by insurers on
treatment payments. Many former officials of the chain have said
that the plan _ which saddled Charter with some $125 million
annually in new franchise fees and rapidly escalating rents _
contributed to Charter's financial collapse, undermining patient
care in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Magellan Health, Crescent Operating and Charter
Behavioral have said that the chain's problems were caused by the
insurance cutbacks, and that the 1997 plan did not affect patient
care. Last year, Magellan Health, the nation's largest behavioral
health care company, transferred all but 10 percent of its
remaining stake in Charter to Crescent Operating,
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's filing comes a month after Charter said it would
close and sell about 35 hospitals and centers. Former employees at
some units have filed lawsuits contending that Charter violated
federal law by failing to give them sufficient notice of the unit's
closings and paying them severance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Mary E. Olson, a lawyer in Mobile, Ala., representing former
Charter employees in three of those actions, estimated that about
5,000 former workers at the chain had been affected by the recent
closings.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Keiser-Jenkins, a spokeswoman for Charter, which is based
in Alpharetta, Ga., declined to comment on the lawsuits. But in a
news release, Charter said it was ``unable to fully fund all
benefits'' to staff members dismissed before Wednesday's filing.
</P>
<P>
   In a release, Crescent Operating said that Rainwater would
guarantee a bank loan that Crescent Operating plans to use to buy
the reorganized company. Rainwater would be compensated for that
guarantee, the company said. He is the largest shareholder in both
companies and was the biggest stakeholder in Magellan Health at the
time of the 1997 deal.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Jeffrey L. Stevens, an official of Crescent
Operating and an associate of Rainwater, told Charter executives
that the chain had $60 million in debts, according to a former
Charter official who was informed about that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Keiser-Jenkins said that she was not aware of the meeting.
Stevens did not return calls in recent days seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Under a proposed plan, Crescent Real Estate would initially
lease the 30 Charter facilities it owns to Crescent Operating for
$20.3 million, a 13.3 percent annual return, the company said. That
rate would rise by 5 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   Crescent Real Estate would also receive the proceeds of any
sales of buildings once used by Charter.

&HT;     CLINTON RELEASES $125 MILLION IN HEATING OIL FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton released $125 million in federal
aid Wednesday to help poor families in the Northeast pay for the
rising cost of home heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at his first official news conference of the year, said
the money, which would come out of the Low Income Home Energy
Assistance Program (LIHEAP), was all that is left this year in the
government fund that aids those who must rely on oil to heat their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These families have been especially hard hit because the
winter months have been colder this year than in the past few
years,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   But he promised to seek $600 million in emergency funds for the
program in a supplemental budget request that he will send later to
Congress to ensure that money will be available during the hot
summer months when air-conditioning will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have always pulled together to help their fellow
citizens in time of need,'' he noted. ``Now the families of the
Northeast need our help too, and we must act.''
</P>
<P>
   The government already has provided $200 million in LIHEAP
funding in an effort to offset the rising cost of heating oil. The
price of crude oil hit $30.25 earlier this week, the highest it has
been since the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the money released Wednesday will go to the
hardest-hit states and that he will meet soon with governors and
members of Congress from those states.
</P>
<P>
   During the hour-long news conference, the president touched on a
wide range of issues, including the presidential campaign, First
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's race for the U.S. Senate seat from
New York and his legislative priorities for his final year in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about the Republican presidential candidates
using comparisons with him as a campaign tool to disparage each
other, Clinton said jokingly, ``I have a lot of sympathy with
(Texas) Gov. (George W.) Bush and (Arizona) Sen. (John) McCain.''
The president asserted that the booming economy and lower crime
rates have left the Republicans struggling for campaign issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it's hard for them to figure out what to run on,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also was asked about his role in his wife's campaign for
the Senate. ``Well, I'm basically doing for her what she's always
done for me,'' he said. ``You know, I'm talking to her about
whatever she wants to talk about. I'm giving her my best ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to his legislative agenda, Clinton urged Congress to
devote more than half of the non-Social Security surplus to
Medicare, the government's health insurance program for the
elderly, and include a prescription drug program for seniors.``I
ask them to move quickly, and resist the temptation to spend large
portions of the surplus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called for tougher gun control measures, including
a mandatory 72-hour waiting period between the purchase and receipt
of a firearm. Congressional Republicans have argued that the
waiting period should be shorter, but the president has insisted
that 72 hours is needed to prevent people who should not be allowed
to buy guns from purchasing them on weekends when some records
cannot be checked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not sign a bill that promises the American people this
will make them safer, (if) it does not do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked about what he plans to do about a request by
the Arkansas Supreme Court for him to respond within 30 days to two
ethics complaints seeking to strip him of his law license because
of his conduct in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   He can either fight the complaints, which could lead to his
disbarment, or voluntarily surrender his Arkansas law license.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who settled a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by
former Arkansas state worker Paula Jones without admitting
wrongdoing, refused to say what he would do about this latest legal
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   He said he settled the Jones case because he thought that ``it
was wrong for the president to take an hour, much less a day, much
less weeks away from the job of the American people for anything
that could be a distraction.''However, he also hinted that he would
like to avoid a public fight over the matter. ``In all things that
have happened subsequently, I have left a lot of things unsaid that
might otherwise have been said, and I hope I can continue to do
that,'' he said.Addressing foreign policy issues, Clinton said he
would be willing to help mediate the decades-old dispute between
India and Pakistan over the contested province of Kashmir, as he
has done in Northern Ireland and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said India and Pakistan would have to be ``truly
committed'' to resolving the dispute. ``Unless we are asked by both
parties to help, we can't get involved,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 51 years, Pakistan and India have fought two wars
over Kashmir. More than 15,000 people have been killed and
thousands displaced by the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Clinton will travel to India and Bangladesh, but so
far he has no plans to visit Pakistan. Gen. Pervez Musharraf,
Pakistan's military ruler, urged Clinton earlier this month not to
bypass his country during his trip, saying a visit would go a long
way toward easing tensions with India.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he will base his decision on whether to visit
Pakistan _ a recent nuclear power _ on what will best serve U.S.
interests in trying to stop ``a nuclear arms race.'' On a domestic
issue, the president also discussed his recent decision to allow
the U.S. Navy to resume practice bombing on part of the Puerto
Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy had used its range on the island for 58 years until a
Marine pilot accidentally dropped two bombs that killed a Puerto
Rican security guard and injured four other civilians working on
the range last April 19.
</P>
<P>
   After eight months of protests, Clinton agreed to stop live
bombing of the island and to use inert bombs instead during
training exercises for the next three years. But he said other
target practice should resume and that Vieques residents should
decide in a referendum whether the Navy should stay or leave.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico has agreed to let the limited training exercises
resume on the island as part of a deal that includes up to $90
million in aid if residents of Vieques vote sometime before
February 2002 on whether the Navy may once more use live
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have charged that the plan is unfair because it does not
allow for an immediate and permanent stop to the bombing exercises.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton said Wednesday that the plan was a ``perfectly
reasonable compromise'' under the circumstances and that his main
goal was to give the people of Vieques a chance to decide the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were just up to me, if I could sign an executive order
and let them have a sanctioned election, I would do it today,'' he
said.

ANDERSON GIVES CELTICS SEASON-BEST PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ You didn't see it, did you? You've already
given up on the Celtics, and you didn't need the aggravation of
seeing them trashed by the Utah Jazz, especially on ``NYPD Blue''
night.
</P>
<P>
   That's understandable. Also regrettable. You missed what Johnny
Most would have called a ding-donger of a fourth period. You missed
a memorable comeback in a 101-99 victory. And you also missed a
delectable sideshow, almost undoubtedly as brilliant a 25-minute
outing as a Celtic point guard has ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Anderson was not just good on Tuesday night when, in 25
foul-plagued minutes, he shot 12 for 15, dished out 6 assists and
scored 19 points in a fourth quarter run (6 for 6 from the floor,
including a pair of 3-pointers) that began with a nervy pull-up
transition 3 at 7:36 and culminated with a pair of free throws with
9.9 seconds to play. He wasn't just great. He was positively
transcendent.
</P>
<P>
   And he's not about to ``Aw, gee, shucks'' it, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I'm capable of at this level,'' he said Tuesday at
the Celtics' workout. ``And the thing I'm proudest of is that
listening to John Thompson say on TV that `Great players come
through with the game on the line,' because that's what I did last
night. Anybody can do stuff in the first quarter or the second
quarter, or when you're up by 20 and everything is loosey-goosey.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing ``loosey-goosey'' about the Utah game. The
Jazz are battling for the Central Division title, and the Celtics
are battling for, among other things, respect.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting part was the 1999-2000 Kenny Anderson at his best.
``All year long, I've been shooting the ball well. I really have,''
he said. ``Even when I miss, I've been right there.''
</P>
<P>
   But this show was of the highest order. He sank the
aformentioned deep 3. He got a conventional 3-point play on a
stutter-step jumper that drew a foul from a frustrated John
Stockton. He hit an inside-out 3 from Paul Pierce. He swished a
baseline 13-foot moonshot right out of a 1967 Havlicek vs. Wilt
highlight reel. He canned a leaner. And he capped off his 12-field
goal night with a pumping, up-and-under banked drive learned long
ago on the New York City asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   Which was only half the story. He was a floor general in every
sense, abetting his individual offense with fourth-quarter feeds to
Tony Battie, Vitaly Potapenko, and Pierce, usually emanating from a
pick and roll, where he was happily doing unto the Jazz what they
normally do unto everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Among his other accomplishments were a veteran acceptance of NBA
reality. That is to say, he didn't allow some questionable early
foul trouble to ruin his evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my maturity showing,'' he said. ``Three or four years
ago, I'd have gotten on the refs or even gotten myself teched out
of the game. I just went back and cheered for my team, and when the
coach called on me, I was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Give the coach his own assist, too. When Anderson picked up his
fourth foul with 8:42 remaining in the third (53-45, Utah), it was
assumed that he'd be exiting, per Rick Pitino's policy. Dana Barros
was actually on his way to the scorer's table when Pitino heeded
Anderson's plea to remain in the game. Anderson gave the Celtics 7
points before leaving more than five minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the kind of night it was for the Celtics, who
survived an 18-0 Utah run in the second period (from 31-24, Boston,
to 42-31, Jazz), as well as a 14-point third-quarter deficit
(53-39).
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them at the half, `Inflate, don't deflate,''' Pitino
said. ``A young team has a tendency to deflate.''
</P>
<P>
   They're not all young. Anderson is 29. He's been around and
back, and situations don't faze him. For one Tuesday night he was
nothing less that the best player in basketball, and the Celtics
rode his brilliance to a superb victory.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The news wasn't all good. Pierce, the team's best night-in,
night-out player, sustained some sort of right leg injury in the
area described by Celtics public relations chief Jeff Twiss as
``neither his knee nor his hamstring,'' and was taken for a
``precautionary'' MRI. He was caught in a monster sandwich between
sizable gentlemen named Olden Polynice (7 feet, 250 pounds) and
Potapenko (6-10, 285). His status is the proverbial day-to-day . .
. How good was the fourth-quarter action in Salt Lake City? ``I
walked off the floor feeling uplifted,'' said veteran official Dick
Bavetta. Pitino likewise conformed that the affair was a cut above
the modern NBA norm, with the teams exchanging the lead seven
straight times from 91-90 through 97-96, and with people on both
sides making tough shots. ``It was fun to see a battle like that
going on,'' Pitino said. ``It was fun for me to watch Stockton and
(Karl) Malone. The last time we played them we hung in for a while,
but we didn't have (Adrian) Griffin and Pierce.'' . . . Is Pitino
worried that this team might be a bit full of itself after such a
big road win? ``It's fortunate we have two days in-between games,''
he said. ``It would have been different if we were playing right
away. But these type of games (i.e. against weak teams) have been
very difficult for us.'' . . . The Celtics play the Warriors at the
Arena in Oakland Friday night . . . Pitino on the three-way trade
involving Philadelphia, Golden State, and Chicago: ``Larry Hughes
is a good young talent. I wish he weren't going to Golden State. Or
that he at least takes his time getting a physical. Toni Kukoc
makes Philly very tough.'' . . . Danny Fortson played 12 minutes
against the Jazz, hauling in five rebounds. ``(The trade with
Toronto) is behind us,'' Pitino said, ``but in all likelihood he
could be moved again. If we can get something good, we'll do it,
because I still don't think we can re-sign him.'' The trading
deadline is Feb. 24.

 &HT;    McCain gets conservative Bauer's nod
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Sen. John McCain's efforts to shore up
support among religious conservatives in South Carolina got a boost
Wednesday when he was endorsed by former rival Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, a former adviser to President Reagan, appeared with
McCain at a Furman University rally in the most conservative region
of the state to offer his support ``with great pride and without
any hesitation.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also picked up endorsements from California Secretary of
State Bill Jones, a former Bush supporter, and former U.S. Sen. Dan
Evans of Washington. California's primary is March 7 and
Washington's is Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   At the Furman rally, Bauer said McCain wants ``not a money bags
democracy, but a system built on civility and decency and honor.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that McCain ``is the man most likely to end the
Clinton-Gore years.''
</P>
<P>
   Having the backing of a champion of the social conservative wing
of the Republican party may help McCain blunt the withering assault
on his conservative credentials by the campaign of Gov. George W.
Bush and its surrogates.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer had campaigned as a vocal opponent of abortion rights
until he left the race following the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Without using the word ``abortion'' on the college campus, he
said McCain would work to ensure that ``every child is welcomed
into the world and protected by the law.''
</P>
<P>
   In a session with reporters later in the day, Bauer provided a
comparison between McCain and Bush that was welcomed by the McCain
camp. ``Governor Bush is no different on the major issues,'' Bauer
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Hilton Head, Bush professed little concern that Bauer had
come out for McCain. ``People are free to endorse who they would
want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Furman rally, a Bush worker distributed a statement
from Bauer's former South Carolina chairman, who now is backing
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of Bauer's endorsement, many of us recognize that
George W. Bush is the true conservative and the real pro-life
candidate in this race,'' said state Sen. Mike Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Bush backers and interest groups have mounted telephone, mail
and television and radio advertising campaigns to undermine
McCain's standing among Christian conservatives, an important
segment of the South Carolina electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism has ranged from his vote to allow scientists to
use fetal tissue in their quest for a cure for Parkinson's disease
to groundless charges that McCain fathered illegitimate children.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, a C-Span camera captured an exchange between Bush
and Fair in which Fair urged Bush to go after McCain's ``soft
spots'' to win over religious conservatives. Bush acknowledged he
would do so, but not on television.
</P>
<P>
   While polls show that the race in South Carolina is too close to
call, Bush has been running well ahead of McCain among socially
conservative voters. McCain conceded Wednesday that his `

SOVEREIGN SUGGESTS PAYMENTS FOR FLEET, BANKBOS BRANCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hoping to ease federal regulators' concerns, Sovereign
Bancorp of Pennsylvania has submitted a new plan to the US Office
of Thrift Supervision that would allow it to spread out payments
for 280 Fleet and BankBoston branches over several months, rather
than make a single $1.4 billion payment.
</P>
<P>
   John Hamill, chairman and chief executive of Sovereign New
England, said he expects final approval within a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've submitted a plan to the regulators which is a good plan,
and we believe it will be approved,'' Hamill said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Tuesday that although the bank, based in
Wyomissing, Pa., is well capitalized, regulators had questioned
whether a one-time payment for the branches would be too great a
burden at a time when financial reserves will be needed to convert
the branches.
</P>
<P>
   Under the revised plan, about 90 BankBoston branches in Rhode
Island and Connecticut would be purchased March 27. The second
purchase, on or about June 20, would involve about 95 Fleet
branches in Massachusetts. The last purchase, for 97 Fleet branches
in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, would be around July 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $1.8 billion or so has been raised and it is in the
bank,'' Hamill said. He added that the payments would coincide with
the bank's schedule for staggered conversions of the New England
branches to Sovereign branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sovereign has completed the financing,'' he said. ``The
staggered conversions we are talking about will be better for the
customer, because it will mean that each branch will be converted
in groupings of about the same size, as opposed to converting all
280 branches at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign, a $25 billion bank, currently has 300 branches in the
Mid-Atlantic region and total net income of about $180 million,
after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some analysts have wondered whether the deal might
be too large for Sovereign, which is technically a thrift. Others
say it should have no trouble expanding into New England.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jim Moynihan of Advest in Boston said the New England
entity's new management team ``brings an awful lot to the table'' _
particularly Hamill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sovereign was reaching when it came in to buy, but a good
management team adds strength,'' Moynihan said. ``There might be a
glitch or two, but I think by mid to late summer everything will be
in place.''

ADVERTISING: HELPING `PEANUTS' CHARACTERS SURVIVE THEIR CREATOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During the last 50 years, Charles M. Schulz built the
comic strip ``Peanuts'' into one of the most powerful and effective
brands in entertainment marketing. The adventures of characters
like Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus and Lucy spawned billions of
dollars worth of licensed merchandise from companies like Fossil,
Hallmark, Hasbro and Pez; inspired scores of advertising campaigns
for products like Ford automobiles, Dolly Madison snack cakes and
Metropolitan Life insurance; and generated hundreds of promotions
for fast food, soft drinks and other mass-market goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with the death of Schulz on Saturday, just as the final
original ``Peanuts'' strip appeared in newspapers, experts in the
field of corporate identity are divided over the future of the
brand. Some say they believe that ``Peanuts'' can remain salient
and relevant to new generations if the brand is tended as carefully
by the Schulz estate as it was supervised by him in life. They cite
as examples the Disney and Warner Brothers cartoon mainstays from
Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck to Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, say that the ``Peanuts'' gang, as Schulz
described his creations, must inevitably suffer the fate of
characters from comic strips like ``Li'l Abner'' and ``Pogo,''
which faded from popularity after their creators died and consumer
tastes changed.
</P>
<P>
   United Media, the division of E.W. Scripps Co. that oversees the
syndication and licensing of ``Peanuts'' and the characters, is
determined to keep its lucrative franchise fresh and thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Plans made for ``Peanuts'' before the death of Schulz ``will go
forward,'' Alexa Gardner, executive director at United Media in New
York, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The characters are global icons, beloved,'' she added.
``Newspapers in New York ran a silhouette of Charlie Brown and
Snoopy. How many images are instantly recognizable in silhouette?
Mickey Mouse, the Eiffel Tower and `Peanuts.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner acknowledged her familiarity with the vicissitudes of
American popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Capp was my favorite uncle; my child is named after him,''
she said, referring to the creator of ``Li'l Abner,'' whose
hillbilly characters were a national craze in the 1940s and 1950s.
But if Regis Philbin asked a question about Dogpatch, the Schmoos
or Kickapoo Joy Juice on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'', he
would probably draw blank stares.
</P>
<P>
   To help ``Peanuts'' remain ``immortal,'' Gardner said, United
Media has ambitious campaigns that predate Schulz's death. They
include an extensive promotional campaign this year to commemorate
the strip's golden anniversary and the release of a Paramount Home
Video tape retelling ``The Pied Piper of Hamelin'' with Snoopy in
the lead role.
</P>
<P>
   ``The licensing program, with 600 licensees worldwide, will
continue,'' Gardner said. ``New art for merchandising and
advertising will be created by those artists authorized by Charles
Schulz to draw the `Peanuts' characters for those purposes'' _ he
delegated those tasks but always produced the strip himself _
``with new looks based on the themes established over the last 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 18,000 strips to draw from, 1,800 with a baseball
theme alone. And there's the animated library, shows and specials
like `A Charlie Brown Christmas,' which CBS and Nickelodeon will
continue to show.''
</P>
<P>
   Some corporate-identity experts applaud that strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brand can go on forever,'' said John Grace, executive
director at Interbrand Group in New York, part of Omnicom Group,
``because it touches a piece of the humanity in each of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think in 10 years people will be prone to personal
embarrassment?'' he asked, citing a recurring theme of the Schulz
oeuvre. ``Then the cartoon will be relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Johnson, chairman and chief executive at Enterprise IG in
New York, owned by the WPP Group, said: ```Peanuts' so successfully
captured a little bit of what the brand identity of this country
is. That's why it has resonated with so many people for so long.
And brands that are closely tended by their creators from the
beginning can remain fresh if you put the kind of resources into
the rejuvenation process that are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts, however, say that whatever efforts are made by
United Media and the Schulz estate will not be sufficient to
counter the natural impulse of consumers to move on, particularly
in the fad- and trend-driven world of pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any other brand, `Peanuts' needs to be kept current,''
said Allen Adamson, managing director at Landor Associates in New
York, a division of Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the characters are not living and growing to talk about
what's important to people, there'll be a slow sunset for them like
retired movie stars,'' he added. ``And fewer and fewer advertisers
will tap into them.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Siegel, chairman and chief executive at Siegelgale in New
York, the corporate and brand consulting company formerly called
Siegel &AMP; Gale, said: `` `Peanuts' is an icon, but a static icon in
the future. I can't see it as a viable advertising expression
because advertising has to be topical and responsive to what's
happening in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were Met Life or somebody using the characters in ads,''
Siegel concluded, ``I would figure out a way to transition out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But executives at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., which has
used the ``Peanuts'' characters in advertising, blimps and
promotions since 1985, say they have no such intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing changes,'' said Kevin Foley, a spokesman for MetLife
in New York. ``Our contract runs through 2002, and while we don't
want to negotiate in your column, they remain as important to us as
they've always been.
</P>
<P>
   `` Schulz always took a personal interest in MetLife, and it's
fair to say he was very pleased with what it meant to us as a
company that people recognized us for his characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz was also a longtime MetLife policy holder, according to a
statement the company issued on Monday in which three current and
former chief executives mourned him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Schulz touched the lives of just about everybody on
this planet,'' said Denny Lynch, vice president for communications
at Wendy's International in Dublin, Ohio, which gave away Snoopy
toys in a children's meal promotion last year and will do so again
in late summer for the anniversary celebration. ``But his passing
will do nothing to change our plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The characters will live on, and some might say they will
increase in popularity now that the strip is no longer being
produced. Our anniversary toys will be numbered and have
collectible value. Maybe they'll be collector's items.''

 &HT;    Gore promises speedy storm relief to Georgians
 &HT;    By Christopher Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMILLA, Ga. _ Vice President Al Gore walked through a
devastated neighborhood here Wednesday, promising tornado victims
that help was on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very impressed with the way this community has
pulled together,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary housing will arrive Monday, and the first federal
checks for disaster relief are expected by Wednesday, Gore said.
State officials estimate that property owners in Mitchell,
Colquitt, Grady and Tift counties suffered $20 million in insured
losses. The death toll was 18 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore appeared with several state politicians, including Gov. Roy
Barnes. After a helicopter tour, Gore said agricultural specialists
will come to South Georgia to examine the flattened chicken houses
and pecan groves and destroyed irrigation equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president visited the family of Tommy Lee Randell. Two
of Randell's daughters and his two sons lost their houses;
Randell's home was still inhabitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to do a little patching, but at least I've got
something to patch,'' Randell said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Jellets, a spokesman for the Georgia Emergency
Management Agency, said 258 homes were destroyed. An additional 88
homes were severely damaged and 103 houses suffered minor damage.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Emergency Management Agency teams walked through
hard-hit neighborhoods to register residents for relief. FEMA also
was scouting locations for temporary housing.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson Manufacturing Co., which makes mobile homes, was shut
down by the storm. FEMA assessor Mac Gardner said the building and
153 trailers were destroyed and 40 employees are out of work.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-mile-long footprint of the storm traveled mostly through
farmland, forest and pecan groves.
</P>
<P>
   Farm officials said the winds destroyed about 20 irrigation
systems and at least 14 chicken houses and flattened pecan groves.
</P>
<P>
   Animals also had a disaster relief team on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Animal Planet television channel sent a bright blue
tractor-trailer painted with pictures of two dogs, a tiger, eagle
and pig. The trailer goes from its headquarters in Denver to the
scene of disasters to rescue and treat animals.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanette Edelstein, the project manager, said the crew pulled
about 10 dogs out of the rubble Tuesday. They try to find the
animals' owners or take the pets to a local shelter. ''They get a
little forgotten,'' Edelstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The initial rush of help in the devastated areas has settled
into a steady movement of heavy machinery clearing acres of debris
and trees and victims picking through the litter that was their
homes. ''We'll be fine,'' said Danny Morrell, a farmer who lost
three massive irrigation systems due to the storm. ''We just have
to put the puzzle pieces back together.''

 BAUER ENDORSES McCAIN; CANDIDATES CONTINUE TO SPAR OVER CAMPAIGN(Eds: The material in the MCCAIN story, budgeted earlier, is now
folded into REPUBS; see also CAROLINA-PROFILE,
SC-POLITICAL-PROFILE.) 
(rk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL with FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Sen. John McCain won the endorsement
Wednesday of Gary Bauer, a former presidential rival and prominent
social conservative who called him the ``best shot we have to end
the era of Bill and Hillary and Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer showed up at McCain's side at a midday rally here on the
campus of Furman University, in the northern quadrant of South
Carolina, where the state's large and influential bloc of voters
from the religious right is the strongest. The senator's senior
advisers said they hoped Bauer could bring new support from
Christian conservatives and help fend off charges by supporters of
Gov. George W. Bush that McCain is not reliable on social issues
such as abortion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain himself said Bauer could help him reach out to a part of
the Republican Party to which ``my lines of communication haven't
been as firm.'' Bauer immediately started offering a spirited
defense of McCain, providing an important counterweight to figures
like Pat Robertson who suggested this week that conservatives would
desert the party if McCain became the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Reminding the crowd at Furman University of McCain's
imprisonment as a prison of war in North Vietnam, Bauer said that
``when John was in that POW camp, he wasn't sitting around thinking
about the wealth of America or the power of America, he was
thinking about that moral idea of America, the reason that we are
who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who had made the crusade against abortion one of the
centerpieces of his own presidential campaign, said McCain agreed
with him that ``we must work to ensure that every child gets
welcomed into the world and protected by the law.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Bauer said he believed McCain and Bush had
the same position on abortion, which is less absolute than his own.
``At least on the surface there wasn't much difference'' he said of
the two men. ``But I've looked John in the eye. I've talked to him.
I've looked at his voting record. I believe it is by and large a
pro-life voting record.''
</P>
<P>
   With McCain and Bush running neck and neck, the senator has
gained solid support from independents. But most polls show him
running behind Bush with traditional Republicans and doing even
worse with the religious right. A South Carolina anti-abortion
group is running radio advertisements accusing McCain of voting
``to use tax dollars for experiments that use body parts from
aborted babies,'' a theme that is also being hit hard by the
National Right to Life Committee in direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Charleston sidestepped a question about
whether Bauer's endorsement of his rival would hurt him with
religious conservatives. ``I think I've got good chance to win
South Carolina,'' Bush said. ``I'm going to drive this campaign
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush took a more direct swipe at McCain and his commitment to
diluting the influence of money in politics, suggesting Wednesday
that McCain was ignoring federal spending limits for the Republican
primary in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides asserted that McCain had spent about $2.8 million
in advertising alone for South Carolina, and had thus undoubtedly
exceeded the limit of slightly more than $3 million for a full
array of expenditures. Bush himself declined to make charges or
cite numbers, but his comments left no doubt that he believed that
McCain had crossed the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``No candidate ought to be above the rules,'' Bush said at a
news conference in Hilton Head Wednesday morning. ``Senator McCain
needs to explain, if in fact he has busted the spending cap in
South Carolina, how on the one hand you can be a campaign funding
reformer and on the other hand, not live within spending caps.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides did not provide a specific figure for the Arizona
senator's spending but said that he would remain within the limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a dime under in New Hampshire,'' said John Weaver, the
political director for the McCain campaign. ``We'll be a nickel
under here.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarrel was about more than math. With striking consistency
over the last week and a half, Bush has worked to divert attention
from his own prodigious financial war chest and intense spending to
charges that McCain's fund raising violates some of his own
principles when it comes to campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush faces no spending limits, because he raised so much money
last year that he decided to forgo the federal matching funds that
are distributed on the condition that candidates stay within
certain caps. Bush's aides said Wednesday that the campaign had
spent about $3.1 million on advertising in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign provided a startling glimpse Wednesday into
the full extent of their spending, conceding that it had spent, by
the end of January, about $50 million of the $70 million it had
raised up to then, leaving the campaign with about $20 million in
reserve on the day before the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   That was a record-setting expenditure for this point in a
presidential race, and it topped by $8 million the amount that Bob
Dole had spent through July in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insisted that his campaign had nonetheless anticipated, and
was well equipped, to deal with this kind of scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on plan,'' Bush said at the news conference. ``We've got
a strategy. We've got a plan in place and we're executing the
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also engaged McCain in a new television commercial that
addresses campaign financing and began airing Wednesday in South
Carolina. The spot says that McCain's criticisms of Bush on this
issue have been gratuitous and unwarranted, and it casts Bush as
someone eager to usher in sensible reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer met secretly with McCain Tuesday in a Columbia hotel
before the final debate leading into the South Carolina primary.
Bauer flew back to Washington Tuesday night to consult with his
family. He then telephoned McCain at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday morning
with his decision and the campaign sent a chartered plane to bring
him back to South Carolina. Bauer was planning to stump for McCain
in South Carolina and then in Michigan.

LAWMAKERS ASSAIL NASA CHIEF FOR RELYING ON RUSSIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers considering NASA's first budget increase
in seven years attacked administrator Dan Goldin on Wednesday for
relying too heavily on the Russian government to complete the
international space station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fools for depending on them,'' fumed Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher, R-Calif., chairman of the House Space and Aeronautics
Subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Rohrabacher, along with other committee members, criticized the
Clinton administration for the ``grievous mistake'' of joining
forces with the financially unstable Russian government. He said
the partnership has cost taxpayers several billion dollars and
delayed the space station's construction by two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other recent problem in our space program has cost the
American people so dearly, both in money and lost opportunities,''
the chairman said during a 2 1/2-hour hearing on Goldin's 2001
budget request. ``Nothing has been so destructive as the naive
assumption that Russia's government would spend its limited
resources to help us build the international space station.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Rohrabacher said, NASA should have dealt directly with
private Russian companies.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin, who is seeking a $435 million increase in fiscal year
2001 to the space program's current $13.6 billion budget, told the
panel that NASA's alliance with the Russian space agency has paid
off, both financially and in terms of the enormous boost in
knowledge gained from joint work aboard Russia's Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us not forget what we learned from the Russian
government,'' he said. ``It was monumental in opening our eyes up
to understand the rigors of long-term space flight. That occurred
not because of Russian companies. That occurred because of the
relationship at the top level with the Russian government. There
are a whole host of things that we did not know.''
</P>
<P>
   And he added that at least one Russian company the committee was
touting had tried to gouge NASA on space station hardware, offering
it at a much lower cost to a private U.S. company. It was the
Russian Aviation and Space Agency, he said, that stepped in to
force the company's prices down. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; When completed in 2005, the international space station will
provide research facilities for a permanent crew of seven. NASA
believes the space station, which involves 16 nations, is a crucial
first step in launching an eventual human mission to Mars and will
also aid medical and scientific research on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   House Science Committee Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wisc.,
complained that RASA had repeatedly reneged on promises to produce
the space station's crew module. Originally slated for an April
1998 launch, the crew module, also known as the service module or
the Zvezda (Russian for ``star''), is critical if the Americans and
Russians want to meet a November target date for launching the
station's first resident crew.
</P>
<P>
   The module, which the Russians now plan to launch in early July,
also contains a life support apparatus, as well as the propulsion,
flight control and power generation needed before new U.S.
components can be added to the station.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner read a timeline for completing the service module,
pointing out that the Russians had missed every deadline since
March of 1996 and complaining that NASA had not followed through on
promises to launch an interim control module as a stop-gap measure.
</P>
<P>
   That module would take over maneuvering of the space station for
up to a year, keeping the outpost in orbit and buying time if the
Russians fail to launch the service module or if something goes
wrong with the service module once launched.
</P>
<P>
   The interim control module ``still sits on the ground, and now
you're telling us that NASA has made the wrong call every single
time,'' Sensenbrenner told Goldin.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldin said not all of the space station delays were
Russia's fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our own problems, along with the Russians,'' he said,
adding that he should have begun work on the interim module a few
years earlier than he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very serious mistake for which I accept
responsibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin also told lawmakers that despite their ribbing over last
year's loss of two spacecraft, the Mars Climate Orbiter and the
Mars Polar Lander, exploration of the red planet will remain a top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   The climate orbiter was lost in September as it approached Mars
because of navigational errors resulting from a mix-up between NASA
and its contractor Lockheed Martin in converting metric and English
measurements. The polar lander failed to send a signal from Mars
after its 11-month journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that we'll get over these problems,'' Goldin
said. ``We will be able land on Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said the loss of the probes was a ``tremendous blow,''
but he hopes to learn from what went wrong. A report on that is
expected next month.

JACQUELINE AURIOL, FRENCH FLIER AND TEST PILOT, DIES AT 82  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Sweden, Italy, France)   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jacqueline Auriol, the glamorous French flier who set several
speed records as one of the world's leading military test pilots in
the 1950s and '60s, died Saturday at her Paris home. She was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Auriol was born to the world of fine boarding schools and
country manors and married the son of the man who would become
president of France. However, she would eventually transcend her
role as the official tea pourer of Elysee Palace to succeed in a
field that had been almost entirely masculine, except for Hanna
Reitsch of Germany, a test pilot for the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Auriol's life was transformed when her face was crushed in a
1949 accident in a plane in which she was a passenger. She endured
33 plastic surgery operations over the next three years. (She did
not see her two sons, Jean-Claude and Jean-Paul, until her face was
as restored as possible. It seemed to work: a French newspaper
commented that her nose might now be American, but her smile
remained unmistakably French.) Rather than discouraging her, the
experience turned her resolve to achieving greatness in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Though she had learned stunt flying before her accident, her
goal became nothing less than breaking the sound barrier. She
watched the Vampire fighter being built in 1951 and eagerly
volunteered to be one of the first to fly it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day I experienced a sense of completeness,'' she told
Collier's magazine, ``an extraordinary sensation of power.''
</P>
<P>
   But she had to settle for being the second woman to break the
sound barrier, in 1953. The first was Jacqueline Cochran, an
American, earlier that year. The two Jacquelines were to become
famous rivals, as each in turn would edge beyond the other in
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Douet was born on Nov. 5, 1919, at Challans, a small
town on the Bay of Biscay. Her father, Pierre Douet, was a wealthy
shipbuilder. She spent most of her childhood at Nantes, then
studied art in Paris at L'Ecole du Louvre. On weekends, she would
ski in the French Alps.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, she meet her future husband, Paul Auriol, through a
friend who was a ski champion. His father, Vincent, was a prominent
leader of the Socialist Party. Both families opposed an alliance
between Socialists and wealthy industrialists, so they insisted
they were too young to marry. She was sent to Sweden, while Paul
toured Italy.
</P>
<P>
   However, two years after their original meeting, they married at
a small mountain chapel. They divorced in 1967 and remarried in
1987. She was later widowed. Only her two sons survive her.
</P>
<P>
   When World War II broke out, she refused to leave France while
her husband was in the resistance movement. She lived in hiding
under a false identity. ``I began to realize that I loved danger,''
she told The Washington Post in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, her father-in-law became president and she, her
husband and Jean-Paul, her older son, moved into Elysee Palace. She
soon realized ``the parties and receptions were not enough to keep
my interest.'' At dinner one night, she sat next to a flying ace
and was so captivated by his stories that she asked if she and her
husband could take flying lessons from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult politically for my father-in-law because
so few women flew at this time,'' she said. ``I was pretty and I
knew I was pretty. There was publicity and I began to be heavily
criticized for my flying.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was that her husband gave up flying, while she
dropped out of the social and political life to devote herself to
it. Then the accident happened. She was a passenger when the pilot
attempted a dive and hit the water. He was barely hurt, but her
face and body were crushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was broken into a million pieces,'' she said. ``I had no
face, no nose, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   She needed a new purpose in life, and flying seemed to be the
solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the chance of my life to really become a good pilot,''
she said. ``Now that my beauty was gone I would have to derive a
reason for being from the plane which had taken it away.''
</P>
<P>
   As an aviatrix, as Current Biography listed her in its 1950s
coverage of her achievements, she flew more than 100 types of
aircraft. She received aviation awards from Presidents Truman and
Eisenhower. She was decorated with France's Legion d'Honneur and
wrote an autobiography called ``Vivre Pour Voler,'' meaning living
for flying. At her death, Jacques Chirac, president of France,
called her ``the incarnation of courage and modernity for the
French people.''
</P>
<P>
   Her conception of modernity did not include all of feminist
philosophy. ``These very feminist women irritate me when they say,
`Men hold me back,''' she said. ``It's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   But she never undervalued the effect of luck. She had a narrow
brush with death in 1956, for example, when her Mystere IV plane
went into spin and she managed to bring it back under control only
a few dozen yards from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was all worth it. In the Colliers interview, she spoke of the
rows of flowers on the grounds of Elysee Palace. ``Poor
creatures,'' she said, ``guardians and ornaments of the Elysee.
Once my life was like theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   She then smiled broadly. ``Perhaps I should teach them to fly,''
she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As two of the most prominent figures in the New York
art world, Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, and Thomas Krens, the director of the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum, oversee distinct and often opposing museum
models. The Manhattan-bound Met, ensconced in Central Park, and the
global Guggenheim, with branches in four countries. The
encyclopedic Met, whose territory covers five millenniums, and the
contemporary Guggenheim, an evangelist for modern art. The stately
Met, which attracts huge crowds for exhibitions on Impressionism,
ancient Egypt and Renaissance art, and the hip Guggenheim, where
spectacles like ``The Art of the Motorcycle'' and jazz on Fridays
are as big a draw as scholarly shows.
</P>
<P>
   When they met over breakfast recently at The New York Times to
talk shop, it was not, as Krens suggested, ``because we're the two
oldest guys around.'' de Montebello, 63, has run the Met for 22
years, and Krens, 53, has headed the Guggenheim for almost 12.
Their views on expansion, exhibitions, financing, the Internet _
excerpted here _ matter in what some call a golden age for art
museums. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Philippe, you have said that there will be no satellites for
the Met. Do you still feel, in this era of mergers and linkups,
that the Met will remain only on Fifth Avenue? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DE MONTEBELLO. We have vast collections, the strength of which
is the ability to move from one civilization to another under the
same roof, and that we don't want to lose. Dispersal would be a
great weakening of the institution.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Tom, what are the benefits of a global museum?
</P>
<P>
   KRENS. It's access to audience. In New York we have about a
million visitors a year. In Bilbao there are now about 1.3 to 1.4
million. In Venice, it's about 300,000. And then in Berlin, our
limit's a little less than 200,000. So you have almost 3 million
visitors, which makes it a fairly substantial cultural force. And
it's still a fairly small space. Now, you can argue that maybe we
shouldn't be programming as aggressively as we are, but the growth
of the collection is related to programming. Donors are drawn to
more challenging institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you see a limit on the number of branches? Can you bring
us up to date on South America and Liverpool and wherever else
you're looking?
</P>
<P>
   KRENS. We're not really looking. If I were to show you a list of
proposals or letters, it probably would be more than 50, but
they're not solicited. We don't have any plans for any further
expansion. There is a kind of public relations bounce to this. We
were doing an exhibition project in Brazil, and I went to Brazil
with a team of three. It was a major story in every newspaper.
There were calls from governors of at least seven states in Brazil.
But that doesn't translate into anything.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The Met is constrained by its footprint in Central Park. How
does it maintain its pre-eminence when it is so constrained?
</P>
<P>
   DE MONTEBELLO. Well, I don't think you measure pre-eminence by
square footage. We already are, with the Hermitage and the Louvre,
the largest museum structure in the world. We have 2 million square
feet. And our collections fit, if not capaciously, at least
comfortably, in the building. I don't think it's necessarily a bad
thing to have to develop plans that call for amelioration rather
than aggrandizement. The public has demonstrated that it likes a
sense of vitality and change in any institution, even one encased
in stone as we are.
</P>
<P>
   And there are any number of configurations that you can give to
collections within a place as large as the Met. This fall, for
example, to celebrate the millennium _ we had to do something to
celebrate the millennium; I caved in _ we're doing a show called
``The Year One,'' calculated as 50 B.C. to A.D. 50. ``The Year
One'' is rich in South America, the Mediterranean world, India,
China. So we're regrouping what man created at the highest level of
visual perception in the Year One.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How much of your collection can be shown at any one time?
</P>
<P>
   DE MONTEBELLO. I would say 90 percent of what you'd like to see.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you ever feel the temptation to just spread it all out and
say this is everything?
</P>
<P>
   DE MONTEBELLO. No. The Met was already too big a museum in the
time of J.P. Morgan. The moment you're too big, you might as well
get much better, because what you are is a series of individual
destinations within the same place.
</P>
<P>
   With major collections that we might be interested in, we might
consider working with other institutions. Maybe, in the future,
strict ownership of a work of art will be an outmoded concept. A
kind of a general global understanding of trusteeship for works of
art rather than ownership may develop.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Museums all over the country are expanding, and yet surveys
show that only about 10 percent of the population goes to art
museums. Does enlarging the audience mean changing the kinds of
shows you do?
</P>
<P>
   DE MONTEBELLO. The predisposition to come to something as
recondite as an art museum requires a whole set of things that a
museum itself cannot give. We can help _ we can have as many
educational programs as possible, we can promote, we can introduce
artists in the schools, and so forth, but society has to do its bit
as well.
</P>
<P>
   KRENS. If you look at a snapshot of a museum audience, it tends
to be tourist-driven. Why? Because we're all busy. Visiting a
museum tends to be a leisure-time activity, so to the degree that
education stimulates awareness, and prosperity stimulates mobility
and the desire to experience these cultural activities in different
places, potentially the audience is very, very large.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some theorists believe that museums are going to have to get
people participating in the museum's life. One museum had visitors
vote on which of two African sculptures to buy, another had
ordinary people writing museum labels. Is that the way museums are
going?
</P>
<P>
   DE MONTEBELLO. The notion of opening to popular suffrage
decisions that require a great deal of knowledge and discrimination
is one that I don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Yet people are voting with their feet. If there is a show of
the Impressionists, it will become a blockbuster and that will look
good on the balance sheets. Isn't there a danger in having popular
suffrage determine blockbusters?
</P>
<P>
   DE MONTEBELLO. A terrible danger. Do you realize how it limits
your options? Picasso, Matisse, Impressionism and Egypt _ is that a
way to represent the world? Our obligation is to broaden appetites,
to cause more people to come in and see the show we have on Tilman
Riemenschneider. One of the reasons I speak a lot about the need
for our institutions to become better capitalized, to have larger
endowments, is for us to be able to have the integrity and the
independence to continue to present things that are not obvious
subjects for the public.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   KRENS. Our attendance is stronger than it's ever been. It's hard
to say exactly why. Is it a function of general prosperity? Of a
larger institutional awareness? Bilbao has been such a successful
enterprise in Europe _ does that translate to, ``Well, when I'm in
New York, I'll go to the Guggenheim''? There may be some of that.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I would hesitate to say that the motorcycle
exhibition is symptomatic of anything, it attracted a lot of
attention, and it wasn't designed to stimulate audiences. We did
the same kind of research for that project that we would do for
any. It was presented in a very elegant way. And it generated a new
audience for the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are any of them coming back?
</P>
<P>
   KRENS. We don't tag them like whales and find them. But I do
have a general sense that [increased attendance) may be a
combination of the programming, the prosperity and image awareness.
</P>
<P>
   DE MONTEBELLO. To me, audiences are second. What distinguishes
an art museum from a university or a hospital or any other kind of
institution is that we collect works of art. Works of art are the
tangible manifestation, the highest aspirations, of man as he
expresses himself in visual terms. Our primary responsibility is to
the works of art. We are responsible for the guardianship, for
scholarship. Then comes the matter of bringing it to the public.
The public is the ultimate beneficiary of our primary purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does an institution like the Guggenheim have a special
relationship with its hometown? Would it bother you to see works of
art go from here to Bilbao permanently?
</P>
<P>
   KRENS. I find myself lining up with Philippe, referring to what
he said earlier about how issues of ownership might be changing.
There may be, finally, a community of institutions that, because of
standards and compatibility in collections, decide, in effect, to
pool their resources. It's a fairly different concept from outright
ownership. But right now, our strength as an institution is very
much a function of what we do in New York City. If we are to
consider serving our collection, we have to consider doing it in
New York first.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are you doing with the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   KRENS. In 10 years it's going to be so different that there is a
huge challenge as to how to use this. In terms of Web sites,
probably the best I've seen right now is the Met's.
</P>
<P>
   DE MONTEBELLO. I view the Web site and most technological
initiatives as forms of marketing, promotion. I want it as
marvelous as possible. I want as many images on it as possible.
Just as audiences after World War II swelled in part because of
those wonderful little Skira books, I'm convinced that Web sites
that provide an enormous amount of information will tip the scale
for thousands of people who are thinking, ``Maybe I'll visit a
museum someday,'' but have never done it.
</P>
<P>
   KRENS. The Internet's a curious thing. It doesn't at all replace
the experience of the museum as we know it. Yet there are certain
things you can do with the Internet that you can't do for a work on
view. One is, with the proper photography and the right bandwidth,
you can look in extraordinary detail at various parts of a work of
art and have access to the scholarship, stories, histories and
conservation records and provenances that surround it.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it still is a screen in a room, and people,
at the end of the day, are social beings, and part of the
attraction of going to a museum is being in the presence of the
actual object.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If the technology continues to improve and the image is
virtually 100 percent, what remains to keep the original original?
</P>
<P>
   DE MONTEBELLO. The notion of authenticity. Take a Rembrandt like
``The Man With the Golden Helmet'' in Berlin, which everybody
admired but which is no longer attributed to Rembrandt. The picture
hasn't changed. It was beautiful before. Why isn't it beautiful
now? The answer is simple: you've changed. The day before, you were
admiring something painted by Rembrandt. The moment you know it's
not painted by Rembrandt, you changed toward it. And so the picture
does change.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The public was surprised, during the ``Sensation'' show at
the Brooklyn Museum, at how museums raise money from people who
have commercial interests in the art being shown. Do you think
there need to be new conflict-of-interest rules?
</P>
<P>
   DE MONTEBELLO. I cannot answer that in the negative since it is
known that the Association of Art Museum Directors has appointed a
committee to review and tighten its guidelines on private
collections and funding of exhibitions. There's no question that a
higher alertness as to what might be conceived as a possible
conflict of interest enters our minds.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But the association said virtually nothing about it before.
</P>
<P>
   DE MONTEBELLO. It may not say much more afterward. As far as I'm
concerned, most museums have shown, over the last decades, a great
deal of wisdom and care in how they've done things.
</P>
<P>
   I have to caution everyone against the puritanism of a newfound
sense of ethics, which to me sounds more like righteousness. One
has to be very pragmatic and remember that the interests of the
many should dominate over the foibles of the few.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But if a fashion designer makes a major contribution and,
before or after, you put on the show of that designer, doesn't that
create the impression that you're caving in to financial interests?
</P>
<P>
   KRENS. You're making a big leap between the reality and the
impression. Hypothetically, there may appear to be danger in lots
of things. If something segues from appearance into common
practice, then you have a situation that may become more complex.
But the fact that there is a debate, that you do have the AAMD
considering tightening these guidelines, confirms the general sense
of ethical operations.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why wouldn't Charles Saatchi, or whoever, want it known that
he contributed to the sponsorship of a show of his works?
</P>
<P>
   DE MONTEBELLO. You're going to have to invite Arnold Lehman (the
director of the Brooklyn Museum) to answer that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is disclosure the answer?
</P>
<P>
   DE MONTEBELLO. No, but disclosure is (italics)an(end italics)
answer. One of the key questions is does the public benefit from
the exercise? You have to weigh the degree to which such
perceptions, were they to be taken too seriously, ultimately damage
the public. We don't print money. And so we have to find some
middle-of-the-road way that is ethical but pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   I was quite amused to read that we were taken to task because we
asked Tiffany to fund the Tiffany show and Cartier to fund the
Cartier show. Should we have asked Tiffany to fund Cartier and
Cartier to fund Tiffany? Let's be logical. First of all, the work
of Tiffany was created at the turn of the century, not any of which
is still sold by the firm. The Cartier show ended in 1930, so
Cartier didn't benefit. This is pushing to an extreme. This is what
I call righteousness. And it's silly.
</P>
<P>
   You could even make the outlandish argument that in contemporary
art, whenever you show an artist, you're benefiting the artist and
the gallery. You might as well close shop if you can no longer deal
in that way.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I wonder about the impact of ``Sensation'' on programming. We
spoke of how Impressionism and Egypt bring in crowds. In other
media, shock brings in crowds. Are we going to see this more and
more in museums?
</P>
<P>
   KRENS. If the material holds up over time, and there develops
behind it an intellectual support, you'll begin to see it. But I
don't see it as an issue, like all of a sudden there's a special
space in storage for the sexually explicit imagery.
</P>
<P>
   We deal with this in a certain way. For example, we received a
gift of 200 images from the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation. And
we've done small exhibitions selected from this collection. Some
were obviously sexually explicit. We deal with that through
signage, basically saying to people in advance that they're going
into an area where there is some sexually explicit imagery and that
parental guidance is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you deal with the crowds?
</P>
<P>
   KRENS. There were no crowds, believe me. Would that there were.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I was a little surprised to see there was an ATM in Bilbao,
inside the museum. I can't imagine one at the Met.
</P>
<P>
   DE MONTEBELLO. Why not? I've always found it curious that we
didn't have one inside our shops. We have phone booths.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you fighting commercialism, the gift shops right next to
the entrance?
</P>
<P>
   DE MONTEBELLO. This is a question of aura. People who make the
conscious decision to visit a museum do not want a promulgation of
their daily existence. They want something different, conceivably
uplifting, or at least challenging, and therefore there has to be
kind of a caesura. Shops support the institution, but I certainly
wouldn't put them first. I think that would defeat that impression
of awe and wonder that museums should provide.
</P>
<P>
   KRENS. To a certain extent, the retail activities are a
necessary burden. It's absolutely for sure that museums cannot
survive on admission alone. If you were to look at either of our
budgets and divide by the number of visitors, the average ticket
price would have to be around $75.
</P>
<P>
   DE MONTEBELLO. When we had the exhibition of van Gogh in St.
Remy and Auvers _ the last 18 months of the life of van Gogh _ you
ended on the very moving set of the final pictures and the crows
over the wheat fields. In the next room were all the catalogs and
postcards. We had a flurry of letters saying, ``We walked out of
the exhibition in tears, a great experience ruined by the shops.''
And I had to say: ``Look, I'm sorry we had to have the shops. Would
you have preferred not to have an exhibition at all?'' Because
without the shops, I couldn't have afforded to do the show.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it's a matter of weighing public benefit with the
evils. We are in a capitalistic society where earned income
increasingly, as governments cut back, is an important part of our
life. That's just the world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Different Perspectives &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a 1999 lecture, Thomas Krens of the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Museum listed ``the components of a great 21st-century museum.''
Without knowing the contents of Krens' list, Philippe de Montebello
of the Metropolitan Museum of Art agreed to compile his own. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Krens: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ A great location, with urban in teraction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Great collections. &QL;

   _ Ease of access, physically through amenities, and
intellectually, through programs that deepen the experience and
understanding of art. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Ease of access fuori le mura (outside the walls) of services
and information through the latest technology. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ An unwavering belief in the primacy of the experience of art

in Shakespeare's ``Troilus and Cressida'': ``'Tis mad idolatry to
make the service greater than the God.'''

GOVERNING PARTY SEEKS TO PROSECUTE CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The bitter rivalry between Taiwan's president, Lee
Teng-hui, and a leading contender to succeed him took its nastiest
turn yet Wednesday as the governing Nationalist Party requested
prosecution of the candidate for embezzlement and forgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists filed their case with prosecutors against James
Soong, a former leading light of the party and ally of Lee,
charging that he diverted $12 million in party donations and
revenues to a personal account. Under Taiwanese law, the Taipei
prosecutor must now investigate and determine whether to bring a
criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   Soong mounted an independent run for president last year after
Lee supported Vice President Lien Chan as the party candidate in
the March 18 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts debated Wednesday night whether the new
charges, forcing an already harsh political dispute into the legal
arena, would harm Soong's candidacy or backfire on the
Nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Lu Ya-li, a political scientist at National Taiwan University,
said he doubted that the case would hurt the party. ``It looks like
they are using this as a campaign strategy, and Soong can say he is
being persecuted,'' Lu said.
</P>
<P>
   Soong, his former secretary and his sister-in-law are accused of
embezzlement and forgery to divert the funds during Soong's tenure
as party secretary-general from 1989 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Soong's attorneys repeated his firm denials of wrongdoing
Wednesday, saying that he put the money into a special account
under a direct mandate from Lee, for use in ``special missions''
that Soong has not described.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has previously denied approving the diversion.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's inquiry is expected to take months, a legal
expert said.
</P>
<P>
   Though it will not be complete by election day, the criminal
inquiry casts a shadow over the presidential campaign, and if the
prosecutors do proceed with charges, a guilty verdict could result
in prison sentences. The prosecution would be suspended if Soong
wins the presidency, the legal expert said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A decade ago Soong, a skilled politician with an unusual ability
to connect with the public, was a close friend and political ally
of Lee, helping him to consolidate his position as party chairman
and Taiwan's president.
</P>
<P>
   After 1994, as the elected governor of Taiwan province _ the
title was a relic of the Nationalists' former claim to be the
government of all of China _ Soong skillfully nurtured an image of
caring for the common people.
</P>
<P>
   But as his own popularity soared, he became more defiant and his
relations with Lee soured. In 1998, Lee led a drive to eviscerate
the governorship and Soong was elbowed to the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Soong began his independent campaign last year and was expelled
from the party. And until accusations of an illegal ``slush fund''
began to dog him late last year, he was a firm leader in the
opinion polls over Chan and the third contender, Chen Shui-bian of
the Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
   The air of scandal has cost Soong some of his support, and the
three candidates now appear to be in a dead heat. But many
Taiwanese say they believe that the charges against Soong are
politically motivated, especially because the concealment of
political donations and secret doling out of funds to gain allies
have been common practices in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 10, the Control Yuan, a government watchdog, issued a
report finding that Soong had failed to properly report political
donations and certain family assets. It did not recommend a
criminal inquiry, although in Wednesday's filing the Nationalists
drew on some of its findings.

 &HT;    Is Web severing lifelines?
 &HT;    By Richard Halicks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Has the Internet stolen your husband?
</P>
<P>
   Did you misplace your life somewhere between Yahoo and shop.com?
</P>
<P>
   Are your only friends people you've never actually seen?
</P>
<P>
   The Web world was vibrating Wednesday with talk of the latest
study: A Stanford University researcher concludes the Net is
increasingly isolating us from the people we love, that we're
working online at home without cutting hours at the office, and
that we're spending less time watching TV or shopping in stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you spend your time on the Internet, you don't hear a
human voice, and you never get a hug,'' declared Norman Nie, the
Stanford political scientist who headed the study of Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of Internet thinkers flamed Nie's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assertion that the Internet is socially isolating has not
held up to serious scrutiny,'' Donna Hoffman, co-director of the
eLab at Vanderbilt University, told The Washington Post. ``All of
the research I've seen points the other way _ not to mention the
anecdotal evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time people are actually spending on the Internet
is for e-mail, which is surely a form of communication,'' scoffed
Pat McKeown, head of the Management Information Systems Department
at the University of Georgia. ``It seems to me that you're actually
increasing socialization.''
</P>
<P>
   But others nodded their heads at Nie's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results aren't at all surprising,'' said Clifford Nass, an
associate communications professor at Stanford and author of ``The
Media Equation: How People Treat Computers, Televisions and New
Media Like Real People and Places.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavy media users to tend to feel more isolated and lonely,''
Nass said. ``We don't know whether it's cause or effect. Do people
use media as a way of filling their loneliness; or does the use of
media cause loneliness? Probably a bit of both.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford report appears to support a landmark study by
Carnegie Mellon University, concluded in summer 1998, that stunned
researchers at the time: The two-year investigation found that
people who spend even a few hours on the Internet each week suffer
higher levels of depression and loneliness than they would if they
used the Net less frequently.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford study, based on a nationwide survey of 4,113
people, focused most closely on the 36 percent of respondents who
said they use the Web more than five hours a week. Of that group,
13 percent said they spend less time with family and friends
because they're occupied online; 25 percent said they work more at
home, without any decline in work at the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go home at 6:30 in the evening and spend the whole night
sending e-mail and wake up the next morning, I still haven't talked
to my wife or kids or friends,'' Nie said.
</P>
<P>
   People do interact on the Net. But much of the e-mail and
chat-room conversation occurs under aliases _ making it impersonal
and intrinsically false.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard for people to navigate the reality of what's
occurring online,'' said Jay Weinstein, a clinical and
neuropsychologist in Sandy Springs, Ga. ``Nothing is clearly real _
or real in the sense of how people would interact in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, you're not presenting yourself as you see
yourself. And on the other hand, people are responding to you based
on this false presentation. This reinforces the idea that if you
present yourself as you really are, you're not as acceptable,
perhaps,'' Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Guzdial, associate professor at Georgia Tech's College of
Computing, fights Internet isolation at home and at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's less isolating when I have my children on my lap
and we're doing Pokemon searches together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guzdial says the answer to problems caused by technology is _
yep _ more technology. At least in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Look for multiple-mouse computers, which enable more than one
person to work at the same time, Guzdial said. Also, check out
``collaborative browsing,'' in which Net users at different
locations can see how one another are navigating a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do some really collaborative, interesting things ...
that connect people, that improve on our day-to-day life, rather
than isolating us from our day-to-day life.''

BRADLEY STRUGGLES TO ATTRACT BLACK VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Bill Bradley voiced his strongest disappointment
yet Tuesday with his inability to capture public attention and, in
particular, to connect with black voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who came within four points of Vice President Al Gore
in New Hampshire, had remained steadfastly optimistic in recent
days even as his campaign has been overshadowed by Arizona Senator
John McCain's surge in the Republican contest.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is scheduled to appear Thursday at a community health
center in Boston whose residents have been touched by gun violence
and activists who have worked to curb it. The event kicks off a bus
tour that also takes him to Providence, New Haven, and White
Plains, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a place where in the last two weeks we can focus our
resources in a way that we can accomplish some things,'' Bradley
said in an interview, describing his prospects in the five New
England states that hold primaries March 7. ``I think we have a
strong chance in all those states.''
</P>
<P>
   He struck a more reflective tone during a news conference on a
gray, gloomy morning in Buffalo and at a town meeting afterward in
Rochester. Responding to questions, Bradley acknowledged that time
is running out before the decisive primaries March 7 in 15 states.
He conceded that he has had little success in reaching voters since
the New Hampshire contest Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The calendar isn't that helpful,'' Bradley said. ``The
five-week gap, given what happened in New Hampshire, did create a
little dead spot. But I don't think it's impossible to overcome
when the public focuses again.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that news media have reported his attacks on Gore less
prominently than they have the sniping between McCain and Texas
Governor George W. Bush. As an example, he cited his vehement
response Monday to Gore's attack on his health plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very strongly condemned him for the points he made,''
Bradley said, ``but I don't know if it made the front page of the
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was getting his message across, Bradley said,
``Not always.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused briefly before answering a reporter who asked if he
was frustrated by that. ``I can handle it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley insisted he had not lost hope. ``I clearly have to
win a number of states on March 7 and 14, no question about that,''
he said. ``We are behind now in most places, but we are moving, and
the public really doesn't focus on this until the last two weeks of
a campaign. We have plenty of time.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he is to gain considerable ground, Bradley needs to break
through to black voters, a core Democratic constituency. To date,
Gore has enjoyed overwhelming support among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a little disheartened by those numbers,'' Bradley told
a crowd of about 150 at Monroe Community College in Rochester.
``But that's not going to change my commitment. What we can do is
simply reach out and tell more people what I believe and why I
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, he won over one black voter who initially told
Bradley he was skeptical about his commitment to improving race
relations. After challenging Bradley to lay out his position on the
issue, the Rev. Anthony Majors, associate pastor of the Lake Avenue
Baptist Church in Rochester, said: ``I believe he is the only
candidate at this point who is somewhat serious about diversity. If
he hadn't said what he did, I wouldn't have voted at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he would launch a new advertising campaign next
week in a final push to catch Gore. He trails by substantial
margins in California, the biggest prize, and New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley is hoping to prevent Gore from knocking him out of
the race by closing the margins in both states and winning several
New England states and his native state, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   James Shannon, a former Massachusetts lawyer and a Bradley
supporter, said that he saw hopeful signs amid the rancor of the
GOP primary in South Carolina. McCain and Bradley are vying for
independent voters across the country, particularly in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who were enamored of John McCain after New Hampshire
are starting to take a second look,'' Shannon said. ``They are
seeing that McCain is more conservative than they knew, and they
are starting to come back to Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there have been indications that McCain has continued to
sway a number of independents and Democrats to the Republican
ranks.

 &HT;    Lewis' freedom puts him on leash
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Submitting weekly urine samples to Baltimore
authorities will become as common to the life of NFL football star
Ray Lewis as tackling a competitor on the field.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis arrives at his Owings Mill, Md., home, where he is
expected today, the All-Pro player will be heavily monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictions placed on Lewis when he was released from the
Fulton County Jail after posting $1.1 million bail Tuesday will be
enforced by officials at the Maryland Department of Public Safety's
Pretrial Detention Services.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Public Safety Commissioner LaMont Flanagan said it's
the first time in his 10 years at the agency that it has been asked
to supervise a celebrity of Lewis' stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will require Mr. Lewis to give us access to his home,''
Flanagan said Wednesday afternoon. ``We'll be visiting him
periodically. This is not routine for us, monitoring a celebrity
like Mr. Lewis. It's the exception rather than the rule. But it's
incumbent upon us to make sure he (Lewis) follows this plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and two acquaintances _ Joseph Sweeting of Miami and
Reginald Oakley of Baltimore _ are charged in the stabbing deaths
of Jacinth Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24, both of Decatur, Ga.
The two victims were killed Jan. 31 in a fight on an Atlanta street
corner the morning after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting, 34, and Oakley, 31, are in the Fulton County Jail
awaiting a bond hearing. Both surrendered this week.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been assigned to Fulton County Superior Court Judge
Alice D. Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictions on Lewis were outlined in a letter by Will Davis,
deputy director of FultonCounty's Pretrial Detention Services.
They are a 9 p.m. curfew; travel only to Georgia and in Maryland;
weekly drug and alcohol tests; weekly visits with pretrial
detention officials; and surrender of his passport.
</P>
<P>
   This means the 24-year-old athlete, regarded the Baltimore
Ravens' strongest player, also will not be allowed to play in
football games outside Maryland, Flanagan said, unless Fulton
County Superior Court Judge Doris Downs modifies the order.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is expected to hold a press conference today at 3 p.m. at
the Ravens complex in suburban Baltimore, said Jana Harris, one of
his attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Weekly urine samples submitted by Lewis to Flanagan's Baltimore
office will determine whether Lewis violates the drug and alcohol
rule, while impromptu phone calls and random visits to his house by
officials under Flanagan's division will determine whether he's
adhering to his curfew, Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must also fax us or call us everyday with his schedule,''
Flanagan said. ``If he does something that's not on the schedule,
that's fine as long as he sticks to the stipulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis will be interviewed by Flanagan's unit and assigned a case
manager as soon as he returns to Maryland, Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ravens officials are hoping some of the terms placed
on their middle linebacker will be relaxed by the time the NFL team
begins its pre-season play in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing planned out of town for the next several
months,'' said Kevin Byrne, vice president of public relations for
the team. ``The first out-of-town game we have scheduled is the
third weekend in August, but we have no idea who we'll be playing
against yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe something will change between now and the time we start
the season,'' Byrne said.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE with JANET ELDER   
 c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Gov. George W. Bush of Texas finds himself in an unexpectedly
rancorous primary struggle, voters' impressions of him nationally
have diminished so substantially that now as many people dislike
him as like him, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   These findings are particularly striking given that for months
Bush towered over the Republican and Democratic fields in poll
after poll. But Bush's Republican challenger, Sen. John McCain, is
in a markedly better position after his impressive victory in the
New Hampshire primary on Feb. 1. In November, voters knew little
about the senator from Arizona; now, more people like him than do
not, by a margin of nearly 3 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Bush, Vice President Al Gore has enjoyed some
success in overcoming a decidedly negative image, and has benefited
from a huge proportion of Americans who credit President Clinton
for a flourishing economy.
</P>
<P>
   The most heartening news is not only for the vice president but
also for the Democratic Party. There were several signs in the
survey that Republicans might find it daunting to compete with
Democrats next November on both the presidential and congressional
levels.
</P>
<P>
   During the Republican debate in South Carolina on Tuesday night,
both Bush and McCain presented themselves as best prepared to steer
the country out of the Clinton era. But that may not be such a
prudent selling point, especially among Democrats and independents,
because the poll found that the president still draws remarkably
high marks for his job performance.
</P>
<P>
   Although only 43 percent of Americans say they like Clinton
personally, his job approval rating stands at 60 percent and his
stewardship of the economy draws a 73 percent approval.
</P>
<P>
   This is all encouraging for the vice president. When voters are
asked why they like Gore, the highest proportion _ 22 percent _ say
it is because of the Clinton administration's record, more than
double since last November. Another 17 percent say it is because of
Gore's experience as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The results are quite a turnabout from last year, when Gore was
struggling to contain the surge by his Democratic opponent Bill
Bradley, while also keeping a distance from the scandals at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remarked on the Democrats' good fortune at his news
conference in Washington on Wednesday. Asked why the two
Republicans condemned him in the debate, he said: ``I have a lot of
sympathy with Governor Bush and Senator McCain. It's hard for them
to figure out what to run on.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating Bush's challenge is that voters are now as likely
to hold a negative view of Bush as a positive one, a pronounced
shift from late last year, when he was far more popular. Bush has
suffered in part, the poll found, because voters do not identify
him with a particular set of policies and are not enamored of his
tax-cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain and Bush compete ferociously in the run-up to the
primary on Saturday in South Carolina, the Democratic contest
nationally seems to have evaporated in the eyes of many voters.
Bradley's losses to Gore in New Hampshire and Iowa have made him
less of a factor in the Democratic race; the vice president has
enlarged his already lopsided lead among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   About as many people have a favorable an image of Gore as
unfavorable. It is not an altogether enviable position, but it
represents a notable shift from last December, when a far higher
proportion viewed him negatively.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide telephone poll of 1,225 adults, including 979
registered voters, was conducted Saturday through Monday. The
entire sample has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three
percentage points. Because of its broad national scope, this survey
is not a reliable measure of the state of the Republican contest in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   If the general election were held today, the survey found, it
would be a dead heat, with Bush drawing 45 percent and Gore 44
percent. Last November, Bush was ahead of Gore, 50 percent to 41
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite McCain's surge in popularity, he would do no differently
against Gore than Bush would. He would receive 42 percent; Gore, 41
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of McCain's potency _ and success in courting
independents and Democrats _ he would beat Bradley, 45 percent to
31 percent. In November, Bradley led McCain, 47 percent to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the primaries, Bush is still favored by more than half of the
Republican voters. But McCain has cut into Bush's once tremendous
lead. The poll shows that Bush is now the choice of 53 percent of
Republican primary voters, and McCain, 33 percent. In November,
Bush was the favorite of 68 percent, and McCain was the choice of
only 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many voters are only beginning to focus on the race and
said it was too early for them to know who they will vote for. Only
one-third of Bush's backers, and of McCain's, said they had decided
for certain.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore's national lead has grown.
Sixty-four percent of Democratic voters back Gore; 25 percent
support Bradley. In November, as Bradley was drawing national
notice as a threat to the vice president in New Hampshire, 56
percent favored Gore and 30 percent favored Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Another comforting sign for Gore is that voters no longer expect
a Republican victory in the presidential race. Now, they say, it is
a tossup.

</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Clinton's popularity is helping Democrats in the
same way it did when Washington was distracted by the impeachment
proceedings: The public likes the policies of the administration
despite the reservations about Clinton's personal qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``As vice president, he's had a part in the success of the
economy,'' said Kelly Rinaldo, an independent who was questioned
for the poll and explained in a follow-up interview on Wednesday
why she likes Gore. ``He's on the right track. And if he follows
through on Social Security and health care, he'd be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Rinaldo, 36, a homemaker from Patchogue Village, N.Y., added,
``When you're a vice president, you always play second fiddle, but
he has the upper hand because of this experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger for Bush is that the more that people get to know him
the more he seems to lose support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush seems to waffle more on the issues,'' said Mark Giloican,
27, a poll respondent who is a student in Savannah, Ga., and plans
to back McCain. ``All of the candidates tend to say what we want to
hear. But Bush seems to do it more. My opinion has changed recently
simply because I've heard more about him. He seems to have a little
more charisma than McCain, but that's not what matters to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggested that Bush's positions were a growing
vulnerability. Voters said they were more drawn to McCain's stand
on campaign reform than Bush's signature tax proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what any budget surplus should be used for, 56 percent of
Americans said it should go to Social Security; 17 percent to pay
down the debt; and only 13 percent to cut income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But respondents seemed more interested in campaign reform, which
has been McCain's major theme, although Bush announced a campaign
finance proposal of his own this week.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two percent of Americans said the campaign finance system
has so much wrong with it that it needs to be completely
overhauled. Another 44 percent said fundamental changes are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Bush's tax-cutting message still appeals to many
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Cassan, 78, a retired clothes presser who backs Bush, put
it this way: ``McCain has come out for campaign finance. But if it
was passed the Republicans wouldn't have a chance because the media
leans heavily Democratic. He's also more liberal than Bush. He
doesn't support as big a tax cut that Bush does, which the people
need and deserve.'' She added, ``He wants all the things I want,
such as tax cuts and smaller government.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Albert McCloud, 63, a retired shipworker
from Hampton, Va., said he would back Gore. ``It appears that Bill
Clinton is going to try to win the election for Al Gore, and it
appears that Al Gore is going to try to continue some of the
successful policies of the Clinton administration, like paying down
the debt, keeping the economy steady by working with the Federal
Reserve, and strengthening the education budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the presidential race, the poll found the Democrats are
better positioned for the November elections than the Republicans.
Sixty-one percent of voters said they had a positive view of the
Democratic Party; 31 percent have a negative view. By contrast, 49
percent have a positive view of the Republicans; 41 percent a
negative view.
</P>
<P>
   While national polls have little predictive value as to the
outcome of local House races, they do offer a sense of public
sentiment about the parties. In the poll, 33 percent of voters said
they planned to vote for the Republican candidate in their
district; 44 percent for the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, Democrats are buoyed by the roaring
economy. In 1992, when Clinton triumphed over President George
Bush, only 23 percent of Americans said the economy was in good
shape. Now, 88 percent hold that view.

GUN CONTROL MEASURES LOSE STEAM IN STATEHOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ For all the political oratory and legislative
proposals prompted by the Columbine school shooting rampage, one of
the few fast-moving firearms bills in the nation's statehouses this
year is not a gun-control measure. It is a ban promoted by the
National Rifle Association against cities suing gun manufacturers
for liability in deadly sprees by citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of our top priorities,'' said Jim Baker, the NRA's
chief lobbyist, who estimated that the urban lawsuit ban, already
enacted into law last year in 15 states, would be fully approved by
15 to 20 more states this session.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to have two-thirds of the states done by the end of
this year,'' Baker said of the bill to protect gun manufacturers,
which the NRA is finding far easier to pursue on a state-by-state
basis than in the federal congressional arena.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between slow-moving gun control proposals and the
rapidly passing lawsuit ban was brought home first-hand here to a
House delegate, James H. Dillard II. No sooner were his three
post-Columbine proposals to ban guns and hunting on Virginia's
school grounds snuffed in committee than the House passed the city
lawsuit ban by a vote of 83-17 and sent it to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``School districts were begging for passage of my bills, but it
didn't matter,'' Dillard ruefully observed.
</P>
<P>
   The National League of Cities is opposed to the lawsuit ban as
an unfair pre-emption of local authority. But the league concedes
that the NRA has scored a strategic victory with its relatively
quiet statehouse blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``State legislatures tend to be more conservative, and the NRA
has very effectively pumped tons of money into this issue,'' said
Juan F. Otero, senior legislative counsel to the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA let the images of Columbine dissipate and then pushed
forward with this,'' said Otero, describing the lawsuit ban as a
``shameful endeavor'' that cities would eventually have to fight in
home-rule constitutional challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the lead of Chicago, New Orleans and other cities
with major gun-crime problems, various urban officials across the
nation have been discussing the possibility of innovative lawsuits
against gun manufacturers for the costly damages from shootings.
Their opponents argue that criminal use of guns is a product abuse,
not the manufacturer's fault. The lawsuit ban is moving more easily
in part because of state lawmakers' tradition of not easily
yielding dynamic prerogatives to localities, especially when they
are potentially revenue producing.
</P>
<P>
   Here on the statehouse level of politicking, Dillard, a
66-year-old schoolteacher and suburban Republican legislator who
has long been involved in Virginia's gun control debate, is not
surprised by the rejection of his school protection bills and the
rapid progress of the lawsuit ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banning guns from schools is a no-brainer, and I think my
bills would have easily passed if they had gotten beyond the
committee to the House floor,'' said the Fairfax lawmaker,
underlining the statehouse mix of committee power and rural
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Firearm legislation is in the hands of the House Militia and
Police Committee, where, Dillard notes, 18 of the 23 members have
earned ``A'' ratings in the NRA's influential legislative report
card.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no grand scheme here,'' said the committee chairman,
H. Morgan Griffith, a member of the Republican leadership that took
full control of Virginia's legislature this year for the first time
in more than a century. In the turnover, the committee was revamped
with rural gun rights advocates predominating over urban-suburban
gun control proponents. This is a change Dillard denounces as ``a
stacked deck,'' while Griffith said it mostly reflected the results
of the last election and the state's profile.
</P>
<P>
   In that election, a number of candidates in the northern suburbs
near Washington campaigned on the issue of gun control in the wake
of Columbine. ``They called for restrictions, and that didn't
happen,'' said Baker, the NRA lobbyist, emphasizing the voters'
rejection of a number of such candidates as the Democrats lost
control of the statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The current tenor of the House was suggested in its recent
endorsement of a proposed amendment to secure hunting and fishing
as a state right on a par with free speech. ``There was some fear
that with the animal rights movement and so forth we ought to state
it affirmatively in our constitution,'' Griffith said.
</P>
<P>
   Dillard and Griffith agree that the gun issue has long played
out not so much on party lines as on the clashing interests of
rural and urban-suburban lawmakers. In fact, the main sponsor of
the ban on cities suing gun makers was Delegate C. Richard Cranwell
of Roanoke, the House Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Griffith, a 41-year-old Salem lawyer who enjoys
bird watching, not hunting, the Columbine tragedy ``has put more
emotional energy into this issue.'' But he insists no workable gun
control bill has emerged. The basic problem, he said, is ``more
deep-seated in society'' and involves parental responsibility and
the waning of youth's respect for church and civic institutions.
``I know the answer is not passing new gun laws that don't have any
effect on people determined to commit mass murder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dillard, a deer hunter in his boyhood and a teacher and
principal for 30 years, concedes that, with the mass of ordnance
now routinely available across the nation, aberrant students cannot
be fully foiled from schemes of mass murder. ``But we needed to
send a clear message after Columbine that schools and guns don't
mix,'' he said. ``We proclaim drug-free school zones despite that
continuing problem, and this is the same idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, there is no outright ban on bringing weapons
onto school grounds. Current law provides for possible expulsion of
armed students, but no criminal prosecution unless the guns are
brandished dangerously.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Columbine may have haunted the national debate, state
legislative specialists find no major enactments looming on gun
controls, although ``smart gun'' proposals and other high-tech
alternatives to gun controls are drawing publicity. ``It's the
teeter-totter effect,'' said Kelly Anders, a policy analyst for the
National Conference of State Legislatures, referring to a general
standoff she finds in most statehouses on the issue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Virginia, gun control proponents are not encouraged by the
fact that one change being seriously studied by the militia
committee under the topic of gun controls would liberalize a
current law against weapons in drinking establishments to exclude
restaurants. ``You don't want to be subject to being robbed as you
come out of a family restaurant that people know you can't take a
gun into,'' Griffith explained.
</P>
<P>
   Last year 1,100 firearms bills of various sorts were submitted
to statehouse hoppers, Anders said. Of these, 150 were approved but
the vast majority of these involved noncontroversial administrative
changes affecting law enforcement agencies and other institutions,
not private gun owners. Despite the Columbine uproar, Anders said,
``This year may not be any different than years past.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They talk about the same record and initiatives, and
assiduously avoid public discussion of certain shared memories from
their years in Washington. They court the same supporters and seek
money from the same contributors. Last Sunday morning, their
motorcades passed just miles from each other, as they campaigned
for votes in churches and restaurants in Brooklyn and Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the one thing that Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham
Clinton don't talk much about these days is each other. And as Gore
and Mrs. Clinton find themselves forced into close political
quarters in New York in the last weeks before the state's
presidential primary, the relationship between these two Democrats,
both of whom who would like to ride President Clinton's legacy
while they distance themselves from his darker moments, has become
as a complicated work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tussle between two ambitious and not particularly close
public figures trying to stake out space on the same limited stage,
picking and choosing from pieces of the president's record as they
try, in their own ways, to succeed him.

<P>
   While Gore speaks often and enthusiastically about President
Clinton, particularly when campaigning in New York, he tends to
discuss Mrs. Clinton only when he is asked, and then with reserve.
``I think she's going to win,'' Gore said last week when an upstate
television interviewer asked if Clinton's Senate campaign helped or
hurt Gore's own presidential effort. ``I think she's going to be a
great senator. I think that her campaign probably helps me. I
really don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   When another television interviewer asked Gore if he would
campaign at Mrs. Clinton's side in New York, he demurred: ``It's a
matter of scheduling. Not just me, but also her. I hope so, but
that's yet to be worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's schedule did not coincide with Mrs. Clinton's during two
days of campaigning in New York this week, though Wednesday night,
after questions were raised about the issue, Gore's aides announced
that an appearance with Mrs. Clinton that had been tentatively
scheduled in Albany, but then dropped to allow for debate
preparation, would take place.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Clinton spoke admiringly in an interview earlier
this month of what she called Gore's ``incredible strides'' as a
candidate after a difficult start, even saying she might borrow
some of the campaign phrases he used in introducing her husband
when they traveled the nation by bus after the 1992 Democratic
convention. Yet some of her senior aides have balked at allowing
her to campaign with Gore too often in the weeks ahead. They were
concerned that while it might aid Gore's presidential aspirations,
it would not help Clinton accomplish her immediate task, which is
to forge an identity separate from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I don't see any need for that,'' said one of
Mrs. Clinton's senior advisers. ``She still has to establish who
she is.''
</P>
<P>
   The wariness on both sides reflects a relationship that is
inherently, and perhaps inevitably, strained. If Gore and Mrs.
Clinton are both reminders of what voters, particularly in New
York, found admirable about President Clinton, they are also
symbols of some the more difficult moments in this White House,
whether it was the investigation into Mrs. Clinton's involvement
with Whitewater or Gore's zealous fund raising. Some Democrats
suggest that the sight of these two candidates together, too often,
can only invite reprises of some of these incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's presence at Mrs. Clinton's side may complicate her effort
to cut her association with the White House and to present herself
as a distinct New Yorker, if a recent one. Conversely, Mrs.
Clinton's presence may complicate Gore's effort in a general
election, should he become his party's nominee, to win the support
of New Yorkers, among them Orthodox Jews and some women. Those two
groups are deeply distrustful of Mrs. Clinton, both campaigns have
found. And if Gore won the New York primary, he most assuredly
would be going after voters who were firmly in the camp of
Clinton's likely Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, an
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also needs to be mindful that he is running in other states
outside New York. Television images of the vice president
campaigning with Mrs. Clinton in New York could be just what the
Republicans ordered in a dozen contested states this November.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, though, there is a relationship of mutual
dependency between these two Democrats. In different ways, and to
different degrees, each needs the other to ensure that they have a
career in politics after Bill Clinton leaves the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are both heirs to the same president and he's a president
who won New York state by huge margins, twice,'' said Phil
Friedman, a political strategist. ``For either of them to try to
deny their affiliation with the president _ or their affiliation or
affinity with each other _ would be a mistake.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is in Gore's immediate interest, his advisers have concluded,
to have Mrs. Clinton campaign with him in New York before the
primary. Whatever problems Mrs. Clinton might have with the general
electorate, polling by both sides suggests that she is
extraordinarily popular among kind of Democrats who vote in
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The tables seem likely to turn after March 7, assuming that Gore
wins the Democratic nomination. Advisers to both campaigns believe
that Mrs. Clinton will need a strong showing by Gore in New York to
help pull her across the finish line. In this view, Gore will need
to do for Mrs. Clinton what Lyndon B. Johnson did for another
newcomer to New York politics, Robert F. Kennedy, in 1964 when
Johnson's landslide victory lifted Kennedy to a narrow win as
senator from New York.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the competition and relationship between Mrs.
Clinton and Gore is less prickly than it might have been. There is
a history of competition between them, said one administration
official. The two were known for squabbling over which one of them
would get to fill in for President Clinton at high-profile events.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when some Democrats thought that Mrs. Clinton
would come under pressure to campaign for Gore and against former
Sen. Bill Bradley, his Democratic opponent, at the risk of
alienating Bradley's supporters. However, Gore's advisers have
become increasingly confident of victory in New York, and thus have
been able to avoid inveighing on Mrs. Clinton in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   In this low-pressure environment, aides to both Gore and Mrs.
Clinton went to some lengths Wednesday night to say that the two
campaigns were prepared to cooperate in the months ahead for a
Democratic victory. To this end, they noted that both candidates
had picked the same building to locate their state headquarters, a
high-rise across from Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But not the same space. Gore's headquarters can be found on the
fifth floor. For Clinton, push eight.

DOW JONES FALLS; NASDAQ RISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology stocks stood their ground Wednesday but
the rest of the market declined as investors awaited January
inflation figures and Alan Greenspan's assessment of the economy
with its implications for Federal Reserve monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of broad gains, the split between high-tech and
so-called old-economy stocks re-emerged. The Dow Jones industrial
average lost 156.68 points, or 1.46 percent, to 10,561.41, while
the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 6.88 points, to
4,427.65. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 14.38 points,
or 1.03 percent, to 1,387.67.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip Dow has lost 8.14 percent so far this year and is
9.91 percent below its Jan. 14 peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's clearly a notion that the Fed eventually will be
successful in slowing the economy, but it's a question of at what
cost,'' said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment strategist at State
Street Global Advisors. For companies sensitive to the business
cycle, he added, ``the market seems to be discounting almost
recession-like conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most prominent casualties was Wal-Mart, which slumped
5 1/4, to 52 3/4, as investors further digested company warnings
that recent sparkling results, announced Tuesday, would be hard to
beat. It did not help that Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch reported
disappointing holiday sales, sending that stock down 4 1/4, to 15
1/4, a two-year low.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retail stocks have totally rolled over,'' said Marion
Schultheis, a portfolio manager at J&AMP;W Seligman. Intimate Brands
slumped 3 7/16, to 31 1/16, and Limited 2 11/16, to 31 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot fell 3, to 56 3/4, seeming to also suffer from fears
of how high the Fed might have to push interest rates to cool off
an overheated economy. A report of surprisingly strong housing
starts Wednesday added to such concern.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks took a pounding, with American Express off 5
9/32, to 153 27/32, and Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and J.P.
Morgan all losing more than 3.
</P>
<P>
   But technology largely withstood the decline, with
Hewlett-Packard the best-performing Dow stock, rising 3 15/16, to
129 1/16, as investors anticipated its earnings report after the
close. The stock subsequently climbed to 131 as investors appeared
to focus more on rising revenue than on slipping profits.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology was especially strong, spurred partly by Human
Genome Sciences, up 33 1/4, to 188, which patented a gene that
could help create drugs to treat AIDS. Amgen climbed 4 13/16, to 69
7/8; Hyseq 8 1/8 to 99; and Targeted Genetics 7 3/16, to 19 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Secondary technology stocks were a big factor in the rise of the
small-cap Russell 2000 to a record 547.76, ahead 1.39 percent for
the day and 8.52 percent for the year.

   ``The Big Picture: Who Killed Hollywood? &AMP; Other Essays'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By William Goldman &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Essays/memoir &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Applause, $23.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a screenwriter, William Goldman is one of the best in the
business. Films such as ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, All
the President's Men, The Princess Bride'' and ``Misery'' are just a
few of the gems on his screenwriting resume.
</P>
<P>
   As an essayist, William Goldman is, well, one of the best
screenwriters in the business. His new collection, ``The Big
Picture,'' an assortment of pieces published in ``Premiere, The
Daily News, New York'' and ``Los Angeles Magazine,'' is engaging
for film fans who might enjoy snickering at after-the-fact Oscar
predictions or studio chiefs' picks for several summers'
``sure-fire'' hits. But for anyone looking for a little historical
perspective on the business of making movies, ``The Big Picture''
has about as much depth as the collected works of Jim Mullen's Hot
Sheet from ``Entertainment Weekly.''
</P>
<P>
   On their own, these essays may have been amusing to read while
flipping through the pages of ``Premiere,'' but Goldman's
frequently updated list of the biggest stars in the world, his
blockbuster forecasts for summer and Christmas, his pleas for
tolerance for the increasingly annoying Academy Awards ceremony
each year, seem not only outdated and irrelevant, but also
naggingly short on insight.
</P>
<P>
   This is the guy who wrote things such as ``Marathon Man, The
Great Waldo Pepper'' and ``The Stepford Wives.'' We should expect a
little more depth than a bunch of off-the-record quotes from
unnamed studio executives. Worst of all, when sandwiched
back-to-back, the pieces aren't only uninteresting, they're
redundant, with Goldman recycling some of the same ideas and even
the same phrases to remake his points.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed listening to studio honchos talk
about how ``The Last Action Hero'' (which is a less-than-stellar
item on the Goldman resume) was gonna stomp ``Jurassic Park,'' but
that smirk subsides after a few pages of nothing but more of the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's at his most interesting when he strays from the
formula of the annual offerings he's obviously been contracted to
write. His fond remembrance after the death of Andre the Giant was
nice, recounting stories about working with the professional
wrestler on ``The Princess Bride,'' but it barely fills three
pages. The rest of this 280-plus-page volume amounts to little more
than a glorified collection of lists.
</P>
<P>
   If I want to read lists, I'll hold out for the next collection
of ``Letterman'' Top 10s.

RUDD THINKING TITLE WITH NEW TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Ricky Rudd's priorities have changed.
</P>
<P>
   The past six years were about survival. This year is about
winning.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd lost his sponsor and sold his 6-year-old race team after
last season, giving up his independence as one of the few remaining
owner-drivers in NASCAR Winston Cup racing. But in return, Rudd
gained an opportunity for his first points championship when he
joined Robert Yates Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just spent the past three or four years with a sponsor that
wasn't big enough to do the job right,'' Rudd, 43, said. ``I didn't
want to go down that road again. I finally had to ask myself what I
really wanted out of this. The answers were I knew my career was
winding down. I don't have 20 years left in the sport. I don't have
time to build a championship team for myself. I think it would take
probably longer than I've got.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've set a three-year plan, and frankly, I don't know if that
could have been built in time if I had the support. I know we could
make vast improvements, but I don't know if we could actually
challenge for the championship. So then you've got Robert's team
sitting here that really all the key ingredients are here. The
chemistry just has to come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing Tide, the sponsor of his No. 10 team, to new Winston Cup
team owner Cal Wells might have been the best thing to happen to
Rudd. Instead of worrying about the bottom line, Rudd now is
focused on the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd had a chance to win Sunday's Bud Shootout before a last-lap
crash sent him sliding down the front straightaway on his roof,
and, having posted the second-fastest qualifying time, he will
start the Daytona 500 outside of teammate Dale Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can promise you one thing,'' said Tony Stewart, driver of
the No. 20 Home Depot Pontiac, ``Ricky Rudd hasn't forgotten how to
drive a race car. I'm sure they'll do real well this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year marked the first time since 1982 that Rudd failed to
win a race, but he has not lost his way to Victory Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd's 20 victories in 661 Winston Cup starts won over Yates,
who hired Rudd to replace Kenny Irwin after Irwin's two winless
seasons in the No. 28 Ford. Now, Rudd has one of the best engine
programs in the business behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky Rudd wins races,'' Yates said. ``He's been a really good
competitor. If we give him good equipment, I don't see why we can't
be in the chase for wins and championships. If the car doesn't run
good, all fingers will be pointed at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates is counting on becoming the next Rick Hendrick, who has
won four of the past five points championships with drivers Terry
Labonte and Jeff Gordon. Rudd wants to follow Jarrett, who last
season, at the age of 42, won his first championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tools, the people and everything is in place,'' said Rudd,
who finished a career-best second in the points in 1991 while
driving for Hendrick. ``Will it jell quick enough? There are no
guarantees in this business. But I can't think anything we're
lacking other than some time for it to come together.'' nn

   ``The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret
History of the KGB' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   $32.50 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sword and the Shield'' is an important book. It also is a
difficult book to read, and difficult to recommend (though, since
it has made some bestseller lists, sales indicate that no
recommendation is needed). The problem is in the way authors
Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin included a confusing welter
of acronyms, thus making the reader's job a tough one.
</P>
<P>
   And that is a real shame. The book is taken from extensive, very
secret files of the Soviet intelligence-slash-security agencies
that evolved from the Cheka of Lenin's day through OGPU, NKVD and
MVD to the more recent KGB. Mitrokhin, a KGB officer, stealthily
stole these files over several years. They provide valuable insight
into the Soviet intelligence community, Soviet leaders, Western
intelligence shortcomings and successes, and the reasons for the
eventual collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   A constant thread is the inability of a succession of Soviet top
bosses, from Stalin through Gorbachev, to understand the West, and
thus to draw proper conclusions from the intelligence being
gathered by their agents. As the authors say of the early World War
II period, ``Stalin's understanding of British policy was so
distorted by conspiracy theory that no amount of good intelligence
was likely to enlighten him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev, in the mid-1980s, was ``the first postwar Soviet
leader who gained access to moderately accurate statistics on the
performance of the Soviet economy.'' What followed, when Gorbachev
finally learned the truth about his nation's no-growth economy, is
history.
</P>
<P>
   Other important insight is gained into the role of Pope John
Paul II in the downfall of communism and into the success the
Soviets had in penetrating U.S. defense industries during the Cold
War (much more so than in penetrating U.S. government), and the
ways in which Sen. Joe McCarthy inadvertently ``helped'' Soviet
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Valuable and comprehensive as it is, ``The Sword and the
Shield'' surely would profit from fewer code names (does the reader
really care that the NKVD's man in Marshal Tito's camp was
code-named VAZHDUH, or that British traitor Anthony Burgess was
called MADCHEN?). Putting all agents' code names, plus the names of
agencies and operations, in all-capital acronyms makes for hard
going. It is almost as though the authors wanted to write their
book in code.

ARBITRATION HEARING PROBABLE AS RANGERS, STEVENS FAR APART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ With negotiations non-existent, the Rangers
are headed to an arbitration hearing with designated hitter Lee
Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Barring an unexpected settlement, the two sides will convene in
front of a three-man arbitration panel at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow in
Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a word spoken between us,'' said Alan Nero,
Stevens' agent. ``At this point I don't think there will be any
negotiating.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who made $2.1 million last season, is asking for $4.7
million. The Rangers are offering $3.5 million. Rangers general
manager Doug Melvin said the difference is so significant that it's
difficult to come up with a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of the process,'' Melvin said. ``We'll just go
down there and present our case and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who played most of the season at first base because of
Rafael Palmeiro's knee injury, hit .282 last year with a
career-high 24 home runs and 81 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers usually avoid arbitration hearings because of the
hard feelings they can generate. Melvin has had one since he became
general manager in 1994, with catcher Ivan Rodriguez in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business,'' Nero said. ``Doug has to do what he thinks
is best for the club, and I have to do what's best for Lee Stevens.
There are no hard feelings; when it's over we'll go about our
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Frank Casey will present the case for the Rangers while
Barry Meister, who works with Nero, will present Steven's case. The
panel must pick one of the two figures submitted. Melvin and
Stevens are both expected to be at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   There were 158 players eligible for arbitration but most settled
without a hearing. There have been seven hearings so far with the
players winning four. There are five cases still to be heard,
including Stevens'. nn

   ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday: 7 p.m., the Fox network &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The publicist nearly yells into her cell phone. ``I am not
supposed to talk to the press. I am only a publicist.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind her, strains of the Wedding March loudly start and stop,
start and stop. It's rehearsal day for the Fox network special
``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, a lot of women want to form a lifetime bond with a
multimillionaire they know nothing about. ``Thousands'' of women
applied to be on the special, which airs at 7 p.m. Tuesday on the
Fox network. Only 50 women were selected, creating a flurry of
prenuptial agreements that Fox's legal counsel required them all to
sign. The publicist, still yelling on a cell phone over wedding
music, will not discuss the terms of the prenuptials.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the wacky 21st-century version of arranged marriage.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-hour prime-time TV special, a rich man will select
one of the 50 women, then legally marry her on the air. The basis
for the marriage is wealth, looks, a male-controlled relationship
and a superficial knowledge of each other's lives. What could go
wrong?
</P>
<P>
   The brides-elect were selected using criteria set by the
potential groom, says the publicity person who publicizes shows
without using her name. The criteria are a closely kept secret at
Fox. The groom was selected from what the stealth-publicity person
said were 100 ``real-life'' multimillionaires who just hadn't been
able to find the right woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just really ready to make a commitment. He's fed up with
conventional methods of dating,'' the publicity person says.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional methods of dating work well for lots of folks.
What's the matter with this rich guy? The publicist won't say. She
says only that his identity is to remain a secret, even to the
contestants, at least until partway through the show.
</P>
<P>
   The publicist says the show will be run like a ``personality
pageant,'' which most of us know as beauty pageants. The women will
select their own wardrobes and apply their own makeup, so the groom
will have a better chance of learning something about them, the
publicist says.
</P>
<P>
   The groom will have a chance to ask the women questions and talk
to their friends and relatives. It's a little like ``The Dating
Game,'' only with more serious consequences. Gradually, through
elimination rounds, the field will be narrowed to five women, one
of whom he will pick as a supposedly lifetime mate.
</P>
<P>
   The women who will participate are not the same ones you may
have seen on TV promotions for the special, the publicist says.
Those supermodel-looking women on the promotions were models. Fox
didn't want to use the real potential brides in the ads because it
didn't want to influence the potential groom. After all, he might
have started choosing early during commercial breaks in ``The
X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   The groom will be required to sign a prenuptial agreement to
protect his bride from him, should he try to take her financial
assets, the publicity person says. Although, if a woman had
financial assets equal to his, why would she humiliate herself this
way? Why would she go off on her honeymoon feeling like a
refrigerator or something else he won on ``The Price Is Right?''
</P>
<P>
   The publicist says the women are saying it just sounds like a
``fun and crazy'' thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they scared?'' this reporter yells back to the publicist
through the static in the airwaves between Fort Worth and Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she says. ``I don't think it's really sunk in for them
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   All this is not as bad as it sounds, the Fox person says. The
groom will get to ask direct questions of the women. And he'll
still get to rely on ``love at first sight.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like an organized bar pickup, broadcast nationwide,
with commercials. But we shouldn't bother being too horrified by
all of this, a Fort Worth marriage counselor says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's indicative of anything in our culture but
media hype, with some women being victimized in the process,'' says
Douglas Weiss, of Heart to Heart Counseling Centers in Fort Worth.
``It doesn't reflect anything about the state of marriage. It only
shows there are 50 women desperate enough to believe that marrying
someone with money is better than marrying someone without.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' is planned as a
one-time-only event, thank goodness. OK, I'll watch, just to see if
any ideas about the gravity of their situation sinks in for these
women. Do they know the price of everything and the value of
nothing? Quietly, I'll be rooting for the selected bride to turn
him down. If not, I'll wait for the sequel, ``Who Wants to Divorce
a Multi-Millionaire?''

ENERGY CHIEF ADMITS US SURPRISED BY OIL-PRICE CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ US Energy Secretary Bill Richardson released funds
Tuesday to help low-income households pay fuel bills and called for
more homes to be heated with natural gas, steps he hopes will make
up for lost time after the Clinton administration was ``caught
napping'' as heating oil prices skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   The near tripling of heating oil prices in the Northeast this
month has made energy a hot political issue in New England, even
though prices had remained relatively low for a decade. The
governors of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, four members of
Congress, and nearly 300 observers came to Boston's Fanueil Hall
Tuesday for a summit meeting on how to prevent future oil-price
shocks.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson conceded that his agency had failed to predict the
oil-price hikes _ one of the steepest fuel price rises in the
United States since 1970. This slowed the government's response, he
said, as thousands of consumer complaints poured in, and energy
programs for low-income New England residents were overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   The root cause of the crisis is the rising cost of oil imported
from countries that belong to OPEC, said Richardson. He said he
would go to the Middle East next week to persuade major oil
exporters to increase the oil supply to the United States, thus
lowering the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the message. We were unprepared, but we have a
plan,'' said Richardson at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's promise to undertake ``energy diplomacy,'' coupled
with President Clinton's release of $125 million in low- income
energy assistance at an afternoon press conference, drew praise
from New England officials, including Sen. John Kerry (D-MA), who
had pushed for more energy aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're on the right track,'' said Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   However, consumer advocates such as Joseph P. Kennedy II,
president of Citizens Energy Corporation, wanted tougher actions,
including more regulation of the heating oil industry. He said oil
wholesalers should be required to keep a reserve oil supply to
prevent fuel shortages in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can blame OPEC. We can blame conspiracies . . . We can
blame whoever you want, but, at the end of the day, if you don't
have oil in the tanks in Massachusetts . . . when it gets cold, the
price is going to go up,'' declared Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Energy analysts warned that the heating oil fight may foreshadow
energy debates to come as world oil prices rise from their historic
lows of the 1990s. The combination of growing oil demand in a
booming world economy and a strengthened OPEC spells trouble for
the US, which imports half its oil.
</P>
<P>
   New England is uniquely sensitive to the price of heating oil,
which this week slid back to $1.56 a gallon from a high of more
than $2.
</P>
<P>
   Three quarters of all US heating oil is consumed on the eastern
seaboard from Maine to Virginia, while the rest of the nation heats
mainly with gas. Because of the colder New England weather and the
older, more drafty buildings, oil customers in New England may be
the most vulnerable to price hikes of all, because they use so much
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three hours, Richardson got an earful on the damage
from the price increase that began during a mid-January cold snap,
forcing Massachusetts residents to pay at least $150 million extra
for heating oil. In addition to tales of poor and elderly people
struggling to make ends meet, 40 truckers attended the summit to
protest a rise in the price of diesel fuel, which is similar to
heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci said the oil crisis could have
been even worse, noting that New England had only a two weeks'
supply of oil left in the region on Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had had a blizzard followed by a cold snap, we would not
have had enough oil to keep all consumers warm,'' he said. ``This
margin of safety is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to ensure that what happened this winter in New
England never happens again,'' added New Hampshire Governor Jeanne
Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Energy Information Administration, which
provides energy forecasts at the Department of Energy, warned in
December that heating oil reserves were ``skating on thin ice''
because they were unusually low for the start of the heating
season.
</P>
<P>
   However, critics say the Clinton Administration made few
preparations to cope in the event of an unexpectedly cold winter.
As Northeastern politicians demanded action, the White House
considered, and then shelved, a proposal to release oil from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, intended for national emergencies, to
boost the supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of bold, decisive action from the White House, we have
heard a deafening silence in terms of serious actions which would
protect the people of the Northeast,'' said US Rep. Bernard Sanders
(I-Vt.), who wants a federal heating oil reserve to be set up in
New York Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, however, Richardson and Clinton unveiled a series of
steps intended to ease the crisis now, and to prevent a repeat in
the future:
</P>
<P>
   -- Clinton released the low-income heating assistance money,
including $13.1 million for Massachusetts and $19.2 million for the
rest of New England.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Department of Energy will report to Clinton in 60 days on
ways to reduce New England's reliance on heating oil, with a
special emphasis on improving access to natural gas supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If gas pipelines are needed, we are prepared to go to Congress
and work for them,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Transportation Department will relax regulations that
limit the number of oil deliveries trucks can make as part of a
three-year experiment.
</P>
<P>
   -- Richardson will meet with energy ministers in Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Mexico and Norway to emphasize the need for more oil
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reminding our energy trading partners that our
relationship goes both ways,'' said Richardson. ``High oil prices
are bad for everyone . . . What we need is price stability.''
</P>
<P>
   But several speakers at Tuesday's summit told the audience that
the fundamental problem is this country's inability to reduce oil
imports. Despite three recessions since 1973 triggered by rising
imported oil prices, import levels have actually risen in recent
years, fueled in part by consumer demand for high-energy using
motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Oil industry officials at the summit called for an increase in
American oil production to reduce the imports. That would mean
allowing oil explorers into areas now closed for environmental
reasons or easing environmental regulations that have forced some
refineries to close down altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those refineries were still in operation, we wouldn't be
here today,'' said John Felmy, chief economist for the American
Petroleum Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Kerry countered that it would be better to increase
use of renewable energies, such as wind power and solar power,
while increasing energy conservation measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been on a remarkably indulgent and in some ways lucky
ride over the past few years,'' Kerry said. ``This in some ways is
a useful wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   Massood Samii, OPEC's former senior economist and now a business
professor at New Hampshire College, said Americans need a wake-up
call because oil-price increases aren't going away. He said
Richardson might well succeed in convincing OPEC to increase
supplies this summer, but, by fall, world economic growth will have
more than offset the gain, causing further price hikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This problem is going to be with us for some time,'' said
Samii, who worked for OPEC from 1979 to 1987.

 &HT;    Group blames Bush for making quality of life worse for Texas
children
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, who has dubbed himself the
``compassionate conservative'' on the presidential campaign trail,
has done little to improve the health and welfare of poor children
in his home state, said officials of the Texas Freedom Network.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush official disputed the charge by the group, which opposed
vouchers in public schools and social conservative candidates in
State Board of Education elections.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Texas Freedom Network, moving into new
political terrain, took aim at Bush, blaming him for the state's
slip in a national ranking as the best place to raise a child. In
1999, Texas ranked next to last _ 48th _ for the best place to
raise a child in the United States. That is down from 29th in 1995,
the year Bush took office. The ranking was done by the Children's
Rights Council in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``When children in the rest of the country have seen their lives
improve, Texas kids have become poorer, hungrier, more likely to
become parents, more likely to die of gun violence and less likely
to have health insurance,'' said Samantha Smoot, executive director
of the Texas Freedom Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``How dare he (Bush) speak of closing the gap of hope for
American's families when he's closed the door of hope for so many
Texas children?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan disputed the charge, citing Texas
schoolchildren's progress on achievement tests and the
Legislature's passage of a health insurance program aimed at
providing coverage for children of the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is a reformer with a record of closing the
opportunity gap by improving public schools so every child can
learn and succeed and moving families from welfare to work and
reaching out to faith-based groups to help those in need, and
lowering taxes for working families,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Texas Freedom Network has focused on halting
social conservatives' reach into Texas public schools. Smoot said
the nonpartisan group will reposition itself as a family-issues
organization, pursuing legislation to improve children's health and
welfare in the 2001 legislative session. The group was formed in
1994 by Cecile Richards, daughter of former Texas Democratic Gov.
Ann Richards.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rising test scores for minority and low-income students,
Smoot said conditions for poor children in Texas are worsening. She
cited statistics from the group's newly-released report which show:
</P>
<P>
   _ One in four Texas children lives in poverty; nationwide, one
in 5 children lives in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 1.4 million Texas children _ a higher number than any
other state _ are uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor George W. Bush seems remarkably unaware of how Texans
actually live,'' Smoot said. ``Bush sees a packed emergency room
and thinks that means that the one in four Texas children without
health insurance must be getting basic medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said Bush worked with legislators in 1999 to pass the
Children's Health Insurance Program, aimed at insuring more
children of the working poor. ``By 2001, an additional 423,000
(children) will be insured,'' McClellan said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton pledged even more money for
Northeasterners grappling with the soaring cost of home heating oil
Wednesday, even while he acknowledged that federal heating
assistance funds may not be adequate to help low-income families
endure the winter.
</P>
<P>
   In his first news conference of the year, Clinton touched on the
political campaigns of his wife and his vice president, and left
the door open to a visit to Pakistan next month. But he focused
much of his attention on the spike in heating oil prices, saying he
would order that the remaining $125 million in a Low Income Home
Energy Assistance Program be made immediately available _ on top of
$200 million already released _ and would seek from Congress $600
million in additional emergency funds for states hardest hit by the
cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last seven years, we've stood to help the victims of
earthquakes in California, of the farm crisis and a 500-year flood
in the Middle West,'' Clinton said. ``Now the families in the
Northeast need our help, too, and we must act.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the funding increases, Clinton also called on the
states to liberalize the income limits so that more families could
receive the federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped short of ordering any release of oil from the
government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, even though a growing
chorus of officials in the Northeast have urged that the oil be put
on the market to depress prices. But the president said he had not
ruled out tapping into the emergency reserve later.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with consumer groups and industry leaders in Boston
on Wednesday, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson admitted that the
federal government was caught by surprise by the rise in oil
prices. ``It is obvious that the federal government was not
prepared. We were caught napping,'' he said. ``We got complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton fielded 20 questions over the course of an hour,
insisting that he did not want to involve himself in either the
presidential race or his wife's run for senator from New York. But
he could not help himself.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how it felt to be used as a rhetorical punching bag by
Republican presidential candidates, Clinton said he wasn't
surprised that the Republicans were eager to attack him personally.
``They can't run against the longest economic expansion in history,
or the lowest crime rate in 30 years, or the lowest welfare roles
in 30 years,'' he said, ticking off his familiar litany of rosy
statistics and expressing ``sympathy'' for the position they find
themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, Clinton held out the possibility that he
would extend a trip to India and Bangladesh next month to include a
stop in Pakistan _ a move that would put him at the center of one
of the tensest nuclear standoffs in the world today. Originally
Clinton had hoped to visit both India and Pakistan, but the
military coup in Islamabad led to the conclusion that he could not
appear to be giving legitimacy to military leaders who overthrew a
democratically elected government.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, the administration has been telling the
Pakistanis that if they want Clinton to visit _ a trip the Secret
Service has insisted ought to last only a few hours _ they must
announce a timetable for a return to democratic elections and some
steps toward curbing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will make a decision about whether to go based on what I
think will best serve the long-term interests in nonproliferation
and trying to stop, particularly, a nuclear arms race,'' Clinton
said Wednesday. ``The very real danger that a conflict between
India and Pakistan not contained is one of the most significant
security threats to the interest of the United States in this new
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the United States would step in to act as a
mediator in the long-running India-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir,
but only if both countries asked. ``Unless we are asked by both
parties to help, we can't get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also pressed Congress to move quickly on granting China
permanent trading status with the United States, under the deal
struck late last year to permit China into the World Trade
Organization. For the past two decades Congress has extended that
trading status year-by-year, and used the run-up to those votes to
highlight Chinese human rights violations, trade barriers to
American goods and military threats to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate has become an empty one: Each year Congress has
relented to overwhelming pressure from American businesses, which
say they would lose billions if the trade status was not extended.
Under the WTO rules, Congress would no longer have a choice: It
could not keep China on a year-by-year string, constantly
threatening to yank its trading privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried Wednesday, as he has in private meetings this week
with members of Congress, to make a broader case. ``This is a huge
national security issue,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trade agreement offers no increased access to the
American markets by China, but gives us dramatically increased
access to their markets. Moreover, it means we can get access to
their markets without having to transfer technology or agree to do
manufacturing in their country.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, American officials say they expect that, as a
practical matter, China will continue to get technology and more
American manufacturing presence.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that China's entry into the trade group would force
the country to accept the rule of law, and not only in commercial
disputes. ``They are far more likely to be constructive members of
the international community if they get into the WTO and they make
these changes than if they don't,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   On the domestic front, Clinton reiterated his call for
congressional action on gun control legislation this year and said
he saw no reason for the federal government to follow the state of
Illinois in calling a temporary halt to executions. Gov. George
Ryan of Illinois took that action after 13 inmates on death row
were exonerated over two decades.
</P>
<P>
   By providing more heating oil money, Clinton sought to dampen
the growing calls for more expansive action. Those pushing for a
release of some of the country's oil reserves include members of
both parties, including Hillary Rodham Clinton's rival in the New
York Senate race, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has been airing
television ads on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the president's announcement, Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized Clinton's action as not going far
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will help the 1 million New Yorkers who benefit from this
program,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that dispensing more money from the oil fund ``will
not provide long-term relief for the price hikes that we are seeing
in heating oil bills and will soon see at the gas pump.''

BAY STATE ATTEMPTS TO EASE SEC BOND INQUIRY CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL REZENDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Cellucci administration downplayed the significance
Tuesday of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a
December bond prospectus that made no mention of a $1.4 billion
cost overrun for the Big Dig highway project, maintaining that
officials adequately disclosed information about state finances.
</P>
<P>
   But bond buyers and others familiar with the SEC say the probe
comes at a time when the agency is making a special effort to crack
down on state and local officials and underwriters who violate
disclosure requirements in the offering statements for sales of
municipal bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Maco, director of the SEC's Office of Municipal Securities,
declined to acknowledge the existence of the Massachusetts probe.
But he said the agency has taken action 95 times in the last six
years in municipal bond sales and that most of the cases involved
lapses in disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Commission has concentrated its resources in the municipal
market over the last six years emphasizing the disclosure
obligations of all parties involved in municipal security
offerings,'' Maco said.
</P>
<P>
   And SEC chairman Arthur Levitt, in a speech to municipal bond
officials last fall, said, ``The message to investors and the
municipal market should be clear _ our Enforcement Division is now
a permanent part of the municipal landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Administration and Finance Secrtary Andew S. Natsios
said said that while the SEC has jurisdiction over underwiters and
bond lawyers, ``they don't have any jurisdiction over state
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   But the agency has routinely moved against public officials in
cases where they did not fully disclose the financial condition of
their governments, including officials of Orange County,
California, which declared bankruptcy in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   That case prompted the SEC to increase its focus on disclosure
in the municipal bond market and led the the creation of its Office
of Municipal Securities. Since then, SEC officials have launched
disclosure inquiries in Washington, D.C., Syracuse, and Denver,
among other jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   Maco said the SEC has civil, not criminal, authority over
government officials and bond sellers, and typically issues a
``cease and desist'' order when it finds that public officials or
bond underwriters are untruthful in their offering statements or
fail to fully disclose financial information.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency has also refered criminal matters to the US
Department of Justice. And some SEC inquiries appear to have paved
the way for lawsuits filed by filed by private investors against
goverment entities and their bond underwriters who failed to fully
disclose their financial condition.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in 1997 brokerage houses that sold more than $3
billion in bonds to build Denver International Airport agreed to an
out-of-court financial settlement to a lawsuit brought by private
investors who claimed they were defrauded by officials who
allegedly failed to fully disclose information about revenue
projections and construction delays.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ladd, undersecretary of Administration and Finance, said
Tuesday that no lawsuits have been filed by investors in the wake
of a $200 million December municipal bond offering for the MBTA
that made no mention of Big Dig cost overruns in a description of
Massachusetts finances.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a prospectus, or offering statement, for a $500
million issue of general obligation municipal bonds this month
provides a detailed explanation of the projected $1.4 billion
overrun on the $12.2 billion Central Artery/Ted Williams Tunnel
Project.
</P>
<P>
   Although the SEC has neither confirmed nor denied that a
Massachusetts inquiry is underway, sources say the probe was
prompted after state officials including Massachusetts Turnpike
Authority Chairman James J. Kerasiotes said they had information
about a potential cost overrun as early as October.
</P>
<P>
   And while Cellucci administration officials are attempting to
discount the SEC probe, State Treasurer Shannon O'Brien said her
office has a different view.
</P>
<P>
   Said O'Brien spokesman Dwight Robson: ``The treasurer takes any
inquiry from the federal government seriously.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone
interviews conducted Saturday through Monday with 1,225 adults
throughout the United States. Of these, 979 said they were
registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected
by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active
residential exchanges across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a
complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed
and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was
designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to take account of household size
and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for
variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race,
age and education.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such
samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in
either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out
all American adults.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller sub-groups the margin of sampling error is larger.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error into the poll. Variations in the wording and order of
questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

COMMENTARY: POLITICAL `GOD'S WORLD' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Picking up an armload of mail early this week, I
noticed an unfamiliar magazine in my box.
</P>
<P>
   ``World'' was its title; full color, slick paper, 38 pages. On
the cover was a glowering, threatening, almost satanic John McCain.
The headline was ``The McCain Craze ... a campaign platform that
should give Republicans pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside was a hatchet job. On tax policy, the critic wrote, ``He
makes his case with liberal, even Marxist, terminology.'' On
campaign finance reform, ``McCain would essentially suspend the
First Amendment for 60 days prior to any federal election.'' On
Social Security, ``he goes beyond even Franklin D. Roosevelt.''
Unnamed detractors call him ``a calculating and conniving
politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Then World gets nastily personal. The writer notes how, 20 years
ago, ``the 43-year-old former POW quickly fell in love with the
25-year-old cheerleader. She was rich, attractive and well
connected.'' He won election ``despite charges of carpetbagging and
buying the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy McCain's family stock, we are told, ``pays her more than
$1 million in dividends, and she owns more than $1 million worth of
stock in Anheuser-Busch.'' McCain, charges the professedly
``God-centered'' magazine, ``has not attacked alcohol companies as
he has the tobacco industry'' because he is ``awash in beer
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more scandalous: ``Yet for all his dependence on his wife's
money, Mr. McCain doesn't appear to be a particularly attentive
husband.'' To get a barbiturate fix after an illness, Mrs. McCain
stole pain relievers: ``The offense was serious enough to merit
jail time,'' but she got off, and her husband ``claimed not to know
about Cindy's addiction ... '' With that sly ``claimed,'' the
writer implies that the senator did know, did not care, and is now
lying about it.
</P>
<P>
   The morally disapproving author of this repugnant anti-McCain
campaign document is Bob Jones IV, son of the present head of Bob
Jones University. That is the educational institution prohibiting
interracial dating that offered its facilities to George W. Bush to
launch his political campaign in South Carolina _ and pointedly did
not invite his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The Bob Jones connection is not the only tie that binds the Bush
campaign to this attack on a fellow Republican in contravention of
Ronald Reagan's ``Eleventh Commandment.'' The editor of World
magazine is Marvin Olasky, a professor of journalism at the
University of Texas in Austin. He is the revered intellectual guru
of Bush and an author of ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   This caused me to wonder: What caused this magazine, edited by a
Bush adviser who says he recuses himself, and with a Bob Jones
scion as its star reporter, and featuring the sinister portrayal of
McCain on its cover, to appear in my mailbox a few days before the
South Carolina primary?
</P>
<P>
   In tiny type is the source: God's World Publications Inc., of
Asheville, N.C. The marketing manager says that _ by sheer
coincidence _ somebody decided that this was the one issue that
would be sent gratis to all 535 members of Congress and 130 moving
and shaking members of the media in Washington, all of whom
apparently needed to get God's World's word at this moment about
McCain, that ``conniving politician'' and not ``particularly
attentive husband.''
</P>
<P>
   God's World, a not-for-profit organization with a turnover of
about $18 million a year, receives tax-deductible contributions
under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. According to
Joel Belz, the publisher: ``We cannot endorse candidates or
legislation. In 58 years, we have never backed any candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   As a card-carrying right-wing seditionist, I defend God's
World's right to excoriate any candidate, fairly or not.
</P>
<P>
   But when its editor is Bush's trusted Austin adviser; when its
reporter bears the name of the school being abused as a Bush tool
in the campaign; when its not-for-profit's funds are used to print,
illustrate and distribute a hatchet job on a political opponent to
a list of officials and media biggies on a primary election eve _
then such backdoor backing of candidate Bush strikes me as
religio-political sleaze in action.

OFFICER EXONERATED IN SHOOTING OF YOUNG MUGGING SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY AND TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. -- Ten months after the fatal shooting of an
unarmed 14-year-old African-American suspect by a white police
officer enflamed racial tensions in Hartford, the outside
prosecutor's investigation that was demanded by members of the
minority community came down squarely on the side of the officer.
</P>
<P>
   Guiding the public through the nine tense minutes that led up to
the shooting through the eyes of Officer Robert Allan, New London
State's attorney Kevin Kane said he found that Allan's act was that
of a police officer with a reasonable fear that Aquan Salmon was
about to shoot him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A boy has been killed, a young boy, who was unarmed. It's a
tragedy for the community. It's a tragedy because it has focused on
what the community perceives as a rift between it and the police
department,'' Kane said. He added, though, that ``it's not
symptomatic of anything except the danger that police officers and
citizens can find themselves in.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 200-page report has not laid to rest lingering anger
about Salmon's killing, which some here see as an echo to the
police shooting of Amadou Diallo -- another unarmed black man --
that occured weeks earlier in New York City. As Public Safety
Commissioner Henry Lee spoke about the likely trajectory of the
bullet that pierced the front and back of Salmon's quilted parka,
George Cruz, one of the community leaders who had pressed Governor
John Rowland to appoint the probe, stood up from his chair and
walked out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything they said is `most likely, possibly,' '' said Cruz,
director of the San Juan recreation center in downtown Hartford.
``I don't like those words. Maybe this thing should go to trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Kane's presentation aimed to put members of the public into
Allan's shoes at 2:01 a.m. on April 13, 1999, when Allan responded
to a report of robberies by four young black men driving a white
Cadillac. Slides recreated the vacant lot where the Cadillac came
to a halt and its four occupants scattered. The p.a. system
replayed Allan's voice as he called, ``Bailing, bailing,'' to
report that they had scattered into the dark and, 16 seconds later,
when he reported that he had heard gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   Allan didn't actually hear gunshots, because none of the four
young men had guns. The first young man Allan saw in the lot was
carrying a cigarette lighter fashioned to look like a pistol, and
when Allan spun around at the sound he mistook for a shot, he saw
Aquan Salmon coming around a tree at an angle that obscured his
right side. According to Allan's testimony, Salmon did not respond
to his order to freeze, kept running and reached across his body
from his beltline. From a distance of 10 feet, Allan shot the boy
through the back, the bullet puncturing both lungs and his heart
and exiting through the front of his chest, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Kane said Allan was justified in shooting Salmon according to a
section in Connecticut's General Statutes, which allow officers to
use deadly force to defend themselves against deadly force.
</P>
<P>
   ``A police officer doesn't have to wait to see a gun pointed
toward him or her or pointed even at him or her before the police
officer decides to shoot, otherwise you wouldn't have too many
police officers around,'' Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   After Kane made his remarks, Hartford's mayor, Mike Peters, said
he hoped the report would be part of the city's long healing
process. ``Nobody wins in a situation like this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But many in Hartford long ago formed their own opinions about
that night, and the long wait for Kane's results has not made them
any more receptive. During the week after the shooting, marchers
carried a silver coffin to the site where he was shot, and black
and Latino organizers cast the event as symptomatic of tensions in
a mostly non-white city whose police force is mostly white.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the straw that broke the camel's back,'' Cruz said.
``We have to get more minorities, as opposed to people from the
suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who lobbied most actively for action against Allan said
the Kane report contained little to sway them, and looked beyond
this investigation toward possible civil rights charges. Among them
is city councilwoman Elizabeth Horton Sheff, who called Tuesday for
the police officer's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get a real surprise,'' said Wadell Muhammed, one of
number of community leaders who protested after the shooting. ``But
we would have expected that at least he be indicted. We think the
evidence represented today was enough to dictate an indictment.''

 &HT;    New bishop `inspires hope' after scandal
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In a cramped confessional at St. Rita
Catholic Church, Bishop Anthony J. O'Connell gingerly lowers his
bulky frame into a chair, steadying his lower back with his right
hand on the way down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinched nerve,'' he says. ``Of course, I got it two days ago,
just before the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinched or not, a half-hour later, O'Connell is standing _
6-foot wooden shepherd's crook in hand, 2-foot white miter on head
_ in front of a packed sanctuary, dropping one-liners in his Irish
brogue to the delight of about 1,200 Sunday-morning worshipers.
</P>
<P>
   With the Wellington, Fla., congregation relaxed, O'Connell moves
to themes of forgiveness and redemption. His message is simple,
straightforward and, for a community trying to move past its
disappointment with the last bishop, resonant.
</P>
<P>
   A year after arriving from Nashville, Tenn., O'Connell, 61, has
tried to heal his diocese by concentrating on the future instead of
the past. He keeps himself so busy that he has spent little time
dwelling on Bishop Keith Symons' admission in 1998 that he had
sexual relations with several boys early in his career. O'Connell,
observers say, has tried to buoy the church on his shoulders and
propel it forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried not to live in the past,'' O'Connell said.
``There's no use to it. Still, I have tried to talk as openly about
reconciliation as I know how. In many cases, it's just listening to
someone. Overall, it has taken up very little focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite the fact that Symons led the diocese for eight
years and the two talk about once a month, O'Connell said he has
had fewer than five substantial conversations about his
predecessor's transgressions with either priests or parishioners.
(Symons has been leading spiritual retreats in Michigan since last
summer.)
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from Pope John Paul II, O'Connell has traveled
extensively to establish himself as a presence in both the church
and secular community. Though he lives next to his office, he drove
30,000 miles in the past 12 months, covering the five-county
diocese.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Sunday was a typical workday. O'Connell said Mass at
St. Rita, stayed another three hours for a party for a parish
priest celebrating 40 years in the clergy, and then drove to
Lantana to say Mass and celebrate the Vietnamese New Year at Holy
Spirit Catholic Church. He stayed until 9 at night, though a large
portion of the congregation doesn't speak English. Throughout the
day, he probably shook hands with 200 to 300 people. His face was
rarely without a smile.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell's stated goal is to show the 220,000 Catholics in his
diocese that if he can reach out, so must they. While many of the
wealthier churches could become isolated and insulated, O'Connell
insists it is the responsibility of the priests and parishioners to
help those in need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reaching out ... is of the essence,'' O'Connell says. ``To say
we don't need anybody else may be good for lots of things, but that
certainly isn't a church.'' And if the church gets down to the
business of being a church, healing and forgiveness will follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when Symons admitted to his past, it was quite a shock
to a lot of people,'' said Brian King, Symons' former secretary and
a seminarian set to be ordained this spring. ``But _ and I hate for
this to sound callous _ the church has to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When O'Connell came here, he was faced with a diocese that
wanted direction. People wanted someone to reassure them and tell
them everything was going to be all right. That's what (O'Connell)
has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauging the bishop's effectiveness or standing is tricky. The
church, like any organization, is a political institution. Still,
the positive seems to vastly outweigh the negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been like a breath of fresh air,'' said the Rev.
Alfredo Hernandez of St. Juliana Catholic Church in West Palm
Beach. ``He is a hopeful man, and he inspires hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind that hope is a faith in people and dislike for the
nitty-gritty of management. O'Connell has been praised as an
administrator who does not micromanage _ a frequent criticism of
his predecessor _ and as a man willing to walk his talk.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Juliana's 50th anniversary celebration in October,
Hernandez tells of watching O'Connell meet the congregation in the
churchyard. It was close to 90 degrees and humid, and O'Connell,
whose fair skin and beefy constitution are better suited for the
rolling hills of Ireland than the humid tropics of South Florida,
was sweating like a perforated water balloon. Still, he refused to
take off his vestments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew that people like to see their bishop looking like a
bishop,'' Hernandez said. ``He was out there in the heat with all
of his gear on, taking pictures, because he wanted to meet the
people where they were.''

COMMENTARY: DESTROYER OF LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dana Garner is a man who lies as easily as most
people breathe. But he is more than a compulsive destroyer of the
truth. Dispensing his lies like poison, he has become a menace to
the criminal justice system in Brooklyn, and a destroyer of lives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 I wrote a series of columns about a man named Jeffrey
Blake, who was serving a term of 36 years to life in prison for the
murder of two men in Brooklyn in 1990. Dana Garner said he had been
an eyewitness to the murders and testified against Blake. It turned
out that Garner had witnessed nothing and that it was physically
impossible for Blake to have committed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Garner had not even been in New York when the murders occurred.
Jeffrey Blake was innocent. He was freed from prison in 1998 after
spending eight years _ more than a quarter of his life _ behind
bars for a crime he didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   One week after the double murder that resulted in Jeffrey
Blake's imprisonment came another murder that Dana Garner said he
had witnessed. He testified in that case, too, saying he had just
happened to see the killing as he waited near a subway station for
his mother. Here's what the embarrassed office of Brooklyn District
Attorney Charles Hynes wrote in December 1998 about that claim:
``In substance, Dana Garner's mother denies her presence in the
area of the crimes on June 25, 1990, and she refutes several of
Dana Garner's reasons for her presence at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Garner lied. A man named Rubin Ortega is in
prison for that murder. Whether he is guilty or not, I can't tell
you. But I know about another case, and it's as bad as the Jeffrey
Blake saga.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday I interviewed a man named Timothy Crosby in the Lower
Manhattan office of his Legal Aid lawyer, Sara Bennett. He wore a
beige suit, a black shirt and, under the circumstances, a
remarkably even disposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first stop was the Downstate Correctional Facility,'' he
said. ``From there they sent me to the Elmira Correctional
Facility. I stayed there for a few years. From Elmira I went to
Green Haven, and then to Fishkill, and then Otisville. Otisville
was my last stop. I did practically 12 years. Just about 12
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 Dana Garner told the police that Crosby was one of a
group of men who had kidnapped and assaulted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There actually was a kidnapping,'' said Bennett. ``Garner
escaped and ran to a police station.''
</P>
<P>
   Four people were arrested, including Crosby, who was picked up
on a street in Brooklyn when Garner pointed him out to police.
</P>
<P>
   Now we learn, after so many years, that Garner, as usual, lied.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in an extraordinary ruling, State Supreme Court
Justice Lewis L. Douglass overturned Crosby's conviction and
ordered him released from prison. The ruling came after a hearing
in which Garner acknowledged that he was a liar, and his own
relatives testified, in effect, that he wouldn't recognize the
truth if he were drowning in it. Even his grandmother swore in an
affidavit that ``you never know when Dana's telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglass wrote: ``Dana Garner, the final witness at the hearing,
admitted that he had completely fabricated testimony for two murder
trials, identifying men as murderers even though he had not
witnessed the crimes. He admitted that he had fabricated testimony
in this case as well.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted in his ruling that in 1998 Justice Robert Kreindler had
reversed Jeffrey Blake's conviction after learning of Garner's
lies. Said Douglass: ``I similarly conclude that Dana Garner is a
completely unreliable witness and where, as here, there is no other
evidence connecting the defendant to the crime, I too grant the
motion to vacate judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office had planned to appeal Douglass'
ruling. But Wednesday when I asked why, a spokesman for Hynes said
the notice of appeal would be withdrawn. ``We are not going to
appeal,'' said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby is free now and looking for a job. His father died while
he was in prison, and he said he worried the whole time that his
mother might die before he was released. ``She's not sick or
anything,'' he said. ``But, you know, tomorrow's not promised to no
one.''

LAWMAKERS SAY `BIG DIG' COSTS DON'T HAVE TO MEAN TOLL HIKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The House is proposing its own plan to address the Big
Dig funding crisis without raising tolls on Massachusetts Turnpike
and harbor tunnel users next year.
</P>
<P>
   The House plan would pay for about half of the $1.4 billion
Central Artery cost overrun, enough to keep the project operating
through next year and give state officials more time to come up
with a long-term financial solution.
</P>
<P>
   Using driver's license fees, state borrowing of $600 million,
and a $200 cash contribution from turnpike reserves, the plan would
avoid the divisive toll hikes, House leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're attempting to do is discover the depth of this
problem and also areas of savings that the turnpike should be
required to identify,'' said Joseph C. Sullivan, House chairman of
the Joint Committee on Transportation. ``The need for an
accelerated toll may be eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Governor Paul Cellucci released his own blueprint
for bridging the Big Dig gap that relies on $1 billion in state
borrowing, with some of the loans extending 50 years. Cellucci also
called for raising turnpike and harbor tunnel tolls next January, a
year earlier than scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, a Braintree Democrat, said the House does not want to
saddle taxpayers with debt for a half century. He also said that
House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran ``has been very sensitive on the
issue of tolls. . . in terms of not having an adjustment until
2002. I think the House is inclined to keep that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, legislators from suburbs along the turnpike,
including House Majority Whip Barbara Gardner (D-Holliston), have
lobbied their House colleagues for relief from repeated toll
increases. Cellucci's plan would double tolls on the easternmost
extension of the turnpike to $1, and raise tunnel fees from $2 to
$3 for cars next January.
</P>
<P>
   The House plan would also give the Legislature more oversight on
spending for the project, expected to be completed in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The funding debate is likely to continue for weeks, leaving the
$12.2 billion project's financial crisis _ and the question of
whether there will be toll increases to cover it _ unresolved until
Cellucci and the Legislature can agree on a plan.
</P>
<P>
   The debate seems to be intensified by gubernatorial politics.
Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham has been aggressively laying
the groundwork to run for governor in 2002, and Finneran is seen as
a potential candidate too.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal could be voted on before the end of the month. The
Senate has yet to issue its own plan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that the state has some $4 billion in surplus
cash, Cellucci has been reluctant to tap those reserves.
Administration sources said they quietly pitched the idea of using
reserve funds but were told that rank-and-file lawmakers would not
accept the plan because they would rather use the surplus for pet
projects in their districts.
</P>
<P>
   Both Finneran and Birmingham accuse the governor of protecting
the surplus to fund an income tax rate cut. Cellucci wants to scale
back the income tax to 5 percent, which would cost over $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor appears to be motivated not by best fiscal
practices but a by a single-minded devotion to an overly aggressive
tax cut,'' said Birmingham spokeswoman Alison Franklin. ``In that
regard, the 50-year bonds are Exhibit A.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran also said he is skeptical of another component in
Cellucci's plan, which would partially liquidate a controversial
Big Dig insurance policy and generate $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the last alternative we have, I won't rule it out. .
. but the misgivings have been serious and substantial,'' Finneran
said.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran said it is difficult to devise a solution to the
shortfall when no one is certain the Big Dig's $1.4 billion gap is
the limit of skyrocketing project costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people with some experience and some insight will
probably express a preference just to go slow, not rush into
anything,'' Finneran said. ``But unfortunately what we seem to be
seeing from some quarters is just a quick response to try to throw
the hot potato elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were directed at Birmingham, who has threatened to
shut down state transportation funding until the governor presents
a more palatable solution to solve the Central Artery/Third Harbor
Tunnel financial problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not 2002 politics that is creeping up,'' Finneran
said of Birmingham, a possible gubernatorial rival in the next
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``That brings me back to the main point,'' Finneran added. ``I
don't want to just merely react, to score political points or act
like a demagogue. . . If they (the Senate) just want to turn off
the spigot, someone should explain that to the citizens, the
contractors, the unions, the laborers on that job.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A week after still-unidentified hackers paralyzed
several well-known commercial Internet companies, the country's
chief law enforcement and legal officers said Wednesday that
threats against computer networks have outstripped the government's
efforts to keep up with them.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before a Senate panel on Internet security, Attorney
General Janet Reno said last week's attacks on popular Web sites
illustrated the necessity of a coordinated law enforcement
strategy. ``How we deal with cyber-crime is one of the most
critical areas we face,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno proposed a five-year plan that would include tougher
penalties for hackers and standardized investigative technologies.
Such a step could lower the astronomical cost of security and
detection gear in an environment in which, she said, equipment is
obsolete almost as soon as its installed.
</P>
<P>
   Louis J. Freeh, the FBI director, told senators that the
investigation of last week's attacks was moving aggressively.
``There are fast-developing leads as we speak,'' Freeh said of the
search for those who barraged the computer systems of companies
like Yahoo, eBay and Amazon.com with meaningless data to clog the
paths of customers attempting to reach the sites.
</P>
<P>
   He said the investigation was being conducted in the United
States as well as in Germany and Canada. Scores of agents from FBI
offices in Atlanta, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle
are at work on the attacks, known within law enforcement circles as
``distributed denial of service'' cases.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, law enforcement officials have said they are
interviewing several people, including some computer hackers,
although they did not yet have evidence clearly indicating who was
responsible for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the seriousness of the problem, Freeh cited the
growing number of such cases, to 1,154 last year from 547 such
cases in 1998. The cases range from minor attacks by teen-age
vandals and disgruntled employees to highly sophisticated
intrusions possibly directed by foreign intelligence services, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said that in 1998, 399 cases were closed, in contrast to
to 1999, when 912 cases closed. Almost none of the cases resulted
in prosecutions. The FBI closes a case when the agency decides
there is no basis for further investigation. The cases do not
include other major categories of cyber-crime, like Internet fraud
or child pornography.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Freeh acknowledged the difficulties
computer cases pose for law enforcement. ``In short, even though we
have markedly improved our capabilities to fight cyber intrusions,
the problem is growing even faster and thus we are falling further
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer crime is one of the most dynamic problems the FBI
faces today,'' Freeh said. ``Just think about how many computers
you have owned and how many different software packages you have
learned over the past several years, and you can only begin to
appreciate the scope of the problem we are dealing with in the
fast-changing era,'' Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony by Reno and Freeh followed a White House meeting
convened Tuesday by President Clinton with technology experts and
Internet executives about how to improve the security of the
country's computer networks. Clinton adopted a reassuring tone,
saying the assaults were not an ``electronic Pearl Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry officials have said they want strong action
against computer criminals but fear that government intervention
and new criminal laws could unintentionally stifle the phenomenal
growth and creativity of the technology industries.

ELDREDGE SETS PLAN TO MAKE 2002 WINTER GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Todd Eldredge, who's been out of Olympic-level figure skating
for two seasons, said Tuesday he's coming back next week _ and
aiming for the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was mostly about the Olympics,'' said the 28-year-old from
Chatham, Mass., who'll make his reentry as a member of the US team
at the Four Continents championship in Osaka, Japan. ``I've never
skated the way I wanted to there. So that was really the motivating
factor.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1998 season, Eldredge went on what the International
Skating Union termed ``active rest.'' He did not defend his US
title last year and skated mostly pro-am events, exhibitions, and
tours. But he deliberately did not turn professional, which would
have closed the door on a third trip to Olympus.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I kept my eligibility, so I could keep my options
open,'' said Eldredge, who finished fourth in Nagano last time and
10th in Albertville in 1992. ``If the field looked like I could be
competitive, I wanted to be able to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   What Eldredge saw at last year's world championships in Helsinki
and last week's US championships, plus his own improvement,
convinced him he could be in the chase for 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt, yeah, I could be competitive if I want to be,'' said
Eldredge, who has won five world medals (including the 1996 gold)
and five US titles. ``There was no one moment when I made the
decision. Just kind of a feeling I've had over the last year that
my skating has started improving and my quadruple jump has gotten
better.''
</P>
<P>
   And the rest of his rivals haven't leaped beyond his reach.
Though Tim Goebel landed an unprecedented three quads at the US
championships, Michael Weiss retained the title without hitting
any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody else is landing three quads,'' said Eldredge, who has
never landed one in competition. ``Most of the guys are doing the
same things they've been doing the last couple of years. I was
always competitive with them without the quad. Now that my quad is
1,000 times better, I can raise the bar for myself and be one of
the guys that can be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   By coming back now, Eldredge felt he could ease back into the
fast lane and have two full competitive seasons before the next
Games. ``It won't be like jumping in just before the Olympic year
and thinking, `Oh my God, I've forgotten what this is all about,'
'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eldredge said he'll skate a full competitive season next fall
and winter and will return to the US championships to try to snatch
back the title Weiss inherited from him two years ago. ``You'll see
me in Boston,'' he vowed. ``I'm looking forward to skating in the
FleetCenter and going for a sixth title.''
</P>
<P>
   The Four Continents event, which includes skaters from North
America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania, will be a decent gauge of where
Eldredge is and needs to be.
</P>
<P>
   Though entries are not yet final, the field could include four
of the top 10 from last year's world championships _ Canada's Elvis
Stojko, Japan's Takeshi Honda, China's Guo Zhengxin, and
Australia's Anthony Liu.
</P>
<P>
   Eldredge has fared well this season, winning the Canadian Open
and finishing second in the Japan Open and fourth in Skate Canada,
a Grand Prix event for Olympic-eligible skaters. Though he didn't
compete in the US championships, Eldredge asked to be added to the
American team, which will be without Goebel and Weiss, who'll be
preparing for next month's world event in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good opportunity for me to pick up where I left
off,'' said Eldredge. ``You always need a chance to keep your name
and your skating fresh in the judges' minds. If I want to be
considered in the mix for the medals in the next Olympics, I have
to be out there.''

MESSAGE FROM A HEATING OIL SUMMIT: DO SOMETHING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Vt., Del.) (See also CLINTON-OIL) 
(DW) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson stood penitent here
Wednesday before a crowd of regional politicians, truckers,
industry representatives and consumers at the first New England
Heating Oil Summit, and confessed, ``We were caught napping.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious the federal government was not prepared,'' he
said, for the recent jumps in oil prices that have brought cries of
distress from residents of the Northeast and elsewhere who have
found their home fuel bills doubling this winter, to as much as $2
a gallon. ``We got complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   No one among the scores of people who nearly filled a Faneuil
Hall meeting room disputed a need for better monitoring to
anticipate rising prices. But the three-hour meeting found no easy
unanimity on how to respond to such spikes.
</P>
<P>
   As Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts put it: ``What is the
solution to make sure we're not back here next year with the same
problem?''
</P>
<P>
   That problem, as several speakers noted, is one of supply (cuts
in OPEC oil production) and demand (a surge that came with this
winter's cold snaps).
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II argued that the answer lay in
ensuring the supply, by requiring wholesalers to maintain some
minimum level of oil in storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very soluble, easy problem,'' Kennedy said. ``It
takes political will.''
</P>
<P>
   His uncle, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., is preparing a bill
that would set such minimum supply levels of heating oil for the
Northeast, the senator's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said that he would consider Kennedy's proposal and
that he was also willing to examine a proposal that the government
itself create an oil reserve for the region. Rep. Bernard Sanders,
the Independent from Vermont, is helping push a bill in Congress to
create a 2-million-barrel home heating oil reserve in existing
structures in New York Harbor, and to store more with the
government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, an emergency supply of
crude oil that lies in huge underground salt caverns along the gulf
coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders and virtually every other federal officeholder from the
Northeast have also been pressing for more immediate help to
besieged fuel consumers. Sanders, who previously called the Clinton
administration's response to the soaring prices ``underwhelming,''
applauded the president's announcement Wednesday that the
government would provide new heating oil aid. But, he added,
Washington should also be releasing oil from the strategic reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said that among other steps, he would look for a way
to provide financial relief to truckers and others who have been
hurt by the jump in prices for diesel, a product almost identical
to home heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   They need that relief, those people say. Al Bryant, one of at
least two dozen truckers who attended the meeting, said that his
fuel costs had risen 119 percent in the last five months and that
his profit ``is nil right now.'' He and other truckers suggested
that they be given a temporary respite from their taxes of 47 cents
a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was among those who puzzled over the most perplexing
question raised at the meeting: Were the price spikes solely the
workings of the market, or was some manipulation afoot? Several
speakers said there had been moments when prices seemed to be
suspiciously inflated beyond reasonable markups. Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., who had called for the conference, said he was not
satisfied that the price increases of this winter were ``a pure
reflection of market forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry too said he was pushing for an oil reserve bill, because
``we can't allow a kind of speculation process to destroy people's
capacity just to make ends meet and live.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the conference were representatives of oil
wholesalers, oil retailers, consumer advocacy groups, the New York
Mercantile Exchange, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the elderly and
the natural-gas industry. One frequently repeated theme was the
kind of warning that came from Harris B. McDowell, a state senator
from Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   ``There truly is an energy crisis that never went away,''
McDowell said. ``In the 1970s and early 1980s, that wolf ate a few
very fat piggies, and has been very happy for a while. But it is
still with us, and I think this crisis proves it.''

ROBERT OLEN BUTLER AVOIDS FORMULA FOR SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight years after winning the Pulitizer Prize for ``A Good Scent
From a Strange Mountain,'' a dazzling collection of 15 short
stories, Robert Olen Butler is surprised when people recognize his
name and tell him they love his books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still feels a little unreal,'' says Butler, 55, who was in
Texas on a stopover that kicked off a national tour touting his
latest novel, ``Mr. Spaceman'' (Grove Press, $23). ``When I won the
prize, I was writing in absolute obscurity. My novel before that
sold 1,083 copies. Nobody seemed to care about my books.''
</P>
<P>
   Now critics rave over each new Butler title, and every
book-signing attracts devoted fans who want to tell the author how
much his work has meant to them. This doesn't mean Butler has
achieved sales superstardom. ``Mr. Spaceman'' and John Grisham's
``The Brethren'' were published within two weeks of each other.
``The Brethren'' is a fixture at No. 1 on Amazon.com's bestseller
list, while ``Mr. Spaceman'' bounces between No. 800 and No. 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Butler says, is the difference between
``entertainment'' and ``literary'' writers, and what each hopes to
achieve for readers. ``Think of it as the distinction between
Stephen King and Leo Tolstoy,'' he says. ``Entertainment writers
know the exact effect they want to have on their readers before
they even begin to write. They want to scare them, or want to hold
their attention with a story about lawyers. There is nothing wrong
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   For literary artists, as Butler calls them, ``writing is
exploration as well as expression.'' They often don't know where
they are headed when they begin their work. Butler's goal is to
touch the emotions of readers who open their imaginations to the
varied messages his eclectic topics provide.
</P>
<P>
   He is happy as long as he sells enough books to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   Butler doesn't deny that this philosophy makes him a minority
among authors. He wants every book to come at readers from a
different angle than the one before.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no challenge, and therefore no emotional and
intellectual reward, in writing the same book over and over,''
Butler says. ``Just before I won the Pulitzer Prize, I decided my
books probably weren't ever going to get much attention, and so I'd
just write to challenge and satisfy myself. Afterwards, I found
myself in the same frame of mind. That's why I've since written a
dense novel about human sexuality, (''They Whisper''); ``Tabloid
Dreams,'' a collection of stories based on extreme tabloid
headlines; and so forth. Because, after ``A Good Scent From a
Strange Mountain,'' I think everyone expected me to write
exclusively about Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been natural. All 15 stories in ``Strange
Mountain'' are based on Vietnamese people and folktales. It is a
culture and folklore Butler learned firsthand. In 1969, after
receiving an undergraduate degree in theater from Northwestern
University and a master's degree in playwriting from the University
of Iowa, he served in Vietnam. Butler's gift for language allowed
him to learn to speak fluent Vietnamese, and he served in military
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Butler returned to the States, burning to write about his
experiences, but he worked at other jobs (laborer in a steel mill,
taxi driver, high school teacher, journalist) before ``The Alleys
of Eden'' was published in 1981. That work, and some of his
subsequent poorly selling novels, focused on Vietnam. The Pulitzer
honoring ``Strange Mountain'' gave him a wider, if still cultlike
audience, and he has tried to engagingly confound it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Spaceman'' is a continuation of a short story in ``Tabloid
Dreams.'' In the earlier work, Butler wrote about a Southern woman
in love with an alien who was visiting Earth to learn about its
inhabitants. ``Mr. Spaceman'' finds the two wed as
out-of-this-worlder Desi is ordered by his far-off superiors to
reveal himself to humans on Jan. 1, 2000. The problem is, Desi has
learned enough about earthlings to realize that humans often
destroy anything or anyone that seems too, well, ``different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As I was writing, I had no idea what would happen to Desi in
the story,'' Butler says. ``But, given the propensities of the
human race, chances were that they would not be kind to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler believes most readers would get more from his books _
from any books _ if they read them in a less traditional way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ought to be a deep, primal connection between readers
and words on a page,'' Butler says. ``But people are taught in
school, in college, to be analytical from the first page. Teachers'
attitudes are that writers are like idiot savants who really want
to say abstract, philosophic things but are not quite able to. So
they present books as what they think the writer is saying. Well,
art does not come from the mind, from our analytical faculties. It
comes from where you dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The perfect meeting of writer and reader, Butler says, ``is a
process of deep communication, of companionship. That is what I ask
of readers. You don't understand a work of art, you `thrum' to it,
and it is more like a musical experience.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which can, Butler knows, make him sound like an
impractical ``artiste.'' But he's got his common sense side, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do realize publishing is a business,'' Butler says. ``Take
this current book tour. I'm going to 45 cities. Most authors, at
least those who've been published a lot, don't like to tour. They
find it demeaning. I'm always ready to do it, and I even told Grove
Press, my publisher for `Mr. Spaceman,' not to spend money on print
advertising. Instead, I asked them to use that money to send me to
more places.''
</P>
<P>
   When the tour concludes, Butler will go home to Louisiana and
write some more _ another novel (he's sorting through ideas), some
screenplays (''I've just come back from Hollywood pitching `Mr.
Spaceman,' though I'd have to write the screenplay myself''), and
he'll even teach at McNeese State in Lake Charles.
</P>
<P>
   And does he practice what he preaches in the classroom?
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I tell them (students) is to forget everything
they learned in the class,'' Butler says. ``I tell them that the
purpose of what we read, what we discussed, was to help them tune
their inner instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'll tell them not to read by thinking, but by dreaming.''

 BAUER ENDORSES McCAIN; CANDIDATES CONTINUE TO SPAR OVER CAMPAIGN(Eds: The material in the MCCAIN story, budgeted earlier, is now

 By ALISON MITCHELL with FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Sen. John McCain won the endorsement
Wednesday of Gary Bauer, a former presidential rival and prominent
social conservative who called him the ``best shot we have to end
the era of Bill and Hillary and Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer showed up at McCain's side at a midday rally here on the
campus of Furman University, in the northern quadrant of South
Carolina, where the state's large and influential bloc of voters
from the religious right is the strongest. The senator's senior
advisers said they hoped Bauer could bring new support from
Christian conservatives and help fend off charges by supporters of
Gov. George W. Bush that McCain is not reliable on social issues
such as abortion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain himself said Bauer could help him reach out to a part of
the Republican Party to which ``my lines of communication haven't
been as firm.'' Bauer immediately started offering a spirited
defense of McCain, providing an important counterweight to figures
like Pat Robertson who suggested this week that conservatives would
desert the party if McCain became the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Reminding the crowd at Furman University of McCain's
imprisonment as a prison of war in North Vietnam, Bauer said that
``when John was in that POW camp, he wasn't sitting around thinking
about the wealth of America or the power of America, he was
thinking about that moral idea of America, the reason that we are
who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who had made the crusade against abortion one of the
centerpieces of his own presidential campaign, said McCain agreed
with him that ``we must work to ensure that every child gets
welcomed into the world and protected by the law.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Bauer said he believed McCain and Bush had
the same position on abortion, which is less absolute than his own.
``At least on the surface there wasn't much difference'' he said of
the two men. ``But I've looked John in the eye. I've talked to him.
I've looked at his voting record. I believe it is by and large a
pro-life voting record.''
</P>
<P>
   With McCain and Bush running neck and neck, the senator has
gained solid support from independents. But most polls show him
running behind Bush with traditional Republicans and doing even
worse with the religious right. A South Carolina anti-abortion
group is running radio advertisements accusing McCain of voting
``to use tax dollars for experiments that use body parts from
aborted babies,'' a theme that is also being hit hard by the
National Right to Life Committee in direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Charleston sidestepped a question about
whether Bauer's endorsement of his rival would hurt him with
religious conservatives. ``I think I've got good chance to win
South Carolina,'' Bush said. ``I'm going to drive this campaign
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush took a more direct swipe at McCain and his commitment to
diluting the influence of money in politics, suggesting Wednesday
that McCain was ignoring federal spending limits for the Republican
primary in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides asserted that McCain had spent about $2.8 million
in advertising alone for South Carolina, and had thus undoubtedly
exceeded the limit of slightly more than $3 million for a full
array of expenditures. Bush himself declined to make charges or
cite numbers, but his comments left no doubt that he believed that
McCain had crossed the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``No candidate ought to be above the rules,'' Bush said at a
news conference in Hilton Head Wednesday morning. ``Senator McCain
needs to explain, if in fact he has busted the spending cap in
South Carolina, how on the one hand you can be a campaign funding
reformer and on the other hand, not live within spending caps.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides did not provide a specific figure for the Arizona
senator's spending but said that he would remain within the limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a dime under in New Hampshire,'' said John Weaver, the
political director for the McCain campaign. ``We'll be a nickel
under here.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarrel was about more than math. With striking consistency
over the last week and a half, Bush has worked to divert attention
from his own prodigious financial war chest and intense spending to
charges that McCain's fund raising violates some of his own
principles when it comes to campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush faces no spending limits, because he raised so much money
last year that he decided to forgo the federal matching funds that
are distributed on the condition that candidates stay within
certain caps. Bush's aides said Wednesday that the campaign had
spent about $3.1 million on advertising in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign provided a startling glimpse Wednesday into
the full extent of their spending, conceding that it had spent, by
the end of January, about $50 million of the $70 million it had
raised up to then, leaving the campaign with about $20 million in
reserve on the day before the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   That was a record-setting expenditure for this point in a
presidential race, and it topped by $8 million the amount that Bob
Dole had spent through July in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insisted that his campaign had nonetheless anticipated, and
was well equipped, to deal with this kind of scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on plan,'' Bush said at the news conference. ``We've got
a strategy. We've got a plan in place and we're executing the
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also engaged McCain in a new television commercial that
addresses campaign financing and began airing Wednesday in South
Carolina. The spot says that McCain's criticisms of Bush on this
issue have been gratuitous and unwarranted, and it casts Bush as
someone eager to usher in sensible reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer met secretly with McCain Tuesday in a Columbia hotel
before the final debate leading into the South Carolina primary.
Bauer flew back to Washington Tuesday night to consult with his
family. He then telephoned McCain at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday morning
with his decision and the campaign sent a chartered plane to bring
him back to South Carolina. Bauer was planning to stump for McCain
in South Carolina and then in Michigan.

LAPD'S TOP OFFICIALS ADMIT LAPSES IN OVERSEEING DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Top police officials here offered a scathing
public indictment of the command and supervision within their
troubled department Wednesday, saying that thousands of new
officers had been hired with little vetting and then allowed to run
virtually out of control.
</P>
<P>
   These lapses, the officials said, were especially bad at some of
the special divisions designed to use aggressive tactics against
gangs and crack cocaine dealers, and had thus contributed to a
scandal that has shocked this city with reports of widespread and
unchecked police corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not have ability to have command and control and to
examine the department,'' said Deputy Chief Michael Bostic, in a
hearing before the Los Angeles City Council.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of a rapidly expanded and undersupervised force
have cropped up at police departments at other large cities,
notably Washington, D.C., where politicians responded to the crack
epidemic in the late 1980s and the early 1990s with calls for
placing more uniformed officers on the streets. In some of those
cities, there have been similar debates over whether the police
departments have brought on too many people too quickly, leading to
abuses that are now being uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has moved to the center of the increasingly
politicized debate over who was responsible for the abuses that
took place in Los Angeles _ including the shooting of a handcuffed
gang member, fabricated evidence and lying by officers _ and the
question of whether the police can reform themselves or whether an
outside body must do the job.
</P>
<P>
   The top officials' statements Wednesday were a startling
admission of the depths of the problems at the police department,
but they were also just another step in the intense political
battle being waged.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most political leaders, including the mayor,
have had little to say about the scandal, in which most of the
victims were gang members or drug dealers. Many here interpreted
the admissions by the police officials as part of an effort to pass
along blame for the problems and to head off the creation of an
outside body to investigate the corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council has not called for an outside investigation and
after Wednesday's hearing, several members said they were content
to let the current inquiries, at the police department and the
district attorney's office, take their course.
</P>
<P>
   But the efforts to limit the damage to the department were
crumbling. The police chief, Bernard C. Parks, acknowledged for the
first time that the systematic corruption might have existed beyond
the inner-city Rampart Division, where it had first been uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said that, though there was no criminal investigation yet
of other police divisions, ``the telltale signs'' of supervisory
lapses were present across the department and would be
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The police officials said Wednesday that all of the officers so
far implicated in the scandal had been hired in in the late 1980s
and early 1990s, when there was great pressure to add to the force
quickly, and that four of them should never have been hired because
of problems that should have been uncovered in the standard
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   The problems found among officers hired during that period
included arrests and histories of alcoholism, domestic violence or
outstanding debts, Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bostic said that in many instances there were ``very clear flags
that something was wrong, and either people did not find it, or
when they did, chose not to take action.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks has offered a broad program of reforms, including lie
detector tests for all applicants, better background checks, sting
operations of police officers to ferret out corruption, and the
hiring of 200 new people for the internal affairs division, which
investigates corruption. He has also called for the creation of a
special department to immediately freeze sites after police
shootings to avoid the kind of tampering with and planting of
evidence that has been uncovered at the Rampart Division.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal may also change the way the specialized police
divisions operate. They had been given great autonomy to pursue
gang members and drug dealers, spawning many complaints about
overly aggressive tactics. The police officials said Wednesday that
they planned to take away some of the units' autonomy and force
them back into mainstream procedures.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is growing concern among some politicians that damage
control is a prime objective at the police department. And some
City Council members and others have expressed concern that the
efforts to deflect blame may take priority over real corrective
action. That is why some people and groups, including state Sen.
Tom Hayden and the American Civil Liberties Union, have demanded an
outside investigation and intervention by federal authorities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The City Council has not made such demands yet, but some members
Wednesday expressed alarm at some of Parks' statement.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Chick, a member of the council and a former head of its
public safety commission, said that at the time the police
department was hiring the thousands of new officers she and others
demanded to know if the controls were in place. She said she had
been assured that they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where was the LAPD in standing up, as our law enforcement
experts, in saying we're making a mistake in hiring so many police
officers and not putting in place the other pieces?'' Chick asked.
``It never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks rejected questions about whether a code of silence among
police officers had contributed to the scandal. He insisted, ``It
is no more pervasive at the LAPD than in the general population.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, more than 40 criminal cases have been or will shortly be
overturned, and the district attorney has said that more are
coming. The city is also being sued by people who say they were the
victims of the police abuses, and some experts have estimated that
the cases could cost the city more than $200 million.

GRIEVING MOTHER WRITES TO KILLER: `I NO LONGER FEEL ALIVE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Colo.) 
 
By HARVEY RICE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONROE, Texas _ In anguished words addressed to her daughter's
killer, a mother told of no longer knowing love _ and no longer
believing in God _ because of the grief the man inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have taken every reason I had to live and I don't know
what it is like to love any more, because you have also taken that
away from me,'' Kim Brothers, the mother of 18-year-old Wanda May
Pitts, wrote in a letter to be sent to William Ray Mathews at the
Montgomery County Jail near Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never forgive you and I can't tell you to ask God for
forgiveness, because with what you have done, I no longer think
there is a God, because if there was, he would never put men like
you on this earth to bring harm to special people like my baby,
Wanda!'' wrote Brothers, 35, of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In a videotaped confession, Mathews, 38, said recently that he
abducted Pitts from her job as a clerk at the Lodge Motel, now a
Howard Johnson, in nearby Shenandoah on Jan. 17, 1999. The attack
came after Mathews escaped for the fifth time from a Colorado
mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Conroe, a city of 43,500 people, is about 35 miles north of
downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Mathews was sentenced to 50 years in prison last week after
pleading guilty to robbery and aggravated assault in two unrelated
abduction attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, who said they could not bring murder charges
against Mathews because Pitts' body had not been found despite
numerous searches, agreed to never prosecute him for murder in
return for his confession and help in finding the body.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the guilty plea, Pitts' remains were found in a
brushy, wooded area just over the Montgomery County line in Walker
County.
</P>
<P>
   Given an opportunity to address Mathews in court, a distraught
Brothers was able to manage only a sentence or two.
</P>
<P>
   In a one-page, single-spaced letter, however, she wrote about
the pain she has felt because of her daughter's murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk around on this planet only as flesh and bones now
because my heart and soul are dead,'' Brothers wrote. ``You might
as well have taken me on 1-17-99 also, because I no longer feel
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know that you should have killed me on that
night and lay me next to the love of my life because I feel dead
anyway, again, no thanks to you William Ray Mathews!''
</P>
<P>
   The letter is signed, ``From a mother that walks this earth an
empty shell, Kim Brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ghigna, victim assistant coordinator at the Montgomery
County District Attorney's Office, said a copy of the letter will
be included in a file that will be sent to the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice Victim Services Office in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Ghigna said Pitts probably would have read the letter in court
had she been able. ``It's a very difficult thing to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter could be presented at any parole hearing after
Mathews becomes eligible in 25 years, Ghigna said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before he pleaded guilty last week, a jury concluded
that Mathews, whom judges in Illinois and Colorado have ruled not
guilty by reason of insanity in separate robbery cases, was
competent to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Mathews escaped from the Colorado State Mental Institution in
Pueblo a month before he killed Pitts.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted forcing Pitts into a pickup and taking her to a
motel in nearby Cleveland, where he strangled her early the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Mathews' last escape, the mental hospital adopted
a policy to notify the public of escapes, spokeswoman Eunice
Wolther said. The public did not hear of Mathews' escape in 1998
until last October, when Texas authorities tied him to Pitts'
slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Wolther also said maximum- and medium-security patients such as
Mathews can no longer go to the hospital's unlocked vocational
buildings. Mathews escaped during a class.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan Olin, director of forensic psychiatry, said the
hospital has made other changes, including unspecified physical
improvements, to make it harder to escape.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call (404) 222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the large amount of money that Steve Forbes spent on his
presidential campaign tax deductible?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. IRS spokesman Mark Green explained that amounts incurred
by an individual seeking public office aren't deductible as
business expenses. The same goes for re-election campaign expenses
for an officeholder. Forbes was reported to have spent a total of
some $66 million on his campaigns in 1996 and this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Also not deductible, by the way, are expenses for the support
of, or opposition to, any candidate for public office. This means
that contributions, gifts, or any other amount paid for
``participation or intervention'' in any political campaign on
behalf of any candidate for public office cannot be claimed as a
deduction. This includes donations to a political party, committee,
group or candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A news magazine recently reported that Sally Hemings was a
half-sister of Thomas Jefferson's wife. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: It has been reported often that Hemings was the illegitimate
half-sister of Jefferson's deceased wife, Martha, the offspring of
a relationship between John Wayles and Elizabeth ``Betty'' Hemings,
a slave. Wayles was the father of Martha Wayles, who married
Jefferson. When Wayles died, Sally Hemings became Jefferson's
property when he inherited the Wayles estate in 1774.
</P>
<P>
   Details about Sally Hemings can be found at libraries. Among the
resources: ``Black Women in America/An Historical Encyclopedia''
and ``Notable Black American Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: An author in Britain named Irving sued an Emory professor and
her publisher for calling him a ``holocaust revisionist.'' The
trial was covered extensively for some days, then disappeared from
the news. What's the status of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The trial of historical writer David Irving's libel lawsuit
against Emory University professor Deborah Lipstadt ended its fifth
week on Feb. 10. It is expected to continue until late March.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has been presenting a series of witnesses to
challenge Irving's merits as an historian, and to attack his
honesty as a writer. Under English libel law, attorneys
representing Lipstadt and her publisher, Penguin Press, must prove
the truth of assertions contained in a book by Lipstadt that Irving
denied conventional accounts of the Holocaust and manipulated
historical facts to support his position.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt's book, ``Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on
Truth and Memory,'' was published in Britain in 1994. Irving says
the book misrepresented his position, damaged his reputation, and
generated waves of hatred against him. Lipstadt's lawyers accuse
him of being a liar and a falsifier of history.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In what years were the Susan B. Anthony coins produced for
general circulation?
</P>
<P>
   A: 1979-81, plus an uncirculated coin set in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After a commercial airplane crashes, and the flight number is
reported so often that it becomes etched in people's minds, are the
airlines required to retire that number?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the Federal Aviation Administration and the Air
Transport Association, there's no regulation requiring airlines to
retire numbers falling into that category, such as TWA 800. But
Diana Cronan of the Washington-based ATA said it's typical for an
airline to stop using a recognizable flight number ``after any
high-profile accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What ever became of Lenny Skutnik, the man who jumped into
the icy waters of the Potomac River in an attempt to save
passengers in the early-'80s crash of an Air Florida flight? He was
singled out by President Reagan in a State of the Union address,
but I haven't heard anything about him since.
</P>
<P>
   A: At last report, Skutnik was still working at the same job he
had at the Congressional Budget Office in Washington when the crash
occurred on Jan. 13,1982.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Skutnik was on his way to his home in Lorton, Va.
As he neared the crash site, he saw a woman, later identified as a
flight attendant, in the river. She appeared to be losing her grip
on a rescue line. He jumped into the frigid water and dragged her
to safety.
</P>
<P>
   His act of heroism didn't go unnoticed. His biggest moment in
the spotlight came less than two weeks later, during Reagan's first
State of the Union address, when Reagan was discussing heroes. ``We
don't have to turn to our history books for heroes. They're all
around us,'' he said, recounting Skutnik's lifesaving deed. Skutnik
was in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last year with the Washington Post, Skutnik said
the crash rescue incident, and the mention by Reagan, didn't change
his life. ``I got caught up in the moment, but I knew it would
eventually be over,'' he said. ``At first ... I had no control over
it. But then I got back to work, back to normal, and things didn't
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that Delta Air Lines has restored an old DC-3 prop
plane that had been in its fleet years and years ago. Can the
public buy a ride on it?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. As Delta has explained previously, Ship 41, as it's
called, is being used only for major air shows and Delta-sponsored
events _ not for commercial or sightseeing flights.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Super Bowl Sunday next year is Jan. 28. When and how can fans
enter the lottery to try and get tickets?
</P>
<P>
   A: As you know, most Super Bowl tickets go to corporate sponsors
and other companies and individuals related to the business side of
the game. Another allotment is set aside for the competing teams. A
small percentage _ a National Football League spokesman wouldn't
specify exactly how many _ goes to the public through a random
drawing.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 Super Bowl will be played in Tampa. Anyone wanting to
get into the pool of potential applicants should send a certified
postcard with name, address and telephone number to: NFL Lottery,
280 Park Ave., New York, NY 10017. The deadline is June 1. Those
whose cards are chosen will be notified ``around the first of
November,'' the NFL spokesman said. Price information will be
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there an Internet site where I can look up Sen. John
McCain's voting record?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Web site of the non-partisan organization Project Vote
Smart _ www.vote-smart.org _ is a good place to start for voting
record information on any U.S. senator or House member.
</P>
<P>
   It displays a map of the United States. When you click on the
state you're interested in (Arizona, obviously, for McCain), you'll
find a wealth of data. Votes over a varying period on many issues _
such as affirmative action, gun issues, foreign aid, senior issues,
welfare and many more _ can be accessed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A TV commentator referred to the medal just awarded to Alfred
Rascon as the Congressional Medal of Honor. I thought it was just
the Medal of Honor. Who is right?
</P>
<P>
   A: You are. The proper name of the highest military decoration
that the United States grants to members of its armed forces is
simply the Medal of Honor. But the word ``Congressional''
frequently is added because the medal is presented by a high
official ``in the name of the Congress of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Rascon shielded men from grenade blasts in Vietnam 34 years ago,
but because of apparent administrative snafus, only now has he been
honored with the medal. It was approved by Defense Secretary
William Cohen in November and awarded to Rascon on Tuesday at the
White House by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose? Some time
ago I read that it was bought and moved by barge from California to
Oregon. Is it on display now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not yet. The Hughes Flying Boat HK-1 is still in pieces, but
is expected to be reassembled in stages and put on display, along
with 40-50 other vintage aircraft, in early 2001. The Spruce Goose
will be the centerpiece of a museum under construction at the Capt.
Michael King Smith Evergreen Educational Institute in McMinnville,
Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Thompson, spokesman for the facility, said workers hope to
start putting the Spruce Goose in place in August or September. The
fuselage first will be placed in a 7-foot pit, after which the
wings, and then the tail, will be attached. Other aircraft will be
placed around the gigantic HK-1, while others will be suspended
from the museum's superstructure.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the museum can be found online at
http://sprucegoose.org.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in obtaining a copy of President Clinton's
2001 budget. How do I get one?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2001,
and related Office of Management and Budget documents can be
purchased at any Government Printing Office bookstore. One is in
Atlanta (999 Peachtree St. NE, Suite 120; telephone 404-347-1900).
The documents are priced separately: $38 for the budget; $72 for
the appendix; $54 for analytical perspectives; $28 for historical
tables; $3.75 for A Citizen's Guide to the Federal Budget, Fiscal
Year 2001; $3.25 for The Budget System and Concepts, Fiscal Year
2001; and $17 for the budget on CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to buy it, you may be able to view the
material at a public library, said Linda Schimmel of Congressional
Budget Office Publications. Budget documents also can be downloaded
from the Internet at www.gpo.gov/usbudget.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Don McLean's song ``American Pie'' has been in the news
recently because of a remake by Madonna. Beyond the generally
understood explanation that the lyrics are about the early days of
rock and roll, what do the words mean? For example, who are ``the
father, son and the holy ghost''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Numerous interpretations have been offered about the 1971
song's lyrics. Many Web sites exist that attempt to explain it. One
_ www.americanpie2000.com/americanpie/ _ lists this as its
interpretation of the line in Verse 6:
</P>
<P>
   ``And the three men I admire most The Father Son and Holy
Ghost'' refers to Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper (J.P. Richardson) and
Richie Valens.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Web site explains, McLean has never provided an
explanation of the meaning of ``American Pie,'' which has added to
the song's mystery.
</P>
<P>
   This interpretation suggests that the entire song is a tribute
to Holly and a commentary on how rock and roll music changed in the
years since his death in 1959. In that view, McLean is lamenting
the lack of ``danceable'' good-time party music in rock and roll
and, in part, is attributing that lack to the absence of Buddy
Holly, et. al.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative explanation, on a different Web site, says McLean
was a Catholic, and Verse 6 deals with religion and godless acts.
So if you accept that, the words refer to the traditional Trinity
of Christian theology.
</P>
<P>
   A search engine such as Yahoo can link you to several resources
for ``American Pie.'' That way, you can take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to visit cemeteries where famous people, such as
Buddy Holly and Richie Valens, are buried. Is there a book with
that sort of information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Several books with such information should be readily
available at libraries or bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Books in Print (1999-2000)'' lists these titles, for example:
``Who Lies Where: A Guide to Famous Graves'' by Michael Kerrigan
(Trafalgar Square Publishing Co.); ``Discovering Famous Graves'' by
Lynn F. Pearson (Shire Publications); ``Final Curtain _ Deaths of
Noted Movie and TV Personalities'' by Everett Grant Jarvis (Carol
Publishing Group); and ``Final Curtain: Eternal Resting Places of
Stars, Celebrities, Moguls, Misers, Misfits &AMP; Their Stories'' by
Margaret Burk and Gary Hudson (Seven Locks Press).
</P>
<P>
   Some information is very specific. For example, ``Final Curtain
_ Deaths of Noted Movie and TV Personalities'' shows that Valens is
buried at Missions Hills Cemetery in Mission Hills, Calif., Section
C, at Curb No. 247, three rows in. It doesn't list Holly's burial
place, but the Buddy Holly Center in Lubbock, Texas, confirmed that
he's buried in the City of Lubbock Cemetery. Holly was born in
Lubbock.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call (404) 222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When airline flights are long and nonstop, such as 16 hours
between Atlanta and South Africa, how does it work with the cockpit
crew? Are there regulations about how long they can be at the
controls?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. International carriers are bound by the regulations of
their respective countries, according to the Montreal-based
International Civil Aviation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the new South African Airways flights to and from
Atlanta, two sets of captains operate the aircraft on shifts, said
airline spokeswoman Ann Gillespie. She added that South African
Airways follows FAA guidelines, since the aircraft operate into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   FAA regulations specify that flight crews can fly for no more
than eight hours before they must be relieved, said agency
spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen. Usually, she said, a crew member flies
the aircraft for several hours, then rests in facilities that are
required to be available while someone else is at the controls.
After resting, the first person returns to duty. The eight hours is
``actual flying time,'' by the way, and doesn't include preflight
preparations, Bergen said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it still possible to purchase official programs from the
Atlanta Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, as long as supplies last. The Atlanta Super Bowl Host
Committee suggests checking an online source,
www.officialstuff.com, which as of Feb. 9 indicated programs were
available for $19.95 (shipping and handling included). A spokesman
at National Football League headquarters in New York said programs
also can be ordered by calling 1-877-NFL-SHOP (1-877-635-7467).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported how to convert temperatures from
Celsius to Fahrenheit. Is there a similar formula for determining
wind chill?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but it's complex. A simpler way is to check a chart that
has temperatures in Fahrenheit ranging from, say, 45 degrees above
zero to 45 below, relating them to wind velocity.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the formula is complicated is that the wind chill
equivalents don't simply double if, for instance, the actual
temperature is steady but the wind speed doubles. Say the air
temperature is 25 degrees F and the wind velocity is 10 mph; the
numerical table puts the wind chill equivalent temperature at 10.
If the temperature is the same (25) and the wind velocity is
doubled to 20 mph, the wind chill equivalent is 3 below zero. If
the temperature is 25 and the wind velocity is 30 mph, the wind
chill equivalent is 10 degrees below zero.
</P>
<P>
   A chart can be found in World Book Encyclopedia, available at
any library. Look under ``Wind chill.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: On a recent episode of the TV game show ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' the name of the Michelin mascot was identified as
Bibendum. We thought it was simply ``the Michelin tire man.'' What
is the origin of the name Bibendum, and how was it chosen as the
mascot?
</P>
<P>
   A: The genesis of the name Bibendum came in February 1893, at
the conference of the Society of Civil Engineers of Paris, when
Andre Michelin introduced the expression that was to become a
Michelin motto: ``The tire drinks obstacles.'' A year later, at the
Exposition Universelle et Coloniale at Lyon, France, Andre and his
brother, Edouard, noticed a pile of tires of varying sizes. Edouard
remarked to Andre that if the pile of tires had arms, it would look
like a man. Thus was the idea planted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1897, illustrator Marius Rossillon, who went by the pseudonym
O'Galop, showed the Michelin brothers several ideas for publicity.
One was a sketch showing a drinker raising his arm, with the motto,
``Nunc est bibendum'' (``It's time to drink''), after a verse from
Horace. The line reminded Andre of the phrase ``The tire drinks
obstacles.'' So he ordered a poster from O'Galop, who created one
the following year using a character composed of tires and
repeating the ``Nunc est bibendum'' motto.
</P>
<P>
   The association was complete when, several months later, a race
car driver spotted Andre Michelin and shouted, ``There's
Bibendum.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported recently on the selection process for candidates
for the TV program ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' Can you give
me similar information about getting on ``Wheel of Fortune''?
</P>
<P>
   A: A new system called the ``Wheelmobile,'' which will visit
several cities each month, is in the works. There's no schedule yet
for when and where it will be going, said a show spokeswoman. Her
advice: Watch local affiliates on which the program is broadcast,
and they will announce locations and schedules for the Wheelmobile.
</P>
<P>
   Once locations are established, people who want to be an
audience member or a contestant can go there and enter their names
and telephone numbers into a database. Names then will be chosen
randomly.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to make the system more equitable for people
nationwide, rather than having contestants and audience members
basically coming from the show's home base in Southern California,
the spokeswoman said. She added that nothing will happen soon,
because the show is scheduled to go on hiatus for a couple of
months.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the recent spell of cold and ice in Georgia damaged the
Vidalia onion crop?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lovers of the sweet onions will be happy to hear that the
worst of the harsh weather bypassed the exclusive growing area. A
spokeswoman at Morris Farms in east-central Georgia said a few
onions may have suffered, but the majority of the crop is expected
to be fine. She said the onions should be in grocery stores in late
April, and will be available through June, or even longer if kept
in cold storage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports indicate that oil found on a Russian freighter
originated from Iraq. How was that conclusion reached?
</P>
<P>
   A: The vessel carried a load of gas oil, a refined product often
used as diesel fuel. Samples were flown to the U.S. Customs Service
Laboratory in San Francisco, the routine procedure in cases of
suspected smuggling in the Persian Gulf. The sample's chemical
signature then was compared to those in a library of 3,000
reference samples collected worldwide. A positive match showed that
the tanker's cargo had originated as crude oil from an Iraqi well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We lost two pine and five maple trees as a result of ice
storms. They broke in two, so must be removed. Since none caused
damage to my home, my insurance company won't reimburse me. I have
a bid for $4,000 from a tree-removal company to remove the wood. Is
that deductible as a casualty loss on my income tax return?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some of it may be deductible, but several factors must be
taken into account, said IRS spokesman Mark Green.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's a ``$100 rule,'' that must be applied, meaning
you reduce the figure to $3,900. Then you must apply another rule,
which requires calculating 10 percent of your adjusted gross
income. If that is less than $3,900, the resulting dollar figure
becomes the deductible amount. As an example, 10 percent of an
adjusted gross income of $10,000 would be $1,000. Subtract that
from $3,900, and the actual deductible amount is $2,900. On the
other hand, if the adjustable gross income is $50,000, there can be
no deductible, because 10 percent ($5,000) is more than $3,900.
</P>
<P>
   Green said full information on this subject can be found on page
6 of IRS publication 547, Casualties, Disaster and Theft.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know the next Super Bowl will be in Tampa, but have the
dates and locations of others after that been announced?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The next two will be in New Orleans, on Jan. 27, 2002;
and in San Diego, on Jan. 26, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that the Oscar statues are dipped in a 24-karat gold
solution. How much does it cost to produce them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Each statuette costs about $350 to fabricate, said John
Pavlik, communications director at the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 are made each year, he added, to ensure that there are
enough in case of ties, honorary or special achievement awards, or
other unforeseen circumstances. No one knows the exact number of
statuettes that will be presented until the envelopes are opened
March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Other factoids: Each statuette is made from the alloy britannium
and then is plated in copper, nickel silver, and finally 24-karat
gold. The original statuettes were solid bronze, and for a while
they were made of plaster. They stand 13 1/2 inches tall and weigh
8 1/2 pounds. To date, 2,328 have been presented. The official
name, by the way, isn't Oscar; it's the Academy Award of Merit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just got back from Florida, where I received the new $1
coins in change at two stores, Wal-Mart and Sam's Club. I was told
they had exclusive distribution of the coins for a limited period.
If true, how could the government favor one retailer over another?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was a practical reason. The U.S. Mint introduced the
new Golden Dollar in stages, one of which was an arrangement with
Wal-Mart and Sam's Clubs to put the dollar coins into their cash
drawers. Mint spokesman Michael White traced the initiative back to
the lack of acceptance of the earlier Susan B. Anthony dollar coin.
In 20 years, that coin ``never made it into the retail arena,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So this time around, with the new Golden Dollar, the Mint talked
with several retailers about ways to get them into cash drawers _
and consumers' pockets _ quickly. Wal-Mart and Sam's Clubs were the
first to agree with the Mint to begin using the coins, White said.
The Mint thought people would be more likely to get them quickly at
these huge retail outlets than at a bank, he added.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, the Golden Dollars were distributed in some boxes of
Cheerios. On Jan. 18, the Federal Reserve began receiving a supply.
On Jan. 27, the Federal Reserve began sending them to financial
institutions, and the Mint began offering the coins in rolls and
bags on its Web site. Wal-Marts and Sam's Clubs began distributing
them Jan. 30, with the promotion limited to February.
</P>
<P>
   March 1 is the target date for 200 million of the new coins to
be in general circulation.

NEIMAN ON ART AND THE EYES OF A DOG
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   The prolific artist  &UR; LeRoy Neiman &LR; , whose works depict such
treasured American themes as golf, football, racehorses and
interiors of bars, is the subject of a retrospective that begins
February 20 at the Franklin Bowles Gallery in San Francisco. ``He's
wined and dined with kings and presidents and sat with three
generations of cultural icons,'' says his press materials,
``including  &UR; Joe DiMaggio &LR; ,  &UR; Frank Sinatra &LR; ,  &UR; Mick Jagger &LR; ,
 &UR; Muhammad &LR; 
 &UR; Ali &LR; ,  &UR; Mark McGwire &LR;  and  &UR; John Lennon &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Neiman told us that he's a fan of abstract expressionists
 &UR; Willem de Kooning &LR;  and  &UR; Franz Klein &LR;  and that  &UR; Richard Diebenkorn &LR; 
is ``a hell of a painter. I think that guy out there,  &UR; Wayne &LR; 
 &UR; Thiebaud &LR; , is a giant. I've done some paintings on commissions of
the bridges in San Francisco, and I've always felt that it was his
territory. He gave me a different way to look at San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Does being a star of pop culture make it harder for him to be
taken seriously as an artist? ``People just paint,'' said Neiman,
whose work is largely commissioned. ``I paint anything. If someone
comes by and wants me to paint their dog, they put it on the table
and I paint it. I've painted sheepdogs, I've painted full-size
poodles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you something about painting a dog: It's not like
painting a horse. A thoroughbred has got markings, and the owner is
very particular about it. But if you paint a dog, it's like a
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to do a portrait of someone, it's life size,
more or less to scale. If you do a full figure, you would scale it
down to fit. But if somebody brings a dog in, it's very hard to
paint that dog in a different scale. That's my problem. ... One of
the great things about living in New York City is that people have
great dogs. ... You look at a dog. You can't do a dumb dog. Every
dog's eyes are intelligent and they're alert. You can do some
people and they're kind of docile. But you don't find a dumb dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Neiman said he'd be paid about $10,000 for a watercolor of a
dog.
</P>
<P>
   The artist is also being honored in San Francisco by the naming
after him of an after-school art program sponsored by the Good
Tidings Foundation.

<P>
   &UR; ASTRONAUT FINALLY GETS HIS DUE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Astronaut  &UR; John Young &LR; , who flew Gemini, Apollo and shuttle
missions and is the most traveled man in space, will be honored
with a plaque to be unveiled on February 23 at the California
Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. Young, who was born in San
Francisco, lives in Houston nowadays. The Westin St. Francis is
putting him up for a week.
</P>
<P>
   The honor for Young is the result of a campaign by space buff
 &UR; Ken Winans &LR; , who lives in Mill Valley and whose efforts included
successful lobbying of Mayor  &UR; Willie Brown &LR;  and the San Francisco
supervisors.

   _ The Washington Post caught  &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR;  failing to leave
a tip at a diner in Albion, N.Y., but she said that her meal was on
the house and the owner had told her not to pay a cent. Etiquette
expert  &UR; Letitia Baldrige &LR;  said it was a faux pas. ``You always tip.
You guess what the bill was and you leave 15 to 20 percent ... but
frankly the first lady would give more.''

<P>
   _ Oakland Mayor  &UR; Jerry Brown &LR;  adamantly refused to allow a lei

<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call (404) 222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the large amount of money that Steve Forbes spent on his
presidential campaign tax deductible?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. IRS spokesman Mark Green explained that amounts incurred
by an individual seeking public office aren't deductible as
business expenses. The same goes for re-election campaign expenses
for an officeholder. Forbes was reported to have spent a total of
some $66 million on his campaigns in 1996 and this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Also not deductible, by the way, are expenses for the support
of, or opposition to, any candidate for public office. This means
that contributions, gifts, or any other amount paid for
``participation or intervention'' in any political campaign on
behalf of any candidate for public office cannot be claimed as a
deduction. This includes donations to a political party, committee,
group or candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A news magazine recently reported that Sally Hemings was a
half-sister of Thomas Jefferson's wife. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: It has been reported often that Hemings was the illegitimate
half-sister of Jefferson's deceased wife, Martha, the offspring of
a relationship between John Wayles and Elizabeth ``Betty'' Hemings,
a slave. Wayles was the father of Martha Wayles, who married
Jefferson. When Wayles died, Sally Hemings became Jefferson's
property when he inherited the Wayles estate in 1774.
</P>
<P>
   Details about Sally Hemings can be found at libraries. Among the
resources: ``Black Women in America/An Historical Encyclopedia''
and ``Notable Black American Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: An author in Britain named Irving sued an Emory professor and
her publisher for calling him a ``holocaust revisionist.'' The
trial was covered extensively for some days, then disappeared from
the news. What's the status of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The trial of historical writer David Irving's libel lawsuit
against Emory University professor Deborah Lipstadt ended its fifth
week on Feb. 10. It is expected to continue until late March.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has been presenting a series of witnesses to
challenge Irving's merits as an historian, and to attack his
honesty as a writer. Under English libel law, attorneys
representing Lipstadt and her publisher, Penguin Press, must prove
the truth of assertions contained in a book by Lipstadt that Irving
denied conventional accounts of the Holocaust and manipulated
historical facts to support his position.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt's book, ``Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on
Truth and Memory,'' was published in Britain in 1994. Irving says
the book misrepresented his position, damaged his reputation, and
generated waves of hatred against him. Lipstadt's lawyers accuse
him of being a liar and a falsifier of history.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In what years were the Susan B. Anthony coins produced for
general circulation?
</P>
<P>
   A: 1979-81, plus an uncirculated coin set in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After a commercial airplane crashes, and the flight number is
reported so often that it becomes etched in people's minds, are the
airlines required to retire that number?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the Federal Aviation Administration and the Air
Transport Association, there's no regulation requiring airlines to
retire numbers falling into that category, such as TWA 800. But
Diana Cronan of the Washington-based ATA said it's typical for an
airline to stop using a recognizable flight number ``after any
high-profile accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What ever became of Lenny Skutnik, the man who jumped into
the icy waters of the Potomac River in an attempt to save
passengers in the early-'80s crash of an Air Florida flight? He was
singled out by President Reagan in a State of the Union address,
but I haven't heard anything about him since.
</P>
<P>
   A: At last report, Skutnik was still working at the same job he
had at the Congressional Budget Office in Washington when the crash
occurred on Jan. 13,1982.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Skutnik was on his way to his home in Lorton, Va.
As he neared the crash site, he saw a woman, later identified as a
flight attendant, in the river. She appeared to be losing her grip
on a rescue line. He jumped into the frigid water and dragged her
to safety.
</P>
<P>
   His act of heroism didn't go unnoticed. His biggest moment in
the spotlight came less than two weeks later, during Reagan's first
State of the Union address, when Reagan was discussing heroes. ``We
don't have to turn to our history books for heroes. They're all
around us,'' he said, recounting Skutnik's lifesaving deed. Skutnik
was in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last year with the Washington Post, Skutnik said
the crash rescue incident, and the mention by Reagan, didn't change
his life. ``I got caught up in the moment, but I knew it would
eventually be over,'' he said. ``At first ... I had no control over
it. But then I got back to work, back to normal, and things didn't
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that Delta Air Lines has restored an old DC-3 prop
plane that had been in its fleet years and years ago. Can the
public buy a ride on it?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. As Delta has explained previously, Ship 41, as it's
called, is being used only for major air shows and Delta-sponsored
events _ not for commercial or sightseeing flights.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Super Bowl Sunday next year is Jan. 28. When and how can fans
enter the lottery to try and get tickets?
</P>
<P>
   A: As you know, most Super Bowl tickets go to corporate sponsors
and other companies and individuals related to the business side of
the game. Another allotment is set aside for the competing teams. A
small percentage _ a National Football League spokesman wouldn't
specify exactly how many _ goes to the public through a random
drawing.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 Super Bowl will be played in Tampa. Anyone wanting to
get into the pool of potential applicants should send a certified
postcard with name, address and telephone number to: NFL Lottery,
280 Park Ave., New York, NY 10017. The deadline is June 1. Those
whose cards are chosen will be notified ``around the first of
November,'' the NFL spokesman said. Price information will be
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there an Internet site where I can look up Sen. John
McCain's voting record?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Web site of the non-partisan organization Project Vote
Smart _ www.vote-smart.org _ is a good place to start for voting
record information on any U.S. senator or House member.
</P>
<P>
   It displays a map of the United States. When you click on the
state you're interested in (Arizona, obviously, for McCain), you'll
find a wealth of data. Votes over a varying period on many issues _
such as affirmative action, gun issues, foreign aid, senior issues,
welfare and many more _ can be accessed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A TV commentator referred to the medal just awarded to Alfred
Rascon as the Congressional Medal of Honor. I thought it was just
the Medal of Honor. Who is right?
</P>
<P>
   A: You are. The proper name of the highest military decoration
that the United States grants to members of its armed forces is
simply the Medal of Honor. But the word ``Congressional''
frequently is added because the medal is presented by a high
official ``in the name of the Congress of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Rascon shielded men from grenade blasts in Vietnam 34 years ago,
but because of apparent administrative snafus, only now has he been
honored with the medal. It was approved by Defense Secretary
William Cohen in November and awarded to Rascon on Tuesday at the
White House by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose? Some time
ago I read that it was bought and moved by barge from California to
Oregon. Is it on display now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not yet. The Hughes Flying Boat HK-1 is still in pieces, but
is expected to be reassembled in stages and put on display, along
with 40-50 other vintage aircraft, in early 2001. The Spruce Goose
will be the centerpiece of a museum under construction at the Capt.
Michael King Smith Evergreen Educational Institute in McMinnville,
Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Thompson, spokesman for the facility, said workers hope to
start putting the Spruce Goose in place in August or September. The
fuselage first will be placed in a 7-foot pit, after which the
wings, and then the tail, will be attached. Other aircraft will be
placed around the gigantic HK-1, while others will be suspended
from the museum's superstructure.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the museum can be found online at

<P>
   Q: I'm interested in obtaining a copy of President Clinton's
2001 budget. How do I get one?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2001,
and related Office of Management and Budget documents can be
purchased at any Government Printing Office bookstore. One is in
Atlanta (999 Peachtree St. NE, Suite 120; telephone 404-347-1900).
The documents are priced separately: $38 for the budget; $72 for
the appendix; $54 for analytical perspectives; $28 for historical
tables; $3.75 for A Citizen's Guide to the Federal Budget, Fiscal
Year 2001; $3.25 for The Budget System and Concepts, Fiscal Year
2001; and $17 for the budget on CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to buy it, you may be able to view the
material at a public library, said Linda Schimmel of Congressional
Budget Office Publications. Budget documents also can be downloaded
from the Internet at www.gpo.gov/usbudget.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Don McLean's song ``American Pie'' has been in the news
recently because of a remake by Madonna. Beyond the generally
understood explanation that the lyrics are about the early days of
rock and roll, what do the words mean? For example, who are ``the
father, son and the holy ghost''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Numerous interpretations have been offered about the 1971
song's lyrics. Many Web sites exist that attempt to explain it. One
_ www.americanpie2000.com/americanpie/ _ lists this as its
interpretation of the line in Verse 6:
</P>
<P>
   ``And the three men I admire most The Father Son and Holy
Ghost'' refers to Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper (J.P. Richardson) and
Richie Valens.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Web site explains, McLean has never provided an
explanation of the meaning of ``American Pie,'' which has added to
the song's mystery.
</P>
<P>
   This interpretation suggests that the entire song is a tribute
to Holly and a commentary on how rock and roll music changed in the
years since his death in 1959. In that view, McLean is lamenting
the lack of ``danceable'' good-time party music in rock and roll
and, in part, is attributing that lack to the absence of Buddy
Holly, et. al.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative explanation, on a different Web site, says McLean
was a Catholic, and Verse 6 deals with religion and godless acts.
So if you accept that, the words refer to the traditional Trinity
of Christian theology.
</P>
<P>
   A search engine such as Yahoo can link you to several resources
for ``American Pie.'' That way, you can take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to visit cemeteries where famous people, such as
Buddy Holly and Richie Valens, are buried. Is there a book with
that sort of information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Several books with such information should be readily
available at libraries or bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Books in Print (1999-2000)'' lists these titles, for example:
``Who Lies Where: A Guide to Famous Graves'' by Michael Kerrigan
(Trafalgar Square Publishing Co.); ``Discovering Famous Graves'' by
Lynn F. Pearson (Shire Publications); ``Final Curtain _ Deaths of
Noted Movie and TV Personalities'' by Everett Grant Jarvis (Carol
Publishing Group); and ``Final Curtain: Eternal Resting Places of
Stars, Celebrities, Moguls, Misers, Misfits &AMP; Their Stories'' by
Margaret Burk and Gary Hudson (Seven Locks Press).
</P>
<P>
   Some information is very specific. For example, ``Final Curtain
_ Deaths of Noted Movie and TV Personalities'' shows that Valens is
buried at Missions Hills Cemetery in Mission Hills, Calif., Section
C, at Curb No. 247, three rows in. It doesn't list Holly's burial
place, but the Buddy Holly Center in Lubbock, Texas, confirmed that
he's buried in the City of Lubbock Cemetery. Holly was born in
Lubbock.

   Q: When airline flights are long and nonstop, such as 16 hours
between Atlanta and South Africa, how does it work with the cockpit
crew? Are there regulations about how long they can be at the
controls?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. International carriers are bound by the regulations of
their respective countries, according to the Montreal-based
International Civil Aviation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the new South African Airways flights to and from
Atlanta, two sets of captains operate the aircraft on shifts, said
airline spokeswoman Ann Gillespie. She added that South African
Airways follows FAA guidelines, since the aircraft operate into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   FAA regulations specify that flight crews can fly for no more
than eight hours before they must be relieved, said agency
spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen. Usually, she said, a crew member flies
the aircraft for several hours, then rests in facilities that are
required to be available while someone else is at the controls.
After resting, the first person returns to duty. The eight hours is
``actual flying time,'' by the way, and doesn't include preflight
preparations, Bergen said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it still possible to purchase official programs from the
Atlanta Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, as long as supplies last. The Atlanta Super Bowl Host
Committee suggests checking an online source,
www.officialstuff.com, which as of Feb. 9 indicated programs were
available for $19.95 (shipping and handling included). A spokesman
at National Football League headquarters in New York said programs
also can be ordered by calling 1-877-NFL-SHOP (1-877-635-7467).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported how to convert temperatures from
Celsius to Fahrenheit. Is there a similar formula for determining
wind chill?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but it's complex. A simpler way is to check a chart that
has temperatures in Fahrenheit ranging from, say, 45 degrees above
zero to 45 below, relating them to wind velocity.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the formula is complicated is that the wind chill
equivalents don't simply double if, for instance, the actual
temperature is steady but the wind speed doubles. Say the air
temperature is 25 degrees F and the wind velocity is 10 mph; the
numerical table puts the wind chill equivalent temperature at 10.
If the temperature is the same (25) and the wind velocity is
doubled to 20 mph, the wind chill equivalent is 3 below zero. If
the temperature is 25 and the wind velocity is 30 mph, the wind
chill equivalent is 10 degrees below zero.
</P>
<P>
   A chart can be found in World Book Encyclopedia, available at
any library. Look under ``Wind chill.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: On a recent episode of the TV game show ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' the name of the Michelin mascot was identified as
Bibendum. We thought it was simply ``the Michelin tire man.'' What
is the origin of the name Bibendum, and how was it chosen as the
mascot?
</P>
<P>
   A: The genesis of the name Bibendum came in February 1893, at
the conference of the Society of Civil Engineers of Paris, when
Andre Michelin introduced the expression that was to become a
Michelin motto: ``The tire drinks obstacles.'' A year later, at the
Exposition Universelle et Coloniale at Lyon, France, Andre and his
brother, Edouard, noticed a pile of tires of varying sizes. Edouard
remarked to Andre that if the pile of tires had arms, it would look
like a man. Thus was the idea planted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1897, illustrator Marius Rossillon, who went by the pseudonym
O'Galop, showed the Michelin brothers several ideas for publicity.
One was a sketch showing a drinker raising his arm, with the motto,
``Nunc est bibendum'' (``It's time to drink''), after a verse from
Horace. The line reminded Andre of the phrase ``The tire drinks
obstacles.'' So he ordered a poster from O'Galop, who created one
the following year using a character composed of tires and
repeating the ``Nunc est bibendum'' motto.
</P>
<P>
   The association was complete when, several months later, a race
car driver spotted Andre Michelin and shouted, ``There's
Bibendum.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported recently on the selection process for candidates
for the TV program ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' Can you give
me similar information about getting on ``Wheel of Fortune''?
</P>
<P>
   A: A new system called the ``Wheelmobile,'' which will visit
several cities each month, is in the works. There's no schedule yet
for when and where it will be going, said a show spokeswoman. Her
advice: Watch local affiliates on which the program is broadcast,
and they will announce locations and schedules for the Wheelmobile.
</P>
<P>
   Once locations are established, people who want to be an
audience member or a contestant can go there and enter their names
and telephone numbers into a database. Names then will be chosen
randomly.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to make the system more equitable for people
nationwide, rather than having contestants and audience members
basically coming from the show's home base in Southern California,
the spokeswoman said. She added that nothing will happen soon,
because the show is scheduled to go on hiatus for a couple of
months.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the recent spell of cold and ice in Georgia damaged the
Vidalia onion crop?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lovers of the sweet onions will be happy to hear that the
worst of the harsh weather bypassed the exclusive growing area. A
spokeswoman at Morris Farms in east-central Georgia said a few
onions may have suffered, but the majority of the crop is expected
to be fine. She said the onions should be in grocery stores in late
April, and will be available through June, or even longer if kept
in cold storage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports indicate that oil found on a Russian freighter
originated from Iraq. How was that conclusion reached?
</P>
<P>
   A: The vessel carried a load of gas oil, a refined product often
used as diesel fuel. Samples were flown to the U.S. Customs Service
Laboratory in San Francisco, the routine procedure in cases of
suspected smuggling in the Persian Gulf. The sample's chemical
signature then was compared to those in a library of 3,000
reference samples collected worldwide. A positive match showed that
the tanker's cargo had originated as crude oil from an Iraqi well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We lost two pine and five maple trees as a result of ice
storms. They broke in two, so must be removed. Since none caused
damage to my home, my insurance company won't reimburse me. I have
a bid for $4,000 from a tree-removal company to remove the wood. Is
that deductible as a casualty loss on my income tax return?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some of it may be deductible, but several factors must be
taken into account, said IRS spokesman Mark Green.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's a ``$100 rule,'' that must be applied, meaning
you reduce the figure to $3,900. Then you must apply another rule,
which requires calculating 10 percent of your adjusted gross
income. If that is less than $3,900, the resulting dollar figure
becomes the deductible amount. As an example, 10 percent of an
adjusted gross income of $10,000 would be $1,000. Subtract that
from $3,900, and the actual deductible amount is $2,900. On the
other hand, if the adjustable gross income is $50,000, there can be
no deductible, because 10 percent ($5,000) is more than $3,900.
</P>
<P>
   Green said full information on this subject can be found on page
6 of IRS publication 547, Casualties, Disaster and Theft.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know the next Super Bowl will be in Tampa, but have the
dates and locations of others after that been announced?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The next two will be in New Orleans, on Jan. 27, 2002;
and in San Diego, on Jan. 26, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that the Oscar statues are dipped in a 24-karat gold
solution. How much does it cost to produce them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Each statuette costs about $350 to fabricate, said John
Pavlik, communications director at the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 are made each year, he added, to ensure that there are
enough in case of ties, honorary or special achievement awards, or
other unforeseen circumstances. No one knows the exact number of
statuettes that will be presented until the envelopes are opened
March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Other factoids: Each statuette is made from the alloy britannium
and then is plated in copper, nickel silver, and finally 24-karat
gold. The original statuettes were solid bronze, and for a while
they were made of plaster. They stand 13 1/2 inches tall and weigh
8 1/2 pounds. To date, 2,328 have been presented. The official
name, by the way, isn't Oscar; it's the Academy Award of Merit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just got back from Florida, where I received the new $1
coins in change at two stores, Wal-Mart and Sam's Club. I was told
they had exclusive distribution of the coins for a limited period.
If true, how could the government favor one retailer over another?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was a practical reason. The U.S. Mint introduced the
new Golden Dollar in stages, one of which was an arrangement with
Wal-Mart and Sam's Clubs to put the dollar coins into their cash
drawers. Mint spokesman Michael White traced the initiative back to
the lack of acceptance of the earlier Susan B. Anthony dollar coin.
In 20 years, that coin ``never made it into the retail arena,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So this time around, with the new Golden Dollar, the Mint talked
with several retailers about ways to get them into cash drawers _
and consumers' pockets _ quickly. Wal-Mart and Sam's Clubs were the
first to agree with the Mint to begin using the coins, White said.
The Mint thought people would be more likely to get them quickly at
these huge retail outlets than at a bank, he added.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, the Golden Dollars were distributed in some boxes of
Cheerios. On Jan. 18, the Federal Reserve began receiving a supply.
On Jan. 27, the Federal Reserve began sending them to financial
institutions, and the Mint began offering the coins in rolls and
bags on its Web site. Wal-Marts and Sam's Clubs began distributing
them Jan. 30, with the promotion limited to February.
</P>
<P>
   March 1 is the target date for 200 million of the new coins to
be in general circulation.
</P>

 Valerie Gladstone's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was
about the Brazilian choreographer Deborah Colker.  
 By VALERIE GLADSTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Julio Bocca, a dashing star of American Ballet
Theater, did not look himself as he rehearsed in a mid-Manhattan
studio early this month. With his toes turned in, his back arched
and his hands placed on his hips, not a trace of Albrecht or Romeo
could be discerned in his demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   While still jet-lagged from a flight from Buenos Aires and worn
from rehearsing his own company, Ballet Argentina, for its recent
performance at the World Financial Center Winter Garden, he was
trying to absorb a choreographic style as different from Petipa as
night from day.
</P>
<P>
   And he had to learn it fast, because last Tuesday he was to make
his Broadway debut in the Tony Award-winning musical ``Fosse.'' A
compilation of 30 dance sequences, it features excerpts from
``Sweet Charity'' and ``Dancin''' by the quintessential Broadway
choreographer Bob Fosse.
</P>
<P>
   Bocca joins the show through April 2, when Keith Roberts _ a
former Ballet Theater principal who was bitten by the Broadway bug
when he danced the lead in Matthew Bourne's irreverent ``Swan
Lake'' _ comes in for the summer. ``Fosse,'' which opened in
January 1999, is now a plum for big-name male ballet dancers.
</P>
<P>
   From the sidelines, the show's dance captain, Bill Burns,
unobtrusively observed Bocca. He had scheduled five hours a day,
six days a week for two weeks to get Bocca up to par for his
several numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every step means something,'' said Burns, who, along with J.
Kathleen Watkins, coaches all 35 cast members. ``It's never just
dancing for dancing's sake. I tell them some of the images Bob had
in mind. Then I let them plan their attack.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first chord of ``Bojangles,'' from ``Dancin' ,'' Bocca
tilted his head to the side, rolled his shoulders and fell into a
slow, mellow soft shoe. But there was nothing of the ordinary
hoofer about him. ``Good and loose,'' Burns said approvingly. Bocca
smiled with some relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob felt that ballet dancers made his dances look classy,''
said Ann Reinking, the show's co-choreographer with Chet Walker.
``That's why we've had them in the show from the beginning. It
gives people who never go to the ballet a chance to see these
superb dancers. Plus, their star power doesn't hurt the box
office.'' In fact, ticket sales took off for Bocca's first week.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Richardson, a former principal dancer with Ballet
Theater, led the pack and won a Tony nomination for best supporting
actor last year. Scott Jovovich, a former principal with the
Joffrey Ballet and the Pittsburgh Ballet, followed Richardson and
continues in the show, and Roberts briefly preceded Bocca and
returns when he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the coming months, Damian Woetzel, a New York City
Ballet principal, also plans to don bowler hat and gyrate. To him,
it means more than dancing. ``I can't wait to sing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Bocca was invited into the show last fall by Reinking, who
starred in many Fosse productions, he asked whether she would
rehearse him alone. ``I wanted to make sure,'' he said, ``that Ann
felt comfortable with me in Fosse's work.'' She agreed to teach him
``Percussion 4,'' also from ``Dancin','' an explosive solo danced
to drums and nicknamed ``Perk 4'' by the cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells the story of a man,'' said Reinking, ``going into a
studio and trying to figure out, as he watches himself in the
mirror, what he can do, what his next step should be. He's fighting
age. But as he warms up, he loses that grim feeling and starts to
have fun _ though soon his time runs out and he has to leave. In
four or five minutes you go through four or five hours in a life.
It's a tour de force.'' In a little over an hour, both Reinking and
Bocca felt he had a grip on it.
</P>
<P>
   Why do male ballet dancers so eagerly join ``Fosse''? ``There's
a bit of the grass-must-be-greener on the other side,'' said Burns.
``But they also like the ensemble work. I remember Desmond wanted
to be in every number. They love the energy. And the work doesn't
squelch personality; charisma is crucial for these parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps speaking for all of them, Jovovich said, ``It's nice to
get out from behind all those tutus.'' There's also not a little
machismo in their choice. ``Perk 4'' can ``trash the body, it's so
arduous,'' said Jovovich. ``Nothing compares to it. I think of it
as sporting event and approach it as a challenge. It's very
athletic but needs very good ballet technique. I love it and I hate
it. I never do `Perk 4' without trepidation. It's a very liberating
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts called the work ``manly'' and ``animalistic.'' He too
said he had to get pumped up to do it. In Richardson's opinion:
``Fosse loved to see the effort put into his dances. He wanted to
see the sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   At his rehearsal, Bocca was sweating, at least metaphorically.
``Right now,'' he said, ``I'm afraid if I do badly in the show, it
will reflect on my position at Ballet Theater. It's a new
beginning, but I'm scared.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not the only one. What if, once these dancers return to
their regular gigs, they can't get ``Fosse'' out of their blood?
Will Bocca confuse his winged creatures in the middle of ``Swan
Lake,'' swivel his hips, click his fingers and launch into ``Bye,
Bye Blackbird''? Could Roberts forget his gallant self in ``Romeo
and Juliet'' and slink around like the sexy dude in ``Cool Hand
Luke''? Will Woetzel break into song in Balanchine's ``Stars and
Stripes''? Oh, what has Fosse wrought?

NEIMAN ON ART AND THE EYES OF A DOG
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   The prolific artist  &UR; LeRoy Neiman &LR; , whose works depict such
treasured American themes as golf, football, racehorses and
interiors of bars, is the subject of a retrospective that begins
February 20 at the Franklin Bowles Gallery in San Francisco. ``He's
wined and dined with kings and presidents and sat with three
generations of cultural icons,'' says his press materials,
``including  &UR; Joe DiMaggio &LR; ,  &UR; Frank Sinatra &LR; ,  &UR; Mick Jagger &LR; ,
 &UR; Muhammad &LR; 
 &UR; Ali &LR; ,  &UR; Mark McGwire &LR;  and  &UR; John Lennon &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Neiman told us that he's a fan of abstract expressionists
 &UR; Willem de Kooning &LR;  and  &UR; Franz Klein &LR;  and that  &UR; Richard Diebenkorn &LR; 
is ``a hell of a painter. I think that guy out there,  &UR; Wayne &LR; 
 &UR; Thiebaud &LR; , is a giant. I've done some paintings on commissions of
the bridges in San Francisco, and I've always felt that it was his
territory. He gave me a different way to look at San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Does being a star of pop culture make it harder for him to be
taken seriously as an artist? ``People just paint,'' said Neiman,
whose work is largely commissioned. ``I paint anything. If someone
comes by and wants me to paint their dog, they put it on the table
and I paint it. I've painted sheepdogs, I've painted full-size
poodles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you something about painting a dog: It's not like
painting a horse. A thoroughbred has got markings, and the owner is
very particular about it. But if you paint a dog, it's like a
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to do a portrait of someone, it's life size,
more or less to scale. If you do a full figure, you would scale it
down to fit. But if somebody brings a dog in, it's very hard to
paint that dog in a different scale. That's my problem. ... One of
the great things about living in New York City is that people have
great dogs. ... You look at a dog. You can't do a dumb dog. Every
dog's eyes are intelligent and they're alert. You can do some
people and they're kind of docile. But you don't find a dumb dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Neiman said he'd be paid about $10,000 for a watercolor of a
dog.
</P>
<P>
   The artist is also being honored in San Francisco by the naming
after him of an after-school art program sponsored by the Good
Tidings Foundation.

   &UR; ASTRONAUT FINALLY GETS HIS DUE &LR;

   Astronaut  &UR; John Young &LR; , who flew Gemini, Apollo and shuttle
missions and is the most traveled man in space, will be honored
with a plaque to be unveiled on February 23 at the California
Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. Young, who was born in San
Francisco, lives in Houston nowadays. The Westin St. Francis is
putting him up for a week.
</P>
<P>
   The honor for Young is the result of a campaign by space buff
 &UR; Ken Winans &LR; , who lives in Mill Valley and whose efforts included
successful lobbying of Mayor  &UR; Willie Brown &LR;  and the San Francisco
supervisors.

PLEADING GUILTY, COUPLE DETAIL RUSSIAN MONEY LAUNDERING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN with RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former executive of the Bank of New York and her
husband told a federal judge Wednesday that they had helped a group
of small but politically connected Russian banks create an
elaborate money laundering scheme to move billions of dollars
illegally out of Russia through the U.S. bank.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 18 months of investigation, federal authorities
delivered Lucy Edwards, a former Bank of New York vice president,
and her husband, Peter Berlin, to U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
They described how between 1996 and last year, more than $7 billion
left Russia illegally and flowed into a network of front company
accounts at the Bank of New York that were controlled by Berlin.
From there, the funds were transferred to offshore accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The network, Edwards and her husband said, was designed by
Russian bankers to whisk funds electronically between Russia and
the United States for three broad purposes: to evade Russian taxes
on money from legitimate business transactions, to avoid Russian
customs duties on imports and to ``wash'' the profits of outright
criminal enterprises through legitimate banks, including a $300,000
ransom payment in 1998 to the kidnappers of a businessman in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who said they were paid nearly $2 million for their
services, said the scheme allowed Russian bankers to conduct
illegal banking activities in the United States that circumvented
the scrutiny of federal banking regulators and law enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I closed my eyes to that fact,'' said Edwards, who worked in
the Eastern European division of the Bank of New York. She said she
``suspected the accounts were being used by many people for illicit
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple agreed to plead guilty to a series of federal crimes,
which carry up to 10 years in prison and heavy fines, and to
cooperate with investigators in a plea bargain that U.S.
authorities hope will produce more charges. ``More than one or two
people had to turn the other way,'' an investigator said. ``You
don't transfer $7 billion through the spanking new Eastern European
division without somebody knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York, which has not been accused of any
wrongdoing, declined to comment Wednesday. It fired Edwards shortly
after the federal money laundering investigation became public last
August, and has been cooperating with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's remarkable courtroom appearance, the bank's
culpability, and that of its directors and officers, is still not
clear. Federal prosecutors have great discretion in deciding
whether to pursue criminal charges against the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents and the couples' oral confession named several
Moscow banks as part of the illegal scheme. According to previously
unpublicized documents and to Western financiers with direct
knowledge of the banks' affairs, one of the banks, Sobinbank, is
controlled by members of a powerful group of Russian financiers
known as the oligarchs, who own much of Russia's wealth and have
wielded enormous influence within the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The court confessions Wednesday provided the first detailed
public accounts by participants in the money laundering scheme,
which had been under investigation since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, Berlin, and three companies controlled by Berlin _
Benex, Bec International, and Lowland _ pleaded guilty to several
charges: laundering money to promote criminal activity and defraud
the Russian government; conducting unlicensed banking operations;
establishing an unauthorized branch of a foreign bank; operating an
illegal money transmitting business; bribing a bank employee;
receiving illegal payments as a bank employee and laundering those
payments abroad; tax evasion; and fraudulently obtaining visas for
Russians to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the couple also
would plead guilty to bribing one of Edwards' superiors at the
bank. No such plea was entered Wednesday.

 NEW YORK: entered Wednesday.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Appearing calm and rested, and smiling occasionally at one
another and their lawyers, Edwards and Berlin described the origins
and purpose of the money laundering operation during a court
appearance that lasted slightly more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a small, well-groomed woman who spoke with a soft
Russian accent, said she was first approached in late 1995 by
representatives of DKB, a Russian bank whose full name is
Depozitarno-Kliringovy Bank, who were interested in using the Bank
of New York's offices and technology to illegally move funds out of
Russia. During the following years, the 41 year-old Edwards said,
those activities came to include money laundering and the other
schemes to which she pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Russian banking during the 1990s has been a notoriously
freewheeling affair, with allegations of extensive involvement in
the banks by organized criminals. Edwards noted in her testimony
that DKB's Moscow employees told her in 1998 that they were afraid
to leave the bank's headquarters because ``customers with machine
guns were waiting for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlin, 45, testified that Benex, Becs and Lowland all had
accounts at the Bank of New York that he had opened on behalf of
his overseers in Moscow. He said that the companies were staffed by
DKB employees and that Edwards helped install Bank of New York
computer software in the Forest Hills, Queens, office of a Benex
affiliate to allow funds to be moved electronically.
</P>
<P>
   The couple said that DKB representatives told them in fall 1998
that they had acquired control of another bank, Commercial Flamingo
Bank, and wanted a new company created to move funds from that bank
through the Bank of New York. Berlin opened Lowland in Jersey City,
N.J., for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   For their cooperation with their handlers in Moscow, Edwards and
Berlin received $1.8 million, which represented a percentage of the
funds moved through the Benex network. ``We were paid substantial
commissions for doing very little work,'' Edwards noted.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and Berlin said they directed that those funds be
deposited in off-shore bank accounts so they could avoid paying
taxes on the money in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said she had assisted ``hundreds'' of Russians to secure
bogus visas for travel to the United States and that most of them
worked in the Russian banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that after the couple moved to London in 1996,
they paid a Bank of New York employee, Svetlana Kudryavtsev, $500 a
month to make sure the Benex accounts were operating properly.
Kudryavtsev, a lower-level employee at the bank, is the individual
cited in the court charges for taking bribes. Kudryavtsev was
indicted last month for allegedly lying to federal investigators
about whether she or her husband had received money or loans from
Edwards. Her lawyer could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but
on Monday he described the charges as unwarranted. The indictment
alleges that Kudryavtsev received about $30,000 from Edwards and
Berlin between 1995 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and Berlin face a maximum of 10 years in prison for the
charges against them when they appear at a sentencing hearing on
May 3, but it is likely that their cooperation with authorities
will lessen the severity of any punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucy Edwards and Peter Berlin have come voluntarily to New
York from their home in London to accept responsibility for their
part in the illegal transfer of funds through the Bank of New
York,'' T. Barry Kingham, the couple's attorney, said Wednesday in
Manhattan. ``They have cooperated fully with the investigation
being conducted by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office and they
will continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple has surrendered about $1 million to authorities, some
of which was maintained in Swiss bank accounts, and they will be
released from federal custody pending their posting of a $500,000
bail bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's pleas starkly demonstrate the serious dangers of
unlicensed and unregulated entities operating within the American
banking system as cover for money laundering and other criminal
activities,'' said Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan,
in a prepared statement Wednesday. ``Evading and disregarding
American laws in this manner significantly undermines the integrity
of United States and foreign banking systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Schiliro, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New
York office, said that the investigation ``has followed a long,
winding road throughout the United States and abroad'' and that his
agency is ``determined to continue following the complicated trail
of money and banking transactions until all those who have
committed crimes are identified and charged.''

VOTERS IN SOUTH CAROLINA NO LONGER PREDICTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SC-REPUBS, SC-POLITICAL-PROFILE) 
(rk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY and DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Not quite a decade ago, Gov. Carroll Campbell
Jr. of South Carolina bought an airplane ticket to Germany and
brought home a BMW. Not a car, but a factory. For Campbell, who had
a talent for luring foreign industry, the arrival of BMW meant
thousands of new jobs and international cachet for a state once
dismissed as a redneck backwater.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, Campbell, who stepped down in 1995 after two
terms, has felt the burden of his own success. For two decades, he
has delivered his state's primary for every Republican presidential
front-runner. Just as New Hampshire has made a habit of deflating
front-runners, South Carolina has propped them back up. The state
became known as the fire wall, the place where upstarts and
insurgents, notably Pat Buchanan, inevitably flamed out.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell is again trolling for support for yet another wounded
front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, for the Republican
primary on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the state he is encountering, a place he dominated and
helped revive, is no longer the same. His political machine is
still intact, but there is a new generation of voters, many of them
new to South Carolina, drawn by industries like BMW. They are
conservative, but they are not predictable, or necessarily
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably have a weakened fire wall,'' said Campbell, who is
now a lobbyist in Washington. ``We used to be a state where four or
five people ran everything. Now, it's open and it's challenging,
and I think that is good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate beneficiary of this evolving political culture is
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who is trying to stoke South
Carolina's populist streak and build an improbable coalition of
Republicans, independents and alienated Democrats. A decade ago,
political observers say, McCain could never have pulled this off,
and even now, his chances of victory on Saturday depend on an
unprecedented turnout of natives and newcomers outside the old
Republican mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome, the competitiveness of the race has
underscored how the changing national economy is changing politics
everywhere, even in once-isolated places like South Carolina. It
was evidence in New Hampshire, where a new pool of voters created
by that state's technology boom helped McCain trounce Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But there are new pools of voters here, whether transplants from
the Midwest and the Northeast working along the I-85 corridor, or
the thousands of retirees, many of them ex-military, who continue
to repopulate the coastline. There also are younger native
Republicans, raised in the state's suburbs, who are less inclined
to walk lock step with establishment leaders.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's candidacy has sparked an open rebellion by two
Republican congressmen, Lindsay Graham and Mark Sanford, who have
embraced his populist message and have escorted him around the
state, partly in hopes of burnishing their own chances at higher
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That granular political structure, built up around county
courthouses, is all gone now,'' said Blease Graham, a professor of
state history at the University of South Carolina. ``Things are so
much more fluid now. People are mobile, and the old loyalties are
dying.''
</P>
<P>
   What is changing South Carolina more than anything is
prosperity. The dispute over flying the Confederate battle flag
atop the state Capitol is a reminder that the state's past is far
from buried. But the present and future are in plain view: The
booming manufacturing zone along I-85 in the north and the retirees
flocking to the coastal low country, particularly near Hilton Head,
where the accents are often from Chicago and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Not more than 40 years ago, South Carolina suffered endemic
poverty, masked by the aristocratic sheen of Charleston. Now, the
state is a national leader in attracting manufacturing, including
$42 billion in capital investment during the 1990s, a boom that
created 207,000 jobs. Once reactionary and isolated, South Carolina
now has 500 foreign companies that employ nearly 85,000 people. Of
the state's 3.9 million residents, nearly 144,000, mostly from the
Midwest and the Northeast, have moved in since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people think we're a bunch of corn pones with pickup trucks
and trailers, they're wrong,'' said Vic Sherlock, a recent
transplant from suburban Washington who is now an officer in the
Greenville County Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This state is going through dramatic, dramatic growth,''
Sherlock said. ``There is the old guard and the new guard. There is
a very hard-core conservative base. It seems like the new people
coming in are predominantly Republican but perhaps not as
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Along I-85, growth is everywhere. In Greenville, the downtown
streets are lined with restaurants like Bistro Europa or with bars
where conversations are often conducted in German. Local residents
have nicknamed the interstate ``the autobahn'' not only because of
the high rate of speed but because of the German companies that are
alongside.
</P>
<P>
   In Spartanburg, a city northeast of Greenville, the county
Republican Party is run by a New Jersey transplant, Rick Beltram.
Newspapers from New Delhi, India, are available in the new
Spartanburg public library. The old mill villages of white frame
houses that were built for textile workers are still standing, but
most of the mills have closed. A new downtown hotel is planned with
a nine-hole golf course, and Republicans hold fund-raisers at the
BMW museum beside the factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told somebody the other day that this place is beginning to
look like New Jersey,'' said Gary Towery, who left Spartanburg more
than 40 years ago and returned in 1996, perhaps overstating the
comparison a bit. ``I look around, and I am mesmerized by the
difference in the people. You don't hear the accents as
predominantly as you did before.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Few politicians in South Carolina have better gauged the
changing moods of the state than Campbell. He built the state's
Republican Party in the 1970s and 1980s, capitalizing on white
resentment of the civil rights era and the growing sense of
alienation from Washington. He and allies like Sen. Strom Thurmond
and Lee Atwater, a Republican strategist, bridged the state's two
rival regions, assembling a coalition of Charleston Republicans
with upstate religious conservatives, many of whom were moving into
the middle class and to the right economically. There were 29
Republicans out of 124 state legislators in 1987; by 1994, the
party had a majority and had elected a House speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a party builder, more of a partisan by nature than his
predecessors,'' said Warren Tompkins, Campbell's chief of staff,
who is now the chief strategist in South Carolina for the Bush
campaign. ``He was able to utilize the growing discontentment with
Washington, and the new economic climate, to add people to the
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   But prosperity has brought a growing independence among voters,
as the freshness and rigidity of the earlier conversion to
Republicanism had begun to fade. Voters began identifying
themselves as independents, splitting their tickets, and black
voters became better organized. The turning point came in 1998,
when Campbell's hand-picked successor, Republican Gov. David
Beasley, lost his re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans not only lost the governor's office to Jim Hodges,
but their majority in the Legislature was cut, and they failed to
dislodge Sen. Ernest Hollings, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some of the pains that you suffer from when you
achieve majority status,'' Tompkins said. ``You're not as tightly
knit as you were when there were only 29 Republicans. Back then, we
never had to worry about voters wandering off the reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Bush-McCain race is the prism through which change is
being measured. Whit Ayres, a prominent Republican pollster in
Atlanta who once worked in Campbell's administration, said the
influence of newcomers is significant but should not be overstated.
The number of people voting in the Republican primary has grown
from 149,000 in 1992 to 274,000 in 1996, and Ayres noted that many
of the new residents have joined the establishment embodied by
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're talking about the plant manager for BMW in
Spartanburg, that person is very much a part of the traditional
business establishment,'' Ayres said. ``But if we're talking about
the guy on the factory floor, I think he may be for McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Buchanan had hoped to shatter the Campbell
coalition by dividing the Bubbas from the Blue Bloods with his
blunt appeal for trade barriers. But he badly miscalculated. The
factory workers who collected paychecks from foreign corporations
such as BMW, Michelin and Hitachi concluded that tariffs were not
in their best interest.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is taking a different tack, preaching free trade like
Bush, but hammering away at the Washington establishment even as
Bush tries to wed him to it. The great unknown is whether the same
wave of independents who poured forth for McCain in New Hampshire _
largely under the radar of polls _ will appear in South Carolina.
He is counting on military retirees along the coast, just as Bush
has worked the Bible Belt in the upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Brafman, 72, a Republican and chairman of the Beaufort
County Council, said McCain's appeal is one of personality. He said
demographic changes in his area skews handicapping. He suspects,
for example, that many of the new residents are Democrats, maybe 25
percent. ``They are very quiet,'' Brafman said, but they do vote in
national elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever experienced anything like this where
nobody knows what will happen,'' said Brafman, who supports Bush.
``It's different upstate, where Bush has the edge. ... It's hard to
gauge how Republican are going to vote, because ideology has
nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanford, whose congressional district encompasses much of the
state's northern coast, said the notion of voters following orders
from above could get someone ``clubbed to death with a 7-iron'' at
the retirement communities on Hilton Head.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this whole notion after New Hampshire that the
Southerners in South Carolina would throw out what the Yankees had
done,'' he said. ``But in many neighborhoods in my district, there
are more Yankees than Southerners. That whole notion just isn't
true. The uncle of that voter up north is probably retired here on
Hilton Head Island.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of Campbell? He stood at the back of a Bush rally last
week, talking with reporters. He spoke a bit testily of Graham and
Sanford; he said Graham, who became famous for his role in last
year's impeachment proceedings, is trying out for a U.S. Senate
run, a notion Graham doesn't exactly deny. ``You're gonna have
cliques,'' Campbell said of the split.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has taken a leave from his lobbying job to help Bush.
He believes Bush will win. His numbers are rising in the polls, and
South Carolina residents love the Bush family. Asked whether
politicking was harder today, he laughed. ''Probably,'' he said.
``Because we had a lot of success then, and it doesn't come as easy
anymore.''

 &HT;    Eating low-fat? Choose corn tortillas over flour
 &HT;    By Karen Collins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Are tortillas considered a grain product?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Anything made from plant grains such as wheat, corn,
rye, oats or barley is a grain product. Corn tortillas are
generally whole grain products and therefore a good source of fiber
and many nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Flour tortillas are most often made from refined flour, though
some are made from whole wheat flour, so look for these.
</P>
<P>
   Corn tortillas usually contain no more than 1 gram of fat, but
fat content of flour tortillas can range from 2 to 5 grams. If you
eat more than one tortilla, this small difference can add up, which
is a concern for weight control. In addition, the fat comes from
hydrogenated oils that contain trans fatty acids (not a
heart-healthy fat).
</P>
<P>
   The calories in tortillas also vary: Small ones may be about
equal to a slice of bread, but larger tortillas may contain the
calories of two slices of bread.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much can people lower their blood cholesterol through
diet alone?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most studies have shown that a moderate reduction in
saturated fat (the cholesterol-raising fat found in meats and
high-fat dairy products) can lower total blood cholesterol about 8
percent (maybe 10 percent or more if the original diet was quite
high-fat).
</P>
<P>
   A more important indicator of heart disease risk is to look
specifically at LDL (''bad'') cholesterol. Studies show that
moderately low-fat diets can reduce LDL levels anywhere from 5
percent to 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A much more severe restriction of saturated fat that is part of
a total lifestyle program advocated by researcher Dean Ornish,
M.D., has reportedly reduced LDL cholesterol by about 37 percent.
Adding more fruits, vegetables, whole grains and beans for fiber
can sometimes enhance a diet's cholesterol-lowering ability.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have a genetic tendency to produce high blood
cholesterol, while others are very influenced by diet. But even in
people who require medication to bring blood cholesterol to normal
levels, a healthy diet is still important for the medication to
work properly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do the fruit snacks that come in different shapes and strips
count toward the recommended number of fruit servings for children?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Although these snacks are labeled ``made with real
fruit'', they are not 100% fruit by any means. You can see this for
yourself by checking the ingredient list. These products are made
with fruit or juice concentrate, but have quite a bit of added
sugar, too. Although extra vitamin C is sometimes added, they are
generally low in other nutrients and don't offer the dietary fiber
that is found in fruit itself. For your child's lunchbox or
after-school snack, fresh fruits like apples, pears, oranges and
bananas are much more nutritious options. For added variety, pack
small boxes of raisins, plastic bags of dried fruit mixtures,
individual-serving packages of applesauce, or fresh kiwi cut in
half to eat by spooning it straight from the skin.

GORE URGES SENATE TO REJECT APPOINTMENT OF BRADLEY SMITH TO FEC 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH N.C. _ Presidential hopeful Al Gore on Wednesday weighed
in on the man Republicans have chosen to join the Federal Election
Commission, saying the Senate should reject Bradley Smith because
of his opposition to campaign-finance regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I neither support this nomination nor agree with the views of
professor Bradley Smith,'' the vice president said in a statement
issued during a campaign stop in North Carolina. ``The last thing
we need is an FEC commissioner who publicly questions not only the
constitutionality of proposed reforms, but also the
constitutionality of current limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's statement came four days after his Democratic
presidential opponent, Bill Bradley, blasted Smith's nomination.
While Gore has endorsed more stringent campaign-finance laws, some
of his own fund-raising activities during the 1996 presidential
election have raised questions.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley called Clinton's Feb. 9 appointment of Smith to the FEC
``a major retreat on campaign-finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week President Clinton forwarded Smith's name to the Senate
as part of a deal with Republican leader Trent Lott of Mississippi.
The president and the senator made a deal that Clinton would not
block Smith's appointment in exchange for the Senate agreeing to
vote on several of Clinton's judicial nominations that have been
bottled up in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it, but I decided that I should not shut down the
whole appointments process and depart from the plain intent of the
law,'' Clinton said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But John Czwartacki, a Lott spokesman, said, ``There was no quid
pro quo. The two are not linked.''
</P>
<P>
   The FEC, a six-member panel that oversees campaign-finance
activity is, by law, split evenly between Democrats and
Republicans. The White House traditionally honors the opposing
party's selection.
</P>
<P>
   However, Smith's selection has been controversial since his name
was floated last year by Republicans. Clinton held the nomination
up for months in the hopes that Republicans would find a more
acceptable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ongoing public controversy over the GOP's choice,
Gore told reporters that he did not speak to Clinton about the
nominee until after the president had sent his name to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know the nomination was pending,'' Gore said. The
vice president explained that he is no longer regularly consulting
with the president about policy matters. ``I'm out of the road full
time now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore defended the arrangement between Clinton and Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a considered judgement because of the unfair position
adopted by Senator Lott,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, the vice president also called upon Republican
presidential candidates John McCain and George W. Bush to pressure
Senate Republicans to reject Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John McCain and George Bush support campaign-finance reform
_ as they profess _ they should have their Republican colleagues
withdraw professor Smith as their nominee,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Embarking on a two-day southern swing, Gore mixed official
duties with campaigning Wednesday as he took a helicopter tour of
Georgia communities that had been hard hit by tornadoes earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
   While the Gore campaign must pay for the political trips, the
taxpayers picked up the tab for his tour of the tornado damage
because it was deemed official business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is a candidate for president but he still has his
constitutional duties as the vice president,'' said Gore spokesman
Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Quinn, a spokesman in the vice president's office in
Washington, could not provide an exact figure of exactly how much
the tornado portion of the trip cost taxpayers. She said it was a
``very small fraction of the trip.''

SCORE ANOTHER HIT FOR BIZARRE TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mystery man sits in the shadows. The prospective brides
stand on a stage in wedding gowns, waiting for the proposal. And
every moment the suspense builds _ and so do the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   It took place Tuesday night, with a special on the Fox Network
called ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?,'' the latest
offbeat real-life format to shake up a network television season
that is already one of the zaniest in memory.
</P>
<P>
   The entire landscape of network television was changed by the
success of ABC's game show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and
Fox's Tuesday night show this week proved that variations on that
theme can reach similar ratings heights.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's two-hour special featured a parade of would-be brides
competing to be chosen by a multi-millionaire, and it culminated in
an on-the-air wedding presided over by a Nevada judge. Drawing
stunning ratings, it attracted more young viewers _ especially
female viewers _ than even the ABC's ``Millionaire'' show.
</P>
<P>
   The show's audience built strikingly through the night, as it
edged toward the actual wedding, growing from 10 million viewers in
its first half hour to 12.3 million in the second half hour to 18.9
million in the third half hour to a huge 22.8 million in the final
half hour.
</P>
<P>
   That final figure would have put the special among the top six
shows in all television, if it had been aired last week. The
ratings were even bigger among teen-age girls and young women. In
its final half hour, the show pulled in more than a third of all
women under the age of 35 watching television Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   One widespread reaction to the show's format was revulsion _ the
kind that apparently helps, not hurts ratings _ that women had
signed on to marry themselves off to an unknown man on a television
show.
</P>
<P>
   Women around the country discussed the show animatedly
Wednesday, some complaining that it reinforced stereotypes of women
desperate to be married, others clearly taken with the show's
fantasy element. The Fox website (Who Wants to Marry.com) was so
flooded with requests from women to be on the next edition of ``Who
Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire'' that it crashed Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took something like this to make the Miss America pageant
look good to me,'' Patricia Ireland, president of the National
Organization of Women said in an interview Wednesday night. ``At
least with the Miss America pageant you get scholarship money and
the guarantee of a year-long run. It perpetuates some very limited
stereotypes that men are success objects and women are sex
objects.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Darnell, the Fox executive who created the show,
defended the concept, saying that he planned to do another show
``the other way around,'' with a female millionaire choosing a
husband.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If you looked at these people at the end of the
show, you could tell it was less about the money, than it was about
the relationship. It'll either go on, or it won't. If they don't
get along, it won't work no matter how much money is involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The special, which aired during the February sweeps period,
became the latest example of network television reaching beyond
fictional drama and comedies for entertainment. Beyond the batch of
game shows, initiated by the success of ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' the networks have been lining up shows that reach
into real-life activities not usually meant to take place on
camera.
</P>
<P>
   CBS already has scheduled two shows for the summer that will
feature real people living together in enforced situations, one in
a house where every move they make will be on-camera, the other on
a desert island off Borneo. Both also involve big prize money for
the last surviving contestant.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell is known in television for creating such Fox specials as
``When Good Pets Go Bad'' and ``When Animals Attack.'' Last year
one of his programming ideas was a live show in which a 747 would
crash in the desert, an idea that top Fox executives made a point
of publicly disavowing.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Darnell was asked to create specials that avoided all
violence. His first idea was the marriage special. He acknowledged
that his concept had been to bring together the formats of the Miss
America pageant, ``The Dating Game'' and ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I thought it would be a little clever special,'' Darnell
said. ``The ratings and reactions to this are just stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   The show was promoted no more heavily than the average Fox
special. Probably because viewers starting to calling friends, the
audience built each half hour, receiving its biggest boost after
one hour, when ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' ended. For
the next hour, ``Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?'' was the most
popular show on television.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell said more than a thousand women signed up for Tuesday's
show, a number that was pared down, through interviews, to the 50
contestants in the pageant, which was taped in Las Vegas last week.
The format included parades in evening gowns and beach wear, and
extensive interview segments where the women described their
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The multi-millionaire, shown only in shadow, then pared the
group down to 10, with the help of a panel made up of his friends
and family. The 10 semifinalists went through further interview
sessions to bring the number down to five finalists. The
contestants then appeared in wedding gowns. The multi-millionaire
made his choice, kneeling to propose. The wedding, officiated by a
Nevada judge, followed.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives said the contestants had all undergone
appropriate health tests. They said that a ``standard pre-nuptual
agreement'' was signed, but they would not be specific about its
contents. From the show, the winner received _ in addition to the
husband _ a two-week vacation (the honeymoon), an Isuzu Trooper
automobile and a $35,000 diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives said the couple went off to the Caribbean, but
they would not disclose where. The details of their relationship
will be up to them, Darnell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is they are taking it very slow, trying to
find out what their relationship will really be,'' Darnell said.
</P>
<P>
   The bride turned out to be Darva Conger, a 34-year-old emergency
room nurse from Santa Monica, Calif., who had also served in the
Gulf War. The lucky _ and rich _ man was Rick Rockwell, 42,
described on the show as a real estate developer and motivational
speaker who came to California after college to be a stand-up
comic. Darnell said Fox had throughly researched his financial
status, and he does, in fact, have assets worth many millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's entertainment division said Wednesday that it is not yet
ready to announce a second edition of the special. But Darnell said
that given the success of this one, more can be expected. Fox will
repeat an edited, one-hour version of this special next Tuesday
night at 8, for all those who missed it the first time. And, as
Darnell said, sometime in the future it will be done the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he believed there was such willingness on the part of
both single women and a single millionaire to take part in a
produced, taped and edited blessed event, Darnell said, ``Obviously
it's hard to meet people.''

   &QL;  NEVADA SEED CO.'S BANKRUPTCY HEIGHTENS FARM CRISIS By Sara
Barnett
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb.16 - The seed-supply company that once prided
itself on keeping the White House lawn green is in the red. When
AgriBioTech, the world's leading seller of forage and turfgrass
seed, filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 25, agriculture officials say it
put farmers at an even graver risk. The bankruptcy has already
caused an estimated loss of more than $100 million in agriculture
revenue nationwide. Founded in 1995, ABT sought to consolidate the
seed industry through mergers and acquisitions. By 1999, the
company had successfully purchased 34 smaller seed distributors.
For the past five years, ABT has been the nation's main provider of
alfalfa and other seeds used in crops such as corn, soybean, wheat
and other vegetables. The company has also supplied the
turfgrass-grounding for many major league athletic facilities, and
its product was even used by White House landscapers. Agriculture
officials in Washington and in Western states say ABT's bankruptcy
is having a domino effect across the country. Crop farmers, who are
already struggling nationwide, must cope without being able to
purchase seed from ABT, which could lead to even more dramatic
losses. Even the John Deere Company has been affected, reporting an
estimated $800,000 in cancelled farm equipment orders in the last
two weeks. ABT, however, says it never intended to be a provider
for the seed industry, that they wanted to quickly sell off the
smaller companies - something they had trouble doing. Last
February, ABT tried to solve their problem by hiring a new senior
management group ``with expertise in operation and integration,''
and set goals to build company capitol, manage the acquired
operations and achieve profit in 2000, according to a company
profile.
</P>
<P>
   By September, ABT had reassured its growers through letters and
meetings that the company was ``healthy and solvent,'' on its way
to almost $400 million in yearly revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is there was basically no warning,'' said Don
Schriftinson, policy director for the Wyoming Department of
Agriculture. ``They said to stick with them, and now farmers are in
a cash-flow crisis with no where to turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Also being crippled by ABT's closing are the seed growers who
were selling their product to the Nevada-based company. One grower
said that nore than 1,000 seed growers indirectly contracted by ABT
could still be held responsible for delivering seed without payment
for the next two years. Of the 13 states with contracted companies,
Oregon and Washington have been hit the hardest, each seeking
nearly $40 million in contract compensation alone. Congressmen in
Wyoming and Idaho have already asked for federal assistance. In a
letter to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, the Idaho delegation
wrote, ``be prepared to intervene with the appropriate emergency
assistance for it will become apparent that the effects of this
bankruptcy will force large numbers of seed farmers out of
business.'' Though Wyoming farmers only lost $4.5 in contract
money, the state will eventually require nearly $20 million to help
stabilize the numerous communities effected by the ABT fiasco,
according to state officials. Finding it too costly to wait for
federal decisions to be made, the Wyoming State legislature intends
to pass it's own emergency relief bill by the end of the week.
Bankruptcy proceedings could give ABT an estimated $80 million in
asset liquidation sales. But officials say that money will be used
to pay off credit debts and other loans. ``I am a seed grower and
the focus should not be 'poor seed grower,''' said Wyoming farmer
Terry Jones. ``States need to deal with their local economy now so
they won't have a huge, disastrous impact not just on their rural
communities but on the nation as a whole.''

VULCAN VENTURES TO PURCHASE THE SPORTING NEWS FROM TIMES MIRROR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul G. Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates,
announced Wednesday that his company, Vulcan Ventures Inc., is
buying The Sporting News, the country's oldest sporting magazine,
from the Times Mirror Co.
</P>
<P>
   Executives involved in the talks said that Vulcan agreed to pay
more than $100 million for the magazine and its other properties,
which include a sports-licensing venture, a line of annual preview
magazines, a book-publishing arm and the Web site affiliated with
the magazine, www.thesportingnews.com.
</P>
<P>
   While it is Allen's first magazine purchase, it is part of a
strategy to develop relationships with consumers on the Internet
through magazine sites, and a Vulcan executive added that the
company was exploring other magazine options.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the 114-year-old weekly magazine also marks the
first time that an owner of sports teams has bought a news
organization devoted to covering sports, sometimes with a critical
eye. Allen owns The Seattle Seahawks, a professional football team,
and The Portland Trail Blazers, a professional basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   The sale comes six months after The Times Mirror Co. announced
that it was paring certain assets to concentrate on its newspaper
business, which has been the core of the corporate strategy put
forth by its chairman and chief executive, Mark H. Willes. Times
Mirror publishes seven newspapers, including The Los Angeles Times,
Newsday and The Baltimore Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Efrem Zimbalist 3rd, the chief financial officer and chairman of
Times Mirror Magazines _ which publishes enthusiast magazines like
Ski, Yachting and Outdoor Life _ said that he had chosen Allen's
company in part based on its connection to the broadcast world.
Vulcan Ventures also owns Charter Communications, a cable company
based in St. Louis. The company will rank as the fourth-largest
cable operator in the country after it completes pending purchases
of other cable concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sporting News was the only title we had that deals with
spectator sports, not participatory sports,'' Zimbalist said.
``Consumers' primary relationship with spectator sports is through
television and sometimes, radio, so if you have a relationship with
television, it gives the publication a leg up.''
</P>
<P>
   Of The Sporting News' competitors, Sports Illustrated provides
content for CNN-SI, a program service of CNN, and ESPN magazine is
visibly linked to the ESPN network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hoped that the magazine would wind up with someone with a
strong cable presence,'' Zimbalist said. ``We felt it would never
be No. 1 or No. 2 without that advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Vulcan is also an investor in dozens of Internet,
telecommunications and media companies, including Oxygen Media and
Drugstore.com. In a statement, William D. Savoy, the president of
Vulcan, said that the purchase fit in with Allen's strategy of
developing a multimedia company that connects consumers through the
Internet, broadcast and cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of strong national brands to Internet audiences
cannot be underestimated,'' he said. ``As we further develop the
comprehensive channel and portal offerings for our cable customers,
we will look for precisely these types of branded, established
vertical content offerings.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   James Nuckols, the president and chief executive of The Sporting
News, said that the fact that Allen owns sports teams would not
affect the magazine's coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an identical issue to Sports Illustrated being in the
Time Warner empire,'' Nuckols said, referring to a recent incident
in which the Time Inc. magazine Sports Illustrated ran a damaging
interview with John Rocker, a pitcher with the Atlanta Braves, a
team owned owned by Time Warner. ``The John Rocker issue was pretty
good evidence that it doesn't affect how they cover sports. We will
operate the same way. And Paul Allen runs his companies in a very,
very decentralized way.''
</P>
<P>
   The sports magazine market has shifted dramatically in the last
two years. The Sporting News and other smaller, sports magazines,
such as EMAP Petersen's Sport, have had to react to the success of
ESPN magazine, which is published by the magazine division of the
Walt Disney Co. Since 1998, when ESPN magazine was founded, its
biweekly circulation has soared to 850,000. Founded in 1886, The
Sporting News was long a bible for baseball fans, later shifting
its focus to include other professional and collegiate sports.
Despite a 1997 redesign that cost Times Mirror about $6 million and
editorial and publishing efforts to increase circulation, The
Sporting News loses about $2 million a year, said executives at
companies who had considered buying the magazine.

<P>
   ELance.com, a World Wide Web site that has added an auction
twist to the buying and selling of professional services online,
said Wednesday that it had received $12 million in financing from
the venture capital firm of Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &AMP; Byers.
</P>
<P>
   John Doerr and Joe Lacob, general partners at Kleiner, joined
the board of eLance.com, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The site permits companies or individuals seeking a range of
services as varied as language translation, business and technical
consulting, manuscript typing and Web site design, to post requests
for bids from free-lancers. It also lists offers of fixed-price
services from freelancers.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which started operations in September, has been free,
but that will soon change. Srini R. Anumolu, the cofounder and
president, said eLance.com planned to begin taking 5 percent of the
transaction fee, probably starting March 1.

BRADLEY SAYS CLINTON AND GORE NEGLECTED UPSTATE NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH with KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Turning his attention to upstate New York, Bill
Bradley said Wednesday that the federal government had not invested
enough money in the region's depressed economy and criticized Vice
President Al Gore for not spending enough time here.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing small crowds in Buffalo and Rochester, Bradley said
one reason that upstate cities had not benefited from the recent
economic boom nearly as much as other regions was that the Clinton
administration had not spent enough on economic development
projects here. While the national employment rate increased by
almost 19 percent in the 1990s, Bradley said, the employment rate
in western New York grew by only 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we can do in being a good steward of the
good economy is to recognize that not every place in America is
booming,'' Bradley told about 200 students and administrators at
Erie Community College in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said several times that Gore had neglected upstate New
York. ``Al Gore says he's been to California 60 times since he
became vice president,'' he said. ``My question to him is, how many
times has he been to western New York?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore last visited upstate New York on Monday, when he delivered
a speech in Rochester on education.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Bradley, Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore
campaign, said, ``Al Gore has been fighting with the administration
to expand prosperity all across the country while Bill Bradley was
out on the speaking circuit making money for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley last visited upstate New York in October, when he made
stops in Albany and Syracuse.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wednesday, Bradley also lamented the rising cost of heating oil,
a pressing issue throughout New York and particularly upstate.
</P>
<P>
   As he has done before, Bradley called on the Clinton
administration to release oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum
Reserve to drive down the cost of home heating oil. The
administration has refused to release oil from the reserves, saying
it should be saved for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Wednesday that he would provide
low-income families in the Northeast with $125 million to help with
the rising cost of home heating oil, on top of $200 million
provided earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley praised the administration for granting the heating
subsidies, but at the same time, his campaign said ``the real
intended beneficiary was Al Gore.'' According to a press release
from the Bradley campaign, New Hampshire received $5.4 million in
heating subsidies last month, on the eve of that state's primary,
while New York received only $2.6 million. The press release
suggested that a $34 million subsidy that New York received this
month was timed to arrive near the state primary, March 7, so that
Gore would win more votes here.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway scoffed at Bradley's suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The release was intended to help low-income people stay
warmer,'' he said. ```I was in New Hampshire, and it was cold.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley spoke Wednesday night in New York City at the
Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center, Gore on Wednesday
received the endorsement of the Empire State Pride Agenda, one of
the state's largest gay and lesbian groups. On Friday, Gore
received the backing of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's

   Jeff Soref, co-chairman of the New York group, acknowledged that
Gore and Bradley had similar positions on gay issues but said his
group chose Gore because ``the Clinton/Gore administration has
brought unprecedented changes'' for gays. In thanking the group,
Gore noted that he was ``the first vice president to speak at a
gay-rights event.''

   Gore said he would appoint a commission to study ``how domestic

 VOTERS SKEPTICAL OF MOTIVE OF McCAIN IN PULLING ADS 
 (See also CAROLINA-PROFILE, SC-REPUBS) 
(rk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SULLIVAN'S ISLAND, S.C. - Huntington Smith, restaurateur and
political independent, thinks highly of Sen. John McCain, but not
as highly as he did a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed with McCain because I thought he was running a
clean campaign,'' he said, standing in the parking lot of Sully's,
the seafood place he owns in this affluent beach town near
Charleston. ``But I've been disappointed he's been running some
negative ads in South Carolina. It's disappointing that he has to
resort to that to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he had heard about McCain's vow to withdraw his
attack ads _ in which he portrayed Gov. George W. Bush as
untrustworthy and likened him to President Clinton _ but it did not
diminish his feeling of having been let down by the senator. ``Has
he pulled them?'' he asked. ``I don't know if he's honestly pulled
them or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies a problem for McCain, at least insofar as his
appeal to a random assortment of voters here is concerned. In
interviews Wednesday up and down the tiny business district of this
resort community, South Carolinians who plan to vote in the
Republican primary on Saturday declined to give the senator any
credit for having taken off the air his spots attacking Bush. They
tended to view the withdrawal as a ploy, as an indication, perhaps,
that the senator is less the outsider than he claims to be.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those interviewed identified themselves as McCain
supporters. ``He says, `I will not lie to you'; I believe him,''
said Ann Matthews, a retired day care worker. But many also
expressed a kind of I-should-have-known-better disillusionment with
the nasty tone of the campaign, and the role that McCain had played
in fostering it.
</P>
<P>
   Like others who stopped to talk, Jackie Donohoe of North
Charleston said the harsh tone of the televised debate Tuesday
night in Columbia had reinforced her feeling that McCain had not
seriously abandoned the negativity that was obscuring other issues
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went right back and started doing it again,'' Donohoe said,
referring to McCain's argument with Bush during the debate over who
was to blame for the attack ads. ``All he had to do was say, `I'm
not answering that question.'''
</P>
<P>
   Strategists for McCain have said they hoped that pulling the
attack ads would highlight the contrasting campaign styles of their
candidate and Bush. But if the views of voters here are any
indication, the tactic may have been a little too transparent to
have the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   The reactions of viewers and voters here suggest to some
political analysts that McCain's effort to position himself as a
kind of anti-politician was harmed by his venturing into attack
advertising; some polls taken over the last several days showed his
negative ratings rising.
</P>
<P>
   William V. Moore, a political scientist at the College of
Charleston, said it was the nature of McCain's attack that may
cause him trouble. Suggesting in a spot that Bush's character was
comparable to Clinton's was perceived by the Bush campaign as being
over the line.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, people on the streets of Sullivan's Island, waved
away the significance of McCain's repudiation of his own
commercials. Some said the damage had been done, and expressing
regret did not erase the television images. Others had a hard time
recalling anything but the shouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've gotten from the whole thing is the bickering back and
forth,'' said Gay Slough, one of the proprietors of the Gibson
Cafe. ``They're both like schoolchildren; I don't know who to vote
for.''
</P>
<P>
   At the cafe bar, Kirk Heidenreich, who has a custom furniture
business in nearby Mount Pleasant, was nursing a beer and a gripe
about the corrosive impact of negative political commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the ads help them any,'' Heidenreich said.
``They get enough coverage on the news _ it's not as if they need
any more. They're wasting all this money, if you ask me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Vavreck, an assistant professor of government at Dartmouth
College who studies political advertising, said that in view of the
ways in which the content of the television spots are endlessly
recycled by the news media, voters should not be blamed for being
so skeptical about McCain's motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows the message of the ad is going to remain in the
discourse,'' Vavreck said, ``so it doesn't surprise me that people
haven't cut him any slack: The message is still out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some supporters like Smith, the restaurateur, are
willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. ``It's just being a
politician,'' he said with a shrug. ``It's not enough for me to
turn my back on him.''

   &QL;  NEVADA SEED CO.'S BANKRUPTCY HEIGHTENS FARM CRISIS By Sara
Barnett
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb.16 - The seed-supply company that once prided
itself on keeping the White House lawn green is in the red. When
AgriBioTech, the world's leading seller of forage and turfgrass
seed, filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 25, agriculture officials say it
put farmers at an even graver risk. The bankruptcy has already
caused an estimated loss of more than $100 million in agriculture
revenue nationwide. Founded in 1995, ABT sought to consolidate the
seed industry through mergers and acquisitions. By 1999, the
company had successfully purchased 34 smaller seed distributors.
For the past five years, ABT has been the nation's main provider of
alfalfa and other seeds used in crops such as corn, soybean, wheat
and other vegetables. The company has also supplied the
turfgrass-grounding for many major league athletic facilities, and
its product was even used by White House landscapers. Agriculture
officials in Washington and in Western states say ABT's bankruptcy
is having a domino effect across the country. Crop farmers, who are
already struggling nationwide, must cope without being able to
purchase seed from ABT, which could lead to even more dramatic
losses. Even the John Deere Company has been affected, reporting an
estimated $800,000 in cancelled farm equipment orders in the last
two weeks. ABT, however, says it never intended to be a provider
for the seed industry, that they wanted to quickly sell off the
smaller companies - something they had trouble doing. Last
February, ABT tried to solve their problem by hiring a new senior
management group ``with expertise in operation and integration,''
and set goals to build company capitol, manage the acquired
operations and achieve profit in 2000, according to a company
profile.
</P>
<P>
   By September, ABT had reassured its growers through letters and
meetings that the company was ``healthy and solvent,'' on its way
to almost $400 million in yearly revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is there was basically no warning,'' said Don
Schriftinson, policy director for the Wyoming Department of
Agriculture. ``They said to stick with them, and now farmers are in
a cash-flow crisis with no where to turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Also being crippled by ABT's closing are the seed growers who
were selling their product to the Nevada-based company. One grower
said that nore than 1,000 seed growers indirectly contracted by ABT
could still be held responsible for delivering seed without payment
for the next two years. Of the 13 states with contracted companies,
Oregon and Washington have been hit the hardest, each seeking
nearly $40 million in contract compensation alone. Congressmen in
Wyoming and Idaho have already asked for federal assistance. In a
letter to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, the Idaho delegation
wrote, ``be prepared to intervene with the appropriate emergency
assistance for it will become apparent that the effects of this
bankruptcy will force large numbers of seed farmers out of
business.'' Though Wyoming farmers only lost $4.5 in contract
money, the state will eventually require nearly $20 million to help
stabilize the numerous communities effected by the ABT fiasco,
according to state officials. Finding it too costly to wait for
federal decisions to be made, the Wyoming State legislature intends
to pass it's own emergency relief bill by the end of the week.
Bankruptcy proceedings could give ABT an estimated $80 million in
asset liquidation sales. But officials say that money will be used
to pay off credit debts and other loans. ``I am a seed grower and
the focus should not be 'poor seed grower,''' said Wyoming farmer
Terry Jones. ``States need to deal with their local economy now so
they won't have a huge, disastrous impact not just on their rural
communities but on the nation as a whole.''

DIALLO JURY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONSIDER LESSER CHARGES, BOTH
SIDES AGREE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Testimony in the trial of four white New York
City police officers charged with killing an unarmed black
immigrant in a barrage of bullets last year drew to a surprisingly
quick conclusion on Wednesday, as both the defense and the
prosecution recommended that the jury be allowed to consider
charges less serious than murder.
</P>
<P>
   The joint request capped an unusual day in which both sides
seemed to have decided that less is more. Defense lawyers did not
present an expert witness who was expected to testify on sight
perception. The lead prosecutor, Eric Warner, opted not to
cross-examine the final defense witness, an expert on police
practices. He then announced that he would offer no rebuttal to the
week-long defense, which had included the testimony of all four
officers charged with murdering 22-year-old Amadou Diallo in front
of his Bronx apartment building last Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments in the racially charged case are not scheduled
to begin until Tuesday, but the legal debate that is to continue on
Thursday is central to the fate of the officers _ Sean Carroll,
Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy. They are charged
with two counts of second-degree murder, which carries a minimum
sentence of 15 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Now both sides are recommending lesser alternatives that range
from first-degree manslaughter, in which a defendant is convicted
of intending to cause serious injury but not death, down to
criminally negligent homicide, in which a defendant should have
known there was a risk of death and been more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   The penalties for these lesser charges range from a minimum of
up to five years in prison for first-degree manslaughter to a
minimum of probation for criminally negligent homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Barry L. Kluger, the chief assistant district attorney in the
Bronx, later emphasized that presenting less serious alternative
charges in a murder case is not unusual, and that ``no special
significance should be given to that.'' Defense lawyers said that
while they expect their clients to be found not guilty, they could
not risk limiting the jury's options.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is expected to grant the joint request, Justice
Joseph C. Tiresi said that he would reserve judgment for now, an
announcement that concluded nine days of testimony in a case that
was expected to last several weeks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The defense chose to close its case with Dr. James J. Fyfe, a
professor of criminal justice at Temple University in Philadelphia
and a nationally recognized expert on police practices. Three
additional factors made Fyfe especially compelling in the view of
the defense: he is a former New York City police lieutenant; he
declined any payment for his testimony; and, as he acknowledged on
the stand, he is best-known for testifying against police officers
charged with crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Fyfe made it clear in his testimony that he believed the four
officers assigned to the Special Crimes Unit patrol in the Bronx on
a cold February night became players in a seconds-long tragedy, not
reckless participants in a deadly crime.
</P>
<P>
   According to the version of events offered by the defense, the
four officers were driving through a high-crime neighborhood in an
unmarked car when Carroll spotted Diallo standing on a stoop of an
apartment building, looking up and down Wheeler Avenue. Finding
this suspicious, Carroll instructed Boss, the driver, to back up.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll and McMellon slowly approached Diallo, the defense says,
with McMellon prominently holding his badge and asking in a
non-threatening tone to speak to him. Diallo did not respond, the
officers have testified; instead, he suddenly turned and darted
into the vestibule.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo suddenly turned to his left toward them and frantically
reached into his coat pocket with his right hand, the officers have
said. As he pulled out an object, the defense says, Carroll shouted
that the man had a gun, and the two officers began to fire.
McMellon tripped and fell backward, leading his partners to believe
that he had been shot, and Boss and Murphy joined in the gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, in a matter of seconds, 41 bullets had been
fired, 19 of which had struck Diallo. The black object turned out
to be a wallet _ a discovery that stunned the officers and left
Carroll crying uncontrollably over the young man's body.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have charged that the four officers acted recklessly
throughout the brief encounter _ by failing to determine whether
Diallo was deaf or unfamiliar with English, by not slowing things
down once Diallo was cornered in the vestibule, and by firing so
many shots.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the prosecution's success in limiting the scope of
Fyfe's testimony, the former police lieutenant still managed to
convey his opinion that the officers had followed police procedure
and had adhered to their primary mission: ``To protect life.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the officers belonged to the Special Crimes Unit, whose
members have the difficult and often dangerous task of trying to
anticipate crime. They are supposed to investigate suspicious
actions, he said. ``That's their job.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fyfe said that in responding to potentially volatile situations,
the police try to follow a theory known as a ``scale of escalating
force.''
</P>
<P>
   The lowest level is an officer's mere presence to send a
message, followed by: persuasion offered in a conversational but
assertive manner; the use of a ``command voice'' (``I'm not asking
anymore, I'm telling,'' Fyfe explained); a ``firm grip'' on a
shoulder or arm; a ``pain-compliance technique,'' such as
finger-bending; ``impact techniques,'' such as thrown fists or
feet; and ``deadly force,'' which is used to protect the lives of
citizens and officers.
</P>
<P>
   By explaining the theory at length, Fyfe seemed to indicate that
Carroll and McMellon had, in his opinion, approached Diallo
properly, from the level tone that McMellon said he used to the
prominent displaying of a badge, as McMellon said he did. This last
technique, the professor said, overrides concerns on whether the
person being approached is deaf or not familiar with English.
</P>
<P>
   Fyfe said that officers expect to get responses to their
questions; otherwise, their suspicions are heightened. And in this
case, he said, the officers were properly focused on not allowing
Diallo to get into the apartment building (even though it turned
out that he lived there) because of the potential of barricades and
hostage-taking.
</P>
<P>
   From the officers' point of view, he said, ``Things can only get
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Fyfe used police terminology already familiar to the
jury. He said it was proper for Carroll and McMellon to try and
``close the gap'' between them and Diallo. And he said that
officers are trained not to kill but to stop, by shooting at the
torso, or ``center mass'' of the body. McMellon had used both terms
during his testimony on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After the favorable questioning by defense lawyers had ended,
Warner, the lead prosecutor, said that he had no questions. He then
said that he had no rebuttal; that the case he had already
presented would stand.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement caused a minor stir in the courtroom. ``I was
shocked,'' John D. Patten, the lawyer for Carroll, said later.
</P>
<P>
   But criminal lawyers not connected to the case said that the
prosecution's decision was not that surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Brafman, a defense lawyer in New York City , said that
the rule is ``if your rebuttal evidence is not really strong,
there's no point in putting it forward because then the case will
end on weak prosecution evidence.'' Besides, he added, ``If the
prosecution had a smoking gun, they wouldn't have held it for
rebuttal.''

SPORTS COLUMN: NBA OFFERS MOOD SWINGS EACH NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He never went to college, but Kevin Garnett has a
head on his shoulders, way up there.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett has figured out the loop-the-loop logistics of the
National Basketball Association: There is always another game. Good
grief, is there always another game.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett and the Minnesota Timberwolves were visiting the Knicks
Wednesday night after both teams had flown in from other cities
Tuesday night. Minnesota had merely lost, but the Knicks had been
downright ghastly in Toronto, which would be alarming if mood
swings were not the norm for the league.
</P>
<P>
   There was always the possibility that the Knicks would light up
the Garden and that the Timberwolves would be energized by the rare
visit to New York. But in the new, new NBA, you really don't know
who is going to emerge from the runway just before the anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these last few games show that when you relax and when
you don't come out with that focus or edge, you get beat up pretty
bad,'' Garnett said after his team lost to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA's crazy like that,'' the young sage from a Chicago
high school added. ``You have one night when you're great and one
night when you're terrible. The best thing is that tomorrow is
another day.''
</P>
<P>
   The inconsistency in the league _ we are not talking here about
losing; we are talking about apathy _ is yet another symptom the
NBA is floundering right now. And people are noticing.
</P>
<P>
   The television rating for the All-Star Game last Sunday was the
lowest since the game went on the networks, down 35 percent from
the last one, two years ago, when a certain Michael Jordan still
roamed the land. People are avoiding pro hoops on Sunday afternoon
to see if Tiger Woods can take another golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, it was a distinct pleasure to push the clicker
and get away from Patrick Ewing's bemused scowl in search of George
W. Bush's characteristic smirk.
</P>
<P>
   The eminently clickable Knicks seem unable to put a few strong
games together, and their coach, Jeff Van Gundy, does not want to
blame road games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can lose the fight on the road, but when you have no
fight, that's a problem,'' Van Gundy said Wednesday night, not
knowing whether his players would bring any defense with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different guys take a possession off,'' Van Gundy said of his
starting team. ``There is not a priority to set a tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy said he constantly asks himself ``a litany of
questions'' about his own coaching, at least as much as he
re-evaluates his players. He was forced to take stock of his team
again Wednesday as the Philadelphia 76ers seemed to improve
themselves by trading for Toni Kukoc. If the Knicks have many more
walkabouts on the road, they could be in jeopardy for losing the
home-court advantage even in the first round of the playoffs. And
the road is not where these people excel.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Knicks had enough talent, Van Gundy screwed up his
face and remained silent long enough to make the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't separate talent from commitment,'' he said.
``Hustling is part of talent. It's all part of the same package.''
</P>
<P>
   He criticized his players for not being physical enough, despite
their reputation for aggression, most of which went north with
Charles Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are going in unimpeded,'' Van Gundy said, adding that his
players ``sort of got out of the way'' on layups Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He did not blame the league's crackdown on physicality since
some of the nasty Knick-Miami playoff series in recent years. He
just let it be known that nobody _ nobody _ in the starting lineup
was coming out and playing hard every game.
</P>
<P>
   The players seem mildly embarrassed but not to the point of
losing their cool or throwing themselves around on the floor after
the ball. This is certainly the personality of this team. Much of
the character left with Doc Rivers, Derek Harper, Buck Williams and
Oakley in what is now essentially ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the Knicks who give off the stale aroma of a
tired act. The new ownership of the Dallas Mavericks set a new low
by renting the definitive tired old act, Dennis Rodman, for the
rest of the season. Although he can still rebound, Rodman sets a
dreadful example to all concerned. He pulled his
sitting-on-the-court act Tuesday night, and was tossed out of the
game, all wearily predictable. It's not Rodman's fault but rather
the fault of the new owner, Joe Cuban, who hasn't been around long
enough to be embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   But hang in there. The playoffs are in two months.

MICHIGAN PLAYS SECOND-HAND ROLE AS GOP PRIMARY NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. _ Michigan may be the first big state that
the Republican presidential candidates are competing for _ with
more delegates at stake in its primary next Tuesday than in New
Hampshire and South Carolina combined _ but it is a second-hand
campaign that they are giving it.
</P>
<P>
   There are no advertisements with glimpses of the state flag, as
in South Carolina. No local debates have been turned into national
dramas. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of
Arizona have each spent one day here since the New Hampshire
primary Feb. 1, and neither is due back until after South Carolina
votes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't expect to shake the hand of a candidate any time soon,''
The Detroit News warned a bit sourly on its front page Tuesday
under a headline that said, ``S. Carolina Steals Show from Mich.''
</P>
<P>
   With surrogate speakers, advertising and dueling if comically
mismatched state organizations, the candidates are previewing in
Michigan the kind of campaign much of the country will get as the
Republicans turn their increasingly divided attention to the 16
states, including California, New York and Ohio, that will hold
primaries or caucuses March 7.
</P>
<P>
   This is not quite what Michigan expected when it moved up its
primary by a month to elbow into the limelight. But few people are
complaining because the primary used to be a ``nonentity,'' said
Bill Ballenger, the editor of Inside Michigan Politics. ``The
candidates were never here very much before this year, compared to
how often they've been here this time, which still isn't very
much.'' he said, adding, ``This is the biggest state east of the
Mississippi, particularly if you include all of the Great Lakes
water.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates have not forgotten Michigan, which will send 58
delegates to the party's convention this summer. The Republicans
held a debate here on Jan. 10. Bush's wife, Laura, visited for two
days earlier this week, and his father, former President George
Bush, is scheduled to begin a two-day swing Thursday, his second
trip. McCain is sending in a brace of senators this week, Mike
DeWine of Ohio and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush is also exporting his feeling of victimization to
Michigan. He is running an advertisement here protesting a McCain
commercial that compared the governor to Bill Clinton, even though
the commercial ran only in South Carolina. And outside
organizations are coming to Bush's aid here as elsewhere. ``If you
want a strong pro-life candidate, don't vote for John McCain,''
declares an anti-abortion group's advertisement broadcast on
Christian radio in this conservative stronghold in western
Michigan. ``Vote for George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is also broadcasting advertisements here that were seen
elsewhere, recounting his biography and declaring him prepared to
be president.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are holding a separate, closed caucus in Michigan
next month. But anyone who is registered can vote in the Republican
primary, and McCain has surged in public opinion polls on the
support of Democrats and independents. In New Hampshire and South
Carolina, McCain made a kind of judo move, using the weight of
Bush's establishment support against him. In Michigan, the
establishment is pre-emptively blaming itself to protect Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At the bustling Bush headquarters in East Lansing, Del Chenault,
the 31-year-old executive director of the Michigan campaign, said,
``This has nothing to do with a referendum on George W. Bush.''
Instead, he said, Democrats are trying to embarrass the governor,
John Engler, a Republican who has put his political machine behind
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no, no, no,'' said Ed Sarpolus, of Epic/MRA, a Lansing
polling firm. ``This is scapegoat time. This is point-the-finger
time, we-don't-want-to-take-any-blame time. I've heard all of this
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarpolus said that voters who said they would cross over for
McCain want to support him, not to punish another candidate, and
that Michigan had a history of backing insurgents, including former
Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and
Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Sarpolus noted that McCain had climbed in the polls despite
barely organizing in Michigan. This suggests that it is his
performance elsewhere that has buoyed him in this state, and that
if he loses in South Carolina his support may fade.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain headquarters here has a slapped-together feel, which
its denizens cite as a virtue. ``It's message over money,'' said
Mike Hudome, a media consultant who previously helped re-elect
Engler.
</P>
<P>
   The television receives two channels, and the nine telephones
are on separate lines, so that a meeting of the state campaign
leaders on Monday night was repeatedly interrupted as they dashed
to different rooms to answer the phones. The group planned McCain's
clockwise route through the state Sunday and Monday and discussed
where Senator DeWine should appear to draw news media attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the cameras in Toledo,'' said Hudome, referring to the
stations in the Ohio border city that broadcast into Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Peter DeMarco, the communications director, newly imported from
Washington, looked puzzled. ``Behind you, on the map _ where's
Toledo?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Voters seem pleased at the chance for a say in the nomination.
``If we waited another month there might be only one guy that's got
a shot at it,'' said Greg Blake, a 47-year-old diemaker who plans
to vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some wished they had seen more of the candidates. ``I was
a little surprised _ I wasn't hurt by it _ that McCain didn't make
a show in western Michigan when he was in Michigan,'' said a
67-year-old businessman here who spoke on condition that his name
not be published.
</P>
<P>
   The surrogates have generated some excitement, however. Bush's
visit to Battle Creek was the top story Tuesday on the local
television station. ``Melissa, it looks like the whole family is
getting involved in the campaign now,'' an anchor remarked to
Melissa Dunbar, the correspondent covering the visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are,'' she replied. ``It's really neat to see. It's nice
to have all the attention on Michigan.''

AMERICANS BRING AN AIR OF IRREVERENCE TO PRADA'S TEAM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ With mischief in his eye, and the trace
of a grin shadowed in his thick red beard, Doug Peterson looks like
a man enjoying the calm within the eye of a storm.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, the creator of the small tempest surrounding the
impending start of the 30th America's Cup match, most certainly is.
``I love this stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The five-of-nine-race finals between Team New Zealand and
Italy's Prada Challenge begin here Saturday. While there may be no
United States challenger for the cup this time, there is a strong
American presence in Prada's camp. Peterson, the gifted 54-year-old
naval architect who leads Prada's design team with the Argentine
German Frers, means to deliver his third straight cup-winning boat,
and thus is the most visible American. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His efforts are being matched by a fellow native Southern
Californian, the head coach Rod Davis _ who has transformed the
Prada afterguard of the helmsman Francesco de Angelis and the
tactician Torben Grael, former fleet-racing specialists, into
dangerous boat-versus-boat match racers _ and by the assistant
coach, Steve Erickson. Erickson is a 1984 Olympic sailing gold
medalist who has drilled the concept of working together into
Prada's 16-man crew.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, Peterson has been the newsmaker. On the front
page of Wednesday's New Zealand Herald, a photograph of the Team
New Zealand boat was splashed alongside this large, rather
indelicate caption: ``Is it a dog?''
</P>
<P>
   The picture referred to an article in which Peterson offered his
candid opinion of the boat the Kiwis have decided to sail in the
coming match. Under race rules, on Monday each team was obliged to
unveil its vessel; and no further changes to rigs, keels and other
equipment will be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   At the unveiling, Peterson stopped short of dropping to all
fours and barking at NZL 60, New Zealand's boat. He pulled no
punches in assessing the boat, which he believes employs too much
wetted surface _ it's too wide, he thinks, among other related
faults _ combined with a corresponding lack of sail area to nudge
it along.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't a fan of the placement of the wings in the ballast bulb
at the bottom of the keel: Team New Zealand's are placed in the
center of the bulb, Prada's are set in the more conventional
location on the bulb's trailing aft edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally,'' he said, ``I think they have a bit of a problem.
Particularly in winds below 12 knots. Maybe all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Peterson's summation, Clay Oliver, a member of Team
New Zealand's design team, would only say, ``Well, Doug always
seems to have all the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson has had many answers to the mysteries of boat speed
since arriving onto the international scene in 1973 with his
breakthrough one-tonner Ganbare. But it's in the America's Cup
arena where the self-taught designer has truly shined.
</P>
<P>
   As a main force behind the successful American defense in 1992,
and the dominating Kiwi challenge in 1995, Peterson has been on the
winning side in every campaign since the International America's
Cup Class boats replaced the 12-Meters. Now, he is going for a cup
triple. ``I guess I've just been able to stay a step ahead of the
field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is only one of the American pieces of the Prada
puzzle. Like Peterson, the 45-year-old Davis is a veteran of the
cup wars. He is in his eighth campaign, having represented
syndicates from the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, in
roles ranging from sail trimmer to skipper, over a cup career that
has spanned 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of his marriage to his New Zealand-born wife, Liz,
Davis holds dual citizenship and won an Olympic silver medal
sailing under the Kiwi flag in 1992. His brother-in-law, Tom
Schnakenberg, is a stalwart of the Team New Zealand design and
sailing team. But family connections only go so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he's sending me an e-mail every time they make a
change,'' Davis said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Erickson, 38, has also played the cup game as both a coach and a
competitor. A native of Seattle, he won a world championship with
Paul Cayard in the Star class nearly a decade before they joined
forces in a winning Whitbread round-the-world race campaign in
1998. But when Erickson received a call from his longtime friend de
Angelis to join Prada, the timing was perfect.
</P>
<P>
   As for Peterson's blunt appraisal of the competition, and the
differences in their two boats, Davis shrugged and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Team New Zealand is onto a different page of
refinement,'' he said. ``Whether it's a page backward or forward,
we'll wait and see.''  &QL;

AMERICA'S CUP CHALLENGER, LUNA ROSSA, CAPTURES ITALIANS FANCY

   ROME _ The night that the Prada sailboat Luna Rossa wound up
qualifying for the America's Cup finals _ the first Italian boat to
do so since 1992 _ the coach of the AC Milan soccer team blacked
out the players' training camp television sets, afraid that they
would blow their next match by staying up all night to watch the
chic gray-and-red Prada sails edge ahead of America One in the
deciding race.
</P>
<P>
   In Naples, members of the Circolo Italia yacht club that spawned
the Prada skipper, Francesco De Angelis, voluntarily pledged not to
watch. Sailors are superstitious, and none more so than
Neopolitans. They were afraid of jinxing Italy's greatest source of
pride in almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
   They could be the only Italians averting their eyes on Saturday
when Prada's Luna Rossa, which means Red Moon, begins its first
race in the best-five-of-nine-race series against New Zealand's
Black Magic. Italians are fanatical about soccer and passionately
follow Formula One racing. But they have now become enamored of a
far more complicated and elitist sport.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3 million Italians watched the Louis Vuitton Cup
finals, which determined the challenger to Team New Zealand in the
America's Cup match, live earlier this month, even though the
10-hour time difference meant that races were broadcast beginning
at 2 a.m. Millions more are expected to tune in to watch Italy face
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Even Italians whose knowledge of boating is limited to ferry
rides to Sardinia have become overnight experts on spinnakers and
bowlines, debating technique and wind factors in elevators, cafes
and business meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is national pride, sweetened by the satisfaction of
watching Italy beat American efficiency and technology. Even if
Italy ultimately loses to New Zealand, that victory will remain.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Italians are mostly known for being creative, for making
things that are good-looking,'' said Domenico Minchilli, an
architect who watched the qualifying races. ``This is a case where
Italian fashion was able to put together the financing and
technical effort to win one of the most competitive international
sporting events, and that is a different image.''
</P>
<P>
   Minchilli confessed he could not watch the last two races, when
Prada first rallied and then won the ninth and deciding race
against America One. ``The anxiety level was too high.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying for the America's Cup, an event that has never been
done by a European sailboat, certainly provided the Milan fashion
house Prada with untold millions in free advertising as well as a
burst of souvenir sales. Prada's chief executive, Patrizio
Bertelli, the husband of the designer Miuccia Prada, is an amateur
sailor who sponsored and financed Luna Rossa to the tune of an
estimated $50 million. Bertelli rejected other commercial sponsors,
insisting that only the Prada logo appear on Luna Rossa's sails.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after Luna Rossa won, fans mobbed the Prada store in
Rome, eager to bask in victory and buy luxury mementos.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing is an elitist pastime here, and so is fashion.
Predictably, Italian newspapers have been avidly chronicling how
Italian celebrities, fashion designers and starlets have been
following the races, focusing in particular on Gianni Agnelli, 78,
the retired chairman of Fiat, who is a yacht-racing enthusiast and
who spoke almost daily by telephone to the crew of Luna Rossa.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members, moreover, have become overnight celebrities, with
newspapers and television shows pouring over their sailing
credentials and also their personalities, girlfriends and favorite
hobbies. Public fascination is particularly acute in the case of De
Angelis, 40, who though Neopolitan by birth, is so reserved and
taciturn, Italian newspapers refer to him as the ``the
Englishman,'' and even ``the German.''
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to find a humanizing tidbit, the news magazine
Panorama, hunted down De Angelis' mother, Linda, who confided that
her son loses his legendary cool when confronted with ``struffoli''
a sugary, deep-fried Neopolitan pastry.
</P>
<P>
   Italy has experienced yacht racing mania before. In 1992, Il
Moro de Venezia, or the Moor of Venice, a sailboat financed by the
industrialist Raul Gardini, became the first European sailboat in
decades to qualify for the America's Cup and challenge,
unsuccessfully, the U.S. defender. That morale triumph was
blemished a few months later, when Gardini, the head of
Feruzzi-Montedison, an agro-chemical giant, committed suicide while
under investigation in a vast financial scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Italians have also not forgotten Azzurra, which in 1983, became
the first Italian sailboat to ever seek to qualify for the
America's Cup, reaching the challenger semifinals. Italians were so
swept up in that milestone that parents throughout the country
named baby girls Azzurra, a feminization of the color blue,
azzurro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italians root for their teams in ways that other nations can't
match,'' said Paolo Massarini, secretary general of the Costa
Smeralda yacht club, under whose flag Azzurra raced. ``I don't know
if parents will name their daughters Luna, but given their current
enthusiasm, it's very likely.'' &QL;

CLINTON ISN'T RUNNING FOR OFFICE, BUT HE HAS A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THE
RACE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ His name is not on the ballot, he reminded the
audience. He is just another voter, he said. But President Clinton
could not resist weighing in Wednesday on the first political
campaign season in decades that did not directly involve him.
</P>
<P>
   The president declared himself a supportive spouse, but not a
senior adviser, for Hillary Rodham Clinton in her bid for a Senate
seat in New York. And he said he was not concerned that his wife
was trailing in the polls against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's doing remarkably well, given the unusual nature
of the campaign and the formidable obstacles out there,'' Clinton
said at his first, formal news conference of 2000. ``And I think
now the people will begin to listen and debate, and I think she's
doing real well.''
</P>
<P>
   His role?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basically doing for her what she's always done for me,''
he said. ``I'm talking to her about whatever she wants to talk
about. I'm giving her my best ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was reluctant, initially, to weigh in on the
presidential contest. ``I'm not running for office and, by and
large, I think I shouldn't comment,'' he said. ``There may be a few
exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the journalists questioning Clinton, fresh from the
campaign trail, eagerly sought out those exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this will be one of the exceptions that you'll be
willing to make,'' said Claire Shipman of NBC News, offering a
question on former Sen. Bill Bradley's attacks on the veracity of
Vice President Al Gore in the Democratic presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton bit, defending the vice president for having been
``brutally honest'' over the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was an unpopular thing to go into Kosovo, he wanted to
do it,'' Clinton said, offering other examples of Gore's candid
nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was unpopular to go into Bosnia, he wanted to do it,''
Clinton said. ``When it was unpopular to stand up for freedom in
Haiti, he wanted to do it. When only 15 percent of the people
thought we ought to help Mexico, but I knew it could hurt our
economy, he was right there. And I could go on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton stopped short of criticizing Bradley for doubting
Gore's truthfulness, saying the vehement back-and-forth between the
two candidates was typical campaign heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a tough race where people fought with each
other, where they didn't have different interpretations of each
other's record and each other's positions,'' Clinton said. ``And
then once you disagree with someone's position or someone's record,
then the person will say, `I just think you're mischaracterizing
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said later that he thought Americans were too smart to
blame a candidate _ Gore _ for personal mistakes made by someone
else _ Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the implication that anybody would be held responsible
for somebody else's mistake or misconduct is just _ it's a real
insult to the American people,'' the president said. ``And they're
not going to do that. That's not in their interest, and it's not in
their nature. They're too smart and too good for that''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Clinton came across as magnanimous toward the two
Republicans seeking to replace him. He said all four major
presidential candidates _ Republicans John McCain and George W.
Bush included _ were ``people of accomplishment, people who have
certain convictions, people who have, I think, pretty clear
philosophies and records.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, brushing off a question about how often his name
has been disparaged on the campaign trail, still showed his
partisan ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of sympathy with Governor Bush and Senator
McCain,'' he said, barely able to suppress a smile. ``I mean, it's
hard for them to figure out what to run on. They can't run against
the longest economic expansion in history or the lowest crime rate
in 30 years or the lowest welfare rolls in 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``They've got a tough job, and I have a lot of
sympathy with them. And I don't want to complicate their problems
by saying any more about them.''

CHRISTIANS ASK FOR RENEWED ATTACK ON POVERTY

<P>
   Concerned that poverty persists in America despite a prolonged
period of national prosperity, a broad group of Christian leaders
gathered in Washington Wednesday to call for an effort by churches,
businesses, labor and government to help poor people.
</P>
<P>
   The group's statement, a ``Covenant to Overcome Poverty,'' urges
religious organizations to make working on behalf of the poor a
priority. It also asks people to evaluate political policies and
candidates ``by how they impact people who are poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The document was signed by officials of evangelical and mainline
Protestant organizations, including the National Association of
Evangelicals and the National Council of Churches, as well as by
ministers of African-American churches and representatives of
several Roman Catholic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put poor people on the national agenda _ they're
not there now,'' said the Rev. Jim Wallis, a leader in Call to
Renewal, a five-year-old coalition of religious organizations that
wrote the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The statement noted that one in every five American children is
growing up in poverty but that the proportion is higher _ one in
every three _ among children of racial minorities. Wallis said the
religious leaders believed that a ``moral constituency'' was needed
to focus attention on finding ways to alleviate poverty, especially
for children's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious constituency is the churches, given how clear the
Bible is'' about an obligation to help the poor, said Wallis, who
is also editor of Sojourners, a religious magazine based in
Washington. ``When you have rising inequality and record prosperity
at the same time, it's a biblical issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement said, ``Just as some of our religious forebears
decided no longer to accept slavery or segregation, we decide to no
longer accept poverty and its disproportionate impact on people of
color.'' The document called for making alleviation of poverty ``a
bipartisan cause,'' and was issued by the signers on the steps of
the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview afterward, the Rev. Wes
Granberg-Michaelson, general secretary of the Reformed Church in
America and chairman of Call to Renewal, said that while the
various participating Christian groups might disagree on ``specific
policy positions,'' they were united in their belief that a shared
national effort on behalf of the poor was needed. He said they
agreed that poverty could be relieved neither by the churches alone
nor exclusively by government programs.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was issued after three days of Washington
meetings, involving some 500 people from religious organizations
around the country, that were organized by Call to Renewal to
discuss how local groups were trying to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been laying the groundwork all across the country'' with
such local efforts, Wallis said. ``And now we're building a
network'' to link the groups.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped that working against poverty would emerge as a
leading moral issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what might be happening,'' he said, ``is, you reach a
new millennium and find some leftover questions that did not get
resolved and then become the primary moral issues.''

OLD CLASSICS FOR NEW CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By NANCY HEWITT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hap Palmer has been entertaining and educating children with his
music for more than 30 years. And he still loves it, as evidenced
in his latest CD, ``Early Childhood Classics: Old Favorites With a
New Twist.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer has taken favorite songs such as ``Old McDonald,'' ``Itsy
Bitsy Spider'' and ``Bingo'' and refreshed them. ``I take
traditional songs, write new verses and update them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And kids love them.
</P>
<P>
   However, Palmer wasn't always making music for kids. He started
out as a special education teacher in Los Angeles, always looking
for ways to hold his students' attention in class. Often he would
bring his guitar to accompany himself while singing folk songs. But
the kids just couldn't sit still. ``I was having difficulty keeping
the kids in their seats,'' he recalls, ``but I wanted to get the
kids actively involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he got an idea. Perhaps if he worked with the children's
natural desire to move, combined it with music and wrote lyrics
that helped expand vocabulary and with recognition of numbers,
letters and colors, they could learn as well as be entertained.
</P>
<P>
   A new career direction began.
</P>
<P>
   And now, more than three decades later, Palmer still enjoys
getting kids actively involved with his music. ``Children,
especially young ones, learn best with music,'' he says. And they
are great inspiration for songs, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   The father of four grown children, one stepchild and a
4-year-old, Palmer's music is kept fresh because he is able to stay
tuned in to what kids like.
</P>
<P>
   He says his ideas come from all over. ``I get them from every
imaginable place,'' he says with a grin. ``From reading articles,
talking to teachers. From parents and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer has a small demo studio at his Woodland Hills home.
``Once I write a song,'' he explains, ``I'll do a demo to get
feedback.'' The feedback he speaks of usually comes from colleagues
such as Amy Weintraub, one of two Los Angeles mothers (the other is
Brooke McEwen) who approached him about using some of his songs in
a series of videos they were putting together called ``Baby
Songs.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, they have released three videotapes: ``Baby Songs,''
``More Baby Songs'' and ``Baby Songs Goodnight.'' Two new videos
are being added to the series Feb. 22: ``Baby Songs Animals'' and
``Baby Songs Rock &AMP; Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening of each video features Palmer crooning the theme
song: ``It's a wonderful day to go out and play. Hey, maybe you can
come along. All you need to bring is a song to sing, a happy little
baby song.''
</P>
<P>
   Each video is approximately 30 minutes long and retails for
$12.98. Tapes can be ordered by calling (800) 745-1145 or by
visiting www.babysongs.com on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's new album retails for $14.95 for CD and $9.95 for
cassette. Either can be ordered on his Web site, www.happalmer.com;
or at amazon.com or borders.com. Schools and libraries can call
(800) 645-3739. &QL;

ASLEEP AT ... THE GRAMMYS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Already the recipient of six Grammy Awards, Asleep at the Wheel
could be forgiven for being at bit jaded about the chance to double
that number with its half-dozen nominations for Wednesday's awards
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the band credited with keeping western swing alive
views its Grammy bids as proof that the innovative country-jazz
style pioneered by Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys is as vital
today as when ``San Antonio Rose'' and ``Faded Love'' first packed
honky-tonks across the country in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reaffirms my belief that western swing is truly one of
the treasures of American music,'' says Asleep at the Wheel leader
Ray Benson. ``To have survived 70 years and still be as vital in
today's musical culture speaks volumes about its ability to connect
with people.''
</P>
<P>
   Asleep at the Wheel's ``Ride With Bob,'' a star-studded tribute
to Wills, was cited for country album of the year. Moreover, the
band competes with itself in the country vocals category, where the
Dixie Chicks showcase ``Roly Poly'' goes up against ``Goin' Away
Party,'' featuring Willie Nelson and the Manhattan Transfer. The
album also garnered an instrumental performance nod for ``Bob's
Breakdowns'' (featuring Vince Gill and Steve Wariner), as well as
nominations for best album package and best long-form music video
(for ``The Making of `Ride With Bob''').
</P>
<P>
   The disc is actually Benson's second all-star homage to Wills.
In 1993, Asleep at the Wheel issued ``Tribute to the Music of Bob
Wills and the Texas Playboys,'' a triple Grammy-winning effort
featuring Garth Brooks, George Strait, Dolly Parton and several
original Texas Playboys that failed to accomplish Benson's main
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured, let's try again with artists who can draw an
audience that may not have any idea who Bob Wills is,'' Benson, 48,
said from his Austin, Texas, home. ``I dislike the culture of
sequels as much as anyone, but I realized on that first album we
hadn't done half the tunes or covered all the styles Bob was known
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson actually encountered Wills just before he died in 1973.
Wills was cutting what would be his final album, ``For the Last
Time,'' when the two met for a fleeting moment in the hallway of a
recording studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob was in a wheelchair, and they were wheeling him out,''
Benson recalled. ``I said, `Hey Mr. Wills, I'm Ray Benson.' And he
kind of grunted .... That night he had a stroke and never came out
of the coma.'
</P>
<P>
   The cast of ``Ride With Bob'' (DreamWorks) includes Tim McGraw,
Lyle Lovett, the Dixie Chicks, Merle Haggard, Clint Black, Dwight
Yoakam, Lee Ann Womack, Tracy Byrd, Shawn Colvin, Texas yodeler Don
Walser, Reba McEntire and Mark Chesnutt. The swing-influenced
Squirrel Nut Zippers play on two rollicking tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a feeling we might get a couple nominations,'' Benson
said. ``But six? It's amazing _ though I guess it's not surprising
when you consider all the talented musicians, singers and technical
people involved. After all, these artists feel so passionately
about the material and did such a great job; people who know and
love this music don't miss that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asleep at the Wheel, which Texas singer-guitarist Benson
co-founded in 1970, appears Saturday at Arcadia on the Santa Monica
Pier. Over the years and the group's 21 albums, more than 80
musicians have passed through the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Benson's original plan, back in 1969, was to form an authentic
western swing band, influenced by the likes of fellow gonzo-country
act Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen. After drifting
through Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, Asleep at the Wheel
relocated to Austin and landed a record deal after Van Morrison
raved about them in the pages of Rolling Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Benson's seven-member outfit was an immediate hit with the same
folks who embraced Nelson and the Outlaws, along with other
refugees from Nashville's bland country music factory.
</P>
<P>
   Now going on three decades of keeping western swing's pilot
light burning, Asleep at the Wheel has maintained a musical
integrity that has rarely wavered, while avoiding putting the music
behind a glass museum case.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people take for granted is the fact that every day,
people play Bob Wills' music,'' Benson said. ``And people forget
that Bob blurred a lot of lines. He worked the whole big-band thing
into what he was doing and took r&AMP;b and pop and brought it into
Texas and Oklahoma. He was like Duke Ellington. That's what we
tried to do with `Ride With Bob,' blur the lines between genres _
and swing.'' &QL;

The Who/``The Who: BBC Sessions'' (MCA)
<TEXT>
<P>
   They just don't make 'em like the Who anymore. Spanning the
years 1965 through 1973, this newly minted 25-track set released on
the 30th anniversary of the group's seminal concert album, ``Live
at Leeds,'' collects material culled from performances for various
BBC shows, capturing the high-voltage quartet in all its early
speed-fueled glory.
</P>
<P>
   Tracks here include such dynamic Who classics as ``My
Generation,'' ``I'm Free,'' ``Substitute,'' ``Pictures of Lily,''
``Shakin' All Over'' and ``The Seeker'' played with razor-sharp wit
and unblinking intensity. Good liner notes and track-by-track
recording details make this one of the best Who packages around and
a perfect companion to ``Leeds.'' 4 stars &QL; 
_ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
Dry Branch Fire Squad/``Memories That Bless &AMP; Burn'' (Rounder)
</P>
<P>
   A traditional bluegrass gospel recording whose liner notes refer
to both Kierkegaard and Shakespeare might seem a tad highfalutin'.
But when you consider that this Appalachia-bred quintet, through
various incarnations, has been waxing spiritual for nearly a
quarter-century, you appreciate the meticulous, almost scholarly
care that went into this elegantly rustic collection of
high-lonesome hermeneutics.
</P>
<P>
   The singing and pickin' aren't too shabby either. Scanning the
genre's many forms, the disc (which includes several re-recordings
and remixes) ranges from foot-stomping holiness jams like ``Hide
You in the Blood'' and expertly harmonized a cappella quartets to
the tremulous title track, highlighted by Suzanne Thomas' plaintive
lead vocal.
</P>
<P>
   Her freqent duet partner, sandpaper-voiced group leader Ron
Thomason, sings with the raspy authenticity of a Blue Ridge
street-corner preacher. He's at his most exhilarating when chasing
the high notes, and if his reach exceeds his grasp, well, as they
say, that's what heaven's for. 3 stars &QL; 
_ Reed Johnson &QR; 
 &QL; 
MC5/``The Big Bang! Best of the MC5'' (Rhino)
</P>
<P>
   Though its rabble-rousing lifespan was brief, the MC5's
proto-punk influence loomed large, and the Detroit group's raging
against the machine helped lay the groundwork for '70s punk and
politically active rock.
</P>
<P>
   This long overdue and perfectly realized 21-track collection
ranges from a trio of rare early singles to cuts off the band's
infamous first effort, ``Kick Out the Jams'' (still one of the most
exciting live albums ever), to the teeth-gnashing ``Back in the
USA'' and the final ``High Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-produced by MC5 guitarist Wayne Kramer, ``The Big Bang!''
finally gives this gutsy, long-neglected group its due. 3 stars &QL; 
_ F.S. &QR; 
 &QL; 
Soundtrack/``The Beach'' (London) &QL; 
Soundtrack/``Wonder Boys'' (Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   Moody, gloomy electronics dominate the soundtrack to ``The
Beach,'' which is highlighted by tracks from the likes of Moby,
UNKLE and Leftfield, along with upbeat pop from Sugar Ray, Blur and
New Order. Don't expect any ``Titanic''-size hits from this one. 2
stars
</P>
<P>
   Singer-songwriters including Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Van
Morrison and Neil Young pack the ``Wonder Boys'' album. The disc
contains the spirited ``Things Have Changed,'' Dylan's first new
recording since 1997's ``Time Out of Mind,'' used in the film as
the main- and end-title theme. Other memorable tracks include
Young's ``Old Man,'' Tim Hardin's ``Reason to Believe'' and Tom
Rush's ``No Regrets.'' 2 1/2 stars &QL;

 &QL; 
Sweet Honey in the Rock and James Horner/Soundtrack to ``Freedom
Song'' (Sony Classical)
</P>
<P>
   For recordings of '50s and '60s politically tinged spirituals,
you can't do much better than the heartfelt, harmonious renditions
of women's quintet Sweet Honey in the Rock. And anyone who owns the
``Titanic'' soundtrack likely ranks James Horner among the best
storytelling composers working in Hollywood today. Horner and Sweet
Honey make a great combination on the new soundtrack to ``Freedom
Song,'' a TNT movie about grass-roots civil rights efforts in
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar songs like ``Woke Up This Morning With My Mind Stayed
on Freedom,'' ``Eyes on the Prize'' and ``This Little Light of
Mine'' are bridged with instrumental intervals written and
performed by Horner _ some with Sweet Honey scatting in the
background _ that capture moods and carry the story forward. 3

Hey, sports fans, don't let the February doldrums get you down. You
know, this is the month after the NFL season ends, before baseball
spring training starts in earnest, before the NCAA tournament,
while the meaningless NBA and NHL seasons drag on until the real
season _ the playoffs _ start in the spring.
<P>
   But there is real competition happening right now in the sports
world.
</P>
<P>
   It's on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The battle was trench warfare even before yesterday, when
cybermogul Paul Allen bought the venerable Sporting News. Under
Times Mirror's stewardship, www.sportingnews.com was the
11th-ranked sports site, according to Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   The big three sports media companies, and their backers, are
Disney's ESPN.com, CBS' SportsLine.com and Time Warner's CNNSI.com
(a joint venture of CNN and Sports Illustrated). Other big players
are the leagues themselves, with NFL.com and NBA.com also ranking
in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   The top sports site, with almost twice the Web traffic of its
closest competitor, is AOL's Sports Channel, but that draws most of
its content from SportsLine.com.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on strong, though, is FoxSports.com, a newly revamped
offering from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. that cracked the top 10
last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the game for one reason, and that's to win,'' said
Danny Greenberg, vice president of FoxSports.com, serving up
appropriately cliched sports metaphors. ``We were late to the game
on the Web, but we still view it as the first inning.''
</P>
<P>
   FoxSports started as a section of TVGuide.com, but now it's
getting its act together. It is taking some novel approaches that
should help it continue to gain ground on the leaders, including:

network broadcasting sports in 22 regions, including the Bay Area.
Greenberg says the company has so far created 18 corresponding Web
sites, using local on-air personalities to help build the Web
presence.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; _Stats.  &LR; Last month, News Corp. bought Stats Inc., the official
statistician for Major League Baseball and a company that supplies
stats for more than 80 percent of the fantasy games on the
Internet, Greenberg says. That's important, as FoxSports.com plans
to add to its fantasy offerings, among the most popular features of
any sports Web site.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; _High school sports.  &LR; Fox started ranking top prep athletes last
fall and found popularity ``more incredible than I ever would have
thought,'' Greenberg says. ``On a daily basis, it outdraws the NBA
and NFL.'' With regional correspondents, Fox plans to do even more
in this arena.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; _Alternate technologies. &LR;  Fox has deals with TimeWarner's
RoadRunner service to bring proprietary services to households with
high-speed cable connections to the Internet, and it's also
investigating mobile and handheld electronics devices. In these
areas, Greenberg says, the vast reach of News Corp. will help
provide leverage and access.
</P>
<P>
   For all its advantages, though, it has some challenges ahead as
well. ESPN is probably the best-known brand in sports media today.
SportsLine.com is an agile, Internet-only company that has an early
mover edge.

<P>
   And CNNSI, well _ magazine readers know Sports Illustrated's

the Internet.  &QL; 
BASEBALL DOT COM:  &QL; 
I took my 4-month-old son, Harry, to a luncheon last week on
Treasure Island, where our hosts, Fox Sports Net, the cable network
that televises Giants and A's games, tried to get the local media
excited about the forthcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   Giants manager Dusty Baker and his A's counterpart, Art Howe,
predicted wonderful things for their teams in the season ahead, but
Harry didn't care about any of that. This new generation is
interested in only one thing: the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   So Harry liked hearing what Sandy Alderson, once the A's general
manager and now Major League Baseball's executive vice president of
baseball operations, had to say.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson explained how a few weeks ago, Major League Baseball
persuaded all of its teams to turn their Web operations over to the
league office. It's a striking deal because it departs from the
league's television practice, in which some teams, such as like
 &LR; the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves, are able to stay on top
because of the money they make from their local television rights,
and small-market teams suffer.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  On the Internet, though, the teams will cede their Web sites
_ which sell tickets and merchandise and provide stats, news and
even radio broadcasts _ to the league, and the league will make
sure content is uniform and revenues are shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Net, they saw the big picture,'' Alderson said.
``One-thirtieth of what could be created (by an aggregate
operation) is greater than what any one can create.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked at Harry to see if he was satisfied with this response.
He was asleep in his stroller.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RED HERRING, GREENBACKS: &QL; 
Is the Web eclipsing magazines? Look at the unusual case of the
Ziff-Davis investment in San Francisco's Red Herring
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff, a leading tech mag publisher, had a 10 percent stake in
the Herring, known for its magazine that focuses on high finance in
the tech world.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Herring has been on the hustings, trying
to raise beaucoup bucks to grow its online business.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ziff-Davis was undergoing a breakup. The
magazine unit was sold off, and the online component, ZDNet, will
become the company.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the Herring found a new soul mate. ZDNet not only
inherited Ziff-Davis' investment in the Herring, but it also
participated last week in the Herring's $28 million round of
funding. While Ziff-Davis publishing leaders Eric Hippeau and Tom
McGrade step off the Herring's board of directors, ZDNet Executive
Vice President Barry Briggs and Vice President Dan Farber take
their places.
</P>
<P>
   ``ZDNet raised their hand because they think we have a
tremendous dot-com opportunity,'' said Red Herring CEO Chris Alden.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SELLING THESTREET.COM: &QL; 
TheStreet.com hadn't even implemented its new strategy of making
its Web site free when word leaked out yesterday that the company
has retained investment bank Wasserstein Perella &AMP; Co. to ``explore
the wide variety of strategic partnerships,'' in the words of
TheStreet CEO Thomas Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   What that usually means is: The bank is shopping the company
around.
</P>
<P>
   Who would buy it? Speculation turns first to the New York Times
Co. and News Corp., both of which have invested in TheStreet. The
Times even runs a joint Web newsroom with the upstart Web site.
Yahoo and E-Trade have also been mentioned as potential suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps TheStreet's rival MarketWatch.com, based in San
Francisco, might snap up the firm?
</P>
<P>
   No comment, says MarketWatch CEO Larry Kramer. But Kramer adds,
``It is sure great to be validated as No.1.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer praises TheStreet for its strong reporting, writing and
analysis, but says, ``They made one bad bet,'' charging for
information. ``That was not a little mistake,'' Kramer says.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer says his site garners more than 150 million page views
per month, while TheStreet reports fewer than 25 million. ``The
question becomes, if they change their model, how long is it going
to take them to get to our size?'' Kramer asks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NOLAN'S UPSIDE: &QL; 
Ousted Mercury News tech gossip queen Chris Nolan's column-in-exile
will start appearing on Upside Today, the online adjunct of San
Francisco biz-tech mag Upside. Her high-tech dish will continue
appearing in the New York Post once a week, as it has for the past
couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Merc has posted a job listing on the Craig's List
Web site for someone who can write ``the juicy
heard-at-the-water-cooler tidbits and the seen-at-the-society-event
news that reflects the money and power of Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, the paper had someone like that, but it reassigned her to
Redwood City _ and now she's writing for the New York Post and
Upside.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the job listing should note: Candidates not eligible for
``friends and family'' stock deals.
</P>

NEXTCARD NEARS APPROVAL ON KEY PATENT 
</HEADLINE>
 _ SF CHRON   By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Internet credit card issuer NextCard is expected to announce today
a patent development that the company hopes is a first step toward
gaining the exclusive right to take card applications over the Web.
<P>
   NextCard, the largest credit card company that operates only
over the Internet, said it got a notice last month from the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office protecting certain aspects of its
online credit card application and pricing system. The office
issues such notices before it actually awards patents.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say NextCard's likely patent only gives them narrow
protections and will almost certainly not give them a monopoly on
online credit applications.
</P>
<P>
   The government notice covered one of a series of patent
applications San Francisco's NextCard has filed connected to
selling credit cards over the Internet. Company officials said
their aim is to gain the sole right to take applications online, in
effect crippling rivals on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say we want to have the whole online application process
covered is a true statement,'' said NextCard Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Jeremy Lent.
</P>
<P>
   If NextCard's claims are successful, the result would be ``one
company dominating the channel that would be the future of the
industry,'' Lent said. Still, he admitted, it's far from certain
that NextCard's remaining patent requests will be granted.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said NextCard's larger claim is weak since patents
are only granted for inventions that aren't obvious. Competitors
could argue that using the Internet to process credit card
applications is a readily apparent use of Web technology.
</P>
<P>
   NextCard ``would have difficulty with the broad concept (of
taking applications over the Internet.) They would have to show
that it would not be obvious,'' said Neil Smith, a San Francisco
intellectual property attorney with the firm Limbach &AMP; Limbach.
</P>
<P>
   The company's patent applications are based on an emerging area
of the law extending protections that traditionally covered
inventions to business methods. Internet companies have been
particularly aggressive in using patents to cover their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Online bookseller Amazon.com, for example, won a patent last
year covering its one-click service that allows customers to store
shipping and billing data so that the information doesn't have to
be re-entered every time they make a purchase. It is suing
Barnesandnoble.com to prevent it from offering the same service.
</P>
<P>
   The NextCard patent application covered by the government notice
concerns the company's custom-tailored method for setting credit
card interest rates. Applicants who agree to transfer balances from
other card issuers are instantly offered lower rates than those
offered people who don't transfer balances.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is central to NextCard's strategy, since the
company makes more money from customers who transfer balances than
from those who start at zero. As a result, NextCard is able to
offer the best interest rates to its potentially most profitable
customers.
</P>
<P>
   NextCard had approximately 220,000 credit card accounts at the
end of 1999, up 64 percent from the year before. Providian
Financial, a leading rival, said this week that it also has 220,000
online credit card accounts, under its own name or the Aria brand.

 Reilly Seeks Revenue-Sharing Deal to Help Buy Examiner  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Clint Reilly asked Hearst Corp. officials last week to consider a
revenue-sharing deal if he purchases the San Francisco Examiner,
his lawyer said yesterday.
<P>
   Joseph Alioto, attorney for former mayoral candidate Clint
Reilly, said he and Reilly met for four hours in New York on Friday
with Hearst chief legal officer James Asher before Reilly expressed
interest in buying the afternoon Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   More details surfaced yesterday surrounding Reilly's surprise,
11th-hour expression of interest in buying the Examiner. Hearst,
based in New York, is trying to sell the afternoon paper to meet
antitrust concerns following its offer to buy The San Francisco
Chronicle in August for roughly $660 million.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly has sued Hearst to stop it from buying The Chronicle and
closing the Examiner. The two papers maintain separate editorial
staffs but share equally printing expenses and advertising revenues
under a joint operating agreement scheduled to expire in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto said Reilly's meeting with Asher covered ``all the topics
we're interested in,'' including an agreement with some aspects of
the current JOA agreement to make the Examiner more attractive and
possibly a revision of the current 50-50 profit split to reflect
the difference in circulation between the two papers.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst had no comment on Alioto's statements.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's daily circulation is 456,742 and the Examiner's
is 107,129. The two papers produce a combined Sunday edition.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto also suggested his client is working alone in seeking to
purchase the Examiner and is not, as some have speculated, part of
a consortium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always done everything on his own, without any help,''
Alioto said. ``There's no difference here.''
</P>
<P>
   Alioto declined to discuss Reilly's offer. Reilly is out of town
for two weeks. Hearst has not said when it will make a decision on
the Examiner's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Fang, owner of the San Francisco Independent and the other
rumored bidder, did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   But Oakland Tribune Publisher Scott McKibben, who said his boss
Dean Singleton still has no interest in purchasing the Examiner,
said Fang would have a good chance of making the Examiner
profitable _ especially if Hearst threw in some profit-sharing
arrangement to get the new owner started.
</P>
<P>
   McKibben suggested Fang could switch the Examiner to a morning
newspaper, combine its circulation with the Independent's and offer
advertisers a way to reach every household in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new owner, McKibben said the Examiner would need to cut
its editorial staff to about 125 people (from about 225 now), and
add about 175 sales, production, printing and delivery people.
</P>
<P>
   David Cole, a newspaper industry consultant in San Francisco,
said other than Reilly and Fang, the only other potential bidders
are probably real estate developers with an eye on the Examiner's
Fifth Street offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no buzz about any private or public newspaper chain
being interested,'' Cole said.
</P>

 GoodHome Spruces Up With FurnitureFind.com  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
For the second time in five months, online furniture seller
GoodHome.com is gobbling up a rival.
<P>
   The San Rafael company will announce today that it is merging
with FurnitureFind.com, a Michigan e-tailer of sofas, lamps, beds
and other home goods, in a deal worth about $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   The combined 230-employee firm will operate under the GoodHome
name and the headquarters will stay in San Rafael. FurnitureFind
will remain a stand-alone site _ at least for the foreseeable
forseeable  &LR; future.
</P>
<P>
   GoodHome, a privately held venture backed by publishing giant
Hearst and toymaker Mattel, launched in September. But in a
pre-emptive strike to eliminate some competition in the burgeoning
online furniture market, it merged with Virginia's nHabit.com
before either site was up and running.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly part of our strategy'' to merge with similar
companies, said GoodHome chief executive Doug Mack. ``Our sense is
that you have to move fast. And in this case, we saw an attractive
company, with deep manufacturing relationships, which would take
several years to develop on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   With the nHabit merger, GoodHome obtained Roger Horchow _ now
the company's chairman _ known for masterminding the merchandise
for the upscale Horchow Collection (now a unit of the Neiman Marcus
Group).
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be a good match,'' said Jeff Quinn, analyst at
Gomez Advisors, a Massachusetts Internet research firm. ``GoodHome
has positioned itself as providing advice on decorating and
grouping products to help people design rooms. FurnitureFind has a
great relationships with manufacturers and an abundance of
products. They've opened up the best of both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   For the fledgling GoodHome, FurnitureFind also adds needed
experience. The 4-year-old company, which grew out of an online
brochure for a 48-year-old family business, is practically ancient
in the cyberselling arena.
</P>
<P>
   While the move may help GoodHome grab a bigger piece of the
estimated $954 million online furnishings market this year, Quinn
Gomez  &LR; said GoodHome still faces intense competition.
</P>
<P>
   Living.com of Austin, Texas, has announced a $145 million deal
to promote its products on e-tailing behemoth Amazon.com, and
Furniture.com of Framingham, Mass., recently filed documents with
the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer its shares to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same public that has yet to embrace the industry
wholeheartedly, despite Gomez's projection that online furnishings
sales will reach $13.6 billion by 2004, compared with to  &LR; about
$423 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Point-and-click furniture purveyors are doing well, ``but no one
is hitting it out of the park,'' Quinn said. ``That has a lot to do
with people getting more comfortable spending large amounts of
money online. They'll spend $20 on a book or a CD, but they're not
as comfortable with furniture.''

WINSTON CUP TEAMS SEARCHING FOR SPEED TO CATCH DALE JARRETT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ With almost alarming ease, Dale Jarrett
has won everything worthy of a checkered flag during Speed Weeks at
the Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Pole. Bud Shootout Qualifier. Bud Shootout. In every
instance it was Jarrett, all day long. Today, however, Jarrett
could deliver the biggest psychological blow seen here in a decade
during the first Gatorade Twin 125-mile qualifying race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win ... and try to keep Earnhardt from winning 11 in
a row,'' said Jarrett, referring to Dale Earnhardt's record-setting
10-race winning streak in the Twin 125s. ``I think every one of us,
as much as we enjoy Earnhardt, we're all out to end that streak.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's two 50-lap sprints around the high-banked, 2.5-mile
trioval will fill positions 3-30 in what will be a 43-car field for
the NASCAR Winston Cup season-opening Daytona 500 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett and Earnhardt _ otherwise billed as ``The Dale and Dale
Show'' _ inexorably have been linked at Daytona. Jarrett's Daytona
500 victories in 1993 and 1996 came at the expense of runner-up
Earnhardt, who did not win his first Daytona 500 until 1998. After
six days of tweaking the aerodynamically challenged 2000 Chevrolet
Monte Carlo, Earnhardt admittedly is not the favorite today, in an
all-star field of 28 that also includes Bill Elliott, Mark Martin,
Rusty Wallace, Jeff Gordon, Bobby Labonte and Terry Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   All chasing Jarrett, perhaps all day long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about the IROC race, is that Jarrett won't be
driving that damned \RNo.\S 88 car,'' said Earnhardt, the reigning
champion of the International Race of Champions series that begins
here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jarrett has locks on the \RCup\S show right now,'' said
Earnhardt, who has won a record 33 races in all types of stock cars
at Daytona, but who will start ninth in today's Twin 125. ``We'll
see if we can stink that up on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from dismissing today's exercise, Jarrett said he is
``pretty close'' to sorting out his new car for race day. And so,
he insisted, are seven-time series champion Earnhardt and the usual
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to give up, no matter what we do,'' said
Jarrett, driver of the No. 88 Quality Care Service/Ford Credit
Taurus. ``It would certainly be a boost if we could go out there
\Rand dominate\S, especially in the race we have. Not to take away
from the group in the second race, but there's a lot of cars I see
in the first one that I know if I can beat them on Sunday, that
we'll have a good chance of winning the Daytona 500. So, it's an
important race for us. We need to see what our car's going to do
around these fast race cars, and what we can do in the draft, and
what our car will do for 50 laps on tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a fast race car. But handling's going to be the key
here, and we're struggling a little bit with the handling.''
</P>
<P>
   Based upon his pole-winning speed of 191.091 mph and his runaway
dash in the Bud Shootout, that looms as an ominous warning for
anyone attempting to stink up Jarrett's show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody comes here excited to start a new season,'' said
Jarrett, who is beginning his sixth year of driving for car owner
Robert Yates and fifth of working with crew chief Todd Parrott.
``You have to have that kind of killer instinct when you come here
because everybody is here with their very best equipment. If you're
struggling, it's hard to find \Rthe answer\S throughout the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all championship teams, Jarrett and Parrott have reloaded
in a bid to repeat the consistency that carried them to their first
championship. Specifically, Yates added five members of three-time
Cup champion Jeff Gordon's ``Rainbow Warriors'' pit crew, and their
precision work in both of Sunday's races keyed what turned out to
be runaway victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Daytona, obviously, Dale's got to drive a smart race and
try to stay out of trouble,'' said Parrott, who like Jarrett is a
second-generation NASCAR star. ``And the pit crew's got to try to
keep him up front. We didn't start out last year very good. We
started out upside down on our roof, but bounced back pretty good
from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett scored his only Did Not Finish in the 1999 Daytona 500,
when he was eliminated in a grinding 12-car wreck. Thirty-three
races later, however, that result was little more than a crumpled
footnote to a feel-good championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you win a championship, that carries over a lot of
confidence,'' said Jarrett, 43. ``I think we wanted to make sure we
didn't have any letdowns. We want to make sure we continue to work
hard. It's a hard pace to keep up, but the guys that want to win do
it.''

AFL-CIO MAPS A FIGHT AGAINST AN EASING OF CHINA TRADE
</HEADLINE>
  (See also LABOR-IMMIG) 
(Duplication warning: also moving in `i' news category.) 
(nk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ AFL-CIO officials Wednesday outlined an ambitious
campaign to persuade Congress to oppose President Clinton's efforts
to normalize trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   The labor officials buttressed their case by issuing the results
of a poll that found most Americans opposed normal trade with
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll, of 609 people around the country over three
days beginning Jan. 25, showed that 65 percent were against normal
trade relations with the Chinese and that 61 percent said China had
unfair trade policies. A particularly surprising result of the
survey, conducted for the federation by Peter D. Hart Research
Associates, was that a higher percentage of Republicans than
Democrats or independents opposed normal China trade.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Sweeney, the federation's president, said the labor

conservative Republicans to build a majority on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The labor federation has been the most powerful opponent of the
Clinton administration's trade accord with China, which, with
congressional approval, would remove trade barriers against the
Chinese and ease their entry into the World Trade Organization. The
AFL-CIO wants to make sure that instead, Congress continues its
annual reviews of trade with China, an exercise that often
irritates Beijing while pressuring it to improve its performance on
human rights and worker rights.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders said the battle they mount over China could be as
big as the huge but ultimately unsuccessful fight they undertook in
1993 to press Congress to reject the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gathered here for the AFL-CIO's winter meeting, labor leaders
said their fight against normalized trade with China would be part
of a larger, multiyear effort to make the global economy fairer to
workers in the United States and overseas. Sweeney said the labor
movement wanted to build on the December protests in Seattle
against the harshest effects of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democratic officials say they fear that labor's battle
against the administration's China trade policy could weaken union
members' support for the presidential candidacy of Vice President
Al Gore and for Democratic congressional candidates, at a time when
the labor movement wants to help the party regain control of the
House.
</P>
<P>
   But, to pressure members of Congress not to normalize trade with
China, the labor federation said it would run broadcast spots in 12
to 15 congressional districts where lawmakers are wavering. The
AFL-CIO also plans to get union members to meet with every member
of Congress, and to sponsor town meetings on the issue around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, the labor movement worked closely with
environmentalists and advocacy groups for the third world, and,
addressing some of their concerns, the AFL-CIO said Wednesday that
it was backing debt relief for poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing what it called a Campaign for Global Fairness, the
federation said it would seek to have countries gain the power to
bring trade sanctions against other nations where core labor
standards, like a ban on child labor, are frequently violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is insane that under the rules governing worldwide trade
today you can take action against a company for pirating a Madonna
videotape,'' Sweeney said, ``but you can take no action against a
company for employing children, or using forced labor, or violating
workers' fundamental rights, or poisoning the environment.''

   NEW ORLEANS _ AFL-CIO officials Wednesday outlined an ambitious
campaign to persuade Congress to oppose President Clinton's efforts
to normalize trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   The labor officials buttressed their case by issuing the results
of a poll that found most Americans opposed normal trade with
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll, of 609 people around the country over three
days beginning Jan. 25, showed that 65 percent were against normal
trade relations with the Chinese and that 61 percent said China had
unfair trade policies. A particularly surprising result of the
survey, conducted for the federation by Peter D. Hart Research
Associates, was that a higher percentage of Republicans than
Democrats or independents opposed normal China trade.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Sweeney, the federation's president, said the labor
movement hoped to work with Democrats and both moderate and
conservative Republicans to build a majority on the issue.

LAPD'S TOP OFFICIALS ADMIT LAPSES IN OVERSEEING DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (inserts Flynn quote after 4th graf) 
(bl) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Top police officials here offered a scathing
public indictment of the command and supervision within their
troubled department Wednesday, saying that thousands of new
officers had been hired with little vetting and then allowed to run
virtually out of control.
</P>
<P>
   These lapses, the officials said, were especially bad at some of
the special divisions designed to use aggressive tactics against
gangs and crack cocaine dealers, and had thus contributed to a
scandal that has shocked this city with reports of widespread and
unchecked police corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not have ability to have command and control and to
examine the department,'' said Deputy Chief Michael Bostic, in a
hearing before the Los Angeles City Council.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of a rapidly expanded and undersupervised force
have cropped up at police departments at other large cities,
notably Washington, D.C., where politicians responded to the crack
epidemic in the late 1980s and the early 1990s with calls for
placing more uniformed officers on the streets. In some of those
cities, there have been similar debates over whether the police
departments have brought on too many people too quickly, leading to
abuses that are now being uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is a sudden intrusion of new rookies, they
overwhelm the organization,'' said Edward A. Flynn, the police
chief of Arlington County, Va. ``They are able to impose their
values on the organization. They can be resistant to positive
mentoring.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has moved to the center of the increasingly
politicized debate over who was responsible for the abuses that
took place in Los Angeles _ including the shooting of a handcuffed
gang member, fabricated evidence and lying by officers _ and the
question of whether the police can reform themselves or whether an
outside body must do the job.
</P>
<P>
   The top officials' statements Wednesday were a startling
admission of the depths of the problems at the police department,
but they were also just another step in the intense political
battle being waged.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most political leaders, including the mayor,
have had little to say about the scandal, in which most of the
victims were gang members or drug dealers. Many here interpreted
the admissions by the police officials as part of an effort to pass
along blame for the problems and to head off the creation of an
outside body to investigate the corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council has not called for an outside investigation and
after Wednesday's hearing, several members said they were content
to let the current inquiries, at the police department and the
district attorney's office, take their course.
</P>
<P>
   But the efforts to limit the damage to the department were
crumbling. The police chief, Bernard C. Parks, acknowledged for the
first time that the systematic corruption might have existed beyond
the inner-city Rampart Division, where it had first been uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said that, though there was no criminal investigation yet
of other police divisions, ``the telltale signs'' of supervisory
lapses were present across the department and would be
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The police officials said Wednesday that all of the officers so
far implicated in the scandal had been hired in in the late 1980s
and early 1990s, when there was great pressure to add to the force
quickly, and that four of them should never have been hired because
of problems that should have been uncovered in the standard
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   The problems found among officers hired during that period
included arrests and histories of alcoholism, domestic violence or
outstanding debts, Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bostic said that in many instances there were ``very clear flags
that something was wrong, and either people did not find it, or
when they did, chose not to take action.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks has offered a broad program of reforms, including lie
detector tests for all applicants, better background checks, sting
operations of police officers to ferret out corruption, and the
hiring of 200 new people for the internal affairs division, which
investigates corruption. He has also called for the creation of a
special department to immediately freeze sites after police
shootings to avoid the kind of tampering with and planting of
evidence that has been uncovered at the Rampart Division.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal may also change the way the specialized police
divisions operate. They had been given great autonomy to pursue
gang members and drug dealers, spawning many complaints about
overly aggressive tactics. The police officials said Wednesday that
they planned to take away some of the units' autonomy and force
them back into mainstream procedures.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is growing concern among some politicians that damage
control is a prime objective at the police department. And some
City Council members and others have expressed concern that the
efforts to deflect blame may take priority over real corrective
action. That is why some people and groups, including state Sen.
Tom Hayden and the American Civil Liberties Union, have demanded an
outside investigation and intervention by federal authorities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The City Council has not made such demands yet, but some members
Wednesday expressed alarm at some of Parks' statement.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Chick, a member of the council and a former head of its
public safety commission, said that at the time the police
department was hiring the thousands of new officers she and others
demanded to know if the controls were in place. She said she had
been assured that they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where was the LAPD in standing up, as our law enforcement
experts, in saying we're making a mistake in hiring so many police
officers and not putting in place the other pieces?'' Chick asked.
``It never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks rejected questions about whether a code of silence among
police officers had contributed to the scandal. He insisted, ``It
is no more pervasive at the LAPD than in the general population.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, more than 40 criminal cases have been or will shortly be
overturned, and the district attorney has said that more are
coming. The city is also being sued by people who say they were the
victims of the police abuses, and some experts have estimated that
the cases could cost the city more than $200 million.

U.S. OFFICIALS TELL OF GROWING THREATS TO COMPUTER SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Adds 2 grafs at end for details provided by Reno about
Clinton's proposals)  
(bl) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A week after still-unidentified hackers paralyzed
several well-known commercial Internet companies, the country's
chief law enforcement and legal officers said Wednesday that
threats against computer networks have outstripped the government's
efforts to keep up with them.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before a Senate panel on Internet security, Attorney
General Janet Reno said last week's attacks on popular Web sites
illustrated the necessity of a coordinated law enforcement
strategy. ``How we deal with cyber-crime is one of the most
critical areas we face,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno proposed a five-year plan that would include tougher
penalties for hackers and standardized investigative technologies.
Such a step could lower the astronomical cost of security and
detection gear in an environment in which, she said, equipment is
obsolete almost as soon as its installed.
</P>
<P>
   Louis J. Freeh, the FBI director, told senators that the
investigation of last week's attacks was moving aggressively.
``There are fast-developing leads as we speak,'' Freeh said of the
search for those who barraged the computer systems of companies
like Yahoo, eBay and Amazon.com with meaningless data to clog the
paths of customers attempting to reach the sites.
</P>
<P>
   He said the investigation was being conducted in the United
States as well as in Germany and Canada. Scores of agents from FBI
offices in Atlanta, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle
are at work on the attacks, known within law enforcement circles as
``distributed denial of service'' cases.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, law enforcement officials have said they are
interviewing several people, including some computer hackers,
although they did not yet have evidence clearly indicating who was
responsible for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the seriousness of the problem, Freeh cited the
growing number of such cases, to 1,154 last year from 547 such
cases in 1998. The cases range from minor attacks by teen-age
vandals and disgruntled employees to highly sophisticated
intrusions possibly directed by foreign intelligence services, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said that in 1998, 399 cases were closed, in contrast to
to 1999, when 912 cases closed. Almost none of the cases resulted
in prosecutions. The FBI closes a case when the agency decides
there is no basis for further investigation. The cases do not
include other major categories of cyber-crime, like Internet fraud
or child pornography.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Freeh acknowledged the difficulties
computer cases pose for law enforcement. ``In short, even though we
have markedly improved our capabilities to fight cyber intrusions,
the problem is growing even faster and thus we are falling further
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer crime is one of the most dynamic problems the FBI
faces today,'' Freeh said. ``Just think about how many computers
you have owned and how many different software packages you have
learned over the past several years, and you can only begin to
appreciate the scope of the problem we are dealing with in the
fast-changing era,'' Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony by Reno and Freeh followed a White House meeting
convened Tuesday by President Clinton with technology experts and
Internet executives about how to improve the security of the
country's computer networks. Clinton adopted a reassuring tone,
saying the assaults were not an ``electronic Pearl Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry officials have said they want strong action
against computer criminals but fear that government intervention
and new criminal laws could unintentionally stifle the phenomenal
growth and creativity of the technology industries.
</P>
<P>
   Amplifying on the president's request for an extra $37 million
for the Justice Department to enforce computer security, Reno said
the money would include $4 million for 59 new assistant U.S.
attorneys and 9 additional attorneys in the criminal division to
prosecute computer and child pornography crimes; $8.7 million for
training for state and local law enforcement agencies; and $11.4
million for 100 new FBI computer analysis and response team
members.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she told the committee, ``we intend to enhance law
enforcement's ability to deal with evidence available on computers
by developing up to 10 new regional computer forensic labs.'' &QL;

<P>
   Down-on-their-luck space humans crash-land on a desert planet
populated by strange, dangerous things.
</P>
<P>
   You've seen it before. ``Pitch Black'' doesn't do it
particularly worse or better than the median ``Alien''-attrition
norm.
</P>
<P>
   Radha Mitchell (``High Art'') is the pilot, Fry, who loses most
of the ship and its sleeping passengers in the accident. She feels
guilty for the rest of the movie, especially about almost
jettisoning the pod containing the few survivors in order to save
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Except for bounty hunter Johns (Cole Hauser) and his violent
captive Riddick (Vin Diesel), the castaways are essentially defined
by their expendability. Keith David's Imam and a few kids are
presented as devout Muslims _ for no compelling reason other than
they make good vehicles for questioning God's mercy in a horror
film.
</P>
<P>
   An abandoned mining station is found where there's an old ship
that may be used for rescue. They also find nasty things with
wings, tentacles and very active teeth lurking underground. But the
creatures aren't too urgent of a threat, since they're allergic to
light, and the planet fortunately revolves around three suns (an
astronomical phenomenon that's never explained).
</P>
<P>
   Things get edgy when Riddick escapes his bonds. But that's
nothing compared to what happens when the Saharan spaceball enters
an unanticipated total eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   You never get a good, complete look at any of the monsters, but
to compensate for that there seem to be many of them. Director
David Twohy, who co-wrote ``The Fugitive,'' overexposes the
blistering daytime footage and shoots the night stuff, well, dark.
In this way, the movie is rudimentarily cinematic.
</P>
<P>
   Acting doesn't count so much as the illusion of endurance in a
project like this. Whatever allotted time they have before being
violently yanked off the screen, the actors endure. Fry and the
not-thoroughly-evil Riddick have redemption issues and a certain
animal attraction to contend with as well, so Mitchell and Diesel
get a little extra work.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it's scary and some of it isn't. There is gore, but
you've seen worse.
</P>
<P>
   You won't waste your time watching ``Pitch Black.'' But there
are better things to do. &QL;

`NOT ONE LESS' EMBRACES HUMAN SPIRIT

<P>
   A sweet and winning tale of an innocent girl's fierce
determination, ``Not One Less'' finds Chinese director Zhang Yimou
embracing the very same themes he did eight years ago in ``The
Story of Qiu Ju.'' Only here, Yimou has cast the film entirely with
non-professionals, with all participants roughly playing the same
roles they have in life. The gambit suits the story's simplicity,
giving ``Not One Less'' a freshness that is as absorbing as it is
appealing. This is a very special movie.
</P>
<P>
   The film tells the story of 13-year-old Wei Minzhi (Wei Minzhi;
the characters in the film have the same names as the actors), who
comes to work as a substitute teacher at a remote mountain primary
school. The school's teacher, Gao, has to leave for a month to care
for his ailing mother. Even though Wei Minzhi is just a bit older
than many of her students, she is left in charge because no one
else is willing to go to such a remote destination.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Gao admonishes Wei Minzhi to keep the remaining students
in class. He wants to return and find ``not one less'' than the
current enrollment number. This is easier said than done. For one
the thing, the crumbling school's only resource is chalk _ and the
teacher has only enough for one stick a day. More significant, many
of the school's students come from poor families who are heavily in
debt. These children are often sent to find work in the city in
order to help their families meet their obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Wei Minzhi herself doesn't appear up to the task of
teaching. Her authority is less than commanding and she seems
largely content to write the lesson on the board and then guard the
door so none of the students can escape. When the children ask her
to do something, she replies, ``There's nothing I can do.'' She
feels that overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   However, when one of her students, the likable troublemaker
Zhang Huike, is forced to go to the city to find work, we find out
just how stubborn Wei Minzhi can be. It's in this discovery that
the film achieves a moving power that is made all the more poetic
by the simple, naturalistic way Yimou has shot the movie.
</P>
<P>
   In its mood and themes, ``Not One Less'' bears a striking
resemblance to Yimou's 1992 film, ``The Story of Qui Ju,'' which
starred Gong Li as a determined innocent who travels to the city to
seek justice for her husband. Both movies are full of sincere
emotions, unfeeling bureaucrats and heart-rending humanity. The
only false note in ``Not One Less'' comes in its ending, which is a
tad too upbeat. But then, Yimou clearly wants to believe his
country's cycle of rural poverty can be broken and you can't
begrudge him his hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Yimou leavens the drama with plenty of sweet humor, particularly
in the first hour when Wei Minzhi settles into her situation and
rather inadvertently becomes a good teacher. The decision to cast
the film by finding people to play characters like themselves leads
to several interesting performances, particularly from the young
students. Every scene in the classroom rings true. And when the
action shifts to the city, Yimou ups the ante by shooting scenes on
the sly, apparently without the participants knowing they're being
filmed.
</P>
<P>
   As for Wei Minzhi, she's a tremendous discovery, a highly
affecting young woman who provides Yimou with a poignant heroine
fully capable of conveying the stirring humanity that runs through
his work. ``Not One Less'' continues that masterful vision. &QL;

<P>
   The sympathetic mobster comedy trend reaches a thematic
peak/moral nadir with ``The Whole Nine Yards,'' a film in which the
best people are the most ruthless killers and those who like and
abet them.
</P>
<P>
   The outlandish angle is a step beyond that of last year's
``Analyze This,'' a film this one otherwise wishes to emulate in
every way. ``Nine Yards'' isn't as funny, but after a slow start it
develops into its own kind of farcical good time. And its extreme
nature actually adds to the laughs _ what you're expected to buy
into here is often so dark, the only honest response to it is in
gasping chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of this presumes that your sense of humor is not
connected to your conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Some very good comic performances, especially from the actors
you least expect to be that way, add to the film's overall ambience
of can-you-believe-it? hilarity. Bruce Willis, for example, has
been playing action heroes or bland leading men for so long that
he's made us forget what great timing and amusing attitude he
regularly exhibited on TV's ``Moonlighting.'' It's back here in
every insinuating line-reading, only this time with an
appropriately sardonic, life-and-death charge instead of mere,
leering suggestiveness. Willis hasn't looked like he's had this
much fun since ``Pulp Fiction'' _ which says more than it's
probably healthy to contemplate about what turns his acting juices
on.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's sneaky Amanda Peet, a young actress on the WB's
``Jack and Jill'' romantic angst series, who starts out in a glibly
pretty throwaway part, but is really ``Nine Yards''' comedy stealth
bomb, a time-released booby trap of escalating character
contradictions. When she and Willis start sparking _ they're each
infatuated with the other's professional killing skills _ they give
the whole ``Prizzi's Honor'' premise a new and ticklesome,
screwball spin.
</P>
<P>
   Willis' Jimmy ``The Tulip'' Tudeski is a Chicago hit man turned
informant who, eschewing the witness protection program, sets up an
easily traceable, seemingly suicidal new life in a Montreal suburb.
His neighbor is an unhappy American dentist, Nicholas ``Oz''
Oseransky (``Friends''' Matthew Perry), who's married to a French
Canadian shrew (Rosanna Arquette with a wandering accent and
abjectly lost comic judgment).
</P>
<P>
   Oz quickly recognizes The Tulip for who he is, but Jimmy insists
on becoming pals with the jumpy dentist. Plot contrivances get Oz
in up past his neck with a vengeful mob boss (Kevin Pollak), a
gigantic underworld enforcer (``The Green Mile's'' Michael Clarke
Duncan) and Jimmy's endangered wife (``Species''' Natasha
Henstridge). Just about everybody Oz encounters is double-crossing
someone else, and they all want somebody or other _ oftentimes him
_ dead.
</P>
<P>
   Laugh riot, huh? Amazingly, it often is, thanks in great part to
director Jonathan Lynn's patient setup of good slow-fused gags
(Mitchell Kapner is credited with the script) and a tonal control
of the potentially offensive material that's nothing short of
astonishing. And while Perry isn't the funniest person in the film
_ he essentially adds pratfalls and mortal fear to your basic
Chandler Bing _ he never fails to provide the antic energy that
keeps the convoluted story skipping along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whole Nine Yards'' is easily Lynn's best movie since ``My
Cousin Vinny,'' and, like that one, it triumphs on a combination of
careful craftsmanship, deft casting and well-sprung surprises. And
as he did with the earlier film's cliched, fish-out-of-water
dynamics, Lynn once again finds a way to breathe freshness into a
concept that's quite overused in this age of ``Sopranos'' worship.
</P>
<P>
   So, enjoy. And see you afterward in line at the confessional. &QL;

`HANGING UP' RINGS IN A SHRILL SORT OF WAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   The unsurprising news that families can drive you nuts is
unnecessarily emphasized by the shrill clan depicted in ``Hanging
Up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mozells _ three adult sisters and their rascally, dying dad
_ are supposed to be the lovable-despite-their-foibles types that
fans of comic tearjerkers love to laugh and cry with. But this
bunch rarely gets far enough beyond the foibles stage to make you
want to spend time with them, let alone share their life issues.
Which, annoyingly, doesn't prevent them in the least from
bombarding you with information about the slightest variation in
every single, trite feeling that darts through their irritated
nervous systems.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of telephones in this film. They're used to frustrate more
than facilitate communication, to keep unpleasantness at a distance
and to torture the central protagonist, Meg Ryan as middle sister
Eve. And they are, of course, indications that this is an Ephron
sisters production (Delia, whose novel the film is based upon,
co-scripted with Nora), serving the same
ain't-it-hard-to-make-real-connections-in-this-modern-world
function as computers in ``You've Got Mail'' and talk radio in
``Sleepless in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nora Ephron declined to direct this one, which is very
loosely based on her own crazy-making father's relationship with
his grown girls. That task fell to Diane Keaton, who plays eldest
daughter Georgia and has made one interesting film about an
interesting family, ``Unstrung Heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   That record stands at one.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is the overachieving egomaniac, a superstar journalist
with her own self-named glamour magazine. The baby, Maddy (Lisa
Kudrow), is a flake who's just recently found minor success as a
soap opera actress after innumerable false career starts.
</P>
<P>
   And Eve is the martyr, although she'll tell you she's the
responsible nurturer who's holding the family together. She has a
young son and a nice but often away-on-business husband (Adam
Arkin) and runs a high-end party-planning business. As if that
didn't keep her hopping, when ex-screenwriter father Lou (Walter
Matthau) takes a turn toward catastrophic illness and delirium, he
and the other girls just naturally assume that it's Eve's job to
attend to him ... which, for the most part, means taking his
dreaded calls.
</P>
<P>
   It's all pretty innocuous stuff, made obnoxious by how much
dramatic weight and off-the-mark comic observation is put on it.
</P>
<P>
   There are repeated flashbacks to earlier incidents involving
trash-talking, sometimes mean-drunk, more often mildly misbehaving
pops, all part of Eve's effort to figure out why she loves the old
problem (though the film seems to think otherwise, we're left
presuming she's just a wimp). When any configuration of sisters is
on screen, it's usually for a shouting match or, if they're not in
the mood for recrimination, one of those bonding movie food fights
that no woman who cares the least about her clothes would ever
enjoy. At one point, an Iranian surrogate mom figure (Ann
Bortolotti) is brought in to provide much-needed aphorisms,
moral-supporting hugs and make an Ayatollah joke.
</P>
<P>
   The Mozells' real mother, played by Cloris Leachman in one
flashback scene, just up and abandoned her family when the girls
were little. She says that was because she just wasn't cut out to
do the parenting thing (it took her three tries to realize this?),
and we're of course supposed to despise her blithe lack of
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a few viewers, I suspect, will be sympathetic to
the old gal. At least she has enough sensitivity to politely lie
about what really drove her away from this wearying,
overdramatizing brood. &QL;

`BOILER ROOM' ECHOES `WALL STREET,' `GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Boiler Room,'' a high-energy look at a group of Generation-X
stock swindlers, is a modestly entertaining film that's mostly
derivative of other, better movies like ``Wall Street'' and
``Glengarry Glen Ross.'' But at least first-time writer-director
Ben Younger is smart enough to acknowledge those sources, while
simultaneously bidding to become part of the greed canon.
</P>
<P>
   A good night's entertainment for ``Boiler Room's'' young men is
to sit around a sparsely appointed mansion (who needs furniture
when you're always at the office?) and watch ``Wall Street'' on
video, seeing who can do the best Michael Douglas impersonation.
The company's chief recruiter, Ben Affleck, (effectively echoing
Alec Baldwin's role in ``Glengarry Glen Ross'') has seemingly
memorized David Mamet's ``Glengarry'' script. His spiel is filled
with Mamet lingo. (``ABC,'' he instructs, as in ``always be
closing.'')
</P>
<P>
   The film's boiler room is a bomb-shelter-like chamber located
far away from Wall Street in the boonies of Long Island. There,
scores of 20-something men with self-esteem issues ply their trade,
manically calling prospective people they've never met and trying
to interest them in ``hot'' stocks. The offerings they're peddling
are worthless, but that hardly matters. These guys appeal to our
society's greed and desire to make a fast buck. Nobody wants to
watch the parade pass them by.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the film's watchful young protagonist, Seth (Giovanni
Ribisi), doesn't. That would mean he'd have to find a real job. And
after making some fast money running a casino out of his apartment,
Seth is looking for bigger stakes and larger scores. He's also
looking for the cloak of respectability because what he wants most
is the respect and love of his father (Ron Rifkin), a judge who has
never been generous with his approval. (With a son like Seth, it's
hard to blame him.)
</P>
<P>
   Seth signs up with the bogus brokerage firm J.T. Marlin, where
he's promised that he'll make his first million within three years.
This is where ``Boiler Room'' works best, right in the
testosterone-fueled trenches, with Seth and his associates
energetically working the phones in search of the latest ``whale''
(a customer with plenty of cash).
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Younger, who says he was once recruited as a
boiler room trainee, stages these scenes with plenty of energy and
a keen eye for detail. Unfortunately, his storytelling skills don't
extend to the movie's interpersonal dramas. Here, ``Boiler Room''
lapses into tired theatrics, its father-son soap opera a pale
imitation of Charlie Sheen's situation in ``Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Ribisi shows considerable intelligence and craft, as long as the
story stays focused on the money. A subplot involving a romance
with the beautiful office secretary (Nia Long) is unnecessary,
apart from the hope it will give to short, nebbishy twerps in the
audience. Supporting cast standouts include Affleck in the showy
role and Vin Diesel, Ribisi's ``Saving Private Ryan'' co-star, as a
boiler room star who doesn't want to consider the moral
implications of his profession.
</P>
<P>
   Given the movie's conventional last act (and its aping of ``Wall
Street''), moral comeuppance isn't so much possible as it is
required. Yet you get the feeling Younger really likes these guys
and hopes that someday, somewhere, amoral men will sit around and
watch his movie, quoting its best lines. Best guess: They'll stick
to his source material. &QL; 
____ &QL; 
The film: ``Boiler Room'' (R; language). &QL; 
The stars: Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Nia Long, Nicky Katt, Scott
Caan, Ron Rifkin, Ben Affleck. &QL;

U.S. ASKS JAPAN TO CONSIDER MAINTAINING SUPPORT FOR U.S. MILITARY
OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS grafs 1 &AMP; 2 to streamline and clarify; CORRECTS title of
Tsutomu Kawara to DEFENSE MINISTER.) 
 (jt/js) 
 By CALVIN SIMS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott called on the
Japanese government Wednesday to reconsider a proposal to reduce
its financial support for U.S. troops stationed in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott held two days of talks here after a move by Japanese
officials last month to cut payments to the United States to cover
the costs incurred by U.S. military forces in Japan for labor,
utilities, facilities, maintenance and training.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese financial support for American military operations
began in 1978, when the U.S. economy was foundering and Japan's
cost of living had skyrocketed. The Japanese government, which paid
about $2.5 billion to support the American military last year, is
now seeking to reduce those payments because it has fallen upon
hard economic times.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott, who led an American delegation including Defense
Undersecretary Walter Slocombe, asked Japan's foreign minister,
Yohei Kono, to generate public support for continuing the host
nation assistance for the U.S. military, said Japanese foreign
affairs officials familiar with the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I discussed with foreign Minister Kono, Japan and the
United States bring different contributions to our security
alliance,'' Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bases and host nation support that Japan provides are a
critical contribution to the alliance,'' he said. ``Host nation
support is not just another line item in the budget, it is a
critical aspect of our alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese foreign officials said that there was no immediate
response from Kono but that the government's position was that the
military support payments, while important to Japan's security, are
a heavy burden, especially during this time of fiscal difficulty.
The agreement under which Japan provides support to the U.S.
military is scheduled to expire in March 2001 and is currently
being renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Germany and South Korea also make support payments to the United
States to cover the costs of American military operations in those
countries, but those payments are small compared with Japan's.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 45,000 U.S. military personnel in Japan,
including 19,000 marines in Okinawa and 13,700 air force staff.
American military officials have said that the importance of the
military bases in Japan has increased in the last decade with the
closing of bases in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the bases in Japan were especially vital for
responding to security threats from China, North Korea, or Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Slocombe, who is defense undersecretary for policy, Wednesday
called on Japan and the United States to continue cooperating on a
planned theater missile defense system to guard against the threat
posed by North Korea's missile program.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with the Japanese defense minister, Tsutomu Kawara,
Slocombe said that the United States and Japan needed to consider
``a military approach'' in dealing with North Korea, Japanese
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, North Korea fired a short-range ballistic missile ver
the Japanese mainland and into the Pacific Ocean, raising concerns
across Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, North Korea threatened to test launch a more advanced
missile with a longer range and greater accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to those threats, the United States and Japan signed
an agreement to conduct joint research on a missile defense system,
which is estimated to cost as much as $521 million in the initial
phase that would be split equally by both countries.
</P>
<P>
   The theater missile defense system is intended to protect the
United States and its allies from incoming ballistic missiles
flying within about 1,800 miles' radius by detecting them with
satellites and shooting them down with missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a recent agreement by North Korea to suspend its missile
development program in exchange for the United States' lifting
economic sanctions, Slocombe expressed concern that the Stalinist
country still poses a security risk to the region, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related issue, Talbott told Japanese officials Wednesday
that the United States wanted the government to shut down an
industrial-waste incinerator that is polluting an American naval
air base in Atsugi, just west of Tokyo, U.S. embassy officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   A survey conducted by the U.S. and Japanese governments found
high levels of dioxin in the air at the navy base, which is located
350 meters from the incinerating complex, which is operated by a
private company.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese foreign ministry officials said the government has
spent $12 million to reduce the plant's emissions and is currently
pressuring the incinerator's operator to install filtering
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy officials here said the American delegation also
discussed issues related to Russia, Southeast Asia, Indonesia,
Japan's global role, and preparations for the economic summit
meeting of major industrialized nations that is scheduled to take
place in Okinawa in July.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation left for Beijing Wednesday evening where it is
expected to discuss the anti-missile shield, which China and Russia
have opposed because they cannot afford to a develop program and
they fear the system will give the United States and its allies a
strategic advantage if it works.

DOWNING STREET TALKS FAIL TO PATCH UP NORTHERN IRELAND RIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subbing throughout for additional quotes by Adams, Blair and
others; new 2nd graf provides better background and context; story

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Demands by the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, that
Britain restore the suspended Northern Ireland government were met
with counterdemands Wednesday from other participants in a crisis
session at 10 Downing St. that the Irish Republican Army first
return to disarmament talks.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour meeting of Roman Catholic and Protestant
politicians with Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish
counterpart, Bertie Ahern, adjourned still deeply divided over the
weapons issue, which has repeatedly halted progress in putting the
elements of the April 1998 peace agreement into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Adams, whose party is the political wing of the IRA,
said: ``We have no room at all to do anything in this situation.
The only breakthrough which can start to make politics work is a
return to the institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that he had not persuaded Britain to
move on reviving those governmental institutions. ``There appears
to me anyway to be no sign that the British government is prepared
to do that,'' he said grimly outside the British prime minister's
official residence.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire for the IRA's refusal to make any move on weapons,
Adams testily complained that his party was being unfairly used as
a scapegoat. ``I don't think we can play a useful role on the arms
issue when all we are met with is rejections and rebuttals,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also ruled out participating in a formal review of the
stalled peace negotiations, saying the British had acted illegally
in shutting down the Belfast administration last Friday. ``There
cannot be a review based on unilateral suspension,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, with Ahern by his side, said, ``Today wasn't the day we
were going to do anything but discuss the parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Blair's insistence that the time had come
for a start to IRA disarmament gained valuable support from remarks
made in Dublin by Ahern.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that it was unacceptable for republicans to continue to
take part in the Northern Ireland government while the IRA
stockpiles remained intact, Ahern told members of the Irish
parliament: ``Whether people like it or not, it is not compatible,
beyond a short transitional period, to have that democratic mandate
with armed backing. I cannot agree to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The republican movement, largely Catholic, favors closer links
with Ireland and is unaccustomed to being lectured to by an Irish
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern said the Irish and British governments could put the peace
settlement back on track rapidly with cooperation, but, he added,
``I can't put it back if only one part goes back on the track _ it
has to be all the parts.''
</P>
<P>
   His words may go some way toward closing a rift that had
developed between Britain and Ireland, the two sponsors of the
Ulster peace talks, over the British action suspending the
government in Belfast. Britain took the action, it said, because
the IRA had failed to begin disarming even after members of Sinn
Fein had been admitted to their ministerial positions in the
Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening while speaking to the Irish Parliament, Mr.
Ahern had been surprised by an announcement by the IRA that it was
ending its contact with weapons mediators and withdrawing from
negotiating fresh proposals it had made to consider disarming for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy leader of the moderate Catholic Social Democratic and
Labor Party, Seamus Mallon, who like Ahern had been opposed to the
suspension, joined in the criticism of the IRA on Wednesday for
pulling out of the consultations with the disarmament commission.
He said he found it incredible that the clandestine organization
had made its announcement at a time when Ahern was before his own
legislators in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only have they made a studied insult to Bertie Ahern, but
to the entire political process in Ireland as a whole and to the
Irish people,'' he said. The IRA, he said, was ``prepared to use
and abuse anybody in their own interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRA action was a dismaying development for supporters of the
peace plan who had been holding meetings throughout recent days
hoping that the new IRA arms initiative would be a basis for
restoring the home rule government. The IRA had offered late Friday
to consider putting its arms ``beyond use'' and suggested that it
would consider a timetable that would see full disarmament by the
May date fixed in the peace agreement. Then on Tuesday it took
those words off the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's meeting was scheduled to find a way to keep the
staggering peace process on its feet, and the consensus that
emerged was that the vexing issue of paramilitary disarmament had
to be confronted before any progress could be made on restarting
the mothballed Northern Ireland government. ``There is this issue
we have to resolve,'' Blair said at a news conference after the
session. ``We are going to knuckle down and get it resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams presented another proposal in which the government would
have to be restored before the issue of disarmament could be taken
up, but he had no takers outside his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at Downing Street, his chief rival, the Ulster Unionist
leader David Trimble, said, ``The onus is fairly and squarely on
the republican movement to put forward proposals as to how this is
going to work.''

   WASHINGTON _ Even as Texas Child Protective Services begins
investigating an Arizona family's decision not to use conventional
medicine on their 4-year-old son's brain cancer, a bill was filed
Wednesday to allow the boy to be treated by Houston doctor
Stanislaw Burzynski.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would give patients ultimate authority in
deciding whether to use drugs the Food and Drug Administration is
investigating but has not approved. Under current law, the FDA
makes that final decision based on what it says is best for the
patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans should have the right to make their own treatment
choices,'' Dan Burton, R-Ind., said in announcing the legislation.
``This legislation would allow patients to make informed choices
between treatments, having the FDA as a partner in the process
rather than a dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   An FDA spokesman, who said he had not seen the bill, Wednesday
repeated the agency's stance that ``there is no scientific and
ethical justification for using a child in research when a proven,
effective treatment is available.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton was joined by the boy, Thomas Navarro, and his parents,
James and Donna of Tuscon, as well as a child successfully treated
by Burzynski and a child visibly suffering the toxic effects of
radiation and chemotherapy. The FDA says the Navarro boy must try
radiation and chemotherapy without success before they'll allow
treatment by Burzynski, who uses a nontoxic alternative therapy
called antineoplastons.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand was Republican presidential candidate Alan Keyes,
who led a march from Capitol Hill to the Department of Health and
Human Services to deliver a letter signed by himself, Gary Bauer,
Steve Forbes, Orrin Hatch and John McCain calling on Secretary
Donna Shalala to intervene on behalf of the Navarros. A signature
is awaited from Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has expressed
similar sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Bush's support, Texas CPS Monday began investigating
a report of ``medical neglect'' against the Navarros. Confirming
that it is trying to contact the Navarros, Harris County CPS
spokeswoman Judy Hay said state law requires the agency to evaluate
any report it receives.
</P>
<P>
   After surgery to remove Thomas' medulloblastoma in September,
the Navarros opted not to do chemotherapy and radiation upon
learning its side effects in children can include not just nausea,
fatigue, hair loss and loss of control of bowels but also hearing
loss, spinal growth deficit, hypothyroidism and mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   After extensive research they decided they wanted Thomas treated
by Burzynski, whose experimental drug _ synthesized versions of
peptides found in blood and urine _ made him a folk hero to some
patients but a villain to the medical establishment, which went to
court to stop him. Though Burzynski was acquitted, he is only
allowed to prescribe antineoplastons in FDA-approved clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cohen, a lawyer specializing in health care and
regulatory affairs, said the bill, named the Thomas Navarro FDA
Patient Rights Act, would ``filter down'' and have a significant
effect on the medical regulatory system.
</P>
<P>
   But its future is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Past legislation to liberalize access to non-FDA-approved
treatment died quietly, and even though the bill has an emotional
appeal and is simple to grasp _ it simply amends the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act to restrict the FDA's authority as long as patients
are aware of the risks _ the Navarros know time is not on their
side.
</P>
<P>
   After all, without follow-up treatment to surgery to remove the
brain tumor, disease recurrence kills 90 percent of patients in one
year and 100 percent in two years. James Navarro already has gone
from hopeful two weeks ago to frustrated Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of negotiating behind the scenes,'' Navarro said.
``Men of evil negotiate behind the scenes. It's time to bring this
out in the daylight.''

MERGER SPECULATION ABOUNDS IN EUROPEAN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (UPDATES figures in 10th graf)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Europe's automobile industry has gone into
overdrive _ at least when it comes to merger speculation.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive day, shares of PSA Peugeot Citroen
jumped Wednesday on rumors that it was in talks with
DaimlerChrysler AG Those rumors followed persistent speculation
about Daimler seeking to acquire the automobile business of Fiat
SPA.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, British and German newspapers speculated that
Volkswagen AG might take over Rover Cars, the ailing British
subsidiary of BMW AG.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts believe that more car mergers are inevitable,
because manufacturers are under pressure to keep prices down and
yet roll out new models faster than ever.
</P>
<P>
   That said, most of the merger predictions thus far have been
wrong. One reason is that the most desirable or at least needy car
companies are still controlled by their founding families _ the
Peugeots of France, the Agnellis of Italy and the Quandts of
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those families has rejected the idea of selling out.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Peugeot once again denied it is in merger talks,
following rumors on Tuesday that DaimlerChrysler had offered 35
shares of its own stock and 10 euros for every 10 shares of
Peugeot.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Martin Folz, Peugeot's president, said in Paris Wednesday
that the company wanted to remain independent and had the ability
to do so. ``We want neither a merger nor an acquisition,'' Folz
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger question is, why would DaimlerChrysler want to
pursue it?
</P>
<P>
   Each new rumor about a big Daimler acquisition has sent its
share price down. Daimler's stock has declined 17 percent this
year, while the DAX index of leading German stocks has climbed
about 7.65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Daimler's decline reflects investor unhappiness about
possible takeovers of small-car makers like Fiat or Peugeot.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a capital markets point of view, we would rather see the
company say they are not going to do anything in small cars and
will return free cash flow to shareholders,'' said Christian
Breitsprecher, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's chairman, Juergen E. Schrempp, has left no
doubt that he badly wants to build up his small-car business _ the
one area that neither Mercedes Benz nor Chrysler have any real
strength.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts are overwhelmingly unhappy about a big push into
small cars. For one thing, the price competition in that segment is
brutal and the profit margins are much lower than for Mercedes
luxury cars or Chrysler's light trucks and sport-utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the margins available in the markets served by
Fiat and Peugeot are nowhere near comparable to those of
DaimlerChrysler,'' said Andrew Blair-Smith, an analyst in London at
Commerzbank.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, analysts worry that companies like Fiat or Peugeot
will require substantial new investment and management time.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts generally agree that Europe's smaller and weaker car
companies are under considerable pressure. Fiat lost money through
the first nine months of 1999, though it is now experiencing an
upswing and is believed to have turned a profit in the final
quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Peugeot fared better last year, with its automobile revenue
climbing 11.5 percent to 32.6 billion euros, or about $33 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But with an annual output of 2.5 million vehicles, far behind
the 4 million produced both by Volkswagen and DaimlerChrysler,
Peugeot faces the problem of trying to spread out the development
costs for new models over fewer vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, investors in Peugeot have been more than happy
about the merger speculation. Peugeot's stock jumped by 6 percent
on Tuesday and a further 1 percent Wednesday to reach 218.2 euros
per share, or $215.32.
</P>
<P>
   Peugeot and Daimler held extensive talks last fall about
collaborating on a new ``platform,'' or underlying blueprint, for
Daimler's troubled line of Smart subcompact two-seater cars. Those
talks broke off, apparently because of reservations by Daimler's
top executives, but they did not put end to Daimler's interest in a
full-scale acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor racing through Paris on Tuesday was that members of
the founding Peugeot family, who own 25.1 percent of the stock and
control 37.4 percent of the voting rights, had become more
receptive to a deal.

FEDERAL SAFETY AGENCY OPENS NATIONWIDE PROBE OF ASBESTOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH and ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After more than a decade of inaction, the Consumer
Product Safety Commission will open a nationwide investigation of
asbestos in consumer products, including attic insulation, the
agency announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency declined to say what other types of products it would
test.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's new initiative marks the first time since 1987
that it has checked products to see if they contain the
cancer-causing fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was announced two days after the Post-Intelligencer
revealed that products containing asbestos are still being sold,
and few regulations exist to protect consumers against unknowingly
being exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The P-I reported Monday that Environmental Protection Agency
investigators have begun testing products for asbestos, and that
their preliminary tests have found asbestos in some products.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's testing continued Wednesday as an agency investigator
crawled through rafters to take samples of old vermiculite
insulation in the house of a man with asbestos-related disease.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after dawn in Manchester, across Puget Sound from
Seattle, Robert Parks held a ladder as EPA investigator Keven
McDermott climbed through a 2-foot-square opening into his attic.
</P>
<P>
   Decked out from head to toe in protective coveralls, surgical
gloves on her hands, her face fully covered with a respirator,
McDermott slithered from rafter to rafter, picking her perches with
care to avoid falling through Parks' ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The beam of her flashlight swept over a scattering of empty red
and black paper bags, labeled ``Zonolite Attic Insulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The bags also carried the label ``100 percent vermiculite,''
below two smiling cartoon characters captioned ``Just pour ... and
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks, 73, squinted up to the green ceiling, trying to figure
how far the EPA investigator had progressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1970, I dumped 130 bags of that Zonolite up there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``About eight years ago, the doctor says I have asbestosis in
the one lung I have left.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks, who retired after 37 years as a mechanic for The Boeing
Co., said, ``I never could figure out where I was ever exposed to
asbestos. It must have come from up there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's quite a bit of it up here,'' McDermott said, her voice
muffled by the filters which were supposed to protect her. She
filled clean plastic bags with the fluffy, expanded vermiculite
from several places around the darkened attic.
</P>
<P>
   She placed the samples and her gear in a large yellow ``asbestos
hazard'' bag and climbed back down the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Parks eyed the bag warily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read about the Zonolite in the paper and thought maybe
that's what happened here,'' he said, tapping his chest.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott shrugged out of the safety clothing, saying that the
EPA demands it when their staff deals with any potential
carcinogen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean that Zonolite is that dangerous,'' she
explained. ``It just means that we have to be careful until we know
exactly what's in the material and the testing we'll do over the
next few weeks will tell us that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zonolite in Parks' attic came from a company called
Vermiculite Northwest, which ran vermiculite expansion plants years
ago in Spokane and Portland. That company, along with producers of
millions of other bags of Zonolite insulation, used vermiculite
mined from 1963 to 1990 by W.R. Grace and Co. in Libby, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   EPA investigators have been in Libby since November, after the
Post-Intelligencer reported that hundreds of vermiculite miners and
their family members have died or are dying from asbestos-caused
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Peronard, EPA's coordinator of the Libby investigation, is
concerned about the potential health effects from asbestos
contamination in the vermiculite insulatin and other products which
used vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Zonolite is all over the country, in millions of homes,
from what we're being told,'' Peronard said. ``If it's dangerous,
we need to know it. If it's not, that information is valuable also.
There's a lot of information needed on what's in this vermiculite,
and we need to start collecting it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that information is being gathered about a mile from
Parks' home, at an EPA regional laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   There, Jed Januch, a member of McDermott's investigative
response team, has his hand buried deep in a sealed,
plastic-fronted chamber. He carefully spades potting soil from a
bag into small flower pots, and dumps the vermiculite-speckled soil
from one pot to another, emulating how a gardener might work with
the material.
</P>
<P>
   At the back of the chamber, two pumps suck the air into filter
cartridges. Sophisticated analysis of the filter will tell the
investigators whether harmful levels of asbestos are contaminating
the vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   The elaborate process will continue for days as different brands
are examined. The results will be evaluated by Dr. Mike Watson,
EPA's regional toxicologist in Seattle, and his counterparts in
other EPA offices.
</P>
<P>
   Watson acknowledges the difficulty of linking the asbestos
levels to a risk assessment. He warns that it's a complex process
that will take time.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of research on workers with long-term exposures to
asbestos, such as shipyard employees and miners, have shown that
asbestos can cause fatal diseases, including asbestosis, lung
cancer and a rare form of cancer called mesothelioma.
</P>
<P>
   The potential exposure and health risks to consumers have been
less well documented. However as early as 1972, investigators at
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
reported that a one-time acute dose of asbestos may be as harmful
as the cumulative effect of lower doses over many years.
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 EPA report stated that a person installing insulation in
a home receives an eight-hour exposure, on average.
</P>
<P>
   The CPSC would not release more specific details of its new
investigation Wednesday, except to say it would include other
product categories in addition to attic insulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any (specific) information right now that people
are being exposed to asbestos fibers from household products,''
said CPSC spokesman Ken Giles. ``But we're going to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the commission finds consumer products that pose a health
hazard, it has the regulatory power to take action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we find exposures that present a health risk, we do have
the power to require cancer hazard warning labels,'' Giles said.
The agency can also ban products, or issue recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Giles would not comment on what the agency would do if it finds
products that contain dangerous levels of asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to speculate,'' he said. ``It's premature to say
what other regulatory actions we might take.''

TIGERS WIN BIG ONE ON ASSIST FROM SELIG
</HEADLINE>

 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The season hasn't even started, and the Detroit Tigers have
already registered a victory. They scored one over Commissioner Bud
Selig, and the surprising aspect of it was he let them have it. Not
a good start to the season for the commissioner. Baseball's
impartial arbitrator may be the next to hand him a loss, that one
on the John Rocker grievance.
</P>
<P>
   If the arbitrator, Shyam Das, should overturn or even reduce
Selig's 73-day suspension of Rocker for his ugly comments about all
sorts of groups, the commissioner would have the excuse that he was
unable to do anything about it. But in the Tigers' case, Selig has
been a willing accomplice. He has allowed the Tigers to blatantly
flout his directive on interviewing minority candidates for certain
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Selig failed to discipline the Tigers, but he has
also praised them for taking what some skeptics might see as a
cosmetic step designed to get them off the hook with the man whose
powers were recently enhanced so that he could fine a team $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard they were going to be fined,'' said one club
executive, who was clearly disappointed to learn that the Tigers
hadn't been fined. ``Some people assumed that one of the reasons
this new power was given was that he'd be able to fine clubs more
if they didn't address the inequality in hiring.''
</P>
<P>
   About six months before the Tigers hired Phil Garner as their
manager, the commissioner clearly set out his position on
interviewing minority candidates. That's right, interviewing, not
hiring. Baseball is a game that is played slowly and makes
advancement at glacial speed. Last April Selig sent a directive to
all clubs outlining the steps they were to take if they had
vacancies in any of five positions of decision-making authority,
including manager and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a club has an opening in any of these positions, the club
owner must notify me personally,'' he said in a letter to owners.
``In addition, your list of candidates must be provided to me. I
expect the list to include minority candidates whom you and your
staff have identified. I will provide assistance to you if you
cannot identify candidates on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig also told the owners he would discipline clubs that did
not ``aggressively pursue equal opportunities and initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Tigers decided last October to make a managerial
change, they did not (1) notify Selig of the vacancy, (2) provide
him with a list of their candidates, (3) identify any minority
candidates or (4) seek assistance in identifying candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Then, heaping insult upon insult, the club president, John
McHale Jr., when asked about the Tigers' failure to follow the
directive, said, ``There isn't a legal obligation to adhere to any
directives from the commissioner's office.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers got away with it because they established a community
advisory board dedicated, in the words of a news release from the
commissioner's office, ``to Equal Employment Opportunities, their
Diverse Business Partners Program and their community relations
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig, in the release, called the Tigers' plan ``a very
progressive and sensitive series of programs.''
</P>
<P>
   He praised the club for recognizing the problem and addressing
it, adding, ``That, I believe, is more important than taking
disciplinary action.''
</P>
<P>
   On the telephone Wednesday, Selig said he expects the Tigers'
program to be beneficial to baseball and to the Detroit community.
``This is not just a glitzy thing,'' he said. ``They have many
announcements to come. They're going to be meaningful. The
economics of it will be good in terms of what they're spending and
what they're going to be doing. As much as I would have fined them,
they're going to spend a lot more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig talked about minority suppliers and minority banks, but
his directive talked about positions whose holders control budgets
and have the authority to make decisions in baseball operations.
The Tigers, like most teams, still have a white manager, a white
general manager, a white assistant general manager and a white
scouting director, positions specified in the directive. If members
of minority groups aren't interviewed, they can't be hired. That
was the message behind Selig's letter.
</P>
<P>
   The club executive who lamented Selig's failure to fine the
Tigers raised the postulation that the Tigers' behavior was worse
for baseball than Rocker's remarks. Rocker's comments, he reasoned,
were the act of an individual; the failure to interview and hire
members of minorities is institutional.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a hint here of a double standard at work, consider
some other issues that baseball officials have ignored. While
Rocker has been suspended for 73 days and fined $20,000, his
employer in Atlanta, Ted Turner, has made a career out of making
outrageous statements about ethnic groups and remains
undisciplined. Marge Schott should have been so widely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves also continue to encourage their fans to perform the
tomahawk chop that American Indians find offensive. The Cleveland
Indians offend the same group with their name and their Chief Wahoo
emblem. For many years they defended their use of both by
explaining that they were honoring a former player who was an
Indian. Recently, the Indians admitted that well, maybe that wasn't
quite the real story.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball doesn't necessarily have to conform suddenly to the
strictest practice of political correctness, but its officials and
teams might want to try their hand at consistency.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four years ago, Frank G. Zarb, chief executive of the
Nasdaq stock market's parent company, decided to take the role of
visionary leader to a new level: he would commission a Times Square
sign so big and bright that it would make all the others blur into
the background.
</P>
<P>
   The result is the eight-story cylindrical sign that wraps around
the recently completed Conde Nast Building, at Broadway and 43rd
Street. And while Douglas Leigh's Camel cigarette billboard from
the 1940s, with its wafting smoke rings, may be the neighborhood's
most legendary advertising property, few if any new signs in Times
Square _ and there are plenty of them _ have elicited such wonder
and amazement, from tourists and denizens alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times Square has become a corporate theme park,'' said George
Stonebly, whose office on the fourth floor of the Paramount
Building is across the street from the Nasdaq sign.
</P>
<P>
   Stonebly, the president of Spectracolor Communications, is one
of Times Square's most prominent sign designers. He said the Nasdaq
screen fulfilled Zarb's dream: it is now acknowledged as the
largest, most colorful, most technologically advanced and most
expensive display in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The 120-foot-tall screen displays more than 16.7 million
distinct colors. It cost _ along with the Nasdaq marketing center
beneath it _ more than $37 million, a little bit less than what
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas had spent on his presidential campaign
through the beginning of January.
</P>
<P>
   A quick tour: The screen wraps 90 feet around the Conde Nast
Building and takes up about the same space as three basketball
courts. It is 18 inches thick and its surface is more than 10,000
square feet. It is made up of more than 8,200 panels, or modules,
which can be divided into eight simultaneously operated screens.
</P>
<P>
   From a control room in the Conde Nast Building, operators and
mangers run the screen, which displays advertisements and stock
information from companies listed on the Nasdaq market _ anything
from simple text to full-motion movies.
</P>
<P>
   The screen is set 5 feet off the building facade. That provides
enough space for a 3-foot-wide catwalk for maintenance workers.
There are 30 cutouts in the screen that allow natural light to
enter the building through windows. The cutouts were not part of
the original design, company officials say, but their positioning
allows the mind to fill in the spaces unconsciously.
</P>
<P>
   The display is powered by more than 800 shoebox-size power units
attached to the back of the screen, officials said. Unlike a
television or a laptop computer screen, the display can be viewed
clearly in true color from a 170-degree angle.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the sign's skin are 18 million light-emitting diodes, or
LEDs, attached to minicircuits called pixels. Within each pixel are
eight small light-emitting diodes. LEDs are commonly used as the
red volume indicators on stereos and other electronic devices, as
well as the screen power indicators on some cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Times Square screen, the LEDs are lined up _ two blue
in the middle with two green and a red on one side and two red and
a green on the other _ so that the flickering lights are translated
by the brain as true colors and images. This prevents the image
from breaking up as a viewer walks around the screen, the designers
say.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the color is a benefit of the technology, as
well. The density of the pixels allows for bright and vivid colors
that can be viewed easily in direct sunlight, said Paul Amenta, the
executive vice president of Saco Smartvision, the Montreal-based
company that designed the sign. The density, he said, also makes
the image clear, even from blocks away. In some spaces, the pixels
are only 20 millimeters, or three-quarters of an inch, apart.
</P>
<P>
   Signals sent from more traditional sources _ videocasettes or
animated computer drawings, for example _ flow through computers in
the control room to distributors that translate the video signals
into sequence codes for the pixels, which produce the colors that
make up the images.

<P>
   Officials added that the LEDs were also less prone to damage
from temperature change or blowouts than light bulbs, and were
supposed to last 100 times longer _ a total of 100,000 hours. Some
companies are working on white LED prototypes that could eventually
be used to replace light bulbs, said Gary Nalven, Smartvision's
managing director.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq and its parent, the National Association of Securities
Dealers, is paying the Conde Nast building's landlord, Douglas
Durst, $2 million a year to lease the space for its sign _ the
largest LED display in the world and the largest single sign of any
kind in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Smartvision created the giant screens used on stage by the Irish
rock band U2 and at Ravens Stadium in Baltimore. Making the screen
seem real on such a curved surface is the most complicated and
costly feature, Nalven said.
</P>
<P>
   The company envisions similar signs replacing billboards,
allowing several advertisers to use the space at different times,
tailoring their messages depending on the time of day. ``Given the
size, resolution and versatility, the screen has the potential of
revolutionizing outdoor advertising,'' Nalven said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company is planning a similar display for the side
of a Covenant House building at 10th Avenue and 43rd Street. That
sign will carry advertisements from several companies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the technology in the Times Square sign, there have been
problems, officials acknowledge. The front of the screen is sealed
in a translucent coating to prevent damage, but water has seeped in
from the windows in the screen, causing some damage and technical
problems, including arrant flashes.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq had the windows installed by a separate company and is
looking at ways to correct the problems, Smartvision officials
said. ``On a project of this scope, you expect some problems,''
Amenta said. ``There is always going to be something.''

<P>
   ISRAEL: GERMAN APOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   President Johannes Rau of Germany addressed Israel's parliament,
asking forgiveness _ in German _ for ``what the Germans did''
during the Holocaust. It was the first time the German language had
been heard from the podium, causing some members to boycott the
session. Avraham Burg, the speaker, said, ``I deliberated greatly
but finally I decided that today the parliament will hear this
language because the language is not the main point, but rather the
speaker and his words.''
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL: HOLOCAUST AID
</P>
<P>
   Belatedly, legislators say, Israel is joining the effort to help
heirs of Holocaust victims trace Israeli properties and bank
accounts. Colette Avital, head of a commission on assets of
Holocaust victims in British-ruled Palestine, said Israelis
``haven't managed to do here what we managed to do in other
countries, like Switzerland.'' The panel will investigate assets in
Israel owned by European Jews who did not emigrate and were killed
by the Nazis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL: PULLOUT COSTS
</P>
<P>
   It will cost about $250 million to pull out of Lebanon this year
and build new defenses, Finance Minister Avraham Shochat said,
quoting army estimates. The government could finance a pullout
without exceeding its budget or receiving extra outside aid, he
said. But he cited figures of $17 billion as the amount of military
aid Israel would need to cover costs of a Golan Heights withdrawal
in the event of peace with Syria.

   BRITAIN: 14TH CHARGED IN HIJACK
</P>
<P>
   A 14th man has been charged with hijacking the Afghan airliner
that spent last week at Stansted airport with more than 150 people
aboard. At the same time, another passenger from the plane formally
applied for political asylum, bringing the number to 75.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: FOSTER CHILD ABUSE
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a damning report exposing the systematic abuse of
650 foster children in group homes in Wales in the 1970s and '80s,
the government began a nationwide search for 28 former child-care
workers said to be involved in the abuse. All 28 still pose a risk
to children, officials said.

   ARGENTINA: AUSTRIA ENVOY REMOVED
</P>
<P>
   The government removed its ambassador to Austria, Juan Carlos
Kreckler, after a newspaper published a cable he wrote last year
characterizing Joerg Haider of the Freedom Party as a misunderstood
democrat ``who is not a neo-Nazi nor an extremist.'' Kreckler was
recalled after Haider's party helped form a governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: ECOLOGICAL ACCIDENT
</P>
<P>
   A cruise ship ran aground off Quintana Roo, near Cozumel Island,
causing an oil spill and forcing 1,400 passengers and crew members
to return to Miami by air. Authorities were holding the ship,
registered in Liberia, pending a report on ecological damage. The
navy said the spill posed no risks to Caribbean coral reefs.

</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA: ANTI-CORRUPTION BILL
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a sweeping anti-corruption bill that President
Olusegun Obasanjo introduced seven months ago. The Senate version,
which provides for an independent counsel to investigate government
corruption and weakens the government's powers over an
anti-corruption commission, was passed by the House of
Representatives in December. It must now be signed by Obasanjo.

</P>
<P>
   A prosecution witness testified in the trial of Nawaz Sharif,
the deposed prime minister, that the nation's chief aviation
official told him that Sharif had forbidden a plane carrying the
army chief he had just fired to land in Pakistan. Prosecutors say
the flight had too little fuel to make it to another country. The
court ruled to admit the logbook showing how much fuel was left.

QUESTIONS OVER HIS VERACITY HAVE LONG DOGGED GORE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE with JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, Ga. _ Questions about Vice President Gore's honesty have
emerged as a recurring motif of his contest with former Sen. Bill
Bradley for the Democratic presidential nomination. Bradley has
angrily accused the vice president of a systematic effort to
distort Bradley's record while whitewashing his own.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism of Gore has been harsh enough that President
Clinton was asked about it Wednesday and offered a spirited defense
of his vice president. ``My experience is that he is exceedingly
honest and exceedingly straightforward,'' Clinton said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gore insisted that he has hewed to the facts
both in describing his own positions and in characterizing those of
Bradley. He said that Bradley equates policy disputes with
dishonesty and that his Democratic opponent cannot defend his own
policies without resorting to personal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pattern is one of Senator Bradley interpreting
disagreement with his positions as dishonesty,'' Gore said aboard
Air Force Two on Tuesday night. ``Just because one has the temerity
to point out that Senator Bradley's health care plan would be an
unmitigated catastrophe for poor people and others who depend upon
Medicaid funding is not evidence that one is being untruthful.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in public appearances, press releases and interviews,
insists that Gore has repeatedly and deliberately distorted his
positions on health care, taxation, school funding and campaign
finance in what he calls a ``pattern of misrepresentation.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Bradley and his aides say, Gore has offered accounts of his
own record and personal history that are at times at odds with the
facts.
</P>
<P>
   Some are familiar and fairly trivial examples, such as Gore
taking credit for inventing the Internet or being the model for
Erich Segal's ``Love Story.'' But others, including his account of
his service in Vietnam, his journalistic accomplishments, his views
on the death penalty and abortion and his role in the Democratic
fund-raising scandals of 1996, are substantial parts of his public
record and rationale for seeking higher office.
</P>
<P>
   Are these exchanges part of the normal give-and-take of a
political contest, the exaggerations and embellishments that are
the ordinary vernacular of political speech?
</P>
<P>
   Or are they signs of a deeper problem that will continue to
haunt Gore throughout the primary season, into the general
election, and possibly into the Oval Office?
</P>
<P>
   The concern about Gore's truthfulness dates back to the earliest
days of his political career.
</P>
<P>
   During his failed 1988 bid for the Democratic presidential
nomination, he exaggerated the danger he faced as an Army
journalist in Vietnam and took credit for putting ``a bunch of
people'' in jail during his stint as an investigative reporter at
the Nashville Tennessean. The first was misleading; the second was
false.
</P>
<P>
   During his congressional campaigns in the 1970s and 1980s, he
overstated his one foray into real estate development to persuade
groups of business executives that he was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   That claim led Arlie Schardt, who was Gore's communications
director during the 1999 presidential campaign, to warn the
candidate in a memo ``your main pitfall is exaggeration.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Schardt said that his widely quoted warning
referred only to this specific claim regarding the real estate
development and was not meant as a generalized description of
Gore's lack of truthfulness. ``I think this whole flurry about
Gore's exaggerations is exaggerated,'' Schardt said.
</P>
<P>
   But other statements by Gore _ including those made during
recent debates with Bradley _ raise more serious questions about
his veracity and have had a direct impact on the current campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate sponsored by Iowa Public Television in January, Gore
asked Chris Peterson, whose farm had been inundated in the floods
of 1993, to stand and be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Bradley, Gore said, ``Why did you vote against the
disaster relief for Chris Peterson when he and thousands of other
farmers here in Iowa needed it after those '93 floods?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, clearly thrown off balance, turned aside Gore's
question and changed the subject. Gore repeated the charge in a
television commercial that began airing within days of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's accusation was false and unfair. Bradley supported
the 1993 legislation that provided $4.8 billion in emergency flood
relief for farmers like Peterson. What Bradley and 31 other
senators opposed was an amendment that would have provided an
additional $900 million in disaster compensation. The Clinton
administration also opposed the amendment until literally minutes
before floor debate ended.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's weak response to Gore's misleading charge has haunted
him to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our polls show the Bradley collapse began the day after the
Jan. 9 debate,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg
School for Communication. ``You could argue that Gore built his
Iowa victory on a significant deception.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also misrepresented Bradley's health care plan,
charging in various appearances that it would provide a voucher
worth only $150 a month for a family to purchase medical insurance
on the private market.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Bradley plan would grant each individual $150 a
month and provides other mechanisms for poor families to receive
health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a serious misstatement,'' Jamieson said. ``At least
he's stopped doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore continues to claim that Bradley's health proposal would
adversely affect blacks, Latinos and people living with HIV or
AIDS. This accusation infuriates Bradley because it appears
specifically designed to cut into his support among minorities and
gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore repeated the charge in the interview Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tendency on the part of Senator Bradley to
interpret any disagreement with his position as an untruthful
statement,'' the vice president said. ``For example, he became
visibly apoplectic yesterday in arguing that it was a bald-faced
lie to say that people with HIV/AIDS had experienced difficulty in
obtaining private health insurance that would cover their medical
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, excuse me, but that's not an untruthful statement,''
Gore added. ``It is evidence rather that Senator Bradley has made a
catastrophically poor political and substantive policy judgment in
designing a health-care proposal that is disintegrating in front of
his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Gore acknowledged one incident recently in
which he uttered a false statement, although he preferred to call
it a ``mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Gore said that he supported the sweeping campaign
finance proposal written by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell
Feingold, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike Senator Bradley,'' Gore boasted, ``I was a co-sponsor
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Feingold took office in January 1993, the same month
Gore left the Senate to become vice president. The two never served
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a mistake,'' Gore said Tuesday. ``That wasn't _ what
I meant to say was that I supported that.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Gore's veracity are compounded by his service to
a president whose own honesty has been assailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem for Gore,'' said John G. Geer, professor of
American politics at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, ``is that
he's Clinton's vice president and Clinton is perceived as the
master of this kind of campaign. His overstatements are magnified
because he's been carrying Clinton's baggage for seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came to his vice president's defense in a news
conference Wednesday. Responding to a question about Gore's
credibility, Clinton said the vice president had always been
``brutally honest'' with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a tough race where people fought with each
other where they didn't have different interpretations of each
other's record and each other's positions,'' Clinton said.  &QL;

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN with RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former executive of the Bank of New York and her
husband told a federal judge Wednesday that they had helped a group
of small but politically connected Russian banks create an
elaborate money laundering scheme to move billions of dollars
illegally out of Russia through the U.S. bank.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 18 months of investigation, federal authorities
delivered Lucy Edwards, a former Bank of New York vice president,
and her husband, Peter Berlin, to U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
They described how between 1996 and last year, more than $7 billion
left Russia illegally and flowed into a network of front company
accounts at the Bank of New York that were controlled by Berlin.
From there, the funds were transferred to offshore accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The network, Edwards and her husband said, was designed by
Russian bankers to whisk funds electronically between Russia and
the United States for three broad purposes: to evade Russian taxes
on money from legitimate business transactions, to avoid Russian
customs duties on imports and to ``wash'' the profits of outright
criminal enterprises through legitimate banks, including a $300,000
ransom payment in 1998 to the kidnappers of a businessman in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who said they were paid nearly $2 million for their
services, said the scheme allowed Russian bankers to conduct
illegal banking activities in the United States that circumvented
the scrutiny of federal banking regulators and law enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I closed my eyes to that fact,'' said Edwards, who worked in
the Eastern European division of the Bank of New York. She said she
``suspected the accounts were being used by many people for illicit
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple agreed to plead guilty to a series of federal crimes,
which carry up to 10 years in prison and heavy fines, and to
cooperate with investigators in a plea bargain that U.S.
authorities hope will produce more charges. ``More than one or two
people had to turn the other way,'' an investigator said. ``You
don't transfer $7 billion through the spanking new Eastern European
division without somebody knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York, which has not been accused of any
wrongdoing, declined to comment Wednesday. It fired Edwards shortly
after the federal money laundering investigation became public last
August, and has been cooperating with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's remarkable courtroom appearance, the bank's
culpability, and that of its directors and officers, is still not
clear. Federal prosecutors have great discretion in deciding
whether to pursue criminal charges against the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents and the couples' oral confession named several
Moscow banks as part of the illegal scheme. According to previously
unpublicized documents and to Western financiers with direct
knowledge of the banks' affairs, one of the banks, Sobinbank, is
controlled by members of a powerful group of Russian financiers
known as the oligarchs, who own much of Russia's wealth and have
wielded enormous influence within the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The court confessions Wednesday provided the first detailed
public accounts by participants in the money laundering scheme,
which had been under investigation since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, Berlin, and three companies controlled by Berlin _
Benex, Bec International, and Lowland _ pleaded guilty to several
charges: laundering money to promote criminal activity and defraud
the Russian government; conducting unlicensed banking operations;
establishing an unauthorized branch of a foreign bank; operating an
illegal money transmitting business; bribing a bank employee;
receiving illegal payments as a bank employee and laundering those
payments abroad; tax evasion; and fraudulently obtaining visas for
Russians to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the couple also
would plead guilty to bribing one of Edwards' superiors at the
bank. No such plea was entered Wednesday.

 NEW YORK: entered Wednesday.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Appearing calm and rested, and smiling occasionally at one
another and their lawyers, Edwards and Berlin described the origins
and purpose of the money laundering operation during a court
appearance that lasted slightly more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a small, well-groomed woman who spoke with a soft
Russian accent, said she was first approached in late 1995 by
representatives of DKB, a Russian bank whose full name is
Depozitarno-Kliringovy Bank, who were interested in using the Bank
of New York's offices and technology to illegally move funds out of
Russia. During the following years, the 41 year-old Edwards said,
those activities came to include money laundering and the other
schemes to which she pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Russian banking during the 1990s has been a notoriously
freewheeling affair, with allegations of extensive involvement in
the banks by organized criminals. Edwards noted in her testimony
that DKB's Moscow employees told her in 1998 that they were afraid
to leave the bank's headquarters because ``customers with machine
guns were waiting for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The ransom money referred to in court Wednesday relates to a
1998 request by the Russian government for the FBI's help in a
kidnapping case. The ransom, it turned out, moved through a Benex
account at the Bank of New York on its way to Russian organized
crime figures, prompting the bureau to open its own inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bank of New York earned relatively small profits
from its business in Russia, its aggressive pursuit of clients
there held out the promise of potentially lucrative future deals.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin, 45, testified that Benex, Becs and Lowland all had
accounts at the Bank of New York that he had opened on behalf of
his overseers in Moscow. He said that the companies were staffed by
DKB employees and that Edwards helped install Bank of New York
computer software in the Forest Hills, Queens, office of a Benex
affiliate to allow funds to be moved electronically.
</P>
<P>
   The couple said that DKB representatives told them in fall 1998
that they had acquired control of another bank, Commercial Flamingo
Bank, and wanted a new company created to move funds from that bank
through the Bank of New York. Berlin opened Lowland in Jersey City,
N.J., for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   According to a series of confidential financial audits, a Moscow
bank controlled by Alexander Smolensky, SBS-Agro, owned sizable
stakes in both Sobinbank and Flamingo Bank.
</P>
<P>
   One of the audits, conducted in 1997 by the accounting firm
Arthur Andersen &AMP; Co., with the cooperation of SBS-Agro's
management, found that the purpose of SBS-Agro's investment in
Flamingo Bank was ``the possible purchase of its business in the
future.'' It could not be determined whether SBS-Agro ever acted on
that goal. A 1998 audit of SBS-Agro by Arthur Andersen notes that
the bank's 20 percent stake in Sobinbank amounted to ``control or
significant influence'' over Sobinbank's activities.
</P>
<P>
   SBS-Agro, which largely collapsed during the Russian economic
crisis in 1998, was part of a financial and oil empire controlled
by Smolensky; Boris Berezovsky, a prominent Russian financier with
long ties to former President Boris Yeltsin; and Roman Abramovich.
The three financiers did not respond to repeated interview requests
over the last few weeks. Neither SBS-Agro nor any of the three
financiers were mentioned by Edwards or her husband, or in the
court documents filed by federal investigators Wednesday. There is
no evidence of any involvement by them in the Bank of New York
activities.
</P>
<P>
   For their cooperation with their handlers in Moscow, Edwards and
Berlin received $1.8 million, which represented a percentage of the
funds moved through the Benex network. ``We were paid substantial
commissions for doing very little work,'' Edwards noted.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and Berlin said they directed that those funds be
deposited in off-shore bank accounts so they could avoid paying
taxes on the money in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said she had assisted ``hundreds'' of Russians to secure
bogus visas for travel to the United States and that most of them
worked in the Russian banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that after the couple moved to London in 1996,
they paid a Bank of New York employee, Svetlana Kudryavtsev, $500 a
month to make sure the Benex accounts were operating properly.
Kudryavtsev, a lower-level employee at the bank, is the individual
cited in the court charges for taking bribes. Kudryavtsev was
indicted last month for allegedly lying to federal investigators
about whether she or her husband had received money or loans from
Edwards. Her lawyer could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but
on Monday he described the charges as unwarranted. The indictment
alleges that Kudryavtsev received about $30,000 from Edwards and
Berlin between 1995 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and Berlin face a maximum of 10 years in prison for the
charges against them when they appear at a sentencing hearing on
May 3, but it is likely that their cooperation with authorities
will lessen the severity of any punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucy Edwards and Peter Berlin have come voluntarily to New
York from their home in London to accept responsibility for their
part in the illegal transfer of funds through the Bank of New
York,'' T. Barry Kingham, the couple's attorney, said Wednesday in
Manhattan. ``They have cooperated fully with the investigation
being conducted by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office and they
will continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple has surrendered about $1 million to authorities, some
of which was maintained in Swiss bank accounts, and they will be
released from federal custody pending their posting of a $500,000
bail bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's pleas starkly demonstrate the serious dangers of
unlicensed and unregulated entities operating within the American
banking system as cover for money laundering and other criminal
activities,'' said Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan,
in a prepared statement Wednesday. ``Evading and disregarding
American laws in this manner significantly undermines the integrity
of United States and foreign banking systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Schiliro, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New
York office, said that the investigation ``has followed a long,
winding road throughout the United States and abroad'' and that his
agency is ``determined to continue following the complicated trail
of money and banking transactions until all those who have
committed crimes are identified and charged.''

<P>
   Campaigning in Georgia on Thursday, Al Gore took a vice
presidential detour to view tornado-ravaged Camilla. His campaign
paid for his trip to Georgia, but taxpayers paid to take him from
Macon to Albany and then for a helicopter to Camilla. Laura Quinn,
a vice presidential spokeswoman, said Gore did not want to go so
near the destruction ``and not have the administration give it its
full attention.''

   Secretary of State Bill Jones of California, the state's
highest-ranking Republican, switched his endorsement from Gov.
George W. Bush to Sen. John McCain on Wednesday, becoming the first
prominent Californian to defect from Bush. Jones, the sole
statewide survivor of a 1998 Republican electoral debacle, said
McCain was ``a candidate that not only crosses party lines but cuts

   In Washington state, polls show growing support for John McCain,

last weekend found that 26 percent supported Bush and 16 percent
McCain, up from 6 percent in November. Twenty percent supported
Gore and 12 percent former Sen. Bill Bradley. An Evans/McDonough
poll for the state Democratic Party showed Bush with a 53 percent
to 32 percent lead over McCain among Republicans. But among all
voters, 23 percent backed or leaned toward McCain and 21 percent
toward Bush. A Mason-Dixon Poll of likely voters found McCain ahead
of Gore but that Bush and Gore were neck and neck. &QL;

DALLAS TO REMEMBER LANDRY IN MEMORIAL SERVICE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to correct story. Use this version) 
 
By JIM HENDERSON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When he was fired in 1989 after 29 years as coach of
the Dallas Cowboys, Tom Landry anticipated that once the spotlight
was turned off, he would recede into the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will forget me quick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not very quick, it turned out. This week Dallas has been
preparing an elaborate eulogy for the man many considered
responsible for bringing more to the city than football
championships.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Landry died last Saturday without realizing
the unique place he occupied in the psyche of Dallas, which spent
decades trying to live down the assassination of President Kennedy
and the image of J.R. Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Since his death, former Cowboys, pundits and old friends have
credited Landry with doing more than any other person to give
Dallas back its self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Being a winning coach was only a part of that process.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a recognized class about him, a style,'' said Tex
Schramm, the team's general manger who hired Landry in 1960. ``He
had character and was honest to the extreme. He was a great man you
would want to look up to. It's like they used to say during the
war: If you're going to charge up the mountain, this is the guy you
want leading you.''
</P>
<P>
   He not only took a rag-tag expansion franchise and turned it
into ``America's Team,'' one of the most recognizable and
marketable organizations in professional sports, he did it without
allowing the job to dominate his life.
</P>
<P>
   Before he accepted the job he warned Schramm that he might not
be suited to the task because football was not his highest
priority. Faith and family ranked higher.
</P>
<P>
   To the crowds and television cameras on game day, he presented a
stern persona, as humorless as artificial turf and as stoic as a
goal post.
</P>
<P>
   Someone once asked fullback Walt Garrison if Landry ever smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Garrison said. ``But, I've only been here nine
years.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind the frozen expression, those who worked with him and
played for him saw another Landry. Carlton Stowers, who covered the
Cowboys for the Dallas Morning News for many years, recalled an
occasion when, to celebrate Landry's birthday, the players hired a
dancer to surprise him at his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was singing and tap dancing,'' Stowers said, ``and he got
up and sang and tap danced along with her.''
</P>
<P>
   When a group of sportswriters covering training camp grew
beards, Landry watched grimly, arms folded, as they approached him
after practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everytime I see you guys, I feel like I should call
security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was one of the most public figures in Dallas, he
guarded his privacy and practiced his faith without fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those closest to him did not know that for more than 20
years he had participated in a prison ministry run by former
Cleveland Brown Pro Bowler Bill Glass. Landry frequently visited
prisons with Glass and other sports figures to minister to inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Glass said he was not surprised this week to see the outpouring
of emotion that followed Landry's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way you could have overvalued him as a human
being,'' he said. ``He was the greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   There were immediate calls from sports columnists and
politicians to rename Texas Stadium for him. The Dallas Stars and
Mavericks began their games with a moment of silence in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   F-16s flew overhead and Pro Football Hall of Famers sat in
mourning Wednesday as Landry was buried in a private ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list of about 400 friends and family members included
former Cowboys Tony Dorsett, Roger Staubach, Harvey Martin, Dan
Reeves and former New York Giants teammate Frank Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   More memorials and tributes are planned for Thursday. At noon
CST, family and friends will hold a private memorial service at
Highland Park United Methodist Church, where Landry was a member
for 43 years.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 p.m., a public memorial will be held in the Morton Meyerson
Symphony Center and, while television cables were being installed
Wednesday for a live telecast, police were grappling with concerns
over security, traffic and crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame members such as Bob Lilly, Sam Huff, Schramm and
Staubach will speak, as will NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Children's Chorus and the Dallas Baptist University
Chorale will perform, and Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene will
provide a color guard. Tommy Loy, whose trumpet solo of the
national anthem opened many Cowboy games, also will play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to keep this a memorial service rather than an
event,'' said David Fisher, interim director of administration for
the symphony center. ``It's a somber event.''

2 BIRDS, 1 STONE: GIULIANI FAULTS CLINTON ON OIL RESERVES IN
UPSTATE VISIT
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-OIL, OIL-PRICES)

 By THOMAS J. LUECK

<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ In a campaign sweep of Plattsburgh and Syracuse
meant to quell criticism that he is spending too little time in
upstate New York, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Wednesday repeated his
criticism of the Clinton administration for refusing to free up
part of the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to counterbalance
the soaring cost of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani made his first stop at midafternoon in Plattsburgh,
close to the Canadian border, saying he had chosen the frigid city
because it had experienced ``the biggest impact in the state'' from
a sharp spike in oil prices caused by cuts in OPEC oil production
and the winter cold snaps in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In Syracuse, where Giuliani appeared at a news conference with
the city's Republican loyalists, he said the increases in oil
prices had provided ``an illustration of what I can do if elected
to the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can fight very hard for New Yorkers,'' he said. ``I am
willing to take on the president.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for the spigot on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to
be opened to counter OPEC's yearlong cut in oil production.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving upstate, Giuliani said that his criticisms had
prompted President Clinton to hold a news conference Wednesday to
announce a fresh federal allocation of $120 million in emergency
cash subsidies to help poor people pay for heating oil. New York is
to get $36.6 million of the subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   In questions from reporters here, Giuliani was asked repeatedly
why he had not appeared more frequently in Syracuse and other
upstate cities. It is a question much on the minds of some Syracuse
residents since the mayor's rival for U.S. Senate, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, has visited this city three times since July, most
recently attracting 500 people at fund-raising event and speech a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in the past, Giuliani responded by saying that his
duties as New York mayor prevented frequent campaign trips outside
the city. He told a television reporter here that he would ``come
up here more as the campaign progresses,'' but acknowledged to
another that he would ``not be able to travel around the state as
much'' as Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Syracuse residents who gathered shortly before 6 p.m.
at a tavern in this city's historic downtown Armory Square
district, Giuliani's appearance provoked a mixture of enthusiasm
and relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody here has not been affected in January by the price of
oil,'' said Nicholas J. Pirro, the Onondaga County executive and a
Republican, who said his constituents considered Giuliani to be ``a
guy who knows how to get things done, and does it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Adam Beasley, a Syracuse University student who awaited
Giuliani's arrival with several members of the university's
Republican student organization, said Clinton had ``pulled a lot of
votes'' here with her visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People upstate are more ideologically attuned to Rudy,'' he
said, ``but he better not take them for granted.''

   BUCHANAN, N.Y. _ Mitchell M. Vanderveer was running on a
treadmill at a health club here Wednesday morning when he heard
that the Indian Point 2 nuclear power plant had apparently released
a small amount of radiation Tuesday night. Suddenly, his heart rate
spiked.
</P>
<P>
   Where were the sirens? Why wasn't he notified? What, exactly,
was going on?
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am, huffing and puffing, and I'm wondering what I'm
breathing in,'' said Vanderveer, 46, a groundskeeper at an estate
in Croton-on-Hudson. ``They use that siren system, which is
certainly annoying, when they don't need it. And when they do need
it, they don't use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanderveer was hardly the only person living, working or passing
through this Hudson River town Wednesday who was rattled and a bit
confused about what happened at Indian Point. Adding to the sense
of confusion, Consolidated Edison said early Wednesday evening that
it was unclear whether any radiation had even escaped the plant.
</P>
<P>
   But for many people here, what seemed most important Wednesday
was not the scientific data, or engineering jargon, or calls for
calm from public officials that invariably accompany any anomalous
event at a nuclear power plant. Instead, they questioned whether
emergency officials had handled matters properly, or had
underplayed the situation. And they reminded themselves that a
26-year-old institution that people around here often take for
granted, in a wishful-thinking kind of way, can still malfunction
or at least produce unwanted events.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly did not help that news helicopters were over the
area in pitch darkness early Wednesday morning, rousing many people
from bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there was a convict who escaped; I didn't know what
was going on,'' said a shaken George Roppoccio, 44, a self-employed
handyman who has lived all his life in this corner of Westchester
County. ``I don't think anything like this ever occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time, in fact, that Con Edison had issued an
alert _ the second of four levels of nuclear emergency _ since the
Indian Point 2 plant opened in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour or so of being notified by Con Edison on Tuesday
night, Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive, opened an
emergency operations center in White Plains. Spano also directed
the county's Health Department to conduct independent radiation
tests within a 2.5-mile radius of the plant, said Adele Dowling, a
spokeswoman for the county's Indian Point emergency response team.
</P>
<P>
   Those tests showed nothing abnormal, Dowling said.
</P>
<P>
   By the small hours of Wednesday morning, when Con Edison was
reporting that the situation was stabilized, Spano and the county
executives of Rockland, Putnam and Orange counties decided that it
would not be necessary to sound the 153 sirens within a 10-mile
radius of Indian Point. To date, the sirens have only blared during
drills, Dowling said.
</P>
<P>
   Spano was so confident, in fact, that he decided to go ahead, as
planned, with a business trip to Los Angeles on Wednesday morning
to get advice _ ironically enough _ from officials operating a new
emergency services center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was assured that there was no public threat,'' said Susan
Tolchin, a spokeswoman for Spano.
</P>
<P>
   To disseminate information, emergency officials opened a media
center at Westchester County Airport on Tuesday night and
established what Con Edison called a ``rumor control'' phone
number. By early Wednesday evening, more than 450 people had
called.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some people said that the very term ``rumor control''
did not exactly inspire confidence in what officials were saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird,'' said Ann Makelainen of the use of ``rumor
control'' to calm fears. ``I'd rather be notified than have to
listen to the news. I'd rather be safe than sorry,'' said
Makelainen, a receptionist at the National Maritime Historical
Society in Peekskill, which is within view of the Indian Point
plant, less than a quarter-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   For years, many people here have been ambivalent about their
relationship with Con Edison and Indian Point. While grateful for
the taxes the plant pumps into the local economy, many people also
say that they do not feel that Con Edison has not done enough to
inform the public, especially considering the plant's spotty record
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   At Johnny Rit's, a sports bar near the entrance to the plant,
the owner, Johnny Ritornato, and the manager, Johnny Ritornato Jr.,
had different interpretations. The younger Ritornato said that he
could not trust Con Edison. But the elder Ritornato, who has owned
the bar for 35 years and counts many Indian Point workers among his
regulars, said he did not mind not being notified about what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   As he watched the crush of journalists in the area Wednesday
afternoon, he said: ``Most everyone who works at Indian Point, they
are all pretty intelligent guys. I think they know what they are
doing. They all have degrees, some have master's, some have
doctorates, some have worked on submarines; they're a solid
bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of Ritornato's customers, George Ondek, was more
skeptical, more nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' Ondek said, in between sips of a soda. ``I
was surprised they didn't notify us. Why were all the government
agencies notified and not the general public? After Three Mile
Island and Chernobyl, of course you worry about these things.''  &QL;

   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Not quite a decade ago, Gov. Carroll Campbell
Jr. of South Carolina bought an airplane ticket to Germany and
brought home a BMW. Not a car, but a factory. For Campbell, who had
a talent for luring foreign industry, the arrival of BMW meant
thousands of new jobs and international cachet for a state once
dismissed as a redneck backwater.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, Campbell, who stepped down in 1995 after two
terms, has felt the burden of his own success. For two decades, he
has delivered his state's primary for every Republican presidential
front-runner. Just as New Hampshire has made a habit of deflating
front-runners, South Carolina has propped them back up. The state
became known as the fire wall, the place where upstarts and
insurgents, notably Pat Buchanan, inevitably flamed out.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell is again trolling for support for yet another wounded
front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, for the Republican
primary on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the state he is encountering, a place he dominated and
helped revive, is no longer the same. His political machine is
still intact, but there is a new generation of voters, many of them
new to South Carolina, drawn by industries like BMW. They are
conservative, but they are not predictable, or necessarily
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably have a weakened fire wall,'' said Campbell, who is
now a lobbyist in Washington. ``We used to be a state where four or
five people ran everything. Now, it's open and it's challenging,
and I think that is good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate beneficiary of this evolving political culture is
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who is trying to stoke South
Carolina's populist streak and build an improbable coalition of
Republicans, independents and alienated Democrats. A decade ago,
political observers say, McCain could never have pulled this off,
and even now, his chances of victory on Saturday depend on an
unprecedented turnout of natives and newcomers outside the old
Republican mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome, the competitiveness of the race has
underscored how the changing national economy is changing politics
everywhere, even in once-isolated places like South Carolina. It
was evidence in New Hampshire, where a new pool of voters created
by that state's technology boom helped McCain trounce Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But there are new pools of voters here, whether transplants from
the Midwest and the Northeast working along the I-85 corridor, or
the thousands of retirees, many of them ex-military, who continue
to repopulate the coastline. There also are younger native
Republicans, raised in the state's suburbs, who are less inclined
to walk lock step with establishment leaders.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's candidacy has sparked an open rebellion by two
Republican congressmen, Lindsey Graham and Mark Sanford, who have
embraced his populist message and have escorted him around the
state, partly in hopes of burnishing their own chances at higher
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That granular political structure, built up around county
courthouses, is all gone now,'' said Blease Graham, a professor of
state history at the University of South Carolina. ``Things are so
much more fluid now. People are mobile, and the old loyalties are
dying.''
</P>
<P>
   What is changing South Carolina more than anything is
prosperity. The dispute over flying the Confederate battle flag
atop the state Capitol is a reminder that the state's past is far
from buried. But the present and future are in plain view: The
booming manufacturing zone along I-85 in the north and the retirees
flocking to the coastal low country, particularly near Hilton Head,
where the accents are often from Chicago and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Not more than 40 years ago, South Carolina suffered endemic
poverty, masked by the aristocratic sheen of Charleston. Now, the
state is a national leader in attracting manufacturing, including
$42 billion in capital investment during the 1990s, a boom that
created 207,000 jobs. South Carolina now has 500 foreign companies
that employ nearly 85,000 people. Of the state's 3.9 million
residents, nearly 144,000, mostly from the Midwest and the
Northeast, have moved in since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people think we're a bunch of corn pones with pickup trucks
and trailers, they're wrong,'' said Vic Sherlock, a recent
transplant from suburban Washington who is now an officer in the
Greenville County Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This state is going through dramatic, dramatic growth,''
Sherlock said. ``There is the old guard and the new guard. There is
a very hard-core conservative base. It seems like the new people
coming in are predominantly Republican but perhaps not as
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Along I-85, growth is everywhere. In Greenville, the downtown
streets are lined with restaurants like Bistro Europa or with bars
where conversations are often conducted in German. Local residents
have nicknamed the interstate ``the autobahn'' not only because of
the high rate of speed but because of the German companies that are
alongside.
</P>
<P>
   In Spartanburg, a city northeast of Greenville, the county
Republican Party is run by a New Jersey transplant, Rick Beltram.
Newspapers from New Delhi, India, are available in the new
Spartanburg public library. The old mill villages of white frame
houses that were built for textile workers are still standing, but
most of the mills have closed. A new downtown hotel is planned with
a nine-hole golf course, and Republicans hold fund-raisers at the
BMW museum beside the factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told somebody the other day that this place is beginning to
look like New Jersey,'' said Gary Towery, who left Spartanburg more
than 40 years ago and returned in 1996, perhaps overstating the
comparison a bit. ``I look around, and I am mesmerized by the
difference in the people. You don't hear the accents as
predominantly as you did before.''

</P>
<P>
   Few politicians in South Carolina have better gauged the
changing moods of the state than Campbell. He built the state's
Republican Party in the 1970s and 1980s, capitalizing on white
resentment of the civil rights era and the growing sense of
alienation from Washington. He and allies like Sen. Strom Thurmond
and Lee Atwater, a Republican strategist, bridged the state's two
rival regions, assembling a coalition of Charleston Republicans
with upstate religious conservatives, many of whom were moving into
the middle class and to the right economically. There were 29
Republicans out of 124 state legislators in 1987; by 1994, the
party had a majority and had elected a House speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a party builder, more of a partisan by nature than his
predecessors,'' said Warren Tompkins, Campbell's chief of staff,
who is now the chief strategist in South Carolina for the Bush
campaign. ``He was able to utilize the growing discontentment with
Washington, and the new economic climate, to add people to the
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   But prosperity has brought a growing independence among voters,
as the freshness and rigidity of the earlier conversion to
Republicanism had begun to fade. Voters began identifying
themselves as independents, splitting their tickets, and black
voters became better organized. The turning point came in 1998,
when Campbell's hand-picked successor, Republican Gov. David
Beasley, lost his re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans not only lost the governor's office to Jim Hodges,
but their majority in the Legislature was cut, and they failed to
dislodge Sen. Ernest Hollings, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some of the pains that you suffer from when you
achieve majority status,'' Tompkins said. ``You're not as tightly
knit as you were when there were only 29 Republicans. Back then, we
never had to worry about voters wandering off the reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Bush-McCain race is the prism through which change is
being measured. Whit Ayres, a prominent Republican pollster in
Atlanta who once worked in Campbell's administration, said the
influence of newcomers is significant but should not be overstated.
The number of people voting in the Republican primary has grown
from 149,000 in 1992 to 274,000 in 1996, and Ayres noted that many
of the new residents have joined the establishment embodied by
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're talking about the plant manager for BMW in
Spartanburg, that person is very much a part of the traditional
business establishment,'' Ayres said. ``But if we're talking about
the guy on the factory floor, I think he may be for McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Buchanan had hoped to shatter the Campbell
coalition by dividing the Bubbas from the Blue Bloods with his
blunt appeal for trade barriers. But he badly miscalculated. The
factory workers who collected paychecks from foreign corporations
such as BMW, Michelin and Hitachi concluded that tariffs were not
in their best interest.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is taking a different tack, preaching free trade like
Bush, but hammering away at the Washington establishment even as
Bush tries to wed him to it. The great unknown is whether the same
wave of independents who poured forth for McCain in New Hampshire _
largely under the radar of polls _ will appear in South Carolina.
He is counting on military retirees along the coast, just as Bush
has worked the Bible Belt in the upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Brafman, 72, a Republican and chairman of the Beaufort
County Council, said McCain's appeal is one of personality. He said
demographic changes in his area skews handicapping. He suspects,
for example, that many of the new residents are Democrats, maybe 25
percent. ``They are very quiet,'' Brafman said, but they do vote in
national elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever experienced anything like this where
nobody knows what will happen,'' said Brafman, who supports Bush.
``It's different upstate, where Bush has the edge. ... It's hard to
gauge how Republican are going to vote, because ideology has
nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanford, whose congressional district encompasses much of the
state's northern coast, said the notion of voters following orders
from above could get someone ``clubbed to death with a 7-iron'' at
the retirement communities on Hilton Head.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this whole notion after New Hampshire that the
Southerners in South Carolina would throw out what the Yankees had
done,'' he said. ``But in many neighborhoods in my district, there
are more Yankees than Southerners. That whole notion just isn't
true. The uncle of that voter up north is probably retired here on
Hilton Head Island.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of Campbell? He stood at the back of a Bush rally last
week, talking with reporters. He spoke a bit testily of Graham and
Sanford; he said Graham, who became famous for his role in last
year's impeachment proceedings, is trying out for a U.S. Senate
run, a notion Graham doesn't exactly deny. ``You're gonna have
cliques,'' Campbell said of the split.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has taken a leave from his lobbying job to help Bush.
He believes Bush will win. His numbers are rising in the polls, and
South Carolina residents love the Bush family. Asked whether
politicking was harder today, he laughed. ''Probably,'' he said.
``Because we had a lot of success then, and it doesn't come as easy
anymore.''

BUSH CAMP HAS SPENT $50 MILLION ON CAMPAIGN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILTON HEAD, S.C. _ George W. Bush's aides confirmed Wednesday
he has spent $50 million of the record $70 million he raised last
year in what has become a battle to win the GOP presidential
nomination that once seemed his for the asking.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it is expensive to run a 50-state campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a plan in place that will enable me to stay in this
race for the long run,'' Bush said. ``We have been in fighting in
every primary state. We are on plan, and I think I've got a good
chance of winning.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said a report to be filed with the
Federal Election Commission next week will show Bush had $20
million cash on hand Jan. 31 out of a total of more than $70
million raised.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's defeat to John McCain in the Feb. 1 New Hampshire
primary prompted Bush to step up spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to spend more money because we lost New
Hampshire, and we're up against a big publicity bonanza that we
anticipated would happen should we lose New Hampshire,'' Hughes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spending through Jan. 31, before the first primary vote
was cast, was a record of more than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole spent $42 million through July 1996 in securing the GOP
presidential nomination in the entire primary season. President
Clinton spent $38 million for the Democratic nomination that year.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's original budget had set a goal of spending about $40
million to secure the nomination and then another $38 million to
campaign against the Democratic nominee through July's Republican
National Convention when the GOP nominee will receive $60 million
in federal funds for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was plan A. Now we're on plan B,'' said one senior Bush
aide, and Hughes said Bush was now operating on a ``contingency
plan'' that was written last fall. Hughes said the campaign had
always anticipated needing to hold planned fund-raising events in
March and April.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Bush's spending through January included major
purchases of television advertising time in 14 states and the
District of Columbia. Those states include Michigan and California,
which hold their primaries Feb. 22 and March 7, respectively, after
this Saturday's pivotal Republican primary in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign also has spent heavily on direct mail and on
setting up campaign offices in numerous states, Hughes said.
Another aide said Bush held 452 political and fund-raising events
in 1999 around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Don Evans, Bush's national finance chairman, said Bush's
spending is not terribly out of line for what the campaign had
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we increased our spending as a result of New Hampshire?
Yes, we have,'' Evans said. ``We raised money in 1999 to be
competitive in the spring, and we're competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign had anticipated a potential financial war of
attrition with millionaire Steve Forbes, who dropped out of the
race after disappointing showings in Iowa, New Hampshire and
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bush's new spending plan risks that he will spend
everything to win the nomination in a fight with McCain and be left
with little money to finance his campaign through July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to spend more money trying to secure the
Republican nomination, but we think we will be amply funded to be
able to compete in the period between the nomination and the
convention,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing of Bush's money woes, McCain said: ``I hope that
there's a category in the Guinness Book of Records for how much
money he has spent. It's pretty remarkable. I believe that it's
ample testimony that we're winning the battle of ideas and not the
battle of bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole's 1996 campaign was severely hampered when he couldn't
afford to respond to Clinton's attacks between the time Dole
secured the nomination and he received federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crisis spending that they didn't anticipate having to
spend this percentage of their money this early,'' said University
of Texas political science professor Bruce Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said Bush's financial future could be determined by the
South Carolina outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't win Saturday, they're going to have big
fund-raising problems,'' Buchanan said. ``If he wins, he heals up
dramatically and quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he is not worried about how much money he might need
if he wins the nomination over McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see. I haven't projected beyond Saturday,'' Bush
said. ``My intense focus is on turning out the vote here in South
Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also raised questions about whether McCain has violated
federal spendng caps for campaigning in South Carolina. Bush is
not subject to spending limits because he decided not to accept
federal matching funds. McCain did agree to take matching funds and
to abide by spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   The two camps disagree on what that limit is. Bush says McCain
was limited to $1.5 million. McCain said he interprets the
convoluted law to mean the limit is $3 million, and he has spent
``a nickel under'' that amount, his political director said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In exchange for taxpayer money, candidates should conform to
the rules,'' Bush said. ``Senator McCain should explain if in fact
he has busted the spending cap in South Carolina how on the one
hand you can be a campaign funding reformer and on the other hand
not live within the spending caps.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, launched a new television commercial in South
Carolina, Michigan, North Dakota and Virginia accusing McCain of
continuing to use negative campaigning against Bush despite
promising not to. The commercial also says McCain, whose candidacy
is based on campaign-finance reform, voted ``to use your taxes to
pay for political campaigns. That's not real reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who also has a campaign-finance reform plan, has said his
plans to use tax money to run a presidential campaign is different
from the legislation McCain voted for that would have financed
congressional races.

BUCHANAN, N.Y.: operable plant.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consolidated Edison has understood for years that the steam
generators at unit 2, numbered 21 through 24, would not last as
long as the plant's operating license, which lasts through 2013.
But as the finances of nuclear power have grown shaky, with some
reactors around the country being shut down and others being sold
for a relative pittance, the economic feasibility of replacing the
generators has also grown uncertain. Con Edison bought new
generators 12 years ago and has them stored on site, but according
to its annual report, installing them could cost $100 million, plus
replacement power costs for a three-month shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' according to the report, ``securing necessary
permits and approvals or other factors could require a
substantially longer outage if steam generator replacement is
required on short notice.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be the case if technicians open up the steam
generator in a few weeks and see a lot of damage, or if they are
faced with the tedious job of testing the integrity of thousands of
tubes, to see if any others are getting ready to leak.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to the way the owner of an old car responds to ae a
fender-bender, the company may decide that the plant was totalled,
because its remaining value is too small to justify the expense of
repacing no. 24 and the other three generators, according to
experts.
</P>
<P>
   Steam generators were on buyers' minds even before the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a steam generator event, one of first things that I
consider is, am I going to be faced with some huge capital
expenditure soon after I acquire the plant,'' said Shelby T.
Brewer, the former head of a company that built nuclear plants,
Combustion Engineering, who is now shopping for reactors like
Indian Point 2, which have been put on the market because of
deregulation of the utility industry.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, who has raised money from a variety of private
investors, estimated that a reactor the size of Indian Point could
sell for $20 million or $30 million, but steam generator
replacement could cost five times that much.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when nuclear reactors are selling for a few pennies on
the dollar, relative to the capital invested in them, the buyers
count on making a profit by buying them dirt cheap, experts say.
Any sign sign that the plant will not run well, or will require
long periods of shut-down, is damning.

DOCTOR AND 2 PHARMACISTS CHARGED IN PRESCRIPTION DRUG CONSPIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Va., W.Va.)  (bl) 
 By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors charged a Manhattan doctor and
two pharmacists Wednesday with taking part in a conspiracy to
illegally distribute prescription narcotics. The prosecutors said
the three men were charged after a federal agency shut down a
network that they said transported drugs from New York City to
Virginia and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White released a statement Wednesday
accusing the men of being part of ``an alleged scheme to divert
huge quantities of the prescription drug Dilaudid into the illicit
narcotics market.''
</P>
<P>
   Dilaudid, a painkiller whose generic name is hydromorphone
hydrochloride, is derived from opium and is an extremely potent
narcotic. It is highly addictive and typically prescribed in small
amounts under strict control. Federal agents said that the street
price for illegal Dilaudid in Virginia was $25 to $60 per tablet.
In New York City, the wholesale price for the painkiller is $3 to
$5 per tablet, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extremely high profit margin is an attractive motive for
this type of association to continue,'' said Lewis Rice Jr., the
special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration
office in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said in their statement that Dr. Ronald A.
Jones, 47, wrote ``thousands of Dilaudid prescriptions without any
medical justification for at least that past two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, an internal medicine specialist with offices on Central
Park West and on 57th Street, was arrested Wednesday. Federal
agents also arrested two pharmacists, Gordon Brodwin, 65, and
Ismael Sosa, 53. Prosecutors said the prescriptions were filled at
the Brodwin-Sosa Pharmacy, at 1344 First Ave. at 72nd Street.
Lawyers for the three men could not be reached Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the Brodwin-Sosa Pharmacy bought more Dilaudid
from its distributor than any other pharmacy in New York state over
the last two years. In 1999, prosecutors said, the pharmacy bought
1,268,500 tablets of the drug, six times greater than the purchase
by the second-largest buyer. They said that 75 percent of that was
dispensed under prescriptions rom Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In January, drug enforcement agents and New York City police
officers arrested 36 people in New York City, Virginia and West
Virginia. Prosecutors said the arrests focused on a drug operation
based in the South Bronx. They have charged 18 people with
involvement in the operation, which prosecutors say sold narcotics
including Dilaudid.

SCALABRINE CAUGHT IN DILEMMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC forward Brian Scalabrine admitted he has been
caught in a dilemma lately, worried about whether he should focus
on grabbing rebounds or blocking out the other team's top
rebounder.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine grabbed just three rebounds last week against UCLA
but said he was concentrating on trying to keep Bruins forward
Jerome Moiso away from the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to make a decision,'' Scalabrine said. ``I can block
out and let (my teammates) go for a rebound, or I can go for the
ball. If I block out, I get chewed out for not getting rebounds,
but you have to make a decision. It's a Catch-22.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine said if he just tries to block out, it allows forward
David Bluthenthal to grab more rebounds. Bluthenthal is averaging
10.6 rebounds in Pacific-10 Conference games, the best mark in the
conference. As for Scalabrine, he is averaging 6.1 rebounds in
conference games.
</P>
<P>
   No redshirt: If he doesn't return from his broken ankle, it
appears forward Jarvis Turner will be unable to redshirt. According
to NCAA rules, Turner would be allowed to play in six games, and
the senior appeared in seven games before his injury.
</P>
<P>
   Road test: Scalabrine said he did as little as possible over the
Trojans' eight-day break but is still unsure if he has regained the
bounce in his legs. After the loss to UCLA, he complained that he
could not drive to the basket, because he had trouble getting out
of ``first gear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually can't find out until the game starts,'' Scalabrine
said. ``They feel the same as before. In games, I can't get into
second gear. I'll find out (today).''
</P>
<P>
   In search of a win: USC has tried to keep a ``one-
game-at-a-time'' philosophy, even in the midst of its three-game
losing streak, but the Trojans (13-9, 6-4) realize the odds for a
victory this weekend are much greater against Arizona State than
No. 4 Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're preparing for Arizona, and we don't want to look ahead,
but I'll say this, the only thing is, I'm trying to get a split,''
Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   USC probably needs to win one more road game and its final four
home games to earn an NCAA berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just four more wins is really shady to get into the
tournament,'' freshman guard Nate Hair said.
</P>
<P>
   Just keep shooting: Hair is coming off one of his worst games of
the season, a 1-for-9 shooting effort against UCLA, but said he
hasn't lost any confidence in his ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't shoot too well, but I don't anticipate doing that
again soon,'' Hair said. ``Coach Bibby tells everybody I'm going to
pull you out if you pass up an open shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hair said he is still recovering from the stress fracture he
suffered in his knee before the season, and it affects his ability
to drive to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have good days and bad days. Slowly, but surely, I'm coming
back,'' Hair said. ``I can't go to the hole and dunk like I used
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Added to list: Scalabrine is among 11 players that have been
added to the original list of 30 finalists for the Wooden Award and
Wooden All-American team.

KUKOC GOES TO 76ERS IN 3-TEAM TRADE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Philadelphia 76ers were stuck in the middle of the Eastern
Conference. Like Toronto, Milwaukee, Charlotte and Detroit, they
fit somewhere between a playoff-bound team and a championship
pretender. Wednesday, the 76ers upgraded their status and caused
concern throughout the conference.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-team swap, Chicago shipped Toni Kukoc to
Philadelphia, which traded Larry Hughes and Billy Owens to Golden
State and Bruce Bowen to Chicago. To complete the deal, the
Warriors sent John Starks and their No. 1 pick in the 2000 draft to
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to improve before the Feb. 24 trading deadline
could be mounting for teams like the Knicks, Miami and Indiana. ``I
think Philadelphia did well for themselves,'' Knicks Coach Jeff Van
Gundy said. ``They got a very good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc, the only player left from Chicago's dynasty, will team
with Allen Iverson to form one of the conference's most potent
offensive duos. For the Bulls, General Manager Jerry Krause freed
more salary-cap room to pursue free agents this summer. Kukoc, 31,
was in the final year of his contract and there was little chance
Chicago would re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors accomplished two goals: getting rid of Starks, who
will be a free agent, and acquiring Hughes, an exciting young
player who must stay at Golden State for at least three years under
the rules of the current collective bargaining agreement between
players and owners.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers got what they wanted _ a multi-skilled 6-foot-11-inch
and 235-pound veteran who can shoot over small forwards and go
around power forwards with his quickness.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc's ball-handling and passing skills can take some of the
offensive load off Iverson, while not threatening his playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, 21, often complained to 76ers Coach Larry Brown about
his minutes. His slashing, uptempo game is so similar to Iverson's,
Brown and the organization eventually deemed him expendable.
Securing a veteran in return was a major coup for the 76ers. They
had also explored a deal with Miami for Jamal Mashburn until the
trade fell through last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teams that win in this league _ the Indiana Pacers, the
New York Knicks, the Miami Heat, the Utah Jazz, the Los Angeles
Lakers and the Portland Trail Blazers _ those teams are not winning
with all young players,'' said Billy King, Philadelphia's general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Though back spasms sidelined him early in the season, Kukoc has
already had 10 games in which he has scored at least 20 points this
season and two games in which he has scored at least 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors were also happy with the deal. Along with Antawn
Jamison, taken fourth in the first round last year, Golden State
has two of the first eight players chosen in the 1999 draft.
Hughes, the No. 8 pick, played in all 50 games and was the
fourth-leading scorer for the 76ers this season. He gets his wish
of becoming an instant franchise player, although it will be on a
very bad team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are excited to get what we think is one of the top young
shooting guards in the NBA,'' Golden State Coach and General
Manager Garry St. Jean said.
</P>
<P>
   The draft pick sent to Chicago by the Warriors is a
lottery-protected selection from Washington. If the Wizards get the
first, second or third pick in the 2000 draft, the Bulls cannot
exercise it until the following season. The best the Bulls could do
this season is secure the No. 4 pick.
</P>
<P>
   Starks, whose contract expires at the end of the season, goes to
a city in which he was often booed during his career. Having heard
rumors that he may have been headed to Miami to again play for
Coach Pat Riley, Starks was shaken by the deal. Starks said he
would not comment on the trade until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for the guy,'' said a former Knick teammate,
Chris Childs. ``His family just moved and now he's got to do it all
over again.''

FINANCIAL SITES ARE SAID TO SEEK MERGER
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TheStreet.com, whose fledgling stock soared and then dipped
sharply in the last six months, is in preliminary merger talks with
Marketwatch.com, a leading rival in the hotly contested business of
delivering financial news online, a person close to the discussions
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com announced Wednesday that it has hired the
investment banking firm of Wasserstein Perella &AMP; Co. to help the
company find a buyer or a partner. Its executives would not expand
on the one-paragraph announcement, which said that it had hired the
investment firm ``to explore the wide variety of strategic
partnerships and other transactions in order to help grow the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the announcement made no mention of Marketwatch or any
other possible partner, speculation on Wall Street immediately
focused on companies like America Online, the News Corp. and The
New York Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com's attitude-laden news and analysis is already
available on several sites owned by America Online. News Corp. has
a 1.6 percent equity stake in TheStreet.com, while the Times Co.
has a 6.2 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   The competition among financial Web sites has sometimes been
direct and at other times glancing, analysts say. Some sites, like
fool.com, are aimed largely at small investors, and others, like
TheStreet.com, seek a more sophisticated audience, a combination of
professionals and well-informed private investors.
</P>
<P>
   But in that competition for audience, TheStreet.com, which has
been a subscription-based site for almost its entire existence, has
been passed by other general news sites. According to the Web
measurement firm Media Matrix, TheStreet.com had 908,000 different
visitors in December, compared with 1.2 million for cnnfn.com and
3.2 million for Marketwatch, which leads the group.
</P>
<P>
   People close to both TheStreet.com and marketwatch.com draw
sharp journalistic and business distinctions between the two sites.
Journalistically, TheStreet.com has prided itself on deep, quick
reporting and sharp analysis. The skeptical, knowing tone and sharp
opinions of the leading columnists, James C. Cramer and Herb
Greenberg, has won the site a cadre of loyal followers on Wall
Street _ and another cadre of investors and professionals who
loathe them.
</P>
<P>
   On the business side, TheStreet.com, like The Wall Street
Journal, chose to use a subscription model for its business,
ensuring two revenue streams _ advertising and subscription _ but
also depressing its audience size. While some of its information
was available for free, those wishing to read Greenberg's column,
for instance, had to subscribe.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, TheStreet.com announced it was amending this
strategy and providing most of its news for free, while developing
premium sister sites like Realmoney.com and TheStreetPros.com that
would offer rich analysis and would charge. RealMonday.com would
offer the commentaries of Cramer, who is also a hedge fund manager
and a co-founder of the Web site, to subscribers who would pay $20
a month, or $200 annually.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Marketwatch.com has focused on plain-vanilla
breaking news and strategies and partnership relationships that
would increase the audience for its free offerings. CBS has a 38
percent stake in the company, as does Data Broadcasting Co., which
was its original backer. A part of CBS's investment, however, is in
in-kind advertising, and the site's Web address is frequently
mentioned on such CBS programs as The Evening News with Dan Rather.
</P>
<P>
   Marketwatch's audience increased sharply in each of the last two
months, after deals with Yahoo and America Online brought thousands
of new users to its site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is fairly simple _ it's about getting users'' and selling
the audience to advertisers, said Lawrence Marcus, an analyst with
Deutsche Bank BT Alex. Brown. ``The beauty of being No. 1 is you
get a disproportionate share of the opportunity'' for deals that
can expand a site's reach.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus' firm was an underwriter for Marketwatch.com's public
offering of its shares last year.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison of the fourth-quarter earnings reports from the two
companies showed that Marketwatch.com, which has a market
capitalization of $588.8 million, had net revenues of $10 million.
TheStreet.com, with a market capitalization of $412.3 million, had
net revenues of $5.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   As an analysis by fool.com _ a competitor of both sites _
recently pointed out, ``TheStreet is running a more expensive
operation than Marketwatch.com to produce just half the revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Kramer, the president and chief executive of Marketwatch,
would not comment on any possible negotiations Wednesday, and
Thomas J. Clarke, the chief executive of TheStreet.com, did not
return a message left with TheStreet.com's public relations
spokesman. The spokesman for News Corp. also did not return calls
seeking comment on whether his company would have an interest in a
partnership with TheStreet.com, whose leading commentators appear
frequently on the Fox News Channel's programs. A spokeswoman for
the Times Co. said it never commented on potential investments.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of TheStreet.com closed at $16 13/16 Wednesday, up 13/16.
SHare of Marketwatch closed at $42.50, down $1.

HEWLETT-PACKARD EARNINGS EXCEED ESTIMATES IN QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Hewlett-Packard Co. reported first-quarter
earnings Wednesday that exceeded Wall Street estimates by a couple
of pennies, excluding costs associated with the spinoff of its
test- and measurement-equipment maker, Agilent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue growth, at 14 percent, was particularly strong, compared
with the year earlier, when its revenue grew by just 1 percent.
Last quarter, Carleton S. Fiorina, who joined Hewlett-Packard in
July as president and chief executive, set a goal for the year of
12 percent to 15 percent growth in revenue and earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent, which operates a test and measurement equipment
business, will report its financial results separately for the
first time on Thursday. Hewlett-Packard sold 72 million Agilent
shares at $30 each in November, representing a 15 percent stake.
Hewlett-Packard plans to distribute the remaining shares to its
shareholders this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard reported its results after the close of the
market, but a strong quarter had been anticipated. Hewlett-Packard
shares closed at $129.375, up $4.0625, on the New York Stock
Exchange. In after-hours trading, Hewlett-Packard traded as high as
$132.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Jan. 31, net income from continuing
operations dropped to $794 million, or 77 cents a diluted share,
down 10 percent from $882 million, or 85 cents a share, in the
corresponding period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Year-earlier earnings that included Agilent was $960 million, or
92 cents a share. Revenue grew to $11.67 billion from $10.24
billion in the first quarter of fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding expenses related to the Agilent spinoff and the
incremental effect of stock appreciation rights resulting from a 46
percent rise in the company's stock price during the quarter,
Hewlett-Packard had earnings of 80 cents a share. Analysts had
expected the company to earn 78 cents, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making clear and measurable progress in our enterprise
business,'' Fiorina said in a conference call with analysts. ``We
are winning more deals against tough competitors. The renewal and
reinvention of Hewlett-Packard is under way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard said its imaging and printing segment _ which
includes laser and inkjet printing and imaging devices like digital
cameras and scanners, and corresponding supplies and services _
grew 13 percent year over year. The computing systems segment _
which includes workstations, desktops, laptops, Unix servers,
storage and software _ grew 15 percent from a year earlier.
Services grew by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They managed to show some growth in Unix, and had pretty good
PC and printer growth,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P.
Morgan. Fiorina ``couldn't expect the honeymoon to last forever,
and she knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   If she hadn't delivered the goods this quarter, the honeymoon
would have come to an abrupt end, and she prevented that,'' he
said. ``I think she's leaning on a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard still trails Sun Microsystems Inc. in the market
for Unix servers, which are commonly used to run Web sites and in
corporate applications. But Fiorina says the company is winning
more sales against Sun than in the past, and is moving into a
strong competitive position with the release later this year of the
IA 64 chip, or Itanium, jointly developed by Hewlett-Packard and
the Intel Corp. This chip will be used first in servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the low end, our data suggest we are growing as fast if not
faster than Sun,'' Fiorina said. ``We believe that based on order
growth we're seeing in these last two quarters. At the high end, we
think our total number of shipments continues to outpace Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said;
``Although still clearly trailing Sun, ``H.P. ought to be able to
at least grow in line with the market. They've got a decent product
line. With printers being 65 percent of profits, that really buys
them time to rebuild the Unix product line.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard's revenue growth of 14 percent, he added,
``shows that Carly is having an impact on the company.''

JURY INSTRUCTIONS REMAIN CRUCIAL ISSUE FOR VERDICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also DIALLO-TRIAL) 
(js) 
 By AMY WALDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For all the courtroom drama the trial of the four
officers accused of killing Amadou Diallo has presented, the
outcome of the case could rest on behind-the-scenes negotiations on
how the judge will instruct the jury to apply the law.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, lawyers for the officers and from the Bronx district
attorney's office convened in the chambers of Justice Joseph C.
Teresi to discuss whether the jury should be allowed to consider
lesser charges against the officers, along with the two counts of
second-degree murder each is already facing.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, they will meet again, this time to continue talks
over how the judge will instruct the jury on which sections of
state law to apply in the case. Each side will present the judge
with a ``request to charge'' that contains the language it wants
the judge to use when instructing the jurors on what they should
consider during their deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest area of contention now involves the officers' claim
that the shooting was justified because they believed Diallo had a
gun. Under New York penal law, there are two justification
statutes. Section 35.30 applies specifically to police officers,
and says they are justified in using physical force only if they
are arresting someone or preventing an escape from custody. The
officers have said they were seeking only to question Diallo, not
to arrest him, and he was not in custody, so their lawyers are not
confident that Teresi will allow them to rely on that statute.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Section 35.15, which is applicable to anyone. That
section justifies using physical force when someone believes it is
necessary to defend oneself or someone else from an attack.
</P>
<P>
   What worries defense lawyers is a section of that statute that
says a person who is facing a potentially deadly attack cannot use
deadly physical force in response if he or she knows that
retreating is a viable option.
</P>
<P>
   Some defense lawyers are worried that the judge will instruct
jurors that the officers had a ``duty to retreat,'' and lawyers not
involved in the case agreed that it could create a heavy burden for
the defense. ``If the judge does charge duty to retreat, that's
devastating to the defense,'' said Barry Kamins, a lawyer in
private practice. ``Normally police officers are not obligated to
establish that there was a duty to retreat.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what defense lawyers are expected to argue on Thursday,
with the support of cases from other states that they hope will be
persuasive to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   There are other issues at stake, including whether the jury will
be told that every shot the officers fired must be justified, and
the notion of ``acting in concert'' _ a prosecution theory that
says the defendants had a shared state of mind. While maintaining a
joint defense, the defense lawyers _ particularly those for Officer
Kenneth Boss, who fired five shots, and Officer Richard Murphy, who
fired four _ also want to separate their clients in the minds of
the jurors. The other two officers, Sean Carroll and Edward
McMellon, each emptied his weapon.
</P>
<P>
   What may turn out to be the most significant legal issue was
resolved behind closed doors on Tuesday. The question of whether
the jury should be allowed to consider lesser charges has hovered
over the trial since a grand jury indicted the officers for murder.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement reached on Tuesday, the jury will have to
reach a verdict on each murder count before considering lesser
charges, including intentional murder, first-degree manslaughter,
second-degree murder with depraved indifference to human life (a
lesser charge that means the officers acted recklessly),
second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of lesser charges would seem to increase the chance
for a conviction of some kind, several lawyers not involved with
the case said Wednesday. ``Putting a variety of charges in front of
the jury promotes the idea of compromise,'' said Gerald L. Shargel,
who has represented the convicted mob boss John J. Gotti. ``If
there are jurors who want to acquit and others who want to convict,
then criminally negligent homicide might be a good place to resolve
that dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the defense, not asking for lesser charges could be a
gamble with severe consequences. Lawyers often talk about the case
of Jean Harris, who was tried in 1981 in the death of her lover,
Dr. Herman Tarnower. Her lawyer asked the jury not to compromise on
a lesser verdict, and Harris was convicted of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Shargel also said, however, that prosecutors in the Diallo case
asking for lesser charges suggested that they ``recognize that the
jury is unlikely to see this as a case of murder _ as the
intentional taking of Diallo's life. I think they're starting to
see this case, if a crime has been committed here, as something
less than murder.''

SENATOR BOB KERREY TO HEAD NEW SCHOOL UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. Bob Kerrey, the war hero who failed in his bid
for the White House in 1992, is leaving the Senate _ and Nebraska _
to become president of the New School University in Manhattan, best
known for its offbeat catalog of continuing education classes for
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, a 56-year-old Democrat, said his decision to leave the
Senate came after the school approached him and expressed
enthusiasm about his ideas for education. He announced in January
that he would not seek a third term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be addressing what I consider one of the most difficult
problems in higher education,'' the senator said in an interview
from Omaha, ``in that it is becoming less and less accessible to
the middle class because of the costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, chairman of the Federal Web-Based Education Commission,
said he wanted to pursue the idea that using the Web could help run
a school more efficiently and lower the costs. And he said higher
education needed to play a more active role in finding solutions to
the problems in primary and secondary education.
</P>
<P>
   The New School University, founded in 1919 as the New School of
Social Research, gradually rose in stature in the 1930s and 1940s
when it served as a haven for social scientists fleeing persecution
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The university has 7,000 students seeking degrees and a
full-time faculty of 162, but it is better known for its 20,000
students in continuing education and its staff of 1,175 part-time
instructors. Its courses run the gamut from English literature to
astronomy to photography to more off-beat topics ranging from
basket weaving to a course entitled ``Gym Culture and the Modern
Amazon.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey said he hoped he would be able to teach one class
himself, in how to draft a law. He also said the fact that his
longtime girlfriend, Sara Paley, a screenwriter, lives in New York
was a ``happy coincidence'' in making his decision.
</P>
<P>
   He will be the school's seventh president. Its sixth, Jonathan
F. Fanton, was appointed in 1984 but left the $250,000 post with
its official Greenwich Village residence in September to become
president of the MacArthur Foundation in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The university said that it was attracted to Kerrey both for his
high public profile and his extensive work in education. ``We view
ourselves as a place of independence,'' said Philip Scaturro, the
school's chancellor, ``a place where free inquiry and discussion is
valued, and we believe those same values are important to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, a Vietnam veteran who lost his leg there and won a Medal
of Honor, was governor of Nebraska and operates a chain of
restaurants and health clubs in his home state. He has a reputation
as something of a maverick, but also as an important player on
Capitol Hill. His decision not to return to what was a safe seat
came as a blow to the Democratic Party, which would like to reverse
the Republican's 55 to 45 margin of control in the Senate.

CLINTON SEES HOPE OF REVIVING IRISH PEACE PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite the breakdown in the Irish peace process,
President Clinton spoke optimistically Wednesday of reviving the
deal aimed at ending decades of violence and restoring self-rule to
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in a rough spot,'' Clinton said of the peace plan
mediated by his administration, as he called the decision this week
by the Irish Republican Army to pull out of disarmament talks an
``unfortunate development.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his first White House news conference of the year,
Clinton insisted ``there's still a good chance'' that the peace
process will succeed and pledged to do all he can to help get
things back on track.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish peace accord is considered one of the most significant
foreign policy accomplishments of Clinton's presidency. But the
IRA's withdrawal from talks Tuesday, a move that was made in
retaliation for Britain's suspension last week of the power-sharing
Northern Ireland government, is a serious setback that could
jeopardize the continuation of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's action worries some Irish observers who fear that the
militant group may be inclined to break its 3-year-old cease-fire
and resume a war of terror aimed at rooting out the British
presence in Northern Ireland. But Clinton said he has seen ``no
indication at all'' that the IRA intends to resort to violence
again, which he suggested is cause in itself to be hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means they still think that, no matter what the rhetoric
is, that all the parties really believe they ought to find a way to
work this out,'' the president added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton addressed the Irish peace process during an hourlong
news conference at which he also tackled topics ranging from the
Republican presidential campaign to gun control and the
India-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will travel to India next month, but is not scheduled to
visit Pakistan. However, he left open the possibility of a stop in
Pakistan and offered to mediate the dispute over Kashmir if both
sides ask the United States to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is willing to play a key role in resolving the
decades-old dispute over the mountain territory that has sparked
several wars in the region, Clinton said, ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   He called South Asia a ``hugely important area of the world''
that's threatened by a potential nuclear arms race between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``A conflict between India and Pakistan, if not contained, is
one of the most significant security threats to the interest of the
United States in this new century, and, I might say, a tragic
situation,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton spent considerable time addressing foreign
policy issues, he used his appearance before reporters in the East
Room to tout his record on the domestic front and to announce the
release of $125 million from the federal Low Income Home Energy
Assistance Program to help poor families in the Northeast and
Midwest hit by the rising cost of home-heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   He also highlighted a study by the Department of Housing and
Urban Development suggesting that residents of public housing are
more than twice as likely to be victims of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than a million children and 360,000 seniors live in
public housing in the United States. They deserve to be as safe as
the rest of us,'' Clinton declared, as he again urged Congress to
pass tougher, ``common sense'' gun-control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The president also reminded Americans that the nation is now in
the midst of the longest-running economic recovery in history. He
said there is still ``important work to be done'' in his remaining
year to help ensure that it continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must stay on the path of fiscal discipline that got us to
this point,'' he said, calling for most of the projected budget
surpluses over the next 13 years to be used to pay off the nation's
$3.7 trillion public debt. He added that debt reduction would help
ensure the preservation of the Social Security and Medicare
programs, and enable the government to provide a prescription-drug
benefit for elderly Americans who can no longer afford the high
cost of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   As he fielded questions, Clinton seemed to enjoy those that
dealt with the Republican presidential campaign between Gov. George
W. Bush and Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Laughing, Clinton said he has a ``lot of sympathy '' for Bush
and McCain who have made him the target of much of their rhetoric
because, ``It's hard for them to figure out what to run on,'' given
the state of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a tough job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he feels about being ridiculed by the GOP candidates
for his personal conduct while in office, the president added,
laughing, ``Well, if I were running, I'd do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said he likes to think that he is ``casting a little
sunshine'' over the 2000 campaign by ``being nice and generous''
for the most part in his assessment of each candidate's
qualifications for the job he now holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You basically have got four people (including Democrats Al
Gore and Bill Bradley) running for president now who are people of
accomplishment, people who have certain convictions. This is not a
bad thing for America, this choice they've got.''

METRO MATTERS: SOME RELIEF FOR KILLERS OF DIALLO 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also DIALLO-TRIAL, DIALLO-CHARGES) 
(js) 
 By JOYCE PURNICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The relief was palpable in Justice Joseph C.
Teresi's courtroom here Wednesday, when he said that the defense
and the prosecution had agreed that the jury should consider less
serious charges than murder in the trial of four police officers
accused in the killing of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   The taut features of Kenneth Boss, one of the officers, relaxed
_ almost imperceptibly, but not quite. Defense lawyers and about
two dozen police officers up from New York City wearing their
``Free the Bronx Four'' buttons all but hugged each other. Even the
four couldn't suppress small smiles as they left the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The reason isn't complicated. Jurors would be able to consider
charges that include manslaughter and criminally negligent
homicide, which carries a penalty as light as probation. The
original charge of murder carries a punishment of up to life in
prison _ 15 years at least. Any of the four can still be convicted
of the higher counts, but even some of their harshest critics say
that the prosecution has hardly made a case for murder.
</P>
<P>
   So there was plenty of elation on the defense side when Teresi
announced that he would consider charging the jury with the lower
counts _ the ``lesser includeds.'' But there was no surprise. In
fact, it was expected, just as the judge, who has reserved his
decision, is expected to accept the recommendation for broadening
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The day the case began, over three weeks ago, even before the
jury had been selected, lawyers and reporters were already talking
about adding charges. That's because from the beginning of this
sad, politicized case over a year ago, many lawyers have said that
Robert T. Johnson, the district attorney of the Bronx, overcharged
_ that he accused the four officers of the high counts of
intentional murder and murder ``with depraved indifference to human
life'' knowing that convictions on those counts were unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   He denies that. He has complained that because the officers
would not appear before the grand jury, he did not know their
explanation. And his chief assistant, Barry L. Kluger, said
Wednesday, ``Of course we do not believe it was an overcharge,''
adding that requesting lesser includeds is ``not unusual.'' ``No
special significance should be given to that.''
</P>
<P>
   But little about the shooting of the unarmed African immigrant
by four white police officers has been without political
significance. The death of Diallo outraged millions of New Yorkers,
and legitimately so. An innocent man was killed, his body riddled
with 19 of 41 bullets fired at him because, the four defendants
say, they mistook his wallet for a gun. His death incensed people
all over the city, especially in the Bronx, most especially
African-Americans, already infuriated by aggressive police tactics.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to view the charges of intentional murder and
murder with depraved indifference through an apolitical lens. If
the jury convicts on lower counts, or acquits any of the officers,
Johnson can say at least he tried. Imagine the outcry if this
district attorney, who is, after all, an elected official,
originally charged them with manslaughter. Nor is overcharging
unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always overcharge,'' Gerald Lefcourt, a criminal lawyer,
said of district attorneys. ``You throw a lot against the wall and
hope something will stick.'' The hope is that by starting out too
high, the jury will come back with more than acquittal, similar to
a union leader insisting on unreasonably high salary increases at
the outset of a labor negotiation, then compromising.
</P>
<P>
   But there are consequences to this strategy. ``You totally raise
expectations,'' Lefcourt said. ``Look at that family. They're
totally going along with intentional murder. You'll have people
saying he threw the case.'' There was never a strong case for
intentional or depraved murder, he went on. ``You'd have to have
people on duty running around killing people.''
</P>
<P>
   Law textbooks describe depraved-indifference murder as the
equivalent of driving down Main Street, doing 60 miles an hour at 3
in the afternoon; intentional murder would be waiting for a
pedestrian to walk into the street and then stepping on the
accelerator. How does a prosecutor without one reliable witness
prove that four officers who say they saw a gun in a man's hand
committed depraved or intentional murder?
</P>
<P>
   He can't. Johnson will never admit it, and we will not know for
sure until the verdict comes in. But the betting here is that he
never stood a good chance of getting the four officers convicted of
murdering Diallo. And being a good lawyer, he knew it.

MINING SUIT MAY HURT LAND DONATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELAINE PORTERFIELD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Down in the fertile green farmlands of Virginia, a fight over
vermiculite mining has spawned a nasty court case that some say
could halt efforts throughout the country to preserve ancient
forests, farmlands and pristine streams.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia case pits a land trust that husbands historic
farmlands and a major mining company that donated property to the
trust against a competing company that wants to mine vermiculite
from those lands.
</P>
<P>
   The case is being closely monitored by major environmental
groups such as the Nature Conservancy, which could eventually find
itself out of business if the courts side with the company that
seeks to mine the vermiculite. The Nature Conservancy is dedicated
to preserving lands for plants and animals by the use of
conservation easements that prohibit development.
</P>
<P>
   The group and other land-trust organizations were dealt a blow
by a ruling earlier in the case by the U.S. Court of Appeals Fourth
Circuit, which held that a non-profit organization that accepts a
land donation with commercial restrictions could be sued for
anti-trust violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservation easements and land donations are important
land-use tools that serve to protect hundreds of acres of
historically sensitive and environmentally sensitive resources
across the country,'' the Nature Conservancy and the Land Trust
Alliance wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief. ``The Fourth
Circuit's ruling that the receipt of donated land may be subject to
an anti-trust challenge directly threatens the continued viability
of conservation easements and land trusts.''
</P>
<P>
   The opponents in the Virginia case meet in U.S. District Court
in Charlottesville Thursday, where a federal judge will hear
motions in the case. Trial is scheduled for April 24.
</P>
<P>
   The same judge earlier dismissed the land trust from the suit,
but the organization was subsequently reinstated as a party by the
Fourth Circuit decision.
</P>
<P>
   The case has placed W.R. Grace &AMP; Co., a multibillion-dollar
corporation long the target of criticism by environmentalists and
public health experts, in the novel position of defending a
donation that would actually preserve lands from mining or other
development.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing Grace is Virginia Vermiculite Ltd., a mining company
owned by Robert Sansom, a former Environmental Protection Agency
official.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sansom's resume, he was a Fulbright Scholar, a
Rhodes Scholar and a White House Fellow. He worked for Henry
Kissinger at the National Security Council as well as serving as
assistant administrator for the EPA in the Nixon Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The legal squabble has roots stretching back to 1992, when Grace
donated about 1,400 acres to a land trust known as Historic Green
Springs Inc. The trust was established to protect the Green Springs
National Historic Landmark District and its surroundings in Louisa
County, Va., from development.
</P>
<P>
   The oval-shaped district encompasses about 14,000 acres, and
contains more 250 historic buildings on farmlands that date from
the American Revolution to about the mid-1880s.
</P>
<P>
   But the lands have a significance that goes beyond the historic:
they contain an enormous quantity of vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other known vermiculite deposit ...in this country
or worldwide that has anywhere near the potential for the
production of vermiculite as the Green Springs area of Louisa
County,'' reported a 1972 Grace interal memo.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Libby, Mont., where vermiculite formerly mined by Grace
is contaminated by asbestos, the ore is found in commercial
quantities near Dillon and Hamilton, Mont., and in Virginia and
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Vermiculite is a unique, fireproof mineral that expands tenfold
when heated. It is used in insulation, fire safety, energy
conservation, construction, food processing and horticulture. It
also has promising future applications in water and soil
detoxification, nuclear waste cleanup and the containment of
industrial spills.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, Grace produced 57 percent of all vermiculite
sold in the United States. Virginia Vermiculite, the only other
major U.S. producer of the mineral, produced 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the remaining vermiculate sold in the country is
imported from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Grace had been under pressure from conservationists and the
Interior Department not to mine at Louisa.
</P>
<P>
   But when Grace donated the 1,400 acres in Louisa County to the
land trust, it didn't sit very well with Virginia Vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Grace had offered its holdings in the county to
Virginia Vermiculate, and that company submitted an offer that
Grace found unacceptable. Rather than making a counteroffer, Grace
instead donated the land to the Green Springs trust in exchange for
a hefty tax deduction from the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   The donation came with a restrictive convenant that prohibited
vermiculite mining.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Virginia Vermiculite sued Grace and the land trust,
alleging it had been injured by the donation, which the company
claimed resulted in the supression of 40 percent of the vermiculite
supply in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That, Virginia Vermiculite contended, was a violation of the
Sherman Antitrust Act because it helped give Grace monopoly power
in the vermiculite market in the United States. Keeping the 1,400
acres from ever being mined by anyone depreciated the value of
Virginia Vermiculite's business and caused it to suffer increased
costs and lost profits, the company contended.
</P>
<P>
   Sansom says he filed the anti-trust suit ``for the public''
because the vermiculite reserves donated by Grace should ``be
available to the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   The land trust is represented by Seattle attorney Charles
Montange, a solo practioner with a broad background in enviromental
law.
</P>
<P>
   To Montange, the case has ramifications far beyond vermiculite
mining. If Virginia Vermiculite prevails in federal court, it could
well mean the end of land donations that protect property from
development, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would render any donation for state forest land illegal,''
Montange said. ``Any donation to the Nature Conservancy for
historic preservation, salmon preservation, old growth forest
preservation, would be subject to the Sherman Antitrust act.''
</P>
<P>
   If that argument is carried to its logical extreme, it means
that if vermiculite were found on the grounds of Thomas Jefferson's
Monticello, ``We'd have to tear it down, otherwise we'd be
restricting (commerce),'' Montange said. ``It's an amazingly
aggressive argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Sansom disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any reverberations for any easement
programs or anything else,'' he says. ``This is a unique case and I
don't think it has any broader consequences because it's in a
(historic) landmark.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, runs counter
to previous decisions made by several other federal appellate
courts around the country, Montange and Grace contend in court
papers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Judge James Michael, who originally dismissed the land
trust from the suit, had agreed, saying ``like the participants in
the temperance movement and anti-abortion movement, (the land
trust) is not engaged in commercial activities and should not be
exposed to antitrust liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis O'Donnell, an attorney who earlier drafted arguments on
behalf of the land trust, said he wasn't surprised by the Fourth
Circuit's ruling. Many of the judges hew to the politically
conservative side, and aren't afraid to put that into practice, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   David Izakowitz, an attorney representing Virginia Vermiculite,
says it's important to keep the case - and the intended mining - in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talk about this mining and what it does to a
historic district,'' Izakowitz said. ``But the mining, when it's
done, is in relatively small areas, a couple of acres at time. And
it can't be seen, because of the land berms.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Virginia Vermiculite would reclaim the land at the
end of mining, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be returned to green pastures that can be farmed,'' he
said.

EXCHANGE TO OFFER DERIVATIVES LINKED TO THE FORTUNE 500 LIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Move over Dow Jones and Standard &AMP; Poor's, here comes
the Fortune 500 stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after Dow Jones &AMP; Co. agreed to allow investors to
trade derivatives based on the Dow Jones industrials, Fortune
magazine says it is going to allow the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
to begin offering futures and options linked to a new Fortune 500
index, which the magazine will create.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which is owned by Time Warner Inc., said Wednesday
that it would also license the exchange to trade derivatives based
on a newly developed Fortune E-50 index, which would track the
performance of companies tied to the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Fortune Inc. said the move was an attempt to
leverage a well-known brand name and capitalize on the growing
popularity of stock indexes by coming up with two measures derived
from the magazine's annual ranking.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine hopes the new indices _ which will move up and down
as a stock measure, just like the Dow Jones average _ will become
major benchmarks of stock performance in the broader market as well
as the increasingly popular technology sector. And for its part,
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange hopes to increase volume and
attract investors looking to do one-stop shopping in two more stock
index derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   Investors can currently trade futures and options on the Dow
Jones industrial average index at the Chicago Board of Trade and
the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, which pioneered stock index futures when it introduced
widespread trading in the S.&AMP; P. 500 index in 1982, tried and
failed to win the Dow contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has begun
offering a popular contract called the e-mini, a bite-sized S&AMP;P 500
contract that is meant to appeal to smaller investors. The larger
S&AMP; P 500 contracts remain the most sought after, though, with over
27 million contracts traded in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The American Stock Exchange has also introduced new stock index
contracts in recent years that track the Dow and S&AMP; P. They are
known as Diamonds and Spiders. The Nasdaq stock market, owned by
the National Association of Securities Dealers, also licenses
indices tied to its index at several derivatives exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   In creating a stock index, Fortune magazine, which introduced
its annual Fortune 500 list in 1955, joins other large financial
institutions and publishers that have created market measures.
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the big Wall
Street brokerage houses, have indices that track commodity prices
and technology stocks. Standard &AMP; Poor's, a unit of McGraw-Hill,
offers an array of stock indices.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, however, the Dow Jones industrial average was simply
a measurement of 30 big U.S. companies, chosen by the editors of
The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Dow Jones. The major
futures exchanges were unable to offer products tied to the
average.
</P>
<P>
   The editors of Fortune will determine the components and metrics
that will be used in calculating the index. The company said those
details would be released in the March 6 edition of Fortune, which
is due on newsstands next week.

MARTIN ORNE, 72, PSYCHIATRIST AND EXPERT ON HYPNOSIS, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Martin T. Orne, a psychiatrist whose work on hypnosis
influenced its use around the world and helped limit its role in
criminal investigations, died Feb. 11 in Paoli, Pa. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Orne, who was also a psychologist, was considered an expert in a
variety of fields, including multiple personality disorder and what
is popularly know as brainwashing. Yet what most interested him was
how people behaved when, in the hands of an accomplished
practitioner, they were lulled into trance-like states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hypnosis was a lifelong work for him, from his very first
paper to his very last paper,'' said Dr. David F. Dinges, director
of the University of Pennsylvania's experimental psychology unit,
which Orne founded.
</P>
<P>
   As an advocate of hypnosis, firm in the face of colleagues
skeptical of its very existence, Orne also proved to be among its
most important critics.
</P>
<P>
   His first published paper, which he wrote as an undergraduate at
Harvard, dispelled many of the myths associated with using hypnosis
for age regression. While the practice has some mert, he found,
adults under hypnosis are not literally reliving their early
childhoods but presenting them through the prisms of adulthood. His
last paper examined how hypnosis could encourage witnesses to
confabulate, or ``remember'' things they could not have seen or
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous state and federal courts have cited Orne's work in
rulings greatly limiting the use of testimony by people hypnotized
by investigators hoping for a lead.
</P>
<P>
   Orne's reputation was buffeted in 1991, when it was revealed
that he had aided a biographer of the poet Anne Sexton by turning
over hundreds of hours of tape recordings of treatment sessions he
had with her in the 1960s, when he was at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton, who committed suicide in 1974 at 45, prided herself on
living her life as an open book. And Orne released the tapes to the
biographer, Diane Wood Middlebrook, at the request of Sexton's
daughter, her literary executor.
</P>
<P>
   His decision brought heavy criticism from mental health
professionals, some of whom said that even if patients wanted their
records disclosed, psychiatrists should not agree. (In fact, the
bylaws of the American Psychiatric Association do allow patients to
control their records.) An editorial in The New York Times accused
Orne of betraying Sexton and dishonoring his profession.
</P>
<P>
   Orne, responding in a column on the Op-Ed page, wrote that
Sexton had instructed him to use the tapes ``as I saw fit to help
others.'' He added: ``In the judgment of all who knew her well,
Anne definitely would have wanted the tapes released exactly as was
done. What others would see as exposure, she saw as honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Some colleagues were concerned that the controversy could
distract attention from the many accomplishments of Orne, who
worked at Penn for 32 years. He had already gained a wide
reputation for work as an expert in two prominent criminal cases.
In the first, he testified on behalf of Patricia Hearst, the
heiress who took part in a 1974 bank robbery after being held
captive by the Symbionese Liberation Army. Orne said he believed
that Hearst had truly feared she would be killed if she did not
cooperate with her captors. ``She was the only private in an army
of generals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, Orne testified for the prosecution in the
murder trial of Kenneth Bianchi, who was accused of killing 10
young women near Los Angeles. Bianchi, whom the media called ``the
Hillside Strangler,'' contended that he suffered from multiple
personality disorder, but Orne, after a series of interviews with
the defendant, helped convince a judge that this was a fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Theodore Orne was born on Oct. 16, 1927, in Vienna, the
son of a surgeon, Dr. Frank Orne, and a psychiatrist, the former
Martha Brunner. In 1938, the family left Austria for the United
States, settling for a time in New York, where Martin attended the
Bronx High School of Science, and then moving to Boston. He
received his bachelor's degree and doctorate from Harvard
University and a medical degree from Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Emily Carota Orne, of Merion
Station, Pa., a researcher in psychology at Penn, who worked with
her husband closely over the years; a son, Franklin, and a
daughter, Tracy, both of Merion Station; and a brother, Peter Orne
of Flushing.

 BAUER ENDORSES McCAIN; CANDIDATES CONTINUE TO SPAR OVER CAMPAIGN (ADDS 9th graf with Bauer quote.) 
 (Eds: The material in the MCCAIN story, budgeted earlier, is now
folded into REPUBS; see also CAROLINA-PROFILE,
SC-POLITICAL-PROFILE.) 
(rk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL with FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Sen. John McCain won the endorsement
Wednesday of Gary Bauer, a former presidential rival and prominent
social conservative who called him the ``best shot we have to end
the era of Bill and Hillary and Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer showed up at McCain's side at a midday rally here on the
campus of Furman University, in the northern quadrant of South
Carolina, where the state's large and influential bloc of voters
from the religious right is the strongest. The senator's senior
advisers said they hoped Bauer could bring new support from
Christian conservatives and help fend off charges by supporters of
Gov. George W. Bush that McCain is not reliable on social issues
such as abortion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain himself said Bauer could help him reach out to a part of
the Republican Party to which ``my lines of communication haven't
been as firm.'' Bauer immediately started offering a spirited
defense of McCain, providing an important counterweight to figures
like Pat Robertson who suggested this week that conservatives would
desert the party if McCain became the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Reminding the crowd at Furman University of McCain's
imprisonment as a prison of war in North Vietnam, Bauer said that
``when John was in that POW camp, he wasn't sitting around thinking
about the wealth of America or the power of America, he was
thinking about that moral idea of America, the reason that we are
who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who had made the crusade against abortion one of the
centerpieces of his own presidential campaign, said McCain agreed
with him that ``we must work to ensure that every child gets
welcomed into the world and protected by the law.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Bauer said he believed McCain and Bush had
the same position on abortion, which is less absolute than his own.
``At least on the surface there wasn't much difference'' he said of
the two men. ``But I've looked John in the eye. I've talked to him.
I've looked at his voting record. I believe it is by and large a
pro-life voting record.''
</P>
<P>
   With McCain and Bush running neck and neck, the senator has
gained solid support from independents. But most polls show him
running behind Bush with traditional Republicans and doing even
worse with the religious right. A South Carolina anti-abortion
group is running radio advertisements accusing McCain of voting
``to use tax dollars for experiments that use body parts from
aborted babies,'' a theme that is also being hit hard by the
National Right to Life Committee in direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Charleston sidestepped a question about
whether Bauer's endorsement of his rival would hurt him with
religious conservatives. ``I think I've got good chance to win
South Carolina,'' Bush said. ``I'm going to drive this campaign
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer took a veiled shot at Bush Wednesday by declaring that
McCain ``wants an American and a political system that's not
moneybags democracy but a system built on civility and decency and
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush took a more direct swipe at McCain and his commitment to
diluting the influence of money in politics, suggesting Wednesday
that McCain was ignoring federal spending limits for the Republican
primary in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides asserted that McCain had spent about $2.8 million
in advertising alone for South Carolina, and had thus undoubtedly
exceeded the limit of slightly more than $3 million for a full
array of expenditures. Bush himself declined to make charges or
cite numbers, but his comments left no doubt that he believed that
McCain had crossed the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``No candidate ought to be above the rules,'' Bush said at a
news conference in Hilton Head Wednesday morning. ``Senator McCain
needs to explain, if in fact he has busted the spending cap in
South Carolina, how on the one hand you can be a campaign funding
reformer and on the other hand, not live within spending caps.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides did not provide a specific figure for the Arizona
senator's spending but said that he would remain within the limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a dime under in New Hampshire,'' said John Weaver, the
political director for the McCain campaign. ``We'll be a nickel
under here.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarrel was about more than math. With striking consistency
over the last week and a half, Bush has worked to divert attention
from his own prodigious financial war chest and intense spending to
charges that McCain's fund raising violates some of his own
principles when it comes to campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush faces no spending limits, because he raised so much money
last year that he decided to forgo the federal matching funds that
are distributed on the condition that candidates stay within
certain caps. Bush's aides said Wednesday that the campaign had
spent about $3.1 million on advertising in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign provided a startling glimpse Wednesday into
the full extent of their spending, conceding that it had spent, by
the end of January, about $50 million of the $70 million it had
raised up to then, leaving the campaign with about $20 million in
reserve on the day before the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   That was a record-setting expenditure for this point in a
presidential race, and it topped by $8 million the amount that Bob
Dole had spent through July in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insisted that his campaign had nonetheless anticipated, and
was well equipped, to deal with this kind of scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on plan,'' Bush said at the news conference. ``We've got
a strategy. We've got a plan in place and we're executing the
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also engaged McCain in a new television commercial that
addresses campaign financing and began airing Wednesday in South
Carolina. The spot says that McCain's criticisms of Bush on this
issue have been gratuitous and unwarranted, and it casts Bush as
someone eager to usher in sensible reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer met secretly with McCain Tuesday in a Columbia hotel
before the final debate leading into the South Carolina primary.
Bauer flew back to Washington Tuesday night to consult with his
family. He then telephoned McCain at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday morning
with his decision and the campaign sent a chartered plane to bring
him back to South Carolina. Bauer was planning to stump for McCain
in South Carolina and then in Michigan.

U.S. IMPOSES SANCTIONS ON OIL VENTURE IN SUDAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States imposed sanctions Wednesday on a
multinational oil venture in Sudan, a project that critics say has
helped the government there finance a religious war against
southern rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department's sanctions prohibit U.S. companies and
citizens from doing business with the Greater Nile Petroleum
Operating Co., a joint venture between Sudapet, Sudan's national
oil company, and Chinese, Malaysian and Canadian partners. The
sanctions ban trade and financial transactions with the joint
venture and freeze any assets it has placed in U.S. banks.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions do not cover the foreign parent companies that
backed the oil venture. Some members of Congress and human rights
groups had urged the Clinton administration to punish Talisman
Energy, China National Petroleum Corp. and Petronas, the leading
oil companies in Canada, China and Malaysia, respectively, for
their involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan's Islamist government has used oil revenue to fuel its war
against rebels in the mainly Christian and animist southern part of
the country, Western religious and human rights groups have argued.
The civil war has gone on for 17 years and killed millions of
people.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the United States has banned all trade, loans and
aid to Sudan, accusing the Khartoum regime of allowing slavery,
supporting terrorism and seeking to overthrow neighboring
governments. Wednesday's sanctions were an extension of the earlier
action, coming after the Treasury Department determined that the
oil project was essentially part of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a strong finding that the Sudapet project is part of
the country,'' a senior Treasury official said. ``Once we did that,
applying sanctions was more or less automatic.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The United States imposed sanctions just two days after Canada
made the opposite decision, electing to spare Talisman and Sudan
itself from punishment. Talisman, which has a 25 percent stake in
the Sudapet project, is one of the few large Western companies
willing to invest in Sudan, and has come under pressure to sever
links.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department's sanctions are not expected to impact
Talisman directly. Company officials told reporters Wednesday that
they had separated the finances and operations of the Sudanese
joint venture from those of the parent company. Still, Talisman
shares fell 2.30 Canadian dollars, or 5.6 percent, to 38.80
Canadian dollars in Toronto trading.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the sanctions are unlikely to affect China National
Petroleum, known as CNPC. The state-owned company is planning to
list shares on the New York Stock Exchange this spring, an offering
underwritten by Goldman Sachs Group. CNPC is selling shares in a
new subsidiary called PetroChina that consists exclusively of the
company's domestic assets.
</P>
<P>
   Some human rights groups and members of Congress have urged the
Clinton administration to take stronger action against the three
foreign companies that backed the Sudan venture. Rep. Frank Wolf,
R-Va., has argued that the administration should block the planned
U.S. listing of the CNPC subsidiary because of its ties to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything they do to punish those companies, I support,'' Wolf
said of the Clinton administration. ``But I would like to see it
broader. This is one of the major moral issues in the world
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior Treasury official said the Trading With the Enemy
Act, under which sanctions against Sudan were imposed, does not
allow the administration to punish third-country companies, only
U.S. citizens and U. S. companies.  &QL;

CONFEDERATE FLAG CASTS SHADOW ON OLYMPIC TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., W.Va., Va., N.J., Md.)   (rk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The presence of the Confederate battle flag above South
Carolina's state Capitol is a hot-button political issue that has
reverberated beyond Saturday's state Republican primary and into
the world of Olympic distance running.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women's marathon trials will take place in Columbia on
Feb. 26, where the flag flies over the capitol even though many
consider it a symbol of slavery, segregation and the Ku Klux Klan.
USA Track and Field, the sport's national governing body, has
issued a statement in support of the removal of the flag from the
South Carolina Statehouse, although it has not called for
postponing the race or for moving it to another location.
</P>
<P>
   The track federation has also offered to assist marathoners who
wish to support an economic boycott of the state, which has been
called for by the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People. Runners who wish to avoid patronizing hotels will
be housed by local families in Columbia, the federation said in a
letter sent to the approximately 200 qualifiers for the marathon
trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would minimize the economic impact of your visit to South
Carolina,'' said the letter, which was signed by Craig Masback, the
chief executive officer of USA Track and Field and by Patricia
Rico, the federation's president.
</P>
<P>
   Some college sports programs are also joining the fight against
the flag. Last week, Swarthmore College announced that it was
canceling spring-training trips to South Carolina for its tennis,
lacrosse, softball, golf and track and field teams, joining other
Philadelphia-area schools such as Haverford College, Bryn Mawr and
Temple, which have also voided trips for tennis and lacrosse teams
in support of the NAACP-sanctioned economic boycott.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA has also been asked by a coaching group that the South
Regional of the men's college basketball tournament be removed from
Greenville in 2002 if the confederate flag continues to fly above
the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Conference, which includes such schools as Furman
and the Citadel, has called for a removal of the battle flag and
has indicated that it will consider moving its 2001 postseason
basketball tournament from Greenville, S.C., and the 2002 and 2003
tournaments from Charleston if the issue is not resolved by the
current session of the South Carolina Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confidence things will be resolved; that's what we're
hearing through the grapevine, said Alfred White, commissioner of
the Southern Conference. He noted that South Carolina Gov. Jim
Hodges had won support from several black legislators for moving
the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse to a monument of a
Confederate general on the Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued this week by USA Track and Field said that,
``For many Americans, the Confederate flag is a symbol of
subjugation and segregation. We urge the South Carolina Legislature
to remove the Confederate flag from its Statehouse as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Masback said that it would be impractical to
move a 26.2-mile race at the last minute, as well as unfair to
athletes who have been preparing for months for the Columbia
course. He said the federation decided to take a public stance on
the flag issue after being encouraged to do so by some of its
officers and athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Pilgrim, the general counsel for the federation, also said
the track group was bound by contractual obligations to keep the
race in Columbia. Mike Moran, a spokesman for the U.S. Olympic
Committee, said the USOC was bound by its constitution not to make
political statements unless athletes were being deprived of the
right to compete.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 trials were held in the South Carolina capital, which
won the 2000 Olympic marathon trials two years ago after a
competitive bidding process. The state NAACP began calling for an
economic boycott last July. Considering that time frame, along with
the fact that race organizers have also called for a removal of the
Confederate flag, NAACP leaders said they did not oppose the
holding of next week's marathon trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are glad that the Carolina Marathon Association has taken a
stand on the issue,'' said Lonnie Randolph, president of the
Columbia branch of the NAACP. ``They are not violating sanctions
per se. But I did meet with race officials and expressed to them
the hope that they will support our efforts in the future and not
return until the matter is resolved.''

<P>
   Katrina Price-Crosby of South Pasadena, Calif., an
African-American who will compete in the Olympic trials at 5,000
and 10,000 meters in July in Sacramento, said she canceled a race
appearance in South Carolina last December. She added that she has
also canceled plans to attend the marathon trials to cheer on her
friends. She has asked them to support the economic boycott by
bringing some of their own food and by not renting cars while in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Price-Crosby and Steve Holman, an African-American who is
America's top miler, said they have begun exploring the idea of
manufacturing red, white and blue ribbons that could be worn as
lapel pins by the marathoners as a sign of silent, individual
protest during next Saturday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd wear one in a heartbeat,'' said Kristy Johnston of
Shepherdstown, W.Va., who has the second-fastest qualifying time.
She said she had considered wearing a confederate flag pin with a
line through it on her ball cap, but was afraid ``I could get shot
by some redneck.'' She said she planned some sort of flag protest
during the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm in a position to express my opinion,'' Johnston
said. ``It seems like majority of people in South Carolina don't
want the flag there. It's amazing a small group of people have kept
the flag flying. It's unbelievable to me it's still up.''
</P>
<P>
   Alisa Harvey of Manassas, Va., who might be the only
African-American in the women's marathon trials, said that she
would consider wearing a ribbon. But she added, ``We need to run a
race and deal with this afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Holman, who lives in Arlington, Va., has vociferously called for
the women marathoners to make some sort of statement about the flag
during the Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say to anyone with a microphone that if the Olympics
are about bringing people across the world together, why does South
Carolina continue to support a flag that stands for keeping people
apart?'' he wrote in a column on the online version of Runners
World magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Holman said: ``If they were flying a swastika,
would Jewish athletes sit on their hands? I think it's pretty
unlikely.''

the marathon at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and is a top contender in
2000, said that his wife would have no comment on the flag issue.
``It's a shame it has drawn the attention it has,'' said Lauck, of
Hampton, N.J. ``Sport is supposed to be something where you put
aside politics. We're upset that's what is getting all the press
attention, not the fact that this is athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwyn Coogan, who finished fourth at the 1996 Olympic trials,
said that she thought it was ``a shame that people feel the need to
fly the flag,'' and that she felt conflicted about competing in the
2000 trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great if I could say, `I disapprove of that flag,
it represents terrible things to many people, therefore I'm not
going to run in the race,''' said Coogan, who lives in Frederick,
Md. ``Not running would be the ultimate way of saying you agree
with the NAACP tourism boycott. In a sense, I'm very much violating
their boycott. But this event happens every four years. I've been
planning to do it for four years. I need to run this race.''

RONNIE ROBERTSON, 62, A SKATER WHO ENTERTAINED WITH HIS SPINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ronnie Robertson, a silver-medalist figure skater in the 1956
Winter Olympics and an ice-show star who was known as the Blur for
his uncanny spins, died on Feb. 4 at a hospital in Fountain Valley,
Calif. Robertson, who lived in Irvine, Calif., was 62.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of pneumonia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, American men's figure-skating was dominated by
Hayes Alan Jenkins, Robertson and Jenkins' younger brother, David.
In 1956, they finished 1-2-3 in the Olympics, world championships
and U.S. championships.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes Alan Jenkins was dominant in the now-defunct school
figures, or compulsory segments, which involved the tracing of
circles. Robertson was the consummate showman, excelling in the
freestyle. Because the compulsories counted for 60 percent of the
total score, the math worked against Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Brackenridge, Pa., near Pittsburgh, Robertson moved
with his family to southern California and grew up in Long Beach.
Often ill as a youngster, he began skating to build stamina and at
age 14 became national junior champion.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson came excruciatingly close to the Olympic gold medal at
the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. The judges
calculated with slide rules for two hours before determining that
the complicated scoring had given Hayes Alan Jenkins seven-tenths
of a point more than Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Skating on a hard, bumpy outdoor rink in subzero temperatures,
Robertson won the free style with extraordinary leaps and spins,
but Jenkins had a large enough margin in the compulsories to take
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, at the world championships in
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, Jenkins and Robertson were again
1-2, but Robertson enthralled the 8,000 spectators, again winning
the freestyle portion.
</P>
<P>
   When Robertson faced the Jenkins brothers in the 1956 U.S.
championships at Philadelphia, he was under a cloud, the German
Skating Federation having accused him of demanding excessive
expenses on a European tour. After finishing second to Hayes Alan
Jenkins for the third time in six weeks, Robertson was cleared of
wrongdoing by the U.S. Skating Federation.
</P>
<P>
   When he was edged out for the Olympic title, Robertson had
remarked, ``That cost me $1 million,'' suggesting he could have
signed a hugely lucrative ice-show contract if he had won the gold
medal. After competing in the nationals, he signed a two-year deal
with the Ice Capades for $100,000. He became a marquee attraction
in the 1960s with that company and then Holiday on Ice.
</P>
<P>
   He later coached, at times helping the former Olympic champion
Brian Boitano, and recently taught at a public rink in Irvine. He
is survived by his mother, Christine Robertson, of Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's ability to spin at an estimated 240 revolutions a
minute was studied by scientists in the American space program who
were trying to determine how astronauts could maintain balance in a
weightless environment. But they apparently reached no conclusions
on why Robertson never became dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone told me it was a natural ability, that I had one of
the best centers of gravity they had seen,'' Robertson told The Los
Angeles Times in an interview in 1982. ``My weight was distributed
just right, my legs were bowed just enough to spin.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson reveled in his showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   As he put it: ``I would like to be remembered as the best
skating entertainer.'' &QL;

LEHTINEN FACES SURGERY

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Stars winger Jere Lehtinen decided to clear up the
uncertainty surrounding his slow-to-heal ankle with surgery.
Lehtinen, who has played only 16 of the Stars' 57 games, is
scheduled to have surgery on his right ankle today at Baylor
Medical Center. He's expected to miss six weeks, which would put
him back March 30 and give him two weeks, or five games, to get
ready before the playoffs. ``For whatever reason, even doing
nothing on it, it didn't heal,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``The good news is we know when we have a player.'' Lehtinen
fractured the ankle Oct. 16 and underwent surgery. He tried to
return Nov. 28, going on the Stars' road trip, but never played,
returning to Dallas after two games with soreness in the ankle. He
returned to the ice on New Year's Eve and played in eight games
before being taken out of the lineup to rest the ankle. After rest
didn't work, Lehtinen went to an ankle specialist Tuesday in New
York. He decided to have surgery when the exam revealed the
fracture hasn't healed. ``No,'' Stars trainer Dave Surprenant said
when asked if Lehtinen's comeback had led to further injury. ``It's
just not strong enough to handle what he had to do.'' HATCHER
UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   It seems like every injured NHL player is listed as day to day
whether he's sidelined by a broken nail or a broken leg. Stars
defenseman Derian Hatcher said he's ``officially day to day'' with
the lacerated calf suffered Dec. 17. He can't say for sure he'll be
in the lineup tomorrow against Phoenix. He did say it's a
possibility. A lot, he says, will depend on how his calf responds
today after three consecutive hard practices. He skated for 60
minutes yesterday. Hatcher said he realizes that whenever he
returns his calf muscle isn't going to be 100 percent. ``It's
something I talked to Hitch and \Rassistant coach Doug\S Wilson
about. My first game back, I won't play 30 minutes,'' said Hatcher,
who figures 15 to 20 is more realistic. ``When you get used to
playing, you need some minutes to get you going.'' NIEUWENDYK
UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock said Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk is recovering
well from the separated right shoulder suffered Jan. 19. He was
originally expected to miss eight weeks. ``Nieuwendyk is on
schedule,'' Hitchcock said. ``Nieuwendyk is really on schedule.
He's had a good week of rehab.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   This will be a difficult day. Saying goodbye to an old friend is
like that, and when that old friend is Tom Landry, that makes it
doubly tough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He has been like a rock in our lives, as solid and dependable as
a mountain, someone we thought would always be there. And yet, most
of us realized that he probably always had a higher calling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That call has finally come. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, we will gather at the church, or at the Myerrson, or sit
alone in front of our television sets to pay our last respects to
someone who was such a central figure in our lives for such a long
time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But saying goodbye doesn't mean we have to forget. In fact, it
is imperative that we remember what Landry stood for, what he
believed in, the way he lived his life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That, more than any building we can name, any monument we can
erect, would be the perfect way to honor his life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like a stone tossed into the middle of a pond, Tom Landry
touched so many others, sending ripples through countless lives,
leaving them changed for the better. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ripple Effect,'' in fact, is the title of the Rev. Tom
Wilbanks' sermon this Sunday at the First Presbyterian Church of
Mesquite. So many great stories and anecdotes of Landry taking the
time to reach out and touch someone's life have emerged over the
past week. That's the wonderful legacy he leaves us. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Landry is the stone cast into the pond, sending out waves
that become wider and wider until they lap upon the shore,'' Rev.
Wilbanks said yesterday. ``He reminds me of the apostle Paul
saying, `Stand firm and be steady. Keep busy in the work of the
Lord.' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's what Tom Landry stood for. He left people with
better faith and hope than before they met him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like so many others, Rev. Wilbanks' life was gently touched by
Landry, leaving an indelible memory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was when our daughter Margie was involved in athletics in
school, and she was in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes,'' Rev.
Wilbanks said. ``The night before a big Cowboys playoff game, there
was a large meeting of FCA youth, and Tom Landry was there to talk
to those young people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget that. He said in a newspaper article the
next day that even though it was the night before that big game, he
felt it was important for him to be there because it was an
opportunity to make a positive difference in the lives of young
people. That made such a powerful impression on me and on my
daughter.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was so typical of Landry, who had a different set of
priorities than most coaches. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't relate to success on the football team,'' Rev.
Wilbanks said. ``Yes, that playoff game the next day was important,
but he was there the night before the game anyway. It just
typifies, it seems to me, what his approach was.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as we share our feelings, our emotions and our personal
anecdotes about Landry, there are still those who are turned off by
all the ``hyperbole.'' An e-mailer scolded me the other day for
having the gall to mention Landry and Abraham Lincoln in the same
sentence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No apologies here. True, one man led a country in the most
crucial era in history, and the other simply led a football team.
We all understand the difference. But they shared common traits of
dedication, perseverance, honesty, integrity, character and an
unshakeable belief and faith in God. Both had a tremendous drive to
do the right thing, even when it wasn't necessarily the popular
thing to do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Landry, the writer suggested, would be insulted and embarrassed
by all the slobbering being done on his behalf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Insulted, I don't think so; embarrassed, almost certainly. What
he did for others was not to gain public acclaim. He simply
genuinely cared about his fellow man. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all possessed of great opportunities, great
possibilities,'' Rev. Wilbanks said. ``A few can go into high
places and change the direction of entire nations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We too are part of creating those good and constructive
ripples that make for a better society.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's what Tom Landry spent most of his life trying to tell us.
He did it, not through words, but through positive, powerful
actions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't a stone tossed into a pond. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was a boulder. &QL;

EDITORIAL: FORCED DASH TO A MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Feb. 17:
</P>
<P>
   Perfecting and building a limited national missile defense would
give America added security against future threats from North
Korea, Iran and Iraq. But a weapons system this complex must go
through long and rigorous testing before engineers can be sure it
will reliably shield American cities from enemy missile attack.
Until that standard has been met, a decision to begin construction
of the proposed $27 billion missile system would be premature, and
not worth the risk of imperiling nuclear arms control treaties with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, the Clinton administration still hopes to make a
decision on construction this summer, a timetable it set early last
year in response to intense Republican pressure. That schedule is
unrealistic. The last two tests of the prototype missile
interceptor revealed significant problems. Only one more test
remains, in May, before the Pentagon is supposed to decide whether
the system is technologically ready. Even if that test fully
succeeds, it will not provide enough information to go ahead.
Several successful tests, including some against dummy warheads
equipped with sophisticated decoys, are needed to determine whether
the system is dependable.
</P>
<P>
   This week a report by the Defense Department's director of
testing and evaluation, Philip E. Coyle III, complained that
Clinton's ``artificial'' timetable ignored major technical problems
and put the Pentagon under unnecessary pressure to reach an early
and possibly flawed decision. Similar calls for a more informed
decision-making process come from Sens. Chuck Hagel and Gordon
Smith, both Republican supporters of missile defense, and from
Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   The White House should heed their advice. North Korea's recent
advances in missile technology call for some urgency. But the right
course is to allow another 6 to 12 months of testing to make sure
the system is effective. Too often weapons systems have been pushed
into production without adequate testing and incorporating mistakes
that must later be fixed at enormous expense.
</P>
<P>
   Other considerations also argue for delay. America's security
would not be enhanced if building a national missile defense led to
the unraveling of major arms control treaties with Moscow, as it
now threatens to do. Such consequences could be avoided if
Washington persuades Russia to modify the 1972 Antiballistic
Missile Treaty to permit limited defensive systems. There is a
reasonable chance that Russia would reconsider its objections after
its presidential elections next month. Even if there is a
negotiating breakthrough this spring, it will take time to win
legislative approval in both countries. By putting off his decision
on construction, Clinton would leave more time for this to take
place.
</P>
<P>
   If no agreement is reached on the ABM treaty, a decision to
begin construction this summer would require Washington to give
formal notice in November that it is withdrawing from the treaty. A
decision of that magnitude requires far more consideration and
national debate than it is likely to receive in the final weeks of
the Clinton presidency. We find it hard to believe that Clinton,
who has worked to reduce nuclear arsenals, would want to dismantle
a central arms control treaty in his last days in office. He should
move now to delay the entire missile defense timetable until a more
careful decision can be made.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former executive of the Bank of New York and her
husband told a federal judge Wednesday that they had helped a group
of small but politically connected Russian banks create an
elaborate money laundering scheme to move billions of dollars
illegally out of Russia through the U.S. bank.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 18 months of investigation, federal authorities
delivered Lucy Edwards, a former Bank of New York vice president,
and her husband, Peter Berlin, to U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
They described how between 1996 and last year, more than $7 billion
left Russia illegally and flowed into a network of front company
accounts at the Bank of New York that were controlled by Berlin.
From there, the funds were transferred to offshore accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The network, Edwards and her husband said, was designed by
Russian bankers to whisk funds electronically between Russia and
the United States for three broad purposes: to evade Russian taxes
on money from legitimate business transactions, to avoid Russian
customs duties on imports and to ``wash'' the profits of outright
criminal enterprises through legitimate banks, including a $300,000
ransom payment in 1998 to the kidnappers of a businessman in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who said they were paid nearly $2 million for their
services, said the scheme allowed Russian bankers to conduct
illegal banking activities in the United States that circumvented
the scrutiny of federal banking regulators and law enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I closed my eyes to that fact,'' said Edwards, who worked in
the Eastern European division of the Bank of New York. She said she
``suspected the accounts were being used by many people for illicit
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple agreed to plead guilty to a series of federal crimes,
which carry up to 10 years in prison and heavy fines, and to
cooperate with investigators in a plea bargain that U.S.
authorities hope will produce more charges. ``More than one or two
people had to turn the other way,'' an investigator said. ``You
don't transfer $7 billion through the spanking new Eastern European
division without somebody knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York, which has not been accused of any
wrongdoing, declined to comment Wednesday. It fired Edwards shortly
after the federal money laundering investigation became public last
August, and has been cooperating with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's remarkable courtroom appearance, the bank's
culpability, and that of its directors and officers, is still not
clear. Federal prosecutors have great discretion in deciding
whether to pursue criminal charges against the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents and the couples' oral confession named several
Moscow banks as part of the illegal scheme. According to previously
unpublicized documents and to Western financiers with direct
knowledge of the banks' affairs, one of the banks, Sobinbank, is
controlled by members of a powerful group of Russian financiers
known as the oligarchs, who own much of Russia's wealth and have
wielded enormous influence within the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The court confessions Wednesday provided the first detailed
public accounts by participants in the money laundering scheme,
which had been under investigation since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, Berlin and three companies controlled by Berlin _
Benex, Bec International, and Lowland _ pleaded guilty to several
charges: laundering money to promote criminal activity and defraud
the Russian government; conducting unlicensed banking operations;
establishing an unauthorized branch of a foreign bank; operating an
illegal money transmitting business; making improper payments to a
bank employee; receiving illegal payments as a bank employee and
laundering those payments abroad; tax evasion; and fraudulently
obtaining visas for Russians to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported on Wednesday that investigators had
evidence that Edwards had bribed one of her superiors at the bank.
No such evidence emerged in court Wednesday, though the documents
released yesterday charged that there were ``corrupt payments to
members'' of the bank's Eastern European division.

 NEW YORK: European division.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Appearing calm and rested, and smiling occasionally at one
another and their lawyers, Edwards and Berlin described the origins
and purpose of the money laundering operation during a court
appearance that lasted slightly more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a small, well-groomed woman who spoke with a soft
Russian accent, said she was first approached in late 1995 by
representatives of DKB, a Russian bank whose full name is
Depozitarno-Kliringovy Bank, who were interested in using the Bank
of New York's offices and technology to illegally move funds out of
Russia. During the following years, the 41 year-old Edwards said,
those activities came to include money laundering and the other
schemes to which she pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Russian banking during the 1990s has been a notoriously
freewheeling affair, with allegations of extensive involvement in
the banks by organized criminals. Edwards noted in her testimony
that DKB's Moscow employees told her in 1998 that they were afraid
to leave the bank's headquarters because ``customers with machine
guns were waiting for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The ransom money referred to in court Wednesday relates to a
1998 request by the Russian government for the FBI's help in a
kidnapping case. The ransom, it turned out, moved through a Benex
account at the Bank of New York on its way to Russian organized
crime figures, prompting the bureau to open its own inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bank of New York earned relatively small profits
from its business in Russia, its aggressive pursuit of clients
there held out the promise of potentially lucrative future deals.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin, 45, testified that Benex, Becs and Lowland all had
accounts at the Bank of New York that he had opened on behalf of
his overseers in Moscow. He said that the companies were staffed by
DKB employees and that Edwards helped install Bank of New York
computer software in the Forest Hills, Queens, office of a Benex
affiliate to allow funds to be moved electronically.
</P>
<P>
   The couple said that DKB representatives told them in fall 1998
that they had acquired control of another bank, Commercial Flamingo
Bank, and wanted a new company created to move funds from that bank
through the Bank of New York. Berlin opened Lowland in Jersey City,
N.J., for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   According to a series of confidential financial audits, a Moscow
bank controlled by Alexander Smolensky, SBS-Agro, owned sizable
stakes in both Sobinbank and Flamingo Bank.
</P>
<P>
   One of the audits, conducted in 1997 by the accounting firm
Arthur Andersen &AMP; Co., with the cooperation of SBS-Agro's
management, found that the purpose of SBS-Agro's investment in
Flamingo Bank was ``the possible purchase of its business in the
future.'' It could not be determined whether SBS-Agro ever acted on
that goal. A 1998 audit of SBS-Agro by Arthur Andersen notes that
the bank's 20 percent stake in Sobinbank amounted to ``control or
significant influence'' over Sobinbank's activities.
</P>
<P>
   SBS-Agro, which largely collapsed during the Russian economic
crisis in 1998, was part of a financial and oil empire controlled
by Smolensky; Boris Berezovsky, a prominent Russian financier with
long ties to former President Boris Yeltsin; and Roman Abramovich.
The three financiers did not respond to repeated interview requests
over the last few weeks. Neither SBS-Agro nor any of the three
financiers were mentioned by Edwards or her husband, or in the
court documents filed by federal investigators Wednesday. There is
no evidence of any involvement by them in the Bank of New York
activities.
</P>
<P>
   For their cooperation with their handlers in Moscow, Edwards and
Berlin received $1.8 million, which represented a percentage of the
funds moved through the Benex network. ``We were paid substantial
commissions for doing very little work,'' Edwards noted.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and Berlin said they directed that those funds be
deposited in off-shore bank accounts so they could avoid paying
taxes on the money in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said she had assisted ``hundreds'' of Russians to secure
bogus visas for travel to the United States and that most of them
worked in the Russian banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that after the couple moved to London in 1996,
they paid a Bank of New York employee, Svetlana Kudryavtsev, $500 a
month to make sure the Benex accounts were operating properly.
Kudryavtsev is one of the employees at the bank who is described in
court papers released Wednesday as having taken ``corrupt
payments.'' Kudryavtsev was indicted last month for allegedly lying
to federal investigators about whether she or her husband had
received money or loans from Edwards. Her lawyer could not be
reached for comment Wednesday, but on Monday he described the
charges as unwarranted. The indictment alleges that Kudryavtsev
received about $30,000 from Edwards and Berlin between 1995 and
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and Berlin face a maximum of 10 years in prison for the
charges against them when they appear at a sentencing hearing on
May 3, but it is likely that their cooperation with authorities
will lessen the severity of any punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucy Edwards and Peter Berlin have come voluntarily to New
York from their home in London to accept responsibility for their
part in the illegal transfer of funds through the Bank of New
York,'' T. Barry Kingham, the couple's attorney, said Wednesday in
Manhattan. ``They have cooperated fully with the investigation
being conducted by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office and they
will continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple has surrendered about $1 million to authorities, some
of which was maintained in Swiss bank accounts, and they will be
released from federal custody pending their posting of a $500,000
bail bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's pleas starkly demonstrate the serious dangers of
unlicensed and unregulated entities operating within the American
banking system as cover for money laundering and other criminal
activities,'' said Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan,
in a prepared statement Wednesday. ``Evading and disregarding
American laws in this manner significantly undermines the integrity
of United States and foreign banking systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Schiliro, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New
York office, said that the investigation ``has followed a long,
winding road throughout the United States and abroad'' and that his
agency is ``determined to continue following the complicated trail
of money and banking transactions until all those who have
committed crimes are identified and charged.''

UNIVERSITY'S STUDENTS TO BE POLLED ON INSTRUCTORS' ENGLISH SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ The University of Missouri plans to survey
at least 5,000 of its students next week amid complaints that some
students cannot understand their instructors' English.
</P>
<P>
   University officials are trying to gauge the depth of the
problem at the same time the Missouri General Assembly is
considering bills to toughen English proficiency requirements in
response to student complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Collins, vice president of the University of
Missouri-Kansas City student government association, told a Senate
committee Wednesday that he had so much trouble understanding a
chemistry teacher that he had to communicate through handwritten
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who said he was paying his own college bills, said he
had major problems understanding another instructor, transferred
out of the class and had to pay an extra $100 charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a right to expect my instructors to communicate
effectively,'' said Collins, 21, a junior from Carl Junction, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The committee did not vote on the bill. A similar measure was
heard in a House committee Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Sen. Peter Kinder, a Cape Girardeau Republican, said he
introduced his bill in response to complaints from the Associated
Students of the University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Kinder's proposal requires all colleges and universities to file
papers with the state Coordinating Board for Higher Education that
say instructors whose native language is not English are proficient
in English.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also requires university officials to file annual
reports with lawmakers that spell out steps taken to deal with the
issue and how students can file grievances.
</P>
<P>
   The bill says it is the aim of lawmakers that all professors or
instructors at state schools ``shall be proficient in speaking the
English language so that they may adequately instruct students.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinder said he filed similar legislation in 1996 but dropped the
proposal after George Russell, then president of the university,
assured him that action was being taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell me the problem is worse than ever,'' Kinder said of
University of Missouri students.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen W. Lehmkuhle, vice president for academic affairs for
the university, told the Senate Education Committee that university
policies designed to address the issue, including student
evaluations of instructors, had not worked.
</P>
<P>
   Lehmkuhle told senators that school officials would launch a
Web-based survey next week to students at all four of the
university's campuses.
</P>
<P>
   At least 5,000 students will be asked to spell out any
complaints they have understanding instructors, officials said.
Lehmkuhle said the university expected a response rate of about 50
percent with results available a week after the survey began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is, the statistics will allow us to develop a more
effective policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Missouri Board of Curators also may take up
the issue at its meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Kenney, a Lee's Summit Republican, questioned the
timing of the university's survey, suggesting it was intended to
head off legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Other committee members were clearly sympathetic to the goals of
Kinder's measure.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted House, a St. Charles Democrat and chairman of the
committee, said senators did not want to micromanage university
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this problem has been persistent for a number of years,''
House said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Steve Stoll, a Festus Democrat and committee member, said
he raised the issue with University of Missouri President Manuel
Pacheco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to say the ball has been dropped somewhere along the
line,'' Stoll said.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Duckworth, 20, lobbyist for the Associated Students of
the University of Missouri, told the committee that previous
meetings with university officials had produced minimal results.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is not about diversity,'' Duckworth said. ``It is
about communication between teachers and students.''
</P>
<P>
   /{English-speaking bill is SB875 (Kinder)./}

UNDERSTUDIES GIVE SPARK AS KNICKS STOP WOLVES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Knicks' starters had been chastised the
night before, and even benched, but it wasn't players like Allan
Houston, Patrick Ewing and Latrell Sprewell felt compelled to
respond against the Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   It was the group of Knicks reserves Minnesota coach Flip
Saunders referred to as waste two weeks ago, when he smirked at the
Knicks' effort to send John Wallace, Kurt Thomas and Chris Childs
to the Timberwolves for Terrell Brandon, who led the team.
</P>
<P>
   Waste not, want not? Maybe Saunders had better measure his words
next time because it was players like Thomas, Wallace and Childs
who were more than a supporting cast in a tight fourth quarter and
helped give the Knicks a 93-89 victory at Madison Square Garden
Wednesday night. The victory also restored the self-esteem the
Knicks lost in their dismal display Tuesday night in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks usually fade in the second of a back-to-back games.
But they were faced with an equally worn Timberwolves team, which
arrived in town at 4 a.m. Wednesday after losing to Denver in
overtime Tuesday night. And yet, neither team wanted to give in.
After Thomas, Childs and Wallace helped put the Knicks in position
to win, Ewing, Sprewell and Larry Johnson finished it off.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson rebounded a miss by Houston with 22 seconds left, a play
that led to Sprewell hitting two free throws with 18.5 seconds on
the clock to give the Knicks a 91-87 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the tension was severed. At least that was the thought.
Houston put the drama right back into the game when he continued
his bad habit of missing clutch free throws. He missed two free
throws with 13.1 seconds left and gave the Wolves a chance to tie
the score or win the game. But Sam Mitchell forced a wild runner
over Johnson with 5 seconds on the clock. The rebound was fielded
by Houston, who was instantly fouled. This time, Houston, with 3.9
seconds on the clock, made both.
</P>
<P>
   In a narrow escape, Sprewell led the Knicks with 19 points,
while Thomas added 16 and Childs and Wallace combined for 11. The
Wolves were led by Kevin Garnett's 23 points. The Knicks ended the
game shooting 46.5 percent and allowed the Wolves to do the same.
The difference was in the turnovers: the Wolves had 20, while the
Knicks ended with 15.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks led by six points with 4 minutes 57 seconds left but
celebrated too soon and allowed the Wolves to take an 86-85 lead on
a jumper from Garnett. After a jumper from Sprewell, the Knicks had
a chance at some breathing room. But when Sprewell fed Houston on a
fast break, Houston blew the layup with three minutes left. The
Wolves had a chance to tie the score with 42.8 seconds left.
Houston then gave them a chance to win it in a dramatic finish.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were one night removed from a forgettable effort in
Toronto that ended so badly coach Jeff Van Gundy benched his
starters in the fourth quarter and ripped into them later. He
chastised their effort throughout the game and expressed disgust at
their commitment but was especially upset by their uninspired
defense at the start.
</P>
<P>
   It had become a trend. In 11 of the Knicks' previous 12 games,
the starters had allowed opponents to score 24 or more points in
the first quarter. Often, Houston and Sprewell have been the stars
giving up the most.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, that habit went unbroken as Houston allowed
Malik Sealy to sneak backdoor for two quick layups as the
Timberwolves took a 10-4 lead. Houston's defense was sloppy
throughout the first half, but his other half, Sprewell, became an
early riser. He scored a quick eight points in the first quarter
while the big men were collapsing on Garnett and cutting off the
Timberwolves' All-Star threat.
</P>
<P>
   With that combination, the Knicks took an impressive nine-point
lead midway through the second quarter only to come undone at the
close of the quarter beneath a 19-5 run by the Wolves. The Knicks,
down by 48-43 at the half, looked as stunned as they did in Toronto
when the Raptors crushed their spirits at the end of the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks opened the third in a daze, falling behind by 54-43
when Joe Smith blew by Ewing for a dunk in transition. There were
boos echoing before the Knicks were jarred into showing some
passion.
</P>
<P>
   In a snappy 7-0 run, Ewing made up for his sluggishness by
racing up the floor and fielding a fullcourt pass by Ward for a
dunk with 9:03 left in the third quarter. A possession later, Ewing
completed a three-point play to bring the Knicks within 54-51 with
8:20 left.
</P>
<P>
   But after Sprewell was poked in the eye by Sam Mitchell, and the
Knicks failed on three straight possessions, the Wolves built a
60-51 lead. The Knicks needed their third star to appear. Where was
Houston? He ended an almost invisible by scoring six points in a
two-minute spurt to pull the Knicks within one point.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks tied the score when Houston missed a runner and the
frumpy Thomas, not the most agile player on the floor, leaped for a
put-back dunk with 1.7 seconds on the clock. Two teams exhausted
from playing the night before were reaching down for energy and
were even, 66-66, to start the fourth quarter.

EVEN NOW, PEOPLE TOUCHED BY RIPPLES OF LANDRY'S LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This will be a difficult day. Saying goodbye to an old friend is
like that, and when that old friend is Tom Landry, that makes it
doubly tough.
</P>
<P>
   He has been like a rock in our lives, as solid and dependable as
a mountain, someone we thought would always be there. And yet, most
of us realized that he probably always had a higher calling.
</P>
<P>
   That call has finally come.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we will gather at the church, or at the Myerrson, or sit
alone in front of our television sets to pay our last respects to
someone who was such a central figure in our lives for such a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   But saying goodbye doesn't mean we have to forget. In fact, it
is imperative that we remember what Landry stood for, what he
believed in, the way he lived his life.
</P>
<P>
   That, more than any building we can name, any monument we can
erect, would be the perfect way to honor his life.
</P>
<P>
   Like a stone tossed into the middle of a pond, Tom Landry
touched so many others, sending ripples through countless lives,
leaving them changed for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ripple Effect,'' in fact, is the title of the Rev. Tom
Wilbanks' sermon this Sunday at the First Presbyterian Church of
Mesquite. So many great stories and anecdotes of Landry taking the
time to reach out and touch someone's life have emerged over the
past week. That's the wonderful legacy he leaves us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Landry is the stone cast into the pond, sending out waves
that become wider and wider until they lap upon the shore,'' Rev.
Wilbanks said yesterday. ``He reminds me of the apostle Paul
saying, `Stand firm and be steady. Keep busy in the work of the
Lord.'
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's what Tom Landry stood for. He left people with
better faith and hope than before they met him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so many others, Rev. Wilbanks' life was gently touched by
Landry, leaving an indelible memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was when our daughter Margie was involved in athletics in
school, and she was in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes,'' Rev.
Wilbanks said. ``The night before a big Cowboys playoff game, there
was a large meeting of FCA youth, and Tom Landry was there to talk
to those young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget that. He said in a newspaper article the
next day that even though it was the night before that big game, he
felt it was important for him to be there because it was an
opportunity to make a positive difference in the lives of young
people. That made such a powerful impression on me and on my
daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   It was so typical of Landry, who had a different set of
priorities than most coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't relate to success on the football team,'' Rev.
Wilbanks said. ``Yes, that playoff game the next day was important,
but he was there the night before the game anyway. It just
typifies, it seems to me, what his approach was.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as we share our feelings, our emotions and our personal
anecdotes about Landry, there are still those who are turned off by
all the ``hyperbole.'' An e-mailer scolded me the other day for
having the gall to mention Landry and Abraham Lincoln in the same
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   No apologies here. True, one man led a country in the most
crucial era in history, and the other simply led a football team.
We all understand the difference. But they shared common traits of
dedication, perseverance, honesty, integrity, character and an
unshakeable belief and faith in God. Both had a tremendous drive to
do the right thing, even when it wasn't necessarily the popular
thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Landry, the writer suggested, would be insulted and embarrassed
by all the slobbering being done on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Insulted, I don't think so; embarrassed, almost certainly. What
he did for others was not to gain public acclaim. He simply
genuinely cared about his fellow man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all possessed of great opportunities, great
possibilities,'' Rev. Wilbanks said. ``A few can go into high
places and change the direction of entire nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We too are part of creating those good and constructive
ripples that make for a better society.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Tom Landry spent most of his life trying to tell us.
He did it, not through words, but through positive, powerful
actions.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't a stone tossed into a pond.
</P>
<P>
   He was a boulder. nn

COWBOYS' DEFECTIONS COULD RISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys might now be paying for having the
NFL's ninth-best defense last season, as a second defensive starter
begins to look to greener pastures through unrestricted free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, middle linebacker Randall Godfrey signed a five-year,
$25-million contract, including a $5-million signing bonus, with
the Tennessee Titans, who lost to the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl
XXXIV last month.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cowboys defensive end Kavika Pittman is beginning to shop
himself on the open market. He will visit Denver today, followed by
Atlanta over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey, who led the team in tackles last season, will receive
more than a 1,100 percent raise to live in Nashville, Tenn., and
play for the reigning AFC champion Titans. Last season, Godfrey
played for $429,000, which was the Cowboys' qualifying offer to him
as a restricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the right decision,'' Godfrey said of his defection to
Tennessee. ``I was prepared for this since I've seen so many
linebackers _ Robert Jones, Darrin Smith, Fred Strickland _ leave
Dallas over the years. I think that helped me prepare myself for
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the free-agency game is played, the fast decision is
usually the best decision because each NFL team has only so much
room under its $62.172-million salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman, like Godfrey, is a four-year veteran who has been a
starter for the past two seasons. Defensive coaches praise Pittman
for his work ethic and his ability to do the little things that
don't always show up on the stat sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys want to hold the line on losing defensive starters
when it comes to defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman and free safety
George Teague, both unrestricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cowboys are expected to begin setting up visits
soon by unrestricted free-agent cornerbacks of other teams.

COMPANIES GO ONLINE TO GIVE JOB APPLICANTS QUICKER ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Job applicants hate it when they submit resumes and never hear
back. So along comes an Internet product designed to give quick
yeas or nays in response to applications.
</P>
<P>
   My knee-jerk reaction? Yuck. A rejection untouched by human
hands.
</P>
<P>
   After further thought, my knee didn't jerk far. Any kind of
response _ even a cyber-sent ``We have nothing for you at this
time'' _ is better than no response.
</P>
<P>
   Some background: Internet job-posting sites draw hundreds of
thousands of resumes. It's so easy to apply online that companies
are utterly overwhelmed by volume. They have neither the time nor
the manpower to wade through or respond to all applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Many online job hunters are frustrated. They say they post their
resumes in vain. And there are tales (perhaps apocryphal) of
workers fired when their current employers discovered their
job-hunting evidence online.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I looked at one of the new applicant-screening tools
from Development Dimensions International. The product is
customized and sold to big corporate clients for use on their own
company Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The product allows an applicant to go to a company's Web page,
fill out questionnaires about personal values and qualifications,
learn about the company and submit applications confidentially. The
company-tailored software quickly evaluates submissions and either
rejects candidates or encourages them to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Cosentino, a DDI vice president, admits that a
computerized response ``is not as good as a personal interview.''
But, he said, ``If there are 1,000 people who appear to be
qualified, and this can reduce them to the top 10 candidates
through the Web screening, then the company can focus its interview
time on the best available people.''
</P>
<P>
   I had doubts. What if a great candidate is rejected by a
computer programmed to search for a buzzword he or she doesn't
enter? What if the applicant submits lies? And where does all this
leave the vital face-to-face part of hiring?
</P>
<P>
   I called a DDI corporate client, John Jordan, director of
organization and management development at Bestfoods, who said the
company tried to consider all those questions. It believes it has
safeguards and follow-ups in its new system, which it bought to
help find good candidates worldwide and apply basic hiring
standards in the 62 countries where it operates.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Bank of America, Pfizer and Owens
Corning are among corporate clients using DDI's Web-Screen to
separate the job candidate wheat from chaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's increasing our speed to hire from weeks to days,'' Jordan
said. ``It's helping us find more good candidates in places where
we could never afford to recruit.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Bestfoods Web site, I worked through the initial pages of
screening material for its fast-track management applicants. It
urged me to go on to the next step, but my high school Spanish is
/{muy/} rusty and I'm not qualified for the bilingual jobs they're
offering.
</P>
<P>
   I'll leave it to a real applicant to let me know what you think
of your online screening. Better yet, tell me if you get the job.

EDITORIAL: WORKING AFTER RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Feb. 17:
</P>
<P>
   A proposal in Congress to repeal limits on what Social Security
recipients can earn after retirement is a reasonable move that will
allow people between the ages of 65 and 70 to work without losing
all or part of their Social Security benefits. The idea is popular
with older Americans, and President Clinton endorsed it a year ago.
While piecemeal changes to the Social Security system are rarely a
good idea, this particular proposal is acceptable because it will
have no significant effect on the solvency of the trust fund, and
it can help the elderly who need to supplement their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement earnings limit was created in the 1930s to
encourage older workers to retire and open up jobs for younger
people. Over the years, the limit has been adjusted to allow
retirees to earn more without being penalized. But it remains
cumbersome to administer, confusing to the public and a modest
disincentive to work.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, people between the ages of 65 and 70 lose $1 of their
benefits for every $3 they earn above $17,000 a year. That limit
will be raised to $30,000 in 2002 under present law and would be
eliminated entirely under the bill sponsored by Rep. Sam Johnson,
R-Texas. Roughly 800,000 Social Security recipients have some of
their benefits reduced. The earnings test does not apply to anyone
over 70, nor does it apply to unearned income such as dividends or
private pensions.
</P>
<P>
   After they reach the age of 70, those whose benefits were
reduced can eventually get all the money back in the form of higher
benefits in future years, provided they live long enough. But the
delayed payback is confusing, and many people need their full
benefits immediately upon retirement. Critics also argue that the
earnings limit is unfair to the working elderly since those who
supplement their Social Security checks with income from
investments and pensions are not subject to benefit reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Repealing the earnings test for those 65 and older will raise
Social Security expenditures by about $22.7 billion over the next
10 years. But over time, those costs will be fully offset by
savings since workers will no longer get higher benefits when they
reach 70.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation wisely does not repeal the earnings
test for those who choose to retire early, at age 62. Such a change
might encourage more people to draw Social Security benefits early
at a permanently reduced level. Since that reduction is generally
passed on to widows, ending the earnings test at 62 might lead to
increased poverty among elderly women in the future.

 Low wages contribute to poor quality of Missouri nursing homes
care  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Low wages are driving down the quality of
care at Missouri nursing homes, prompting state officials to
declare an emergency and to seek more funding.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing homes do not pay well enough in a tight labor market to
attract good workers. That has caused the number of facilities
cited for substandard care to triple in the past year, according to
the new director of the state Division of Aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a critical point in trying to serve and protect the
elderly,'' said Richard Dunn, who on Monday became the division's
new director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not take immediate steps to change the direction we
are heading in, hundreds, if not thousands of older Missourians'
health and well-being may be in jeopardy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn and Gary Stangler, director of the Missouri Department of
Social Services, were in Kansas City on Wednesday to draw attention
to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mel Carnahan is asking the Missouri General Assembly for 30
new Division of Aging positions to oversee nursing home operations
and for $11 million in additional state and federal Medicaid funds.
</P>
<P>
   The money would be used to increase the reimbursement rate
nursing homes receive for low-income patients. The increase would
have to be spent on higher wages or training for nursing home
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't keep good staff, they can't get good staff,''
Stangler said in a meeting with the editorial board of The Kansas
City Star. ``Flipping burgers is more attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   One nursing home company with a payroll of 900 positions issued
about 2,000 W-2 tax forms last month because of high employee
turnover, Stangler said.
</P>
<P>
   The labor situation is tied to the current booming economy. But
pressure on nursing homes and state budgets is projected to worsen
as the senior population grows.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, several nursing home chains have filed for
bankruptcy and the federal government is cracking down with fines
on facilities that violate standards of care. But Stangler said
fines only make it more difficult for struggling nursing homes to
improve.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, according to the Department of Social Services:
</P>
<P>
   95 percent of nursing homes receive full annual inspections from
the state and 62 percent are inspected more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   The number of nursing homes cited for failing to meet state
standards has nearly doubled, to 211, in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The number cited for failing to meet federal Medicare and
Medicaid standards has nearly tripled, to 90, in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The number of facilities deemed in immediate jeopardy of losing
funding nearly quadrupled, to 73, in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have coined the term ``roller coaster homes'' for
nursing facilities that are cited for problems, improve briefly and
then slide back below minimum standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next governor is going to have to face this and face it
directly,'' Stangler said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, in his last year of office, recently appointed a task
force to look at staff training and compensation in nursing homes
and make recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 57,000 senior Missourians receive some form of
state-assisted nursing home and at-home care. The nursing home
population has remained stable, at about 42,000 for the last five
years, as more people receive less costly at-home care. But that
has meant that the people who have to be in nursing homes tend to
be sicker and require more costly care.
</P>
<P>
   The labor shortage has strained the supply of qualified at-home
caregivers, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the
poor, pays the bills for two-thirds of Missouri's nursing home
residents. The average daily cost is about $95. Sixty percent of
Medicaid is federal money and 40 percent is from the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 new staff positions requested for the Division of Aging
would join 158 current employees. The additional $11 million sought
for Medicaid patient reimbursement would be a 4 percent increase,
Stangler said.

BLOCK HOPES TO REOPEN ITS TAX-FILING WEB SITE THIS WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ H&AMP;R Block Inc. said Wednesday that it
expected to reopen its new tax-filing Web site for home computer
users this weekend, after its latest software problem is fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Block said the latest glitch, which erroneously caused some
customer tax information to be shared with other filers, affected
``fewer than 10'' online users out of more than 300,000 who have
tried the service since it was launched Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Block has fixed the problem and determined that all the returns
filed through the Web site so far have been filed accurately, said
Linda McDougall, a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The company is now running further tests to make sure the
original problem is out of the system. It hopes to reopen the site
either at the end of business Friday or early Saturday for weekend
filers, McDougall said.
</P>
<P>
   The problems did not affect any traditional tax service
operations at Block's 9,000 tax offices, where 2 million taxpayers
are expected this week, or any online trading and mortgage service
operations also offered through the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Block also closed its online preparation and filing site to home
computer users Feb. 1-3 when more people than expected logged on
and caused the system to slow almost to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Block originally estimated that 650,000 people would use the new
service between its opening and this year's April 17 filing
deadline.

AEROFLEX TO MOVE ITS STOCK LISTING FROM NYSE TO NASDAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Aeroflex Inc., a maker of communications equipment,
will announce on Thursday that it is moving its stock listing from
the New York Stock Exchange to Nasdaq, becoming the first company
to make that move.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gorin, the company's president, confirmed on Wednesday
night that the announcement would be made. ``We are a small-cap,
high-technology company that feels that our interests are best
served by being on the Nasdaq market, with many of our peers,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zarb, the chairman of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, the Nasdaq parent organization, scheduled a
news conference on Thursday to make what the NASD called ``a major
announcement'' regarding a new listing.
</P>
<P>
   While many companies have moved from Nasdaq to the Big Board, a
New York Stock Exchange rule made it all but impossible to move the
other way. But that rule, No. 500, was changed last July, making it
possible for companies to move if their boards determined that was
wise.
</P>
<P>
   Gorin said that ``our treatment on the New York Stock Exchange
has been superb'' and said the specialist who handled the stock had
done a good job. But he said that he thought the company would be
best served by listing on the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   Aeroflex, based in Plainview, N.Y., has been listed on the Big
Board since 1983. It has a market capitalization of $720 million.
Its share price has tripled in the last two weeks, after the
company reported strong earnings for the final quarter of 1999 and
said it expected its sales and earnings to grow during the first
half of this year. On Wednesday, its shares rose $4.625, to $39.25.
</P>
<P>
   While Aeroflex is a small company that has rarely traded more
than 200,000 shares a day until the big run-up of the last two
weeks, when volume has topped a million shares a day, the Nasdaq
market apparently considers it a coup to persuade any NYSE company
to move. &QL;

EDITORIAL: WRONG MAN FOR THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Feb. 17:
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has wisely joined Bill Bradley in calling
on the Senate to reject President Clinton's nomination of Bradley
Smith to the Federal Election Commission. The decision is another
sign that Gore now appreciates the need to reform a campaign
finance system that he and Clinton so brazenly abused in 1996.
Smith, a Republican and a law professor who opposes reasonable
limits on campaign money, is the choice of GOP senators who oppose
reform. Gore should help Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader,
wage a fight to block Smith's confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   A vote to confirm Smith is a vote to perpetuate big-money
politics. Campaign restrictions are only as strong as the FEC's
interest in enforcing them _ an interest Smith plainly lacks. In an
election year in which Washington's failure to end the corrupt
soft-money system has become a rallying cause for John McCain's
presidential campaign, the Senate should not seat someone on the
FEC who questions the need for change. Smith, as Gore aptly noted,
``publicly questions not only the constitutionality of proposed
reform but also the constitutionality of current limitations.''
Smith does not belong on the FEC, and anyone in the Senate who
cares about fashioning a fair and honest system for financing
campaigns should vote against his appointment.

SENATOR LOOKS INTO FEES CHARGED FOR FETAL TISSUE OBTAINED AT
CLINIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pressing another front in the abortion wars, a
senator from New Hampshire is focusing on an Overland Park, Kan.,
clinic where outside companies removed and marketed tissue from
aborted fetuses for medical research.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith, a Republican and strong abortion foe, is asking
the Senate Judiciary Committee in a resolution to hear from four
witnesses, at least three of whom did fetal tissue extraction at a
clinic affiliated with Planned Parenthood of Kansas and
Mid-Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the persons were technicians and one is a pathologist who
worked for companies that had agreements to do tissue work at the
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   It is legal to use fetal tissue for research as long as it is
donated, not sold, by the women. Reasonable charges are allowed for
companies that extract and transfer the tissue to researchers.
Smith wants to find out whether fees are excessive and if
regulations on removal are being followed.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Brownlie, president and chief executive officer of Planned
Parenthood, said the clinic had been compensated solely for
providing the facilities for the tissue work. The clinic, he said,
had no part in any sale of tissue or organs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly support federal statutes and guidelines,''
Brownlie said. ``It is and should remain illegal to sell tissue.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's resolution does not assert that any of the witnesses did
anything illegal or unethical, but it seeks their testimony by
subpoena, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood stopped renting space in its facility for
fetal tissue research a little more than a year ago, Brownlie said.
</P>
<P>
   Fetal tissues, such as skin, liver, kidney and brain cells, are
used in research. The tissue has been helpful in developing
treatments for Parkinson's disease, diabetes, AIDS, vision problems
and other conditions, Brownlie said.
</P>
<P>
   Fetal tissue research has been going on for 40 years, said
Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the
University of Pennsylvania. It is used to study fetal diseases and
can be effective when transplanted into children and adults because
it grows quickly and is less likely than other tissue to be
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents said the practice could be used as an excuse
to prolong pregnancies, because fetuses that are more developed
produce tissue that is more valuable. It also can be profitable,
thus keeping more clinics and doctors in the abortion business,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people need to know about this,'' said Mark
Crutcher, president of Life Dynamics Inc., a Denton, Texas,
anti-abortion organization. ``Regardless of your feelings on
abortion, you would find this reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Crutcher cited a brochure of one company that listed ``fee for
service'' prices, such as $999 for tissue from a brain, $350 from
bone marrow and $125 from a liver. Costs were to include removal
and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any price above the actual cost of retrieval makes it
illegal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although people have come forth with stories about witnessing
illegal sale of fetal tissue, Crutcher said he knew of no one who
had been prosecuted for the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Brownlie said women who received abortions at Planned Parenthood
signed consent forms for the tissue donations and never were
pressured into extending pregnancies. Federal law requires consent
and prohibits medical researchers from having any role in the
timing or method of abortion.

PUSHING AND PULLING FOR AN URBANE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Darien Dash has piled on the gold chains and partied
with Puffy, then put on his three-piece suit for a Rose Garden
briefing with President Clinton on the perils of Internet
illiteracy in black and Hispanic communities.
</P>
<P>
   He has huddled with the secretary of commerce, William Daley,
and communications czars like AT&AMP;T's Michael Armstrong to discuss
``the digital divide'' _ the one where 41 million white Americans
but just 5 million blacks have access to the Internet. Then he has
headed home to Hackensack, N.J., to help bankroll a hip-hop anthem
(``No Pigeons,'' which sold 700,000 copies last year).
</P>
<P>
   He has accepted the post of ``technology chair'' for School
District 5, in Harlem, along with the directive to put a computer
on every desk. The appointment came 10 years after he returned home
from school, a kid himself, to find his father, a methadone addict,
dead of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   At 28, he heads the first-ever publicly traded, black-owned
Internet company, and he's also the happily married head of a
frenetic household that contains three children under the age of 7.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the hats, some of them virtual and some the real
thing, worn by Dash, who is to black American entrepreneurs on the
World Wide Web what Martha Stewart is to the lifestyle scene:
ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   He's an Internet missionary worth millions. Last time he peeked,
his salary was $250,000, and his net worth reached an amount that
leaves him at a loss for the Dale Carnegie eloquence that usually
comes so naturally. ``Um, ah, a lot, about $110 or $115 million,''
he guesses, nearly strangling himself with the earpiece cord for
his car phone, which he wears even when not in his car.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Dash can filter in some Ebonics, the better to keep in
tune with his juvenile audience and rapper acquaintances (he made _
and spent _ $100,000 during his sophomore year of college when he
and a cousin, Damon Dash, teamed up as managers and snagged
inaugural record deals for the rappers Jay-Z and Original Flavor).
But the lawyer-speak that came with his political science degree
from the University of Southern California has been handy in
navigating the boardrooms of mainstream clients like Reader's
Digest, Visa, and Otis Elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Still, according to Dash, whose hipper clients include Queen
Latifah, the heart of his business is delivering something the next
generation of blacks and Hispanics won't successfully negotiate the
21st century without: Internet access and customized content for
minority households, 71 percent of which are Internet-less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thing is, get connected, get plugged in, or get shut
out,'' says the slogan-conscious Dash.
</P>
<P>
   This is how Dash, whose mind moves as fast as his name suggests,
describes the straws that stirred the drink for entrepreneurial
youth, himself included, on the street: ``In the '70s, the game was
pimps and prostitution and hustling, in the '80s the game was
crack, in the '90s the game was sports and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in 2000, the game is technology. That's the new hustle.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we define it,'' he adds, indicating two dozen workers
communing with their computers in a 28th-floor suite just off Wall
Street. Of the 50 or so technicians he employs here and at his New
Jersey office, just two are over 35, and one of those is his
mother, Linda.
</P>
<P>
   ``She watches my back,'' he says. ``And she signs my paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   Last February, in step with Black History Month, his
six-year-old company, DME Interactive Holdings, became the first
publicly traded black-owned Internet entity in a reverse merger
that left Dash with 66 percent of the company's stock. On Monday,
again with a nod to Black History Month, Dash announced a
partnership with America Online, which has taken a minority stake
in DME to start Places of Color, an online service for urban
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL was the vehicle that first put 20 million Americans
online, and we're like the urban version of AOL,'' says Dash.
``We're going after a $700 billion market that's 75 percent
unpenetrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Dash is convinced that his Internet inroads may help his
customers avoid some wrong roads. He says that if he hadn't had a
stepfather _ the Casablanca Records executive Cecil Holmes, who
taught him the value ``of hard work and walking the straight and
narrow'' _ he probably would have been sucked in by the same fast
track that ruined his parents' marriage and eventually killed his
father, Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the space of two weeks when I was 18, my father died, and I
was one of the first ones to find him; my dog died; my stepfather's
house in Paramus burned down; my mother and stepfather separated;
and my girlfriend, the woman who later became my wife, left me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was either going to turn to ice,'' he said, ``or have faith
and make something of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   First came USC, then a Madison Avenue marketing job. He sold a
digitally compressed 30-channel music service, took note of the
company's reluctance to install cable boxes in poor and minority
urban homes, and determined to start a business without those
prejudices. So far, so good. Now, his addiction to technology is
his only problem, and to solve it, he intends to retire at 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, how much money do you need, how many hamburgers can
you eat, how many cars can you drive?'' he asks. ``People say
`you'll never be able to leave this.' I say never say never.''

SENATOR LOOKS INTO FEES CHARGED FOR FETAL TISSUE OBTAINED AT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ...method of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Caplan said he thought it was unethical to charge excessive
amounts of money for fetal research services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tremendous markups in what is charged for fetal
tissue, and that's been true of adult tissue, too,'' Caplan said.
``Prices charged are actually quite breathtaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Caplan said fetal tissue represented a tiny fraction of all
tissue research but was being used to stir alarm in the
anti-abortion sector. He said that didn't mean, however, that the
Senate committee should stay away from the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say, `Let's take a look at this as part of looking at
how we get tissues in this country,' it might be worthwhile,''
Caplan said. ``There's some hanky-panky out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling for loopholes in the law to be closed, Smith told the
Senate last fall, ``Abortion clinics and wholesalers are making a
killing, literally, off the sale of human baby parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Crutcher worked with the Judiciary Committee in finding
witnesses who could testify to the tissue extraction. Smith's
resolution to elicit testimony was on the committee calendar Feb.
10 but held for action until the next meeting.
</P>
<P>
   One of the persons who could be asked to testify is Ross Capps,
an Overland Park area resident.
</P>
<P>
   Capps said he used to be a technician for the Georgia-based
Anatomic Gift Foundation, a nonprofit company that had an agreement
with Planned Parenthood to extract tissue and provide it to
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Capps said he didn't have anything to do with the pricing of the
tissues. He said he was uncomfortable with his work and was willing
to testify about what he witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stance is, abortion is legal, and if they can gain some
beneficial research from the donation of a fetal organ, that's
fine, but I don't want to get involved with it anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony also is being sought from Dean Alberty, listed in the
resolution as living in Lee's Summit, Mo. Alberty could not be
reached for comment, but Capps said he trained Alberty at Anatomic
Gift Foundation as a technician.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bardsley, vice president of Anatomic Gift Foundation,
acknowledged Wednesday that Capps and Alberty had been employees.
Bardsley said the company followed all laws.
</P>
<P>
   Bardsley said, however, that as of Jan. 1 Anatomic Gift got out
of the fetal tissue business because of ``negative campaigning and
innuendo'' by anti-abortion groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can live without it (fetal tissue work), but we couldn't
live with it,'' Bardsley said.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded in 1994, still retrieves adult tissue and
organs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bardsley said his wife and former company executive, Brenda
Bardsley, had told the Judiciary Committee she was willing to
testify voluntarily about fetal tissue work.
</P>
<P>
   The other persons on the list of desired witnesses are Miles
Jones and Rosie Lee Diaz. Jones is licensed as a doctor in Lee's
Summit, according to state medical records. He did not return
several telephone calls to his home and office numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is a pathologist who did some fetal tissue extraction at
the clinic for about 10 weeks in late 1998, Brownlie said.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution lists Diaz as living in San Diego, and it was
unclear whether she had worked at the clinic. She could not be
located for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution seeks to have Alberty, Capps and Diaz submit
testimony and ``any and all documents relating to the sale of fetal
tissue.'' It seeks the same of Jones but also wants documents
related to his medical research business.
</P>
<P>
   At the state level, two Missouri lawmakers have offered bills
that would require disclosure of any fees involved in the
extraction and transport of tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Brownlie said that he didn't object to more disclosure but that
the U.S. Senate resolution and related investigation were grounded
in abortion politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a controversy being entirely fostered by anti-abortion
groups that don't really care about the issue, except that it's a
good political one for them,'' Brownlie said.
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the National Abortion Federation,
whose members include about half of the country's clinics where
abortions are performed, said Crutcher and his organization were
not credible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Dynamics has a long history of disseminating
misinformation and using underhanded tactics,'' Vicki Saporta said.
``There are laws in place that regulate (tissue research), and they
should be adhered to.''
</P>
<P>
   Crutcher said he wasn't surprised by the reaction of abortion
rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is typical of the pro-abortion side,'' Crutcher said.
``When a message comes out they don't like, they shoot the
messenger.''

BLACK BROTHER-SISTER DUO PURSUING OLYMPICS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (rk)

</P>
<P>
   Almost any time he's skiing _ on any slope anywhere _ the
Alaskan downhiller Andre Horton seldom sees another black person on
the mountain. If he does, that other skier is probably the only
other African- American besides himself out there that day. Despite
years of ski racing, the realization still gives Horton pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, that guy must be lonely,'' Horton said in a recent
telephone interview. ``I see him, and I think he must be the only
one there. But then, sometimes I'm the only one there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than letting the numbers bother him, however, Horton
turns reality around. ``It's the position I've been given,'' he
said about his ski-racing career. ``It's a strong position to be
in, because I know I can have a big impact on others.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Horton, and his 17-year-old sister, Suki, are
primed to become the first African-Americans on the U.S. Ski and
Snowboard Team. But for both athletes, who grew up near ski slopes
in Anchorage and are the children of two schoolteachers _ Elsena,
an expert downhill skier who is white, and Garry, who is black _
the dream is still at least a season away.
</P>
<P>
   Both Andre and Suki are being nudged in that direction with
financial and moral support from the National Brotherhood of
Skiers. With a membership of 14,000, the brotherhood is the largest
skier organization in the country for African-Americans. As for how
many black skiers there are in the United States, no one knows. But
the number is apt to be a fraction of the country's estimated 15
million skiers.
</P>
<P>
   Schone Malliet, the Hortons' ski coach and a member of the
brotherhood, has a theory about that. ``While the number of skier
visits is flat over all in the industry,'' Malliet said, ``the
number of African-Americans probably is increasing because the
discretionary income of blacks is increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the brotherhood's intention to prepare a skier for
world-class competition, the Hortons are attending the
brotherhood's racefest this week. Billed as the Pontiac-GMC Annual
Meeting Challenge Cup 2000, the event at Copper Mountain, Colo.,
brings members together for 11 days of racing and slopeside
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   For Suki Horton, an appearance there is no small task. Last Dec.
10, she injured a knee while skiing at Jackson Hole, Wyo. Surgery
and a rehabilitation schedule means that she will not be able to
ski again this season. But she's showing up at Copper anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It was a blow to the young Suki, who at 15, was the first black
to make the skiing and snowboarding development team, the precursor
to the full ski team. It was a milestone that gave her as good a
chance as anyone to become the first black Olympic skier from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   And so why is it that no African- Americans have made the ski
team? ``TV really influences us,'' Suki said. ``Yet kids in the
city never even see skiing. Beyond that, not many blacks are living
in resort areas because they don't want to be that one black skiing
down the mountain. But it has to start somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting a black American on the U.S. Ski Team may be on the
horizon. But how soon it comes about is another question. Skier
rankings are important, but so far, neither of the Hortons have
enough points to make the grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked with the National Brotherhood, and we're trying
to move that along,'' Tom Kelly, spokesman for the skiing and
snowboarding group in Park City, Utah, said recently. ``A number of
skiers have come close. Andre and Suki are particularly notable,
and we hope that will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre is racing with a western regional team this year. Last
month, he was first and second in two downhill races at the Doug
Smith Memorial in Big Mountain, Mont. He figures that if he can be
among the top five in at least three events this season in the
Super Series, part of the North American circuit, he can qualify
for the U.S. Development Team next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I make the national team, hopefully it will be with a low
profile,'' he said. ``It wouldn't be like being a Tiger Woods with
all the national attention. But I would like to be a role model.
I'm up for the task, even though I know it won't be easy.''

SCORE ANOTHER HIT FOR BIZARRE TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (DELETES spaces in web site in 8th graf; CORRECTS to ``National
Organization for Women'' in 9th graf)

<P>
   The mystery man sits in the shadows. The prospective brides
stand on a stage in wedding gowns, waiting for the proposal. And
every moment the suspense builds _ and so do the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   It took place Tuesday night, with a special on the Fox Network
called ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?,'' the latest
offbeat real-life format to shake up a network television season
that is already one of the zaniest in memory.
</P>
<P>
   The entire landscape of network television was changed by the
success of ABC's game show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and
Fox's Tuesday night show this week proved that variations on that
theme can reach similar ratings heights.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's two-hour special featured a parade of would-be brides
competing to be chosen by a multi-millionaire, and it culminated in
an on-the-air wedding presided over by a Nevada judge. Drawing
stunning ratings, it attracted more young viewers _ especially
female viewers _ than even the ABC's ``Millionaire'' show.
</P>
<P>
   The show's audience built strikingly through the night, as it
edged toward the actual wedding, growing from 10 million viewers in
its first half hour to 12.3 million in the second half hour to 18.9
million in the third half hour to a huge 22.8 million in the final
half hour.
</P>
<P>
   That final figure would have put the special among the top six
shows in all television, if it had been aired last week. The
ratings were even bigger among teen-age girls and young women. In
its final half hour, the show pulled in more than a third of all
women under the age of 35 watching television Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   One widespread reaction to the show's format was revulsion _ the
kind that apparently helps, not hurts ratings _ that women had
signed on to marry themselves off to an unknown man on a television
show.
</P>
<P>
   Women around the country discussed the show animatedly
Wednesday, some complaining that it reinforced stereotypes of women
desperate to be married, others clearly taken with the show's
fantasy element. The Fox website (whowantstomarry.com) was so
flooded with requests from women to be on the next edition of ``Who
Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire'' that it crashed Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took something like this to make the Miss America pageant
look good to me,'' Patricia Ireland, president of the National
Organization for Women said in an interview Wednesday night. ``At
least with the Miss America pageant you get scholarship money and
the guarantee of a year-long run. It perpetuates some very limited
stereotypes that men are success objects and women are sex
objects.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Darnell, the Fox executive who created the show,
defended the concept, saying that he planned to do another show
``the other way around,'' with a female millionaire choosing a
husband.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If you looked at these people at the end of the
show, you could tell it was less about the money, than it was about
the relationship. It'll either go on, or it won't. If they don't
get along, it won't work no matter how much money is involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The special, which aired during the February sweeps period,
became the latest example of network television reaching beyond
fictional drama and comedies for entertainment. Beyond the batch of
game shows, initiated by the success of ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' the networks have been lining up shows that reach
into real-life activities not usually meant to take place on
camera.
</P>
<P>
   CBS already has scheduled two shows for the summer that will
feature real people living together in enforced situations, one in
a house where every move they make will be on-camera, the other on
a desert island off Borneo. Both also involve big prize money for
the last surviving contestant.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell is known in television for creating such Fox specials as
``When Good Pets Go Bad'' and ``When Animals Attack.'' Last year
one of his programming ideas was a live show in which a 747 would
crash in the desert, an idea that top Fox executives made a point
of publicly disavowing.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Darnell was asked to create specials that avoided all
violence. His first idea was the marriage special. He acknowledged
that his concept had been to bring together the formats of the Miss
America pageant, ``The Dating Game'' and ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I thought it would be a little clever special,'' Darnell
said. ``The ratings and reactions to this are just stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   The show was promoted no more heavily than the average Fox
special. Probably because viewers starting to calling friends, the
audience built each half hour, receiving its biggest boost after
one hour, when ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' ended. For
the next hour, ``Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?'' was the most
popular show on television.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell said more than a thousand women signed up for Tuesday's
show, a number that was pared down, through interviews, to the 50
contestants in the pageant, which was taped in Las Vegas last week.
The format included parades in evening gowns and beach wear, and
extensive interview segments where the women described their
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The multi-millionaire, shown only in shadow, then pared the
group down to 10, with the help of a panel made up of his friends
and family. The 10 semifinalists went through further interview
sessions to bring the number down to five finalists. The
contestants then appeared in wedding gowns. The multi-millionaire
made his choice, kneeling to propose. The wedding, officiated by a
Nevada judge, followed.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives said the contestants had all undergone
appropriate health tests. They said that a ``standard pre-nuptual
agreement'' was signed, but they would not be specific about its
contents. From the show, the winner received _ in addition to the
husband _ a two-week vacation (the honeymoon), an Isuzu Trooper
automobile and a $35,000 diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives said the couple went off to the Caribbean, but
they would not disclose where. The details of their relationship
will be up to them, Darnell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is they are taking it very slow, trying to
find out what their relationship will really be,'' Darnell said.
</P>
<P>
   The bride turned out to be Darva Conger, a 34-year-old emergency
room nurse from Santa Monica, Calif., who had also served in the
Gulf War. The lucky _ and rich _ man was Rick Rockwell, 42,
described on the show as a real estate developer and motivational
speaker who came to California after college to be a stand-up
comic. Darnell said Fox had throughly researched his financial
status, and he does, in fact, have assets worth many millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's entertainment division said Wednesday that it is not yet
ready to announce a second edition of the special. But Darnell said
that given the success of this one, more can be expected. Fox will
repeat an edited, one-hour version of this special next Tuesday
night at 8, for all those who missed it the first time. And, as
Darnell said, sometime in the future it will be done the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he believed there was such willingness on the part of
both single women and a single millionaire to take part in a
produced, taped and edited blessed event, Darnell said, ``Obviously
it's hard to meet people.''
