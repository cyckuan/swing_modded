<HEADLINE> More Burundi Refugee Flow Into Zaire, Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) reported today that some 4,400 Burundi
refugees have arrived in Zaire and Rwanda since last weekend,
fleeing the ethnic clashes in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
The refugees, most of them Hutus, were from Cibitoke area where
three delegates of the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC)
were killed last month in an ambush, UNHCR spokesperson Ron
Redmond told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The refugees said their homes were burned and relatives killed
in the ethnic clashes.
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 of them stayed now in the southwestern Rwandan town
of Bujarama. They said they wanted to go to Zaire, but could not
afford the approximately three U.S. dollar charge for crossing the
river between Zaire and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Among them were 150 children without the company of adults, with
four children being wounded by gun fires and one of them died later
of measles.
</P>
<P>
According to Redmond, the Zairean-Burundi border was officially
closed and the refugees were being registered at the transit
office in Bujarama. They were urged to go back to Cibitoke and
were told that the southwestern Rwandan town was unsafe because of
recent attacks.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR field officers were discussing with Rwandan authorities
moving these refugees to safer places inside Rwanda, away from the
border.
</P>
<P>
In Cibitoke, where refugees said clashes were continuing, no
relief agency had worked since the killing of the ICRC delegates.
</P>
<P>
In eastern Zaire, about 1,400 Burundi refugees have arrived in
Uvira region over the weekend, and 500 more on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNHCR spokesperson, about 85 percent of these
people were women and children.
</P>
<P>
They were on top of some 1,400 Burundi refugees arriving there
over 10 days before the last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Redmond said that there were 223,000 Burundi refugees currently
in neighboring states. Some 120,000 were in Uvira area, and the
rest in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He added that the weekend refugee influx into Rwanda was the
first since the new government took over in july 1994. Before it,
only about 2,500 Burundi refugees were in Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Deplores Japanese Lawmaker's Remarks on Comfort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Foreign Ministry
today expressed deep regret about the absurd remarks made by
Japanese lawmaker Seisuke Okuno that comfort houses were not run
by the Japanese military, but by businessmen during the World War
II.
</P>
<P>
Okuno claimed on June 29 that the sex slaves were engaging in
"commercial activity" and weren't forced to serve in military
brothels during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
Okuno's remarks are glossing over and distorting the essence of
the issue, and are "anachronistic," a foreign ministry official
said.
</P>
<P>
The official criticized the Japanese Lower House member's
repeated blunders, saying that they can no longer be overlooked
since they are trampling on the pride of the Korean people,
especially the victims. He said that Japanese history textbooks
are acknowledging that the Japanese military coercion was used to
mobilize the comfort women.
</P>
<P>
Historians say that as many as 200,000 women, mostly Koreans,
were recruited as "comfort women" -- a euphemism for sex slaves -
for the Japanese imperial army as it swept through East and
Southeast Asia in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 until
Japan's World War II defeat in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The official construed Okuno's remarks to be lamentable attempt
to discourage efforts to establish more friendly ties to
successfully co-host the 2002 World Cup Soccer finals.
</P>
<P>
On May 31, the International Football Federation decided in
Zurich, Switzerland, that South Korea and Japan will jointly host
the World Cup football finals in 2002.

<HEADLINE> China to Upgrade Ties with Uzbekistan, Says Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TASHKENT, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today the Chinese government is willing to work together with the
Uzbek government and make unremitting efforts to upgrade the friendly
and cooperative ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At a banquet hosted by Uzbek President Islam Karimov, Jiang said
"the moment we set foot on your beautiful country, we were impressed
by your friendly feelings toward the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
China is pleased to see that Uzbekistan has made great
achievements in maintaining social stability, developing national
economy and expanding exchanges with neighboring countries, as
well as other countries in the world, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Two thousand years ago, the ancient 'Silk Road' joined our two
countries closely together; since the establishment of diplomatic
ties, we have deepened our mutual understanding and friendship and
expanded our exchanges and cooperation," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
He said both China and Uzbekistan, which are concentrating on
building their own countries, desire for a long-term stable
international environment and equal and mutually-beneficial
cooperation and good-neighborly relationship.
</P>
<P>
He wished Uzbekistan stability, prosperity and happiness.
</P>
<P>
Karimov said Uzbekistan and China had once been the two important
centers on the great "Silk Road," and today "we are making joint
efforts to revive this important passageway linking the east and
west."
</P>
<P>
He said Uzbekistan aims at building itself into a prosperous
country with a developed market economy, democracy and law and
order.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, his five-year-old republic is eager to
safeguard and consolidate regional peace and stability, protect
civil and ethnic harmony, and strengthen national independence and
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He said the foundation for Uzbek-Chinese economic and trade
cooperation has already been laid and at present both sides should
"be more determined to explore for new fields in which the
existing potential can be tapped more effectively."
</P>
<P>
He said that President Jiang's current visit would be helpful
in turning the great potential in bilateral economic relations
into reality.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President arrived here today to begin a two-day
state visit to the country.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Offters Tyson 46 million Dollars for a Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Lennox Lewis on Tuesday
offered World Boxing Council (WBC) heavyweight champion Mike
Tyson 30 million pounds ($46.6 million) for a title fight.
</P>
<P>
Lewis's manager Frank Maloney wasted no time in pledging the
money after Tyson said he was willing to meet the British former
WBC champion, according to a report from Reuter.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's WBC title, won from Briton Frank Bruno in March,
will not be at stake when the American fights Bruce Seldon in
Las Vegas on July 13.
</P>
<P>
It follows a court ruling prohibiting him from putting his
crown on the line against anyone other than Lewis.
</P>
<P>
As he chose to meet WBA title-holder Seldon, Tyson was told
to vacate his WBC crown on July 15.
</P>
<P>
But in a further complication to the heavyweight division
merry-go-round, Maloney said Lewis was prepared to let Tyson
keep his belt rather than that they should fight each other for
a vacated title, Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who has lost just once in 45 fights, said on Monday
he was prepared to face Lewis, the number one WBC contender.
</P>
<P>
"I hear he's saying everyone is afraid of him. Well, Mike
Tyson is not afraid of him. I'm not afraid of anyone. Bring him
on," Tyson said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Punjab provincial
government will spend 1.6 billion rupees (45.7 million US dollars)
on irrigation development projects during the fiscal year of July
1996-June 1997.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by the Punjab Minister for Irrigation Maqsood
Leghari when talking to members of the provincial assembly today
in Lahore, metropolis of Punjab, said the Association Press of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that this amount is three times more than the
previous year's budgetary allocations for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
The major chunk of this amount, 1.29 billion rupees (36.9
million dollars) received from foreign donors, will be spent on
irrigation development schemes in the far flung areas of the
province, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The resources will also be spent on various projects, including
the improvement and maintenance of irrigation system, drainage
schemes, small dams, flood control arrangements, survey and
research and new development schemes, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said that 100 million rupees (2.86 million dollars)
will be spent on the remodeling of Thal canal during 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
The capacity of the canal will increase to 9,000 cusecs after
completion of the project, benefiting farmers on an area of over
two million acres of land.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed the hope that completion of these
projects will enhance agricultural production and thus will be a
great stride forward towards agricultural self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
Punjab is the most important crops producing province in
Pakistan, whose 25 percent of the Gross Domestic Product comes

MOSCOW, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has
reiterated his opposition to NATO's expansion to take in the three
Baltic countries.
</P>
<P>
His condemnation follows a visit by the presidents of Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia to the United States and Italy last week,
Mikhail Demurin, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said today.
</P>
<P>
It is absolutely unacceptable for Russia to allow Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia to join NATO, Yeltsin said in a letter

</P>
<P>
Any step by the three countries to seek NATO membership
is considered a direct provocation to the national security
of Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has strongly opposed NATO's plans to adopt its
former Warsaw Pact allies in Central and Eastern Europe as full
members of the military alliance, although no exact timetable for
accepting new members has been laid out.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials have said that NATO's Partnership for Peace
program, which offers special relations for former Soviet Bloc
countries without granting them full NATO membership, was the
maximum level of integration Moscow could accept.

Dassault-Aerospatiale or Aerospatiale-Dassault -- will put
together all their assembly lines that produce the Ariane rockets,
the Falcon commercial planes, the Aerospatiale helicopters, the
Airbus and ATR aircraft, the Dassault combat aircraft, the
Aerospatiale satellites and the Aerospatiale missiles.
</P>
<P>
A French Defense Ministry source said, "The objective of the
government is that the general plan of the merger could be
finalized in autumn, so that the precise modalities (of the
merger) could be fixed before January 1, 1997."
</P>
<P>
At the Dassault, however, the interpretation of the calendar is
a little different. Dassault officials said that they would spend
six months studying the conditions for the bringing together of
the two in best conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Then, we will see the time that is needed for the real
procedures of coming-together,"said a Dassault source.
</P>
<P>
According to the government communique issued in coordination
with the Dassault, the state will maintain control over the
majority of the shares of the new group, but the state will also
fully consider the interests of private participants in the
airspace industry.
</P>
<P>
Details of the percentage of shares to be controlled by the
Dassault family remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac fixed the aim for the merger of the
two giants in February: to build one of the world's strongest
airspace industrial enterprises. He ordered the two companies to
finalize a framework for the merger by June 30.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Russia to Jointly Celebrate Navy Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian and Russian naval leaders
have decided today to jointly celebrate the 300th anniversary of
the founding of the Russian Navy to further cooperation between
the two navies.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which was made in accordance with an appeal
issued by the port city of Sevastopol, the Ukrainian Navy and
Russian Black Sea Fleet, also won support from the Ukrainian
president Leonid Kuchma and the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
According to a protocol signed today by Ukrainian Deputy
Defense Minister and Naval Commander, Vladimir Beskorovainy,
Commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, Victor Kravchenko, and
Victor Seyeonov, mayor of Sevastopol where the fleet is now
anchored, the two navies will carry out a series of activities to
mark the occasion from July to October.
</P>
<P>
This decision is believed to demonstrate the respect of the
military to the glorious past of the two peoples, and to enhance
friendship, cooperation and exchanges between the two navies, the
Independent News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that Ukraine and Russia have basically resolved
their dispute over the division of the Black Sea Fleet after
Ukraine won its independence from Russia.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Foreign Minister Visits Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan is always paying a great deal of
attention to the development of Ukraine and would like to support
its reform in both political and economic fields, visiting
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda said today.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda, who arrived here Sunday after attending the Group of
Seven (G-7) industrialized nations conference in Lyon, France, is
the first senior Japanese official ever visiting Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day visit, the foreign minister declared a
technical aid project worth five million U.S. dollars to help
development in Ukraine's electronics and telecommunications
sectors.
</P>
<P>
He also assured the Ukrainean side of the loan of 200 million
U.S. dollars that the Export-Import Bank of Japan provided under
an agreement signed by Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma with the
Japanese leaders when Kuchma visited Japan in March last year.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said his country welcomes Japan's investment. He added
that Ukraine's new constitution encourages all kinds of foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda also told Kuchma that the just-concluded G-7 summit
highly praised Ukraine for having shipped all its nuclear warheads
to neighboring Russia early in June.
</P>
<P>
Japan would like to help Ukraine further destroy its nuclear
infrastructure, he said.
</P>
<P>
When talking about the Chernobyl nuclear plant, site of the
world's worst nuclear accident in 1986, Ikeda said the G-7
appreciates Ukraine's decision to close down the station
completely by the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under great pressure from the international community, Ukraine
made the decision early 1995 in exchange for at least three
billion dollars in aid from the West.
</P>
<P>
But Kuchma told Ikeda that the delays by the G-7 in providing
the agreed aid might make Ukraine re-consider the timetable for
shutting down of the nuclear plant.

On Sunday, in the Pagoda of Chanteloup, the knights wearing
battle dresses, which weigh 75 kilograms each and consist of
swords, helms, boots and coat of mail, will join a contest to

<HEADLINE> France Remains "Vigilant" After Karadzic's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- France remains "vigilant" after
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's announcement of his
resignation Sunday and the French government wants the resignation
to be "full, complete and final," said a spokesman of the French
Foreign Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Jacques Rummelhardt, said that the announcement
of resignation by Karadzic is "an important step, under the
condition that it is in fact followed" by action.
</P>
<P>
He said that since Karadzic remains the head of the ruling
party in the Serb-controlled area of Bosnia, France will remain
vigilant and "judge on evidence."
</P>
<P>
Karadzic announced his resignation and handed over his power as
"president of Republika Srpska" to Biljana Plavsic after both the
international community and the Yugoslav Federation had urged his
resignation. But he will run for presidency in the presidential
election of Bosnia-Herzegovina scheduled for September.
</P>
<P>
On the elections in the Bosnian city of Mostar which is divided
between the Muslims and Croats, Rummelhardt said that the
elections should "rapidly" lead to the establishment of a
reunified municipality in Mostar.
</P>
<P>
"At all events, the prolonging of the mission of the European
Union in Mostar remains subordinated to the continuation of the
process of reunification of the city," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary results of the local elections in
Mostar published Monday, two big nationalist parties representing
Muslim and Croat hardliners led in the elections, which aroused
fear that the division of the city would be reinforced.

"Urgent conservation measures were needed to protect North Sea
herring," a EC spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The quantities of mature herring in the stock are at present
about half the minimum level advised by scientists and intensity
of the fishery on both adults and juveniles is far too high," the
EC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The measures were agreed with Norway, which is not a member of
the 15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
In the North Sea, the total allowable catch has been decreased
to 156,000 tons from 313,000 tons, the EC said. In the Skagerrak
and Kattegat it has been cut to 90,000 tons from 120,000.
</P>
<P>
In response to strong concern from the Dutch fishing industry,
the EC may open an extra duty-free herring import quota and
provide temporary compensation from existing resources for
fishermen hit by the cut.
</P>
<P>
The EC will also monitor industrial fishing for sprats to check
the impact on young herring stocks.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Economy Improves, Reports Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's overall economic
performance was better in 1995 than that of the previous year but
the problems hindering the economic growth still exist.
</P>
<P>
These are the essence of the 1995 annual reports of the
Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Nigeria Deposit Insurance
Corporation (NDIC), the two regulators of the country's financial
system.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria's overal economic conditions improved slightly in
1995 following a small increase in the growth rate of real gross
domestic product (GDP) as well as the improved level of the
macro-economic stability arising from reduced fiscal and monetary
expansion and a measure of exchange rate stability," says the CBN
report, which was obtained today.
</P>
<P>
In its own report, NDIC says, "the general performance of the
Nigerian economy in 1995 was better than what obtained in 1994.
The improved performance resulted from the relative
macro-economic stability brought about by tight liquidity
management strategy and from improved fiscal operations of
government."
</P>
<P>
"In spite of some relative success in the performance of the
economy, some major economic problems that had bedevilled the
nation in the past few years still persisted," the INIC report
admits.
</P>
<P>
Such problems, highlighted in the reports, include high rate
of inflation, low capacity utilization and industrial output, the
poor value of the local currency and distress in the banking
sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the CBN, the inflation abated in the second half
of last year, but settled at a rate that was still higher than
its level in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Both both CBN and NDIC expressed concern over the high rate of
inflation which they put at about 72.8 percent by the end of
1995, compared with 57.0 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Although the Naira, the local currency, gained some measure of
stability, it stabilized at relatively depreciated level of
between 82-85 Naira to one U.S. Dollar last year, the central
bank source said.
</P>
<P>
The rate was officially fixed at 22 Naira to one Dollar in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, distress in the financial sector continued in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank, there were 51 distressed banks
last year, compared with 42 in 1994. NDIC said the number of
distressed banks increased from 55 to 60.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 100 bank executives were arrested and
they are now facing the charges of fraud and forgeries, the
sources say.
</P>
<P>
The country's external position weakened further in 1995. The
country's overall balance of payments deficit increased from
42.62 billion Naira in 1994 to 195 billion Naira, the reports
say.
</P>
<P>
This, according to the central bank, was due to the increase
in the imports of goods and services required to bridge supply
shortage as well as finance a higher level of economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's aggregate exports, however, rose to 748 billion
Naira, indicating an increase of 263.3 percent over the 206
billion Naira level in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Oil export was largely responsible for the rise, the central
bank report says.

<HEADLINE> Israeli New Government Approves Massive Budgetary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli new government today
approved a proposal to cut about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars from
next year's budget despite a strong warning of more strikes by
the workers.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet passed the proposal by a 12-5 vote, which called
for a cut of 4.9 billion shekels (1.5 billion dollars) from next
year's budget and a gradual reduction of deficit.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, put forward by Finance Minister Dan Meridor,
proposed a budget deficit of 2.8 percent of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) next year, which would be gradually reduced to 1.5
percent in the year of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Meridor passed the first major test as he gained support from
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his chief economic adviser
Jacob Frenkel, also Governor of Bank of Israel, despite strong
opposition from the five ministers, including Foreign Minister
David Levy and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
Because the proposal did not include new taxes, it means the
budgetary cuts will have to come from the ministries. The cabinet
will meet Sunday again to finalize the details of the new economic
program.
</P>
<P>
Meridor is to present a formal proposal to the cabinet by
August. As the exact proportion of cut for every ministry has yet
to be worked out, intense inner-fighting among the ministries is
expected.
</P>
<P>
The budgetary cuts, which are expected to affect the weaker
section of the society, immediately aroused strong protests
today.
</P>
<P>
Former Environment Minister and Meretz MP Yossi Sarid accused
the government of failing to live up to its promises to protect
the interests of the lower income-earners by cutting budgets in
health and social welfare services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of Histadrut (Israel's Trade Union)
Amir Peretz called for "a long battle" to fight the government's
new economic plans, which he criticized for hurting the
workers and weaker section of society.
</P>
<P>
Peretz, who discussed the budgetary cuts and privatization
with Netanyahu Monday, said he planned to meet Meridor Wednesday
to demand the government to honor the signed agreements on wages,
pension and cost-of-living increment.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut Monday called a one-hour warning strike, which
involved 400,000 workers across the country, to protest against the
government's plans to cut the budget and accelerate privatization
of state companies.
</P>
<P>
The government predicted the budget deficit to reach about 5.5
billion shekels (about 1.7 billion dollars) in the first half of
this year, pointing to an annual inflation rate of 14 percent,
much higher than last year's 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Israel had reported a significant sign of
an impending economic slowdown as the index of integrated
indicators declined in May by 0.7 percent, the first time in the
past three years.

<HEADLINE> Criminal Attacks on Computers Costly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Criminal attacks on computers are
costing businesses and consumers billions of U.S. dollars each
year, yet most victims aren't even bothering to report the losses.
</P>
<P>
The USA Today reported that instead of resorting to law
enforcement, companies are taking matters into their own hands,
hiring security firms to protect their computer systems.
</P>
<P>
The major reason for that is that they fear of losing consumer
confidence, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"People just aren't talking about it," said Mac Hicks, vice
president for information security at Bank of America. "It's like
the battered child syndrome we had for years where no one would
discuss it."
</P>
<P>
The types of illegal computer activity range from 10 million
U.S. dollars spirited out of Citibank in 1994 to teen-age
"phonephreakers" stealing as much as 2 billion U.S. dollars in
telephone time yearly. Estimates of total losses are as high as 10
billion U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Companies' decision to handle matters privately is being driven
by a mix of concerns, among them the reluctance to acknowledge any
vulnerability of their systems and lack of trust in the
government.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is a major Internet booster,
anticipating 100 billion U.S. dollars in Internet commerce by
2004, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
But unless the public reaches a comfort level where it feels
secure doing business by computer, commerce won't blossom, it
said. Experts said the only way out is to involve law enforcement,
determine the size of the problem and punish the criminals.
</P>
<P>
The most common dealings with the computer criminals include:
banish the intruder; avoid public exposure of vulnerabilities;
and, possibly, move the intruder towards a competitor.
</P>
<P>
An organization has very little to gain by reporting the cases,
according analysts.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the rampant illegal intrusion is that the
current state of technology makes it too difficult to track a
skillful intruder, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The administration is also enhancing the monitoring of
cyberspace security. Computer crime units have been set up in the
Justice Department and other governmental departments.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe a closer cooperation between law enforcement
and major computer users is vital in the battle.

<HEADLINE> British Opposition Approves Platform For Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The British Opposition's leadership
approved today a policy document which will form the basis of its
election manifesto, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
The 10,000-word policy document, redrafted by Opposition leader
Tony Blair, emphasized the message that new Labor has given up
past commitments on tax and spending, but focused on law and
order, cuts in school class sizes, welfare to work plans, health,
and the economy.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Blair last week tore up sections of the
draft manifesto and decided to re-write it himself because it
failed to get across his message over the extent to which Labor
had changed.
</P>
<P>
The document is to be put to a vote of party members in a new
procedure some have criticized as a "loyalty test." The opposition
leader has came under criticism from Labor MPs for his allegedly
dictatorial style of leadership.
</P>
<P>
Leftwinger Paul Flynn accused the party of producing "timid
and anaemic" policies, while another Welsh MP, Llew Smith, said
that "all hell will break loose.... Tony Blair can't have it both
ways. He can't lecture me on loyalty one day and then turn the
policies of the party upside down."
</P>
<P>
Flynn warned the Labor leader that he was not omnipotent and
accused him of behaving in a manner inconsistent with the
leadership of a democratic party.
</P>
<P>
"We are producing policy documents which are timid and anaemic,
that don't rejoice in the achievements of the Labor Party," he
told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Party accepted that Blair has changed Labor,
but said that the policies he has encouraged it to adopt are a
menace to Britain. Prime Minister John Major argued that "new"
Labor will be more dangerous than the old version because Blair
has adopted policies that threaten both economic recovery and the
unity of the country.

<HEADLINE> Bank Governor Optimistic About S.A. Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Reserve Bank Governor Chris
Stals today painted a rosy picture of South Africa's future
economy, predicting a continued resurgence in capital inflows and
relatively low inflation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to financial analysts at a meeting in Midrand, north
of here, Stals said he is optimistic that inflation could be kept
below ten percent following the Rand's recent 15 percent
depreciation, and that capital inflows of the past two months
will continue.
</P>
<P>
Stals said although the Rand is still on decline against
foreign currencies, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange recorded a
record inflow of foreign capital last month of approximately 2.7
billion Rand (about 628 million US Dollars).
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the capital outflows are the result of a
"currency crisis" and not a loss of confidence in the future of
the South African economy.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the exchange rate at a weakening level, Stals
said South Africans should accept volatility in the level of
capital inflows and in the value of the Rand, as is the
experience in other emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
It is the responsibility of all South Africans to keep
reminding the government "of all its good intentions" spelt out
in the growth and development plan announced last month, said the
governor.
</P>
<P>
If the government sticks to its plans, the economy will grow,
and foreign investment will arrive, he noted.

<HEADLINE> African Export-Import Bank Extends Loans to Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The African Export-Import Bank
(Afreximbank) will extend loans of 10 million U.S. dollars to two
Nigerian banks to finance Nigeria's exports of manufactured
products.
</P>
<P>
Each of the Citizens International Bank Limited (CIB) and the
Citibank N.A.(Nigeria), two of the leading banks in Nigeria,
signed here today an agreement with the Afreximbank on the loan
grants.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, each of the two banks will receive five
million dollars in loans to finance the west African country's
exports of manufactured products such as tyres, textiles, steel
pipes, wet blue leather and related items, President of the
Afreximbank Christopher Edordu told a press conference following
the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's foreign trade volume amounted to 19 billion dollars
in 1995, accounting for about 9.2 percent of Africa's total trade,
the president said.
</P>
<P>
He added that only seven percent of Nigeria's trade, of which
the exports reached 12 billion dollars, is "intra-African."
</P>
<P>
"(The loans) represent our humble attempt to facilitate a
speedier integration of the Nigerian economy with the rest of Africa,"
said Edordu.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based Afreximbank was established in October 1993 to
facilitate, promote and expand intra-African trade and trade
between Africa and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the bank netted a profit of about six million dollars
and approved loans of 141 million U.S. dollars, of which over 48
million dollars were disbursed to 14 African countries, Edordu
said early last month.
</P>
<P>
The bank, whose shares are mainly held by African governments
or their designated institutions, African and non-African
financial institutions and private investors, is ready to extend
more loans for the promotion of African trade, Edordu said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Dismisses "Land For Peace" Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said here this evening that Israel seeks secure
and recognized boundaries in its peace negotiations with the
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The rightwing Likud-led government leader made the remarks
while speaking to foreign journalists at a press conference
organized by the Foreign Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who was spokesman of the Israeli delegation to the
1991 Madrid Middle East Peace Conference, dismissed a suggestion
that the "land for peace" principle and U.N. Resolutions 242 and
338 were basis for peace negotiations between Israel and Arabs
in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel had given up more than 90 percent of the
territories it captured at various times. But he argued that the
"land for peace" formula had never been shared by Likud
governments and the vast majority of the Israeli people would not
agree to hand over 100 percent of the land it took during wars.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister explained that his government advocates a
Madrid-type conference because it means peace negotiations without
pre-conditions. Israel still prefers to have direct, separate
talks with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the Palestinian Authority has not lived up
completely to its commitment to the peace agreements. He added
that there are many, many areas in which the PA has violated the
peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, the PA has not yet captured the Hamas
armed wing leader who masterminded the string of suicide bombing
attacks in February and March and has still insisted on refusing
to extradite to Israel those wanted for killing Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reiterated Likud's opposition to the establishment of
an independent Palestinian state in the territories evacuated by
Israel. He said that the Palestinians will not have sovereignty,
but enjoy substantial autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Hezbollah's statement that it will stop launching
rocket attacks on northern Israel if Israel withdraws from south
Lebanon, he said that he does not believe it, because Hezbollah
has repeatedly declared that its goal is to annihilate the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu declared that "we have no territorial claim in
Lebanon." He defended the Israeli occupation of part of the
Lebanese territory by saying that Israel's presence there
serves its security needs. When Israel feels safe without
being there it will consider a way out, he said.

<HEADLINE> Motive Still Unclear in Church Fire Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Agents investigating
Sunday's arson fire at a predominantly black, rural North Carolina
church had yet to uncover a motive for the attack or determine if
it is linked to similar incidents at other Southern churches,
authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
"Right now we don't know what the motive was for the fire," The
United Press International quoted Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
spokesman Earl Woodham as saying. "We don't know if it was a hate
crime, a racial crime, or just vandalism."
</P>
<P>
Without a motive or suspects, agents were unable to determine
whether the blaze was connected to a series of at least 40
suspicious fires across the South during the last 18 months,
Woodham said.
</P>
<P>
The church was in a rural area of Jones County in eastern North
Carolina, about 100 miles from Raleigh, and had about 100 active
members, Woodham said.
</P>
<P>
According to Woodham, investigators determined that someone had
poured gasoline around the outside of the St. James A.M.E. Zion
Church six miles outside Maysville, and then threw Molotov
cocktails through several windows to ignite the fire.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department said last month that racial hatred
appeared to be the motive behind a significant number of fires at
black churches in the South and that a task force of 200 federal
agents had been assigned to help solve the crimes.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Expresses Optimism over US Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
today expressed optimism that the United States will contribute
to the solution of the Cyprus problem, saying that it may be
willing to exert some sort of pressure on Turkey to reach this
goal.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, speaking at an annual general assembly of the Cyprus
Barristers Association here, said that during his recent meetings
with U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, they confirmed their desire to play a role in solving
the Cyprus problem and coordinate their efforts with the
initiatives of Britain and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"We managed to convince the U.S. that they have to turn to
Turkey to solve the problem and that there cannot be direct talks
between the two communities, without substantial preparation to
find common ground," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his talks in the U.S., he was told
that "the U.S. State Department is now more willing to exert
pressure on Turkey and to even use American military officials
for talks with their Turkish counterparts".
</P>
<P>
President Clerides reiterated that "the new basic precondition
for a solution to the Cyprus problem is to find a way for both
communities to be satisfied on the issue of security."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish-Cypriot community in
the north and the Greek-Cypriot community in the south since 1974
when Turkish troops invaded and took control 37 percent of the
island following a Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved despite the U.N. and
international peace efforts for the past 22 years.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides said that he told U.S. government officials
that one of the basic issues towards which they should channel
their efforts is the demilitarization of Cyprus and the creation
of an international force under the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has decided to send his presidential emissary for
Cyprus Richard Beattie to visit the island this month, and the
U.S. envoy will concentrate his efforts on he issue of security.

ADDIS ABABA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese security personnel
have been dispatched to Tokker in the country's east, on the
border with Eritrea, after the blast of two land mines injured
a number of people, a PANA report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
the mines are believed to have been planted by an
Eritrea-based group opposed to the Sudanese government, the
Pan-African News Agency (PANA) report from Khartoum said.
</P>
<P>
according to the report, an independent Sudanese daily today
quoted eastern Sudan province commissioner Abdel Rahman as saying
that "a large number" of civilians had volunteered to take up
arms to protect their country against alleged "armed incursion".
</P>
<P>
The commissioner, however, told the daily that Sudanese forces
would not launch "any aggression against the Eritrean people." He
described relations between the two countries as "intimate."
</P>
<P>
Eritrea has accused Sudan of training dissidents seeking to
oust President Issias Afwerki.
</P>
<P>
It broke off diplomatic ties with Sudan on December 5, 1994
for the above mentioned reason.

combating church burnings.
</P>
<P>
The money would be taken from Justice Department funds and
distributed to communities in 12 states for bolstering police
patrols and other protections for churches.
</P>
<P>
"This is a struggle against racism and religious bigotry,"
Clinton said during a ceremony here. "We will escalate that
struggle as necessary with enough people-power and will power to
make sure the struggle is won."
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged Congress to approve the transfer of funds without
a "time-consuming" floor vote.
</P>
<P>
Also, Clinton said he is eager to sign legislation approved by
Congress last week that would strengthen the penalties for church
arson.
</P>
<P>
The legislation extends the maximum prison terms from 10 to 20
years for anyone convicted of church attacks and increases the
statute of limitations for prosecution from five to seven years.
</P>
<P>
The states receiving aid are Alabama, Florida, Georgia,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina,
Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
About 40 predominantly black churches have reportedly been
burned by suspicious fires in the southern United States over the
past year and a half.

<HEADLINE> Kwazulu/Natal Elections Confirms Urban/Rural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) won most votes in last week's local
government elections in Kwazulu/Natal, but will have little
administrative control over the province's major urban councils.
</P>
<P>
According to official results announced today, the IFP polled
11 percent more proportional votes and secured nearly 150 more
council seats than its rival the African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
While Inkatha secured a landslide victory in most rural areas,
the ANC won in most of Kwazulu/Natal's urban centers, such as
Durban and Pietermaritzburg.
</P>
<P>
Kwazulu/Natal's first and non-racial local government
elections were held relatively incident-free in the strife-torn
province on June 26 under a tight watch of about 30,000
policemen.
</P>
<P>
About 3.5 million voters were expected to cast their ballots
in the long-awaited local elections, but only 44 percent of
registered voters turned out in the polling that day.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the official election results in Pietermaritzburg,
Kwazulu/Natal's Provincial Local Government Minister Peter Miller
said consolidated proportional votes showed the IFP had secured
44.50 percent of voter support compared to the ANC's 33.22
percent.
</P>
<P>
The National Party (NP) won 12.69 percent, the Democratic
Party 3.33 percent, Minority Front 2.29 percent, and independents
and others polled 2.88 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ward results showed that the IFP won most seats
with a total of 562, compared to the ANC's 524 and the NP's 187
seats.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Bank CS Holding Announces Major Restructuring Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Swiss banking giant CS Holding
announced Tuesday a wide-ranging restructuring programme in a bid
to improve competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
CS Holding said it would axe 5,000 jobs, cut its branch network
by a third, and set up a new structure, called Credit Suisse
Group, for its banking and investment banking business.
</P>
<P>
The move, which would be completed over two or three years,
would produce new efficiencies, reduce duplication and improve
profits, the bank said. Estimated annual savings of 564 million
dollars will more than compensate for the costs.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman of the company, most of the job losses
would occur in Switzerland, but he also predicted at least 1,500
redundancies elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
CS Holding Chairman Rainer Gut told reporters that London would
be the focal point for the group's revamped investment banking
business. He said London had the advantage of being in a central
time zone between New York and Tokyo.

Deputy Minister for Finance Kilontsi Mporogomyi told the

Among the donor countries, only the Netherlands and the U.S.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's defense headquarters said
here today that the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) has
formally asked it for arms and training of road guards in
handling weapons.
</P>
<P>
The FRSC has sought government approval for its personnel to
carry arms while on duty as part of measures to safeguard the
lives of the road marshals, some of whom have been shot and
killed by armed bandits, said Brig. Gen. Fred Chijuka, Director
of Defense information.
</P>
<P>
Armed robbery has been reported on the rise recently,
especially in the three northern states of Plateau, Bauchi and
Kaduna. Armed robbers, believed to have come from neighboring
countries, have terrorized motorists along the major highways
around the three states.
</P>
<P>
The government has established anti-robbery task force to
check the upsurge in armed robbery activities, but no
achievements have been reported.
</P>
<P>
On the FRSC requests, Chijuka said, the defense headquarters
is still studying it. When satisfied, the defense headquarters
will still ask for government approval before it could be
implemented, he added.
</P>
<P>
To assist the FRSC with some of the weapons in its arsenal,
the defense authorities would compile a list to facilitate the
selection of those most appropriate for the corps.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Parking Lot Operators Increase Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Parking lot operators have raise their
rates well beyond their usual daily rates for everyone except their
monthly customers, but the rates will go still higher after July 19,
when the Olympic Games actually begin, according to local reports on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some of the off-street parking downtown was lost over the weekend
when Olympic sponsors and workers setting up hospitality suits began
claiming parking spots. Coca-Cola Olympic City, the National Black
Arts Festival and Olympic-related activity are also drawing more
people downtown.
</P>
<P>
Event rates, which is what the lots are charging, range between 5
and 10 dollars more than typical daily rates.
</P>
<P>
Chalie Munn, executive director of the Parking Association of
Georgia, said parking operators typically fill 80 percent of their
spaces with monthly contract parkers and use the remaining 20
percent for drop-in customers.
</P>
<P>
But in the last week, operators claimed they were losing money
because more tourists seem to be coming to town and filling up the
available spaces as early as 10 a.m.. However, instead of leaving a
few hours later, which is what parking operators count on to make
money, the visitor were staying all day.
</P>
<P>
So to ensure that they make as much money as possible, rates were
raised, the local reports said.

NEW DELHI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee recovered in

</P>
<P>
Opening around 35.08/11 rupees per dollar, the rupee plunged to

Later, after the SBI withdrew from the market, dollar sellers
emerged and in a narrow two-way movements, the rupee staged a

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Popular Slimming Methods Do Not Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Millions of overweight Chinese
people have been warned about the ineffectiveness and dangers of
some diet pills and other slenderizing products.
</P>
<P>
The results of a survey conducted among nearly 1,000 obese
people in Beijing showed that more than 80 percent of them failed
to shed their extra pounds because they chose weight loss products
without consulting experts.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people sampled who used slimming products
following advertisements or others' introduction," said the survey
report. "Many products not only had little effect, they also did
harm to the people's health."
</P>
<P>
Some diet products can cause diarrhea, poor appetite and
metabolic disorders. Rapid weight reduction can ultimately cause
some people to gain even more weight, the report quoted experts as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Only 13 percent of the obese people had consulted diet experts
before starting a weight loss program.
</P>
<P>
About 70 million Chinese people, mostly city residents, are
obese, and the number is on the rise as people's living standards
have greatly improved in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Overweight people run higher risks of cardiovascular and
cerebral diseases, diabetes, kidney and liver diseases, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
Many people gain unwanted pounds because they do not engage in
regular exercises, eat and sleep too much, then rely on "miracle"
slimming products for help, the survey report said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted experts as saying that the ideal slimming
products should not cause diarrhea, loss of appetite and
fatigue. But many types of Chinese-made weight-loss products
failed to meet the standards.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Medical Association, one of the survey sponsors,
plans to launch a nationwide campaign to spread scientific methods
for weight loss.
</P>
<P>
It also plans to coordinate with the state administrative
departments of public health and product quality control to place
stricter supervision over the quality of slimming products
available on the market.

<HEADLINE> Auditor-General Says China's Finance Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Senior auditing official Guo
Zhenqian said today the state's finances improved in 1995, with
the growth rate of revenue surpassing that of expenditure for the
first time in years.
</P>
<P>
Guo, auditor-general of the Auditing Administration, reported
the country's final budget in 1995 to the on-going 20th meeting of
the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress
(NPC).
</P>
<P>
The Auditing Law was implemented in 1995. Between last October
and April, 1996, the administration audited the budget for 1995
implemented by the Ministry of Finance, 43 central governmental
departments, 17 provincial taxations administrations, and 20 major
customs offices.
</P>
<P>
In a move to reduce the deficit, the Ministry of Finance
carried out the tightly-controlled financial policy to increase
revenue and reduce expenditure, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry spent more on projects related to agriculture,
forestry, water conservancy, scientific research, education,
culture and public wealth, he added.
</P>
<P>
Various departments of the central government also took
measures to enhance financial management in order to increase
revenue and cut spending.
</P>
<P>
However, it was discovered that some departments
inappropriately used funds to cover administrative expenses, wrote
false expense reports, and transferred funds for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
Guo said the state taxation departments took effective measures
to step up taxation and check up on those in arrears, and to
punish tax evaders.
</P>
<P>
The auditing showed that taxation administrations in 17
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities paid 184.77
billion yuan of industrial and commercial tax to the central
government, an increase of 13.5 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
But the auditing showed tax losses were serious, and taxation
administrations could have collected about 3.1 billion yuan more
taxes for the central government.
</P>
<P>
The treasury took responsibility for the payment, division and
appropriation of budgetary funds. But some funds belonging to the
central government were returned to localities that had violated
certain regulations.
</P>
<P>
The audit also indicated that 20 customs offices under the
General Administration of Customs showed they had collected 714
million yuan more in taxes in 1995 over 1994's figure, an increase
of 17.2 percent.

ISLAMABAD, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari today called for an overhaul of the country's tax
collection machinery and monetary policy to improve economic
environment.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Defense College here, Leghari said that
all tax efforts were wasted by an inefficient and corrupt tax
collection system.
</P>
<P>
"Despite heavy taxation, we fail to achieve deficit targets
because the tax effort gets swallowed by an inefficient, corrupt
or leaking system," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan imposed additional taxation annually in the past
decade, keeping the tax ratio around 13 percent of the Gross
Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said, "we require expansion in the tax bases, plugging
of loopholes, better tax administration, documentation of economy
and other steps to modernize our tax system."
</P>
<P>
"Our monetary policy is currently hostage to large budget
deficits and inefficient and corrupt public sector banks," he
said, adding, "the vested interests also exploit the banking
system to their advantage."
</P>
<P>
He said, "if Pakistan is to achieve inflation control and
balance of payments, we will have to control government
borrowings, reduce loan defaults, improve the administrative
efficiency of banks and eliminate outside interference in our
banking system."

<HEADLINE> Dream Team Are Healthy, Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Most of the Dream Team members who
had sustained or worsened their injuries more or less in the
1995-1996 NBA season are in good shape for the coming Olympic
Games, head coach said.
</P>
<P>
The good news for the Dream Team is that Scottie Pippen is his
only ailing player, and the bad news was that Pippen is his only
ailing player, coach Lenny Wilkens said.
</P>
<P>
John Stockton's right elbow is healed, Penny Hardaway's
hamstrings are no longer troublesome. Reggie Miller's double
vision ended about 10 days ago. Even Pippen, hobbled throughout
the NBA Finals with sore ankles that may require surgery after the
Olympics, hopes to play at least 12 to 15 minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
"They all want to play," Wilkens said after Tuesday's 90-minute
practice at Moody Bible College in Chicago, "and most of them came
here in good shape. The level of intensity is increasing with each
scrimmage. What you already see is that these are competitive
people, and when you get them all together, these guys challenge
one another."
</P>
<P>
In theory, the upcoming opponents are Yugoslavia, Croatia,
Lithuania and Greece, among the others. But the true test remains
the standard established by the 1992 Dream Team featuring legends
Larry Bird, Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson.
</P>
<P>
To accommodate his stars, Wilkens plans to start different
lineups in the five exhibition games, perhaps even in the Games.
</P>
<P>
"This is a special situation," said Wilkens. "These are special
people. That's why they're here. But it's never easy. Everybody
wants to play and the games are only 40 minutes, not 48. We'll
give everybody the opportunity to play good minutes, with Scottie
being the exception."

</P>
<P>
Speaking on the "Present and Future of Sino-Singapore

together," he said, adding that the economic links between China
and the ASEAN nations have been closer as China's economy has been
growing in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China and the ASEAN countries have not only
coordinated and supported each other on international political
issues, but also maintained close consultations and coordination
in such regional fora as APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation),
ARF (ASEAN Regional Forum), and ASEM (Asia-Europe Meeting)
initiated by Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"China will become a full dialogue partner of ASEAN in July.
This marks a new chapter of more matured Sino-ASEAN relations that

good-neighborly relations between the two sides into the 21st
century," he said.

Stressing that Sino-Singapore cooperation is an important
component of cooperation between China and Southeast Asian
countries, the ambassador said that closer cooperation between
China and Singapore contributes to the prosperity of the Asia
Pacific region and the world as a whole.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- An Atlanta Olympic Games boxing
official said here that he was unhappy with the boxing governing
body's recent reversal on boxing score displays.
</P>
<P>
After originally deciding that computer scores would be flashed on
the scoreboard following each round in Olympic bouts, International
boxing (AIBA) officials reversed field and decided to keep scores
secret until the bouts' conclusion.
</P>
<P>
ACOG boxing official Woody Gregory said on Tuesday that the added
element of secrecy sets up boxing for more controversy.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not at all happy about it," Gregory said. "But it's AIBA's
decision and we have to abide by it."
</P>
<P>
Scores were shown on the overhead scoreboard at a recent ACOG
test event at Geogia Tech, but AIBA president Anwar Chowdhry
believed that a lopsided score after two rounds could lead to one
boxer "running" in the third.
</P>
<P>
Chowdhry also maintained that a judge's score in rounds two and
three could be influenced if he or she is aware how others are
scoring.

<P>
TOKYO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan's southernmost island
prefecture Okinawa will hold a referendum on September 8 to ask
local residents whether they support a reduction in U.S. bases on
the island, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa governor Masahide Ota, who revealed the referendum date
during a prefectural assembly session, said it would be an
opportunity for every Okinawa resident to be informed of the
situation in the prefecture and to think about its future.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa is eager to hold the referendum before regular defense
talks between Japan and the United States in late September, which
will take up the base issue.
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of all land used by the U.S. military in Japan
is located in Okinawa, although the island prefecture makes up
only 0.6 percent of Japan's land area.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached in April between Tokyo and
Washington, the U.S. military will vacate some 20 percent of the
land it now occupies in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
U.S. bases became the most heated topic in Okinawa after three
U.S. soldiers raped a school girl on the island in early
September last year, arousing great public anger. Local
residents are demanding that U.S. troops leave the island.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July (3) -- Chinese President and Communist Party
General Secretary Jiang Zemin has called for still greater efforts
in the reform of state-owned enterprises and in their development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang attended a meeting with business executives and leading
officials of Sichuan, Hebei, Liaoning, Shandong, and Zhejiang
provinces, and Shanghai municipality on May 4, following his
inspection tour of a number of firms focused on improving the
country's state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
New progress has been made in reform in state-owned enterprises
and their situation is good on the whole, Jiang told the group,
while acknowledging that problems still exist and the reforms fall
short of meeting the demand of a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang spoke highly of the role of the state-owned enterprises
and the contributions they have made in China's reforms and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
They constitute a pillar in the country's national economy and
played a decisive role in strengthening the socialist system,
building a socialist market economy, promoting economic and social
progress and socialist ethics and ideological progress, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned enterprises contributed greatly to the
country's reform and modernization drive and guaranteed the
sustained, rapid and healthy development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
They are a major part of the country's economic lifeline and
have played a leading role in entire economic development and
serve as the principal source of state revenues, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many local governments and government
departments have accelerated the pace of reforms in state-owned
enterprises, and the enterprise system has been experimented with
on an extensive scale in many places, with some good results.
</P>
<P>
In the reforms, measures have been developed for solving some
difficult problems and certain unprofitable enterprises are
allowed to declare bankruptcy or to merge with others, thereby
reducing the social burden to be borne by the enterprises and
helping to provide job opportunities for surplus workforce.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Says GCC Needs Big Countries to Maintain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's Foreign Undersecretary
Sulaiman Majid Al-Shahin asserted today that the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) countries will remain dependent on the big countries
to maintain the region's security and stability in the "visible
future."
</P>
<P>
Al-Shahin made the remarks at a training program titled "the
security in the Arab Gulf" which was organized by the official
Kuwait News Agency this morning.
</P>
<P>
He said it was necessary to comprehend the needs of the six GCC
states, which group Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar, to depend on foreign powers to
secure their stability, particularly in the visible future.
</P>
<P>
"This does not mean that those powers are directed against any
country in the area outside the GCC," he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, the number of foreign military personnel stationed
in the Gulf region stood at about 25,000, with U.S. military
personnel accounting for 20,000.
</P>
<P>
The official called on Iran to establish normal relations with
all GCC states on the basis of good neighborliness, stressing that
security in the area could be achieved through the tripartite
balance of the GCC, Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is not possible for the super powers led by the
United States to allow for alliances against the GCC states
because it will push the area for a war.
</P>
<P>
He added the U.S.-GCC relations were based on mutual strategic
interests not only in the Gulf area but in the Middle East in
general.

<P>
Meanwhile, there are some problems, Jiang pointed to, for
example, the large number of state-owned enterprises that are
run rigidly and with poor performances and financial
difficulties. The losses incurred by state-owned enterprises are
continuing to aggravate, he said.
</P>
<P>
These problems have a direct impact on the growth of socialist
market economy, social stability, and people's livelihood, and
they should arouse the concern of the leading bodies at all
levels, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Fundamentally speaking, One solution to these problems lie in
speeding up the pace of reforms at state-owned enterprises, and in
scientific and technological progress and development of scale
economy and in avoidance of redundant production.
</P>
<P>
He called on all departments to make readjustments in the
state-owned assets and making full use of the modern enterprise
system and science and technology so as to improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
At present, the reform of the state-owned enterprises is a
critical state, Jiang said. Reforms of both the economic system
and economic growth mode are tied to industrial enterprises, and
only when their problems are solved can the economic system and
economic growth mode be reformed and the country's Ninth Five-Year
Plan and long-term goals for the year 2010 be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged party and government officials at all levels and
state-owned enterprise directors to have full confidence in
enterprise reforms.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we enhance leadership, adhere to the party's basic
line and the series of policies on enterprise reform, and bring
into play the enthusiasm of all sectors, then the path for the
development with Chinese characteristics for state-owned
enterprise reforms will be found and taken," he said.

<P>
President Jiang urged local government not to neglect the
government's principles on increasing reforms in state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that practice has proven that the principles
established by central authorities are absolutely correct, and
that the modern corporate system based on public ownership is the
basis of China's socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that reforms in state-owned enterprises are aimed to
establish a modern corporate system characterized by clear
property rights, definition of rights and responsibilities,
separation of state and enterprises, and scientific management.
</P>
<P>
Jiang put forth the goal of establishing the modern corporate
system in the majority of the large and medium-sized backbone
enterprises by the turn of the century, making them independent in
management and held responsible for their own profits and losses
occurred.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader called for state-owned enterprises to pay
greater attention to the improvement of industrial structure and
economic efficiency, along with efforts to be made in combining
reforms and transforming enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that local governments should make full use
of the state-owned economy in national economic development by
strengthening a group of large state enterprises or enterprise
conglomerates and setting free and invigorating ordinary small
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged state-owned enterprises to sharpen their
competitive edge in the marketplace by speeding up the use of
science and technology. To improve them, it is essential to rely
on the working class wholeheartedly, effectively improve the
enterprise managerial ranks, to develop reforms in a coordinated
manner, and to set up and improve a sound social insurance system.
</P>
<P>
By mainly adhering of public ownership and developing different
types of economic factors, Jiang said. the state can create the
good environment and conditions for the involvement of the
economies of all types in market competition on an equal
footing. Moreover, he urged state-owned enterprises to be bold in
developing new methods and to gain fresh experience in enterprise
reforms.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it is fully useful to give scope to the
workers' initiative and build up and strengthen the ranks of

<HEADLINE> Aggressive Tourism Campaign Called for in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A World Tourism Organisation (WTO)
official said on Wednesday Zimbabwe should diversify its product
market and be more aggressive in promotion to boost tourism in
the country.
</P>
<P>
WTO Chief of Statistics and Market Research Enzo Paci said
that because of competition for destinations, there was need to
keep abreast of effective promotional tactics.
</P>
<P>
''The marketing should be a very targeted one whereby the
message and promotion is directed to a specific niche market
which is interested in the product that you can offer,'' said
Paci.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe had some of the best resorts in the world,
adding that a good marketing strategy would boost tourism growth.
</P>
<P>
Paci, who is based in Spain, said information on tourism
should be readily available, especially to politicians whose
influence could have a positive impact on the industry.
</P>
<P>
Paci is attending a three-day workshop on statistics organised
by the World Tourism Organisation in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe last year had about 1.4 million visitors and earned
130 million US dollars. It was expected to earn over 300 million
US dollars annually by the turn of the century. enditem

<HEADLINE> Less Change in HK Civil Servants Contingent, the Better (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- With only one year left until Hong
Kong returns to the motherland, the issue of what to do with Hong
Kong's civil servants becomes more important than ever.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese have always adhered to one principle: the fewer the
changes made during the transitional period, the better the
conditions will be for the civil servants contingent after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a population of six million. One out of every
three Hong Kong residents is a civil servant, and they are
considered invaluable to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always attached great importance to
stabilizing Hong Kong's civil servants contingent before and after
1997, and regarded this as an important factor for realizing Hong
Kong's smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
China will not send a new group of people to take over the Hong
Kong government when it resumes the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, it will implement a high degree of autonomy and the
principles of "one country, two systems," and the "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong." The latter means that the government
of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) will
be composed of local Hong Kong people, and the Central People's
Government will not send any officials there.
</P>
<P>
The 180,000 Hong Kong civil servants now working in the
government departments are familiar not only with Hong Kong's
situation, but also with the governmental operation.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen, vice-Premier of the State Council and director of
the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR, described the Hong
Kong civil servants as being a huge asset for Hong Kong that can
be relied on to implement the "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" after 1997.

<HEADLINE> Less Change in HK Civil Servants Contingent, the Better (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Article 100 of the Hong Kong Basic Law stipulates that public
servants serving in all Hong Kong government departments,
including the police department, before the establishment of the
Hong Kong SAR, will remain employed and will retain their seniority
with pay, allowances, benefits and conditions of service that are
no less favorable than before.
</P>
<P>
According to this stipulation, after the Hong Kong SAR is
established, civil servants currently working in Hong Kong will
remain employed after July 1, 1997, and their treatment will be
fully guaranteed by law.
</P>
<P>
The single exception is for the more than 20 major officials
who will be nominated by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR,
and then appointed by the Central People's Government.
</P>
<P>
In order to successfully implement the Basic Law, the
stabilization of the Hong Kong civil servants contingent was
listed as an important working plan by the Preliminary Working
Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
A suggestion to maintain the stability of Hong Kong's civil
servants ranks and relevant systems was approved by the
sixth plenary session of the Preliminary Working Committee.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion stressed that Hong Kong's executive management
will rely on its present civil servants after 1997. It expressed
the hope that civil servants now working in Hong Kong will remain
on their posts and serve the Hong Kong SAR and Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong remains under British rule until 1997, and its civil
servants perform duties according to policies created by the
British Hong Kong Authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government hopes to maintain Hong Kong's social
stability and economic prosperity. To do so, it is necessary to
strengthen links between civil servants in China's inland areas and
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of November, Chinese government officials have
held 12 meetings with more than 70 Hong Kong senior civil
servants, which helped the Chinese understand the Hong Kong
government's executive framework and boosted the Hong Kong civil
servants' confidence in their future.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Hong Kong's civil servants ranks can be
stabilized so long as the Basic Law is fully implemented and the
principle of "the less change, the better" is adhered to.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Uruguay to Strengthen Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Yang di-Pertuan Agong
(King) Tuanku Ja'afar said here today that there are many areas of
interest where Malaysia and Uruguay can benefit by cooperating.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a state banquet in honor of visiting Uruguayan
President Gulio Maria Sanguinetti tonight, Tuanku Ja'afar said
that in trade, investment and tourism, the two countries can share
their experience, use each other's technological advantages and
exchange specialized skills.
</P>
<P>
"In this environment of accelerated growth, there are vast
opportunities for Uruguay and Malaysia to cooperate as well as to
strengthen existing links," the Malaysian king said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Malaysia could be used as a distribution
center for Uruguay's products and for expanding Uruguay's economic
involvement in the region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Sanguinetti and Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad agreed to promote the bilateral economic
cooperation and Uruguay has invited Malaysia to set up plants in
Uruguay for assembling or manufacturing cars for export.
</P>
<P>
After their talks, Mahathir and Sanguinetti witnessed the
signing of an agreement on economic, scientific and technical
cooperation as well as two memorandums of understanding on
cooperation in veterinary medicine and on cooperation in sanitary
and phytosanitary measures.
</P>
<P>
Sanguinetti arrived here Tuesday for a state visit to Malaysia.
 This is the first visit to Malaysia by a Uruguayan president
since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Stresses Reform in State-Owned Enterprises (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President and Communist
Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin has called for greater efforts
in the reform of state-owned enterprises and in their development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang attended a meeting with business executives and leaders
of Sichuan, Hebei, Liaoning, Shandong, and Zhejiang provinces, and
the city of Shanghai on May 4, following a tour of a number of
firms in China's largest metropolis, that focused on improving
China's state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
New progress has been made in reforms in state-owned firms and
their situation looks good on the whole, Jiang told the group,
while noting that problems still exist and the reforms fall short
of meeting the need of a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
"We must correctly analyze the situation, boost confidence in
state-owned enterprises, further strengthen leadership, carry out
the relevant policies to letter, and increase the pace of reforms
and the development of those enterprises," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the role of the state-owned enterprises in China's
own reforms and economic development, Jiang spoke highly of the
contribution the state-owned firms have made in the modernization
drive, where they have helped secure sustained, rapid and healthy
growth of the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Issues "Order" for Okinawa on U.S. Base Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today ordered Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota to renew a
lease on land in a U.S. military base, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The order is the latest stage in a running confrontation
between the governor and the central government over his refusal
to force Okinawan landowners to renew leases with the state for
property used by U.S. military facilities.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto mailed a document "ordering" Ota to comply with the
government's request, after the governor refused his original
request and ensuing "recommendation," Kyodo quoted government
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ota, explaining his reasons for refusing, has previously said
that the return of the Futemma air base agreed by both the
U.S. and Japanese governments and its transfer to other locations
within Okinawa are "far from the satisfaction of the Okinawa
people."
</P>
<P>
If Ota refuses Tokyo's "order", as is likely, Hashimoto will have
to file a lawsuit forcing Ota to comply with the request.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo is asking Okinawa to publicize a government paper
pertaining to a plot of land inside the U.S. Navy's Sobe
communications facility in the village of Yomitan.
</P>
<P>
The forced lease for the land expired at the end of March, and
the central government wants to renew the contract to keep the
land for use by the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
The time consuming procedures the central government is taking
against the governor are based on the nation's Local Autonomy Law.
</P>
<P>
Posting of the official "order" paper is necessary before Tokyo
can obtain approval from a local land expropriation committee to
renew the lease.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, an island in southern Japan, has a heavy concentration
of U.S. military bases. Relations between the prefecture and the
U.S. have been strained since the rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl
by three U.S. servicemen last year.
</P>
<P>
The incident sparked angry protest against the U.S. military
presence on the island and Ota has spearheaded a drive to cut down
on the American presence.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Stresses Reform in State-owned Enterprises (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has about 17,000 large and mid-sized state-owned
enterprises, which account for a major share of the country's
taxes and profits. One-third of these, however, are running in the
red.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged state-owned enterprises to be bolder in exploring
new ways to reform and to establish a modern corporate system.
</P>
<P>
The reforms are aimed to establish a modern corporate system
characterized by clear property rights, definition of rights and
responsibilities, separation of state and enterprises, and
scientific management, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on state-owned enterprises to pay greater attention
to improving the industrial structure and economic efficiency, and
greater efforts at combining reforms and transforming enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In reminding local authorities not to neglect the central
government's principles on increasing reforms in state-owned
enterprises, Jiang emphasized that the modern corporate system,
which is based on public ownership, is the basis of China's
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that different sectors of ownership are
useful.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged Party organizations and governments at various
levels to pay closer attention to enterprises reforms as well as
care for the lives of low-income and laid-off workers that are
tied to the reforms.
</P>
<P>
Reforms and development of the state-owned enterprises are not
only an economic issue, but a political one, he noted, and have an
important bearing on both the growth of the national economy and
the fate of the socialist system.

<P>
BISHKEK, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
arrived here today on a two-day state visit to Kyrgyzstan, the
first visit to the central Asian republic by a Chinese head of
state.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement distributed at the airport, Jiang said
the main purpose of his visit to the "friendly neighbor" is to
explore ways to further develop friendly and good-neighborly
relations on a strategic basis into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
China and Kyrgyzstan are linked by common mountains and
rivers, and their friendly, good-neighborly, mutually-beneficial and
cooperative relationship has enjoyed sound and steady development
since 1992, when the two countries established diplomatic ties,
said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is expected to exchange views with Kyrgyz President Askar
Akayevich Akayev and other leaders of Kyrgyzstan on bilateral
relations and international issues of common concern as well as
signing a number of documents.
</P>
<P>
"It is my belief that this visit will help to deepen our mutual
understanding, trust and friendship, and bring friendly relations
and cooperation between China and Kyrgyzstan to a new level," Jiang
stated.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president flew to Bishkek, the fifth leg of his
six-nation tour of Europe and central Asia, after successfully winding
up his state visit to Uzbekistan, which was preceded by visits to
Spain, Norway and Romania.

<P>
CAIRO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Police killed a Islamic militant in
Abu Kurkas, Minya province in southern Egypt, early today, the
Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The militant, who was involved in several terrorist operations,
was shot dead during a shoot-out with the police who came to his
hideout in a plantation trying to arrest him, according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
The police searched the hideout and found an automatic gun,
ammunition, documents and a name list of prominent figures, who
might be targeted by terrorists in their attacks.
</P>
<P>
Slips of newspapers carrying reports on the terrorist attack
which left 18 Greek tourists dead in Cairo last April were also
found, indicating that the terrorist might be related to the
incident.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist is believed to have been a suspected Moslem
fundamentalist militant.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, Moslem militants have attempted to
install strict Islamic rule through a violent campaign against the
government. The security forces have fiercely cracked down on
these militants, and have almost confined their terrorist attacks
to only remote villages in the south.

on the issue. On June 18, Netanyahu proclaimed his cabinet before
the Knesset, which did not, as expected, include coalition
partner David Levy and Likud stalwart Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu announced that he would hold onto the additional
portfolios of Foreign Affairs, Construction and Housing, and
Religious Affairs. Later Levy agreed to join the cabinet after
Netanyahu promised him to create a cabinet post for Sharon. But
two weeks has past since then Sharon is still outside the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In response, Netanyahu said today that he hopes that Sharon
will take up cabinet post. However, he said, it is unacceptable
that ministers demand that Sharon should join the government, but
refuse to give up parts of their ministries for the ministry of
infrastructure slated for him.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister asked Justice Minister Ya'acov Ne'eman to
discuss the formation of the new ministry with some other
ministers. But none of them is willing to cut their newly
obtained power for the sake of the new one.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu added that it is preferable for such matters to
be discussed within the cabinet, and not in front of
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
Sharon told Israel Radio earlier today that Netanyahu announced
publicly in the Knesset that he would set up infrastructure
ministry, but so far nothing has been done.

<HEADLINE> France Announces Ban on Asbestos Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The French government is to ban
asbestos from January 1, 1997 after a report claimed that 2,000
people will die this year from the effects of asbestos fibres.
</P>
<P>
The ban will apply to the production, import and sales of all
products containing asbestos, particularly asbestos-cement,
Jacques Barrot, minister of labour and social affairs announced
today.
</P>
<P>
The report, by the INSERM research institute earlier this week
said that many people working in what had been assumed safe
professions, such as plumbers and electricians, are threatened by
the cancer-causing material. Even jewellers, dockers and railway
workers are in danger.
</P>
<P>
Most people die from the effects of inhaling asbestos fibres
many years after exposure. Inhalation can cause cancer 20 to 30
years later.
</P>
<P>
The report recommended the development of a comprehensive
policy of research into the dangers to the general public from
passive inhalation of asbestos used in buildings such as schools
and offices.
</P>
<P>
Asbestos has long been banned in most European countries as its
effects have been known to cause fatal lung cancer and other
respiratory diseases for decades.

SEOUL, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A civilian employee of the
U.S. forces in South Korea was today jailed for seven years for
inflicting fatal injuries on his live-in South Korean girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
Henry Kevin Mckinney, 36, had been accused of beating Kang
Un-kyong in her chest and face at her Seoul apartment where they
lived together, during a heated argument on January 18 this year.
</P>
<P>
Kang, 39, fell and hit her head and later died of a brain
hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
"Although the defendant denied committing a criminal act, I
find him guilty in the light of testimonies of legal medical
experts and the victim's daughter," said the presiding judge of
the Seoul District Court when handing out the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had demanded a 15-year term for the American.
</P>
<P>
Kang, who had been separated from her husband for six years,
had lived with Mckinney since last year after meeting him
at a U.S. club.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 20 years, about 40 murders have been linked to
the U.S. military presence in South Korea, where 37,000 American
troops are stationed.

<HEADLINE> OAU Fights Arrear Problem to Enhance Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU) is fighting the serious arrear problem to enhance its role
in regional peacekeeping and socil-economic issues, OAU spokesman
Dr. Ibrahim Dagash said here today.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of dues owned to the OAU by its members stood
at 53.7 million U.S. Dollars as of June, accounting for 68
percent of this year's OAU financial budget, compared with 57.8
million U.S. Dollars for the same time of the 1994/95 financial
year, according to an OAU report.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is hopeful to be better,"said the spokesman,
explaining that those member states with heavy arrear burdens
have promised to step up the paying process during the three-day
preparatory meeting expected to end today.
</P>
<P>
The 32nd OAU summit meeting is expected to be held here from
July 8 to 10, which observers say is the best time for African
countries to show their contributions to the continental unity.
</P>
<P>
Under OAU rules, member states placed under sanctions are not
allowed to speak or vote at OAU meetings until they pay up.
</P>
<P>
The member states in serious arrears are Chad, Comoros,
Somalia, Guinea Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Central African
Republic, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sao Tome and Principe, Gambia,
Niger, Seychelles, Rwanda, Burundi, Zaire, Cape Verde and
Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
However, reports say OAU would show magnanimity to a number of
member states whose total arrears amount to US $37.5 million.
They would be allowed to speak out on issues directly concerned
with them.
</P>
<P>
In addition, four countries including Liberia, Sierra Leone,
Burundi and Somalia are enjoying membership due exemptions.
</P>
<P>
The arrear problem has limited the scope of functions of the
OAU which is eager to expand its roles over a number of regional
issues including peacekeeping and fostering of regional economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim has ruled out OAU
military intervention in Burundi, partly because of the limited
operational fund.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief has commended 13 member countries without
arrears, namely: Algeria, Benin, Botswana, Eritrea, Ethiopia,
Ghana, Lesotho, Mauritius, Namibia, Senegal, Swaziland, South
Africa and Zimbabwe.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Iraq have signed an
oil-for-food agreement, with Indonesia sending food to Iraq in
exchange for crude oil, Mines and Energy Minister I. B. Sujana
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The crude oil imported from Iraq will be processed at the
refinery of the state oil company Pertamina in Cilacap, central
Java, Sujana told newsmen before attending a limited cabinet

</P>
<P>
He declined, however, to give details on the quantity or value
of the planned oil-for-food barter, and on what kind of food
Indonesia will send to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations resolution in May allowed Iraq to export oil
worth two billion US dollars for at least six months, or about
700,000 barrels of oil per day, to purchase food and medicine.

KUWAIT CITY, July 3 (Xinhua)-- The United States is still the
main trade partner of Kuwait with U.S. exports to Kuwait
totalling 16 percent of the small emirate's total imports in
1995, according to a report by Kuwait's Ministry of Trade and
Industry.
</P>
<P>
The report said the value of imported U.S. goods reached 368
million Kuwait dinars (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) out of a total
imports of 2.3 billion Kuwait dinar (8 billion dollars) in 1995.
</P>

to the U.S. in 1995.
</P>

According to earlier reports, U.S. exports to Kuwait in 1994
amounted to 1.4 billion dollars, compared with 1.2 billion dollars

<HEADLINE> French Drug Stores to Sell Anti-AIDS Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- French drug stores and pharmacies
could soon be allowed to sell drugs treating AIDS-related
diseases on prescription, the Liberation daily said today.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, AIDS drugs have only been available in hospital and
all HIV patients in France have to be treated in hospital.
</P>
<P>
But a group of French experts has recommended that the
government allow pharmacies to sell the drugs on prescription,
Liberation reported.
</P>
<P>
"The group of experts, with an overwhelming majority,
recommend the distribution of anti-retroviruses that have
been authorized to be put on the market, in accordance with the
existing common laws," said the report submitted to the French
government by the group led by Professor Jean Dormont.
</P>
<P>
The French Secretary of State for Health Herve Gaymand is
expected to publish the report today, and is also believed to
be close to announcing the marketing of anti-AIDS pills in drug
stores.
</P>
<P>
Liberation said that once the recommendation is put into
practice, AIDS will be regarded as a chronic disease in the same
category as those such as diabetes and high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
There are about 37,000 AIDS patients in France now, and one in
every 600 Parisians carries the HIV virus.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar lost ground
against major currencies today as its worse-than-expected current
account deficit triggered a dumping of the currency.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was traded at 78.18 US cents from 78.65
US cents on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was also weaker against the Japanese yen, ending at 86.20
yen from 86.58 yen yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 1.1950 marks against the German
mark from 1.2000 marks on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced yesterday
that the country's current account deficit blew out to 2.153
billion Australian dollars (1.679 billion US dollars) in May from
1.97 billion Australian dollars (1.54 billion US dollars) in
April.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures caused dumping of Australian dollars in
overseas markets last night. Overseas selling interest continued
as the local foreign exchange market opened trade today. But
strong local buying interest from exporters prevent the currency
from falling below 78 US cents.

COLOMBO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is to

tourist industry, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Tourism D. Senanayake said at a press conference

the bomb blast on the Central Bank in downtown Colombo by Tamil
rebels on January 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
Since then, occupancy rates have hovered at around 20 percent
at Colombo's five star hotels, which faced severe difficulties
with threat of retrenchments, Senanayake said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has requested the government to provide

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Secretary Ends Visit to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 3 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind left Saudi Arabia today for Jordan to continue his
two-leg Middle East tour, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind's visit to Saudi Arabia was aimed at ending lingering
concerns about the effect on bilateral relations caused by a Saudi
dissident Mohammed Al-Masari, who has led a bitter campaign
against the Saudi royal family from his base in London.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind said both Britain and Saudi Arabia agree that the issue
of Al-Masari, who was arrested by Saudi police in 1993 and fled to
Yemen and then Britain after his release six months later, "is
relevant to our relations."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held after meeting Saudi Crown Prince
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Rifkind stressed the necessity of
cooperation among the Gulf countries to counter terrorism after
the truck bomb blast in Saudi Arabia on June 25, which killed 19
U.S. servicemen and wounded nearly 400 others of different
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind, who arrived in Saudi Arabia late Monday night for a
two-day visit, was quoted as saying that he had received
assurances from Saudi officials about ensuring the safety of
British citizens in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Saudi Arabia, the British foreign secretary
met with King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and held talks with his Saudi
counterpart Prince Saud a-Faisal al-Saud on the situations in the
Gulf region and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He also discussed with the Saudi leaders the Middle East peace
process and Iraq's implementation of the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind reportedly called for the creation of an international
coalition to fight against terrorism which became "broader and
coordinated" among several groups.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the Saudi-British ties as "important and developing
in the right way," noting that British exports to Saudi Arabia
increased by nine percent in 1995 over 1994 and by 20 percent in
the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
He also met with a number of British businessmen in Saudi
Arabia to discuss the Saudi-British trade cooperation.

<P>
GENEVE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- German media group Kirch won a
bidding battle on Wednesday for television rights to the 2002
and 2006 soccer World Cup finals, sources in the international
football federation FIFA said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Reuter, Kirch made a 2.8 billion
Swiss francs ($2.24 billion) offer in partnership with Swiss
marketing agency ISL, which is majority-owned by Germany's Sporis
company.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to a FIFA executive committee meeting, which made
the decision, said Kirch and ISL had bid 1.3 billion Swiss
francs ($1.04 billion) for the 2002 rights and 1.5 billion Swiss
francs ($1.20 billion) for the 2006 rights.
</P>
<P>
The 2002 finals will be co-hosted by South Korea and Japan.
Germany is the front runner to host the 2006 tournament.
</P>
<P>
The next highest bid for 2.7 billion Swiss francs ($2.16
billion) came from the U.S.-based International Management Group
(IMG), run by leading sports agent Mark McCormack.
</P>
<P>
A public service broadcasters' consortium, led by the
European Broadcasting Union (EBU), was said to have bid 2.2
billion Swiss francs ($1.76 billion) but lost the chance to make
a higher bid.
</P>
<P>
Other bidders were ABC Television, a subsidiary of Walt
Disney and owner of U.S. sports cable network ESPN, Cable TV Hong
Kong and two Swiss-based companies, CWL and TEAM.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk
today thanked the country's Co-Prime Ministers for agreeing to a
royal pardon for an opposition newspaper editor jailed last week
for defaming them.
</P>
<P>
First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen Tuesday accepted the king's proposal to release
Chan Ratana, editor of the Khmer-language Voice of Khmer Youth
newspaper who was jailed on Friday for one year and fined five
million riels (2,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Chan was sued by the two prime ministers in February last year
after his paper, which supports the opposition Khmer Nation Party,
ran a cartoon and story entitled "Ranariddh is more stupid than
Hun Sen three times a day."
</P>
<P>
He was jailed on Friday after the Supreme Court rejected his
appeal last October against the municipal court ruling in February
1995 which sentenced him to a year in prison.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, the king is entitled to grant anyone an
amnesty, but he put forward his proposal in a letter to the prime
ministers, saying he wanted their support before making a decision.
</P>
<P>
He said that while there was no doubt Chan Rattana had
committed a "clear and serious" offence, he should be pardoned.
</P>
<P>
Both co-prime ministers agreed and the king expressed his
thanks in a letter released by the palace, but dated from Beijing,
where he is undergoing medical treatment.

ADDIS ABABA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of Mines and
Energy Izedin Ali said the country has sold 14,925 kg of gold over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency today, in a report presented

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Speed Up Development of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
accelerate the development of telecommunications networks to reach
a ratio of 20 fixed telephone lines for every 100 people by the
year 2020, an official said.
</P>
<P>
"If we fail to reach the figure, Indonesia will be classified
as an underdeveloped nation," Director General of Post and
Telecommunications Djakaria Purawidjaja told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are five million telephone lines in Indonesia
for a population of almost 200 million. The number of mobile
cellular telephone subscribers is estimated at 300,000. In Jakarta
alone, the fixed telephone line density now stands at 11 per 100.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is currently developing telecommunications networks
and infrastructures --including fiber optics, submarine cables,
terrestrial gateways and satellites -- for both fixed
telecommunications lines and cellular services.
</P>
<P>
"We will learn from what is happening in Japan now," Djakaria
said. "The telephone line density in that country is 40 per 100."
</P>
<P>
He said that the total population in Indonesia in 2020 is
predicted to reach 250 million. "The number of fixed telephone
lines in that year should reach at least 20 percent of the total
population, while the number of mobile cellular telephone lines
should be between 10 percent and 20 percent of the country's total
number of telephone lines," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
The government has set a target of at least 6.5 million
additional telephone lines during the ongoing sixth five-year
development plan period ending March 1999.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Softens Stance on Nigeria, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela may have changed his views on the human rights record of
the Nigerian government and its commitment to the transition to
civil rule program, the Guardian newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was quoted as telling French journalists in
Johannesburg yesterday that he had softened his position
following appeals from the United Nations Secretary-General
Boutrous Boutrous-Ghali and west African countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Nigeria and South Africa deteriorated
followning the execution last November of nine minority rights
activists inclduding writer Ken Saro-Wiwa for murder of four
Ogoni men.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela played a major role in the Commonwealth's
suspension of Nigeria amid international outcry against the
hanging of the nine Ogoni activists.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he hoped the Nigerian issue would be tabled at
the Organisation of African Unity summit this week in Yaounde,
capital of Cameroun, because ''there will be a variety of
opinions'' among participants.
</P>
<P>
As for the appeals, the president quoted Boutros-Ghali as
saying ''Nigeria takes responsibility for law and security in
Sierra Leone and Liberia in view of the civil war and the peace
keeping efforts.''
</P>
<P>
On the west African countries, Mandela said they pleaded: ''we
depend economically on Nigeria. If you attack Nigeria, you attack
all of us.''
</P>
<P>
The appeal, like that of the UN secretary-general, is
something ''I cannot ignore,'' he added.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Mixed Feelings About Environment in 3 Major Chinese Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators say they have
mixed feelings about the environmental situation in Beijing,
Tianjin and Shanghai, three of the country's largest cities, after
having taken a look at them since April.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have increased efforts to enforce environmental
laws in the three and have had some progress in improving the
environment, but the general outlook is "far from optimistic."
</P>
<P>
This remark came from Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the
National People's Congress Standing Committee, who led the
inspections tour, at a meeting today of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The three cities still have a long way to go in protecting
their environment and to reach the level called for by central
authorities, public expectations, and reasonable standards of
modern city dwellers," Wang told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors said they were happy that the three major cities
have put 1.5 to 2 percent of the GDP in environment protection
over the past five years, much more than the country's average,
and they also lead the country in building
environmentally-friendly infrastructure, preventing and
controlling industrial pollution, protecting water resources, and
developing ecologically-safe agriculture.
</P>
<P>
They have come up with local regulations to add to state laws
on environment protection and formed a basic legal framework, the
senior lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has used foreign investment for environment projects,
with 1.6 billion yuan having been put into sewage treatment
recently. Beijing planted 32.4 percent of its land in trees by the
end of last year, and Tianjin has brought its drinking water
nearly 100 percent in line with national standards by controlling
water pollution near its water sources.
</P>
<P>
To curb industrial pollution, the three major cities shut down
the worst polluters or moved them to less populated areas. Lower
consumption of energy is being encouraged to reduce emissions
during production.
</P>
<P>
Beijing and Tianjin have also built "green belts" around urban
areas to protect water resources and to prevent soil erosion.

<HEADLINE> HK To Set Up Mortgage Corporation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA), the de facto central bank in the territory, announced
today that it will set up a mortgage corporation which will play a
key role in developing a vibrant secondary market for home loans.
</P>
<P>
The founding of a mortgage corporation is based on HKMA's
projection that there will be a potential shortfall in mortgage
funds provided by private banks in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
According to HKMA, if the home ownership ratio in Hong Kong
continues to rise with a completion of 60,000 private residential
units per annum in the next ten years, there is likely to be a
substantial shortage of home loans.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that property related loans, including
residential mortgages have risen steadily over the past 15 years.
It is estimated that 26 percent of the total loans in Hong Kong's
banking system flew to property market in 1980, and the ratio
increased to 39 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The risk of the banking system is going to be higher unless a
secondary market is developed through the founding of the mortgage
corporation, sources from HKMA said.
</P>
<P>
The corporation will develop its business in two phases,
starting with the purchase of mortgage loans from banks for its
own portfolio, followed by the issue of mortgage-backed
securities. It will be owned by the government initially through
the Exchange Fund with a capital base of one billion HK dollars
(128 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
A two-month consultation exercise has been conducted on the
establishment of the mortgage corporation, soliciting views from
the banking sector, capital market participants, real estate
developers, political groups and academics.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam, chief executive of the HKMA said that the overall
reaction was favorable, indicating broad agreement that a mortgage
corporation will contribute to banking and monetary stability,
debt market development and home financing.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the mortgage corporation will start operation
in 12 months' time.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's unit trust industry
attracted total net inflows of 484.73 million US dollars in the
first five months of this year, as compared with 17.33 million US
dollars recorded in the corresponding period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association
(HKIFA), gross sales in the period amounted to 1,872.46 million
US dollars, up by 34.4 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Lo, chairman of the HKIFA, said that the sales trend in
1996 has been very encouraging. This year's gross sales
consistently stayed above 300 million US dollars, which only
happened twice in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The continuous high net inflows boosted the asset size of the
HKIFA to a record high of nearly 40 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In terms of individual sectors' gross sales, the top three in
May were single Asian economy equity, cash funds, and
international equity.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the first five months, cash funds had consistently
stayed at the top two in the gross sales table. On a year-to-date
basis, it pulled in gross sales of 316.1 million US dollars,
taking up 16.9 percent of the industry's aggregate total.

<HEADLINE> British Police to Be Given New Right to Bug Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Policemen in Britain will be given
legal powers to break into private property and plant bugging
devices against targeted criminals, according to a report reaching
here today from Manchester.
</P>
<P>
Legislation will place covert surveillance by police on a
similar basis to MI5. The security service can obtain warrants
from the Home Secretary for break-ins but police rely on
authorization from senior officers.
</P>
<P>
The legislation will be outlined in the Queen's Speech in the
autumn. Home Secretary Michael Howard told chief constables on
Tuesday that an independent commissioner would be appointed to
oversee the use of the warrants and investigate complaints.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the summer conference of the Association of Chief
Police Officers in Manchester, where an IRA bomb last month shock
the whole Britain, Howard said listening devices often provided a
crucial piece of the jigsaw in cracking crime.
</P>
<P>
The creation of a national crime squad and reorganizing the
National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) are also moves
discussed at the conference to combat the gangs. The squad will
have l,200 officers from the six regional crime squads.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the NCIS, which collates intelligence on criminals,
would get a chief constable and its supervisory authority.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Feelings About Environment in 3 Major Chinese Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, inspectors worry about the problems the three cities
still face because of environmental degradation, which include:
</P>
<P>
-- the gap between water supply and demand is increasing, water
resources become severely polluted, and the three cities face a
crisis in water shortages and lower water quality;
</P>
<P>
-- air pollution caused by large-scale coal burning and an
increasing number of automobiles;
</P>
<P>
-- the double threat of industrial and consumption-related
pollution because of the unreasonable production structure and
allocations, the population, and the high density of building;
</P>
<P>
-- energy and natural resources being excessively consumed in
urban areas, and water and soil not being protected in rural
areas, as a result pollution caused by consuming natural resources
grows serious.
</P>
<P>
The senior lawmaker said that the three major cities are
crucial to China's national economic and social development, and
should set themselves up as models for the rest of the country in
protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he believes the three cities have the ability
to tackle these problems and meet the central authorities' demands.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the tour, Wang suggested several measures for
the three cities for controlling pollution and protecting the
environment: Local leaders should increase environmental
awareness, macro-economic controls, and improve the comprehensive
management system.

<HEADLINE> Interview: HK Will continue to Be Prosperous: Canadian Businessman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's future will be quite
good, and there is every reason to believe that Canadian
businesses will remain in Hong Kong after 1997, said Hugh
Gillespie, Chairman of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
"So far Hong Kong has been a free and fair place to do
business, I believe that after 1997 Hong Kong will still allow
businessmen to feel that they can operate in Hong Kong comfortably
and possibly," said Gillespie in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua this week.
</P>
<P>
Gillespie assumed the position of Chairman in March this
year. He came to Hong Kong in 1988 to become a lawyer in Fred Kan
&AMP; Co., a joint venture law firm between Hong Kong and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in 1977, the Canadian Chamber of
Commerce in Hong Kong has worked hard to foster bilateral trade
and investment between the two economies. The chamber is now the
largest Canadian chamber of commerce outside Canada.
</P>
<P>
Gillespie said that Hong Kong boasts fairly complete
infrastructures, both hard and soft, which include convenient
transportation and telecommunications facilities, efficient legal
systems and laws, a highly competent professional services
industry and competitive and efficient financial markets in which
to raise capital for doing business in Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland
and elsewhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
"For anyone who want to do business in China, Hong Kong will
remain the best place," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China is a great support to Hong Kong's business
potentials. If the success of China's opening and reform policies
continues, Hong Kong will surely become more prosperous, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think that will happen and I think Hong Kong's future is
quite good," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the history of business relations between Canada
and Hong Kong is very long, and Canada is a major player in Hong
Kong, enjoying privileged access at all levels.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a trade partner, Hong Kong is becoming
increasingly important to Canada. In 1994 Canadian exports to Hong
Kong rose by 49 percent over the previous year, while in 1995
Canadian exports to Hong Kong increased a further 50 percent to
1.75 billion Canadian dollars (1.29 billion U.S. dollars), and
two-way trade reached three billion Canadian dollars (2.2 billion
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> New Fighting Erupts at Green Line Dividing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 3 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were killed
and more than a dozen others wounded this morning in the latest
round of factional fighting in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the war-torn city were awakened by the thunder of
heavy shellings from fighters loyal to north Mogadishu warlord
Ali Mahdi Mohamed and those in support of Mohamed Farah Aidid,
who dominates the southern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
Anti-aircraft missiles, 120 mm mortar rounds, rocket propelled
grenades, recoilless rifles and heavy and small machine guns were
being used in the fighting at the green line dividing the city.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the office of Ali Mahdi said the fighting is
aimed at easing the pressure of Aidid on Medina neighborhood
where the clansmen of Ali Mahdi live.
</P>
<P>
Aidid has been holding a siege on Medina district since the
fall of the strategic point of K-7 to his forces a week ago. Only
pedestrians are allowed to go in or out carrying nothing.
</P>
<P>
Reports say Medina is now short of food and receives no
vegetables at all. There is no word yet from the self-claimed
government of Aidid over the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi told a press conference on Tuesday that his alliance
won't tolerate the siege on Medina.
</P>
<P>
"We'll impose an overall sanctions on Mogadishu in general if
the siege on Medina is not lifted immediately," he warned.

"For example, Manulife is a large insurance company with more
than 2,000 employees operating in Hong Kong," he said, adding that
Manulife has been here for nearly a century.
</P>
<P>
"Canadians are very well positioned to take advantage of the
many business opportunities both here and on the mainland," he
said. "Hong Kong is the undisputed gateway to China, and I
encourage Canadians to use it as such."
</P>
<P>
He said Northern Telecom is one of the most successful Canadian
companies which have used Hong Kong as a gateway to develop
business on the mainland. Now quite a few of the company's senior
staff have moved from Hong Kong to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Another company that has been very successful but more recently
is Manulife, which has just won the first Sino-foreign insurance
joint venture license in April this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the law firm he is working with has also extended its
business into the mainland. The law firm will open its first
office in China later this year in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
He said that currently there are about one million Chinese
living in Canada, and many of them came from Hong Kong. As a
result, the two places have strong social, economic and cultural
links, he said.
</P>
<P>
After China resumes the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong
Kong, these links will be further strengthened, he said.

<HEADLINE> Klaus Remains as Czech Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel today
reappointed the incumbent Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus as head of
the new cabinet to be formed on Thursday and asked him for the
line-up.
</P>
<P>
Havel appealed to Klaus's outgoing government, which lost its
parliamentary majority in elections a month ago, to remain as a
caretaking cabinet until a new minority government was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
Klaus's conservative Civic Democratic Party (ODS) won out in
the elections held a month ago. By law, the head of the winning
party will take the post of prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that the most important task for the new government is
to submit an administration program to the parliament for approval.
</P>
<P>
Klaus, a right-wing economist whose government is expected to
be made up of his ODS and the same junior partners from the
outgoing government, the Christian Democrats and the Civil
Democratic Alliance (ODA), will have to form his coalition with
support from the opposition Social Democrats, whose deputies have
won key positions in parliament including the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Under the coalition deal, the ODS gets eight seats in cabinet
including ministers of foreign affairs, finance and the interior
affairs, while the junior partners share the remaining eight
portfolios equally.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's "Special" Homes for the Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has turned several
kindergartens into homes for the elderly, whose numbers are
increasing rapidly at a time when many kindergartens' enrollments
are dropping.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's total population started to decline in 1993, and the
number of new babies also dropped.
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Statistics Bureau says that in 1995, the number
of children in local kindergartens was 136,000, a drop of more
than 60 percent from the previous year, and the number of children
going to nurseries also dropped. At the same time, the number of
elderly was climbing rapidly, increasing the demand for facilities
for the aged.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now has some 2.3 million people at or above the age of
60. When one figures that 5 percent of them will need care in
homes for the elderly, at least 110,000 beds will be needed. There
are, however, fewer than 10,000 beds available in homes for the
elderly in urban and suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
Turning idle kindergartens into homes for the elderly,
therefore, seems to be a good idea. So far the city has turned
three kindergartens into homes for the elderly, which help ease
the problem of shortage of facilities.

our average inflation forecast for 1996 to 10.1 percent from 8.5
percent."

positive trend in the Philippine economy this year, with the

<HEADLINE> China Accuses US Firm of Selling Contaminated Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 3 (Xinhua) --China accused a US company of
violating a contract agreement and selling China 78 tons of steel
that was seriously contaminated with radioactivity.
</P>
<P>
"China has sent an official inquiry, asking the US side to send
people to China to discuss how to handle this problem," the port
commission of Tianjin municipal government said here today.
</P>
<P>
The seven containers of contaminated steel arrived in Tianjin
aboard the "Gregor 0029" on June 17, according to commission
members.
</P>
<P>
"The steel was purchased by the Materials Recycling Corporation
of China's Ministry of Internal Trade from the Material-Re-Sources
Inc. in the US," the Tianjin officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to a contract signed between the two sides last
March, the steel must be high-quality waste steel from equipment
used in the petroleum business.
</P>
<P>
The cargo left Houston on May 31 and arrived in Tianjin on June
17. On June 26 the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau discovered
that the amount of gamma rays in Number 3 container was as high as
3000ur/h, or 30 times the Chinese national limit and a clear
violation of Chinese environmental protection laws.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and environmental protection
departments were highly alarmed by the incident and transferred
the steel to a nuclear industry warehouse in the city's suburbs.
</P>
<P>
When the Chinese company informed the American firm about this,
the Americans said that the steel contained only a small amount of
radioactive material and was within the limits of the US
Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
But the laboratory tests conducted by researchers from the
Chinese nuclear industry showed that the gamma rays at their
maximum were 6000ur/h, more than 20 times the international limit
of 250ur/h.
</P>
<P>
"The steel can be classified as material harmful to the
environment and human beings," the Tianjin officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese officials say they hope the Americans will send
people to China to discuss handling the contaminated steel in
accordance with international practices.

<HEADLINE> Iran Sets Water Consumption Ceiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Tehran government today
announced a water consumption ceiling for 10 million residents
in summer season with the maximum temperature 45 degrees
centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Because of water shortage in the capital, the municipal
authorities set the ceiling of 22.5 cubic meters for every
five- member family per month.
</P>
<P>
The new decision of the water ceiling was carried in all
local Persian dailies. The authorities asked those residents who
consume water beyond the limit to reexamine and adjust their
usage or face periodic water cuts.
</P>
<P>
There have been repeated warnings in recent weeks by the
Energy Ministry and its affiliated Tehran Water Company that
the absence of economization in the consumption of water would
lead to daily water cuts.
</P>
<P>
The people in Tehran are extravagant water users,
particularly those in northern parts of the city with large
garden and swimming pools. Some people there water their plants
twice a day.
</P>
<P>
Local media abound with pictures in recent weeks that
show people washing their automobiles with precious drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
Some specialists hold that the increase in water consumption
level is not merely the result of extravagant use but also
the growing population of Tehran, which attracts migrants from
all over the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Tehran Water Company, the city's consumption level
usually rises considerably in summer. A comparison of water use
Monday with that of same day last year shows an increase
of eight percent, or a total of 2.7 million cubic meters a
day.
</P>
<P>
If such water consumption continues in Tehran, the city
will need the water five times more than the present standard,
according to the Energy Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has already alarmed the public,
particularly the residents in Tehran, the danger of water
shortage and criticized those who waste water resources.
</P>
<P>
The water for Tehran is supplied by two large reservoirs
-- one in the east and the other in the west. Since the
water consumption grows, the city has to procure the water
from distant places and at higher cost.

<HEADLINE> Syria Endeavors to Remove Differences between </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian initiative aimed at
removing the differences between Bahrain and Iran has been crowned
with success.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Bahrain have come to an agreement to halt mutual media
attacks against each other over the Bahraini charges that Iran was
behind a plot to topple its government as an initial step toward
improving the relations between them.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad had charged his Foreign
Minister Farouq al-Shara with mediating between Bahrain and Iran,
who twice visited the Iranian capital of Tehran and the Bahraini
capital of Manama recently.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister conveyed a message from President
al-Assad to both Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani and Emir
of Bahrain Sheikh Isa Bin Suleiman al-Khalifa with the aim of
tackling the differences between the two countries through
brotherly dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini-Iranian differences began to emerge after the
occurrence of a number of bombings in Manama. Bahrain has accused
Iran of interfering in its internal affairs and of plotting a coup
to overthrow the ruling family, but this has been categorically
denied by Iran.
</P>
<P>
The recent Cairo Arab summit stood by Bahrain and called in its
final statement on Iran not to interfere in the affairs of the
Gulf Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Since Syria has good relations with both Iran and Bahrain, it
has mediated between them with the aim of getting their differences
settled.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian newspaper Teshreen said in its editorial today that
inter-Arab divisions and Arab-Islamic differences pose a threat
to the security of both the Arab and Islamic worlds.
</P>
<P>
Syria believes that Arab-Iranian cooperation is at present a top
necessity and an urgent need to protect the region from foreign
interventions.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that the Syrian mediation
between Bahrain and Iran is intended to bring Arab states and
Iran closer together so that the region can counter the policy
adopted by the new right-wing Israeli government which rejects
the land-for-peace principle in achieving a fair and overall
peace in the Middle East.

<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The world's communications and
computer giants, such as IBM and Northern Telecom, are showing
strong interest in China's data communications market.
</P>
<P>
The data communications industry in China is developing very
rapidly and there is "much to be done" in the field, William
R. Bowles, vice-chairman and president of IBM Great China Group,
said at the '96 International Exhibition on Technologies and
Services of Data Communications Network, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
IBM has seven research labs around the globe, one of which is

Chinese graduates so that their research can be tied to China's
market needs.
</P>
<P>
IBM has seven branches and 32 maintenance outlets in China,
with more than 1,000 employees, and Bowles said that IBM will
enhance its competitiveness in China by providing the best
products and service available.
</P>
<P>
Andrew T. Chen, director of sales and marketing of Canada's
Northern Telecom, expressed enthusiasm in the company's prospects
in China. Northern Telecom has set up one wholly-funded and eight

<HEADLINE> CPC Official on Party's External Links (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua)-- The Communist Party of China (CPC),
celebrating its 75th birthday, has expanded its external links,
which is closely connected with the development of diplomatic
relations of the country as a whole, a top official has said.
</P>
<P>
For many years, the CPC has used its links with political
parties of foreign countries to pave the way for formal diplomatic
ties between China and many other countries, said Li Shuzheng,
head of the International Liaison Department of the CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The CPC's external links have ushered in a new phase, as
political party diplomacy has been playing a unique role in the
development of the overall diplomacy of the country, said Li in an
article carried in today's People's Daily to mark the 75th
anniversary of the founding of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Ever since its founding in 1921, the CPC has attached
importance to developing its overseas links, gaining sympathy and
support from the overseas friends, while voicing support for the
just cause of people in the world, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Particularly after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC
Central Committee in 1978, the Party has made major readjustments
to its policy on external work, to meet the needs and changes of
the internal and external situations.
</P>
<P>
The readjustments have greatly advanced the Party's external
links, and allowed its external work to continue to play a unique
role in serving China's modernization drive, Li says.
</P>
<P>
The role of political parties has become more conspicuous in
the post-Cold War years, in which political parties in many
countries have undergone great realignments and major
reorganizations, Li said, adding that in several countries some
influential and long-time ruling parties have lost political
power, or have even been dismissed, while many new political
parties have cropped up like "Bamboo Shoots After Spring Rain".
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the situation, the CPC has actively engaged
in establishing links in various forms with both the old and the
new political parties in all countries, thus enhancing mutual
understanding and cooperation, and exerting a unique role in
helping stabilize and develop state-to-state relations, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In promoting its external links, the CPC has adhered to the
principles of not intervening in the internal affairs of the other
parties and the countries, and respecting the choice of other
parties in determining the development road of their respective
countries, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
CPC has So far established links with more than 300 political
parties in 120 countries and regions, Li noted.

<P>
With changes both in domestic and international situations,
especially since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central
Committee, Li noted, the CPC has greatly adjusted its purposes,
guidelines and policies governing the party's foreign exchanges.
</P>
<P>
At the 12th CPC National Congress, she said, the principles of
"self-independence, complete equality, mutual-respect and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs" were formally
put into the party's constitution.
</P>
<P>
These principles were further defined as guidelines for
party-to-party relations at the 13th CPC National Congress.
</P>
<P>
These principles undoubtedly have shown clearly the direction
and explored a broad prospect for the foreign exchanges of the
CPC, she said.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that the starting point of the principles is
that party-to-party relations should follow the spirit of seeking
common grounds, while reserving differences, and social systems
and ideology should not be a prerequisite for such relations.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of developing party-to-party relations is to
conduct cooperation on issues such as peace and development, as
well as to promote country-to-country ties, instead of imposing
one's ideology on others, or interfering in internal affairs of
other nations, she said.
</P>
<P>
The CPC has successfully maintained and developed its relations
with parties with different ideologies by setting aside
divergences through concerted efforts, she noted.

<P>
CPC's external links have also contributed to restoring or
improving China's relations with other countries, and to forging
formal diplomatic ties with some countries through establishing
political party links first, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Party's external links with political parties in foreign
countries which have not yet formed diplomatic relations with
China have proved to be of great advantage in bridging
country-to-country relations, She noted.
</P>
<P>
Li cited the example of the CPC's links with political parties
in many Latin American countries, which resulted in the
establishment of diplomatic ties. At the moment, CPC has
established links with 24 political parties in 10 Latin American
countries which have no diplomatic ties with China, she said,
adding that CPC has also sent delegations to visit eight of the 10
countries. This has helped establish close relations between
senior party, government and parliamentary leaders in China and
the countries, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
CPC's external links have also proved helpful and effective in
promoting Sino-Foreign economic and trade relations. In the world
today in which economic factors are playing increasingly important
role in international relations, the CPC, like many political
parties in other countries, has a strong desire to strengthen
China's economic cooperations with other countries through
party-to-party links, or through establishing links between
economic entities affiliated to certain political parties, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In this aspect, Li added, the party's external links have done
a great deal to bridge Chinese and overseas enterprises,
introducing foreign capital to China and importing technology and
technical personnel.
</P>
<P>
At present institutions and the economic liaison center, under
International Liaison Department of the CPC Central Committee,
have established business links with more than 140 firms in 81
countries and regions, she disclosed.

<HEADLINE> China, Uzbekistan Affirm Support for Peace in Central Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TASHKENT, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin met here today with his Uzbek counterpart Islam Karimov,
expressing support for the maintenance of peace and stability in
central Asia.
</P>
<P>
During the talks held at the Dyrmen State Guest House, Jiang
said Uzbekistan is a country with important influence in the
central Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Karimov, who briefed Jiang on the situation in central Asia,
said that there exist some elements of instability and that his
country is advocating strengthening of security cooperation and
taking measures to ensure peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the bilateral relationship, Jiang said the two countries are
close neighbors although they don't have common borders.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties four years ago, he
said, the two countries have made headway in mutually-beneficial
cooperation in politics, economy and trade, science and
technology, culture and education, and other fields.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with all these and value the personal
contributions made by President Karimov," Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the smooth development of bilateral friendly and
cooperative ties to the attention and strategic considerations of
leaders of the two countries, to both sides' adherence to the
principles set forth when the diplomatic relations were
established, and to their close cooperation and support in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Leaders of our two countries should map out our future
relationship from a strategic height toward the 21st century to
enable it to benefit our two peoples, and peace and stability in
the region and the world as a whole," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We have every reason to believe that the Sino-Uzbek friendly
and cooperative relations have great potential and prospect," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang thanked Uzbekistan for its understanding and support
concerning the issues of Taiwan, Tibet and anti-separatism
efforts. He said China will as always support Uzbekistan in its
efforts to safeguard national independence and sovereignty,
stabilize domestic situation and develop its national economy.
</P>
<P>
Karimov said his country attaches importance to China's role in
international affairs and expressed the hope that the two sides
will promote cooperation and consultation in this area.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said bilateral economic and trade cooperation have made
remarkable progress in recent years thanks to their joint efforts,
but they still lag far behind their potential.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore hope our respective departments will strengthen
cooperation and actively explore new ways and methods in line with
international trade practices and characteristics of our two
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is our shared wish to continuously expand and develop
bilateral economic and trade cooperation and enhance common
prosperity; we are confident of their prospects," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Karimov said the two countries now have some 30 cooperative
agreements, which, together with the five more to be signed here
later, will give a new impetus to bilateral economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to see more joint ventures and more Chinese
commodities in Uzbekistan, and we also hope the cooperative ties
in the fields of culture, science and technology will further
develop, in order to push forward our comprehensive relations to a
new and higher level," he added.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the issue of transportation,
deeming it an indispensable element in expanding bilateral
cooperation and their cooperation with other central Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
They called on countries concerned in the region to increase
consultations and exhaust all feasible ways to improve their own
transportation and gradually establish an air, railway and highway
network among them to rejuvenate the ancient "Silk Road."
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here Tuesday for a two-day state visit, the
fourth leg of his current tour which has taken him to Spain,
Norway and Romania and will lead him to Kyrgyzstan and
Kazakhstan.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 3 (Xinhua) --The Kenyan Minister for
Commerce and Industry has urged the Tanzanian business community
to make more effort to eliminate the existing trade gap with
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Tanzanian businessmen on the occasion of the Kenya
Day at the Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair on Monday
evening,the Kenyan Minister for Commerce and Industry Krugi
M'Mukundia said that Tanzania has an abundance of natural
resources such as gas reserves, precious stones and other
minerals which could have established a huge potential market in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
But for quite a long time, the trade balance had been in
Kenya's favour, the minister observed, emphasising that the
business community in Kenya was compelled to work harder than
their counterparts in neighbouring countries to narrow the trade
gap.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tanzania was placed third in 1994 as the source
of Kenyan imports from African countries, it moved to number two
position after South Africa in 1995, having overtaken Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He told Bilateral trade between the two countries had grown
10-fold in the last five year, from about 1.3 billion Kenya
Shillings (22 million U.S.Dollars) in 1991 to 13.2 Kenya
Shillings (220 million U.S.Dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Abdallah Kigoda, the Tanzanian Minister for Trade and
Industries, said that ministerial meetings will be arranged to
discuss ways of removing bottlenecks hampering trade between the
two countries.

<HEADLINE> New Measures Being Taken to Protect Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 3 (Xinhua)-- A radio communication network for
Forest Officers and a special police unit are the new measures
being taken by The Sri Lankan Forestry Authorities to combat the
illegal felling of timber, according to official sources here
today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the Ministry of Agriculture, Lands and
Forestry is to introduce new measures to punish those who violate
the forestry law and to detect the illegal felling of trees within
the country's reserved forest cover.
</P>
<P>
The sources told local press this morning that Minister D. M.
Jayaratne has decided to provide a radio communication network to
the forest officers who operate in the interior of the forest.
</P>
<P>
They said that the radio network is expected to greatly improve
the capability of forest officers to detect and intercept anyone
involved in illegal tree felling.
</P>
<P>
In the past, forest officers were helpless in intercepting
timber pirates as they lacked the necessary means of communication
with their offices, the sources pointed out, adding that with the
introduction of the radio network their capability is expected to
be greatly enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry has increased the fine for illegal
felling of trees to 100,000 rupees (about 1,820 US dollars) from
the current 10,000 rupees (about 182 US dollars).

<HEADLINE> First Private-built Jail Opens in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Germany's first private jail has been
put into operation near the coastal port city of Rostock in the
northeastern Mecklenburg state, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The jail, built by a Hamburg private company at the cost of 80
million marks, ushered in the first group of prisoners on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Mecklenburg government, which plans to lease the jail for
30 years, will pay 7 million marks (4.58 million U.S. dollars)
annually for the use of the jail.
</P>
<P>
The prison has 228 separate cells and can accommodate 234
inmates at most.
</P>
<P>
At a handover ceremony of the jail, Rolf Eggert, justice chief
of the Mecklenburg State, said the government saved spending by
leasing the jail rather than building it.
</P>
<P>
It will cost 322,000 marks for the government to provide
accommodation for each prisoner in a government-built jail, not
including the affiliated facilities. However, the government may
save more than 100,000 marks by leasing the private prison, Eggert
said.

<P>
TASHKENT, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China attaches great importance to
developing its ties with Uzbekistan, Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said in a meeting with Uzbek Supreme Assembly (parliament) Speaker
Erkin Khalilov here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that in the past five years, Uzbekistan has made
encouraging achievements in maintaining social stability, national
harmony and in developing economy.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan has successfully promoted its status and influence
in the international arena by actively engaging in world affairs,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a friend and close neighbor, we feel wholeheartedly
delighted about this," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said China was satisfied to see the
continuous strengthening and developing of the Sino-Uzbek
relations as cooperation and exchanges in all fields between the two
countries have expanded and confidence between them increased in
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the exchanges between the parliaments of
China and Uzbekistan are a key part of the bilateral relations,
and that such contacts have helped promote understanding and
friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
"We fully support the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC)
in strengthening exchanges and cooperation on all levels with the
Uzbek Supreme Assembly, so as to make more and greater
contribution to the development of the bilateral relations," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
Khalilov said the Uzbeck Supreme Assembly wishes to cooperate
with the Chinese NPC as it actively participates in international
inter-parliamentary activities.

The parliament speaker spoke highly of China's remarkable
achievements in economic reform, adding that the Uzbek people pay
much respect to the Chinese people.
</P>

Law in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin.

paying close attention to environmental protection and have had
some noteworthy results, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, however, the environmental protection situation
in the cities is no cause for optimism because of rapid growth of
urban populations and increased energy consumption, he explained.

development, increasing environmental protection, and improving

Chalker to put retribution on to the British High Commissioner
here.
</P>

Chalker was reacting to complaints made by a Kenyan Opposition
delegation over a speech by Simon Hemans predicting a KANU
victory. The Kenyan opposition delegatilon, headed by FORD-Asili
Chairman Knneth Matiba, visited London recently.
</P>
<P>
The delegation demanded the immediate removal of the High
Commissioner for overstepping his mandate.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israel Licenses Five Oil Drills off Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has
awarded the first five licenses to drill for oil in the Israeli
deep waters in the Mediterranean, reported The Jerusalem Post
today.
</P>
<P>
The winning consortium, headed by Avner Oil and Gas Ltd.,
intends to drill off the coast at unspecified locations between
Haifa and the Gaza Strip by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
The first stage is to find further financial and technical
partners, followed by a seismic study of the area between October
and December, according to Avner's Managing Director Eli
Rosenberg. "Drilling will hopefully begin before the end of
1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg dismissed suggestions that the total cost of the
project will be around 1 billion U.S. dollars. He estimated that
the initial drilling, at a 1,500 meter-depth, will cost 25 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's deep waters appear to be very promising," said the
government's Director of Petroleum Research, Dr. Yehezkel
Druckman, who granted the licenses.
</P>
<P>
This confidence stems from the results of previous drillings
in the nearby shallow waters by Isramco in the early 1990s, which
suggested the area is oil rich.
</P>
<P>
Avner, together with Delek Kiduchim and Enserch Middle East,
had to be granted five licenses to carry out the project, because
each only covers 400 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
While experts agree that the area could prove lucrative, there
is a variance of opinion as to how much oil is needed to make the
operation economically viable. Druckman suggested a minimum of
3,000 to 5,000 barrels a day while others believe more would be
needed.
</P>
<P>
"For a successful well in that depth of water, they need
thousands of barrels," said Yaron Ran, the managing director of
Israel National Oil Company.
</P>
<P>
Avner, which claims the support of many international oil
companies, said a former vice-president of the world's largest
publicly owned oil company, Exxon Corporation, described the
prospects as "world-class."

<HEADLINE> Farmers' Debts Rising in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Farm debts in Australia have been
gradually but steadily rising over the 1980s and 1990s, an
official survey available here today said.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of the farm debts to the gross value of
production for the Agricultural sector has risen from around 59
percent in 1984-85 to 76 percent in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that about 96,000 farmers, or 80 percent of
the Australian farmers, are having debts totaling nearly 19
billion Australian dollars (14.6 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The estimate does not include loans from members of the farm
business or from family members outside of the farm business,
according to the survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics.
</P>
<P>
The total farm business debt by the end of June 1995 is
estimated at nearly 17.9 billion Australian dollars (13.7 billion
US dollars) based on monthly Reserve Bank data.
</P>
<P>
A local report today quoted Minister for Primary Industries
Anderson as saying that he was determined to halt a situation that
30 farmers are leaving their land per week.
</P>
<P>
"Amongst those, some are in absolutely desperate circumstances,
we have to make sure we have policies to help farmers who see no
future exit with dignity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said what has to be done is to reduce cost. "The
cost of transport, processing, regulation, finance and the cost of
employing people have all got right out of control," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Farmers Federation argued that almost
two billion Australian dollars (1.54 billion US dollars) are
unfairly extracted from farmers annually by government monetary
policy, direct and indirect taxes and high bank margins.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli
said today that the increase of revenues in China in 1995 passed
that of expenditures, bringing the deficit below the figure called
for in the budget.
</P>
<P>
Liu delivered a report on the final budget of the central
government last year to the 20th meeting of the Standing Committee
of the Eighth National People's Congress, China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
He said that revenues and expenditures in 1995 were basically
in line with the budget approved at the Third Session of the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Total revenues were 386.66 billion yuan, 101 percent of the
budget and an increase of 11.2 percent over the previous fiscal
year's figure.
</P>
<P>
The central government has used the increased revenues to put
more into the middle and western parts of the country and to
provide grain subsidies, disaster relief and deficit compensations.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that total expenditures last year were 452.945 billion
yuan, 100.8 percent of the budget and an increase of 9.3 percent
over the previous year.

The state's deficit stood at 66.28 billion yuan, 398 million
yuan lower than the budget called for.

MOSCOW, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today voted in private in the presidential election runoff at a
rural residence outside Moscow, said Kremlin spokesman Sergei
Medvedev.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, the incumbent president facing a strong challenge from
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, was scheduled to vote in
the city, but changed his plan because of "too many journalists
there," said Medvedev.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin voted at his rural residence in Barvikha, the place
where he recovered from a heart attack last October.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent president has not been seen in public for a
week. Officials said he was suffering from a hoarse voice or a
cold but, after two heart attacks last year, the incident has
sparked speculations about his health.
</P>
<P>
Russians living in the less populated Far East began voting
earlier today in good weather, which electoral officials said
might help the turnout.
</P>
<P>
But in Russia's far east, the turnout in the runoff was several
points lower than in the first round by midday Wednesday, the
electoral commission was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
First-round turnout was just under 70 percent and Yeltsin's
campaigners deem that he could be in trouble if it fell below 60
percent this time.

SHANGHAI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai will be the venue for two
international exhibitions on woodworking machinery and furniture
and fittings in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to Adsale Exhibition Services of Hong Kong, one of

equipment for making plywood and furniture.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition's purpose is to help China introduce advanced
technology and upgrade its furniture industry.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, China's urban residents will have a living
space averaging eight square meters per capita, meaning that
Chinese will be spending more money on furniture and other types
of home improvements.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is a natural place to hold the exhibitions because it
is China's leading commercial and industrial center, and home to

<P>
LHASA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Tibet Autonomous Region is to
concentrate on speeding up the development of energy, transport
and telecommunications over the next five years, according to the
regional government Chairman Gyalcan Norbu.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We'll be able to create a sustaining strength for
the rapid and sound growth of Tibet's economy in the future."
</P>
<P>
An official at the Regional Planning Commission said that over
the next five years efforts will be made to develop hydropower
resources, thermal and solar energy and wind power.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, power plants or stations will be built in the 19
counties where electricity is now unavailable, he said, adding
that all counties will have electricity at the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Tibet will generate 1.1 billion kwh of electricity annually in
the year 2000, up 120 percent from 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
Exploration of oil and gas in Lunbula in northern Tibet will be
accelerated, he said, adding that the place will be built into an
oilfield with an annual production capacity of 50,000 to 80,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
The highway linking Tibet with neighboring Qinghai Province, and
the road linking Tibet with neighboring Sichuan Province, will be
upgraded and widened during the 1996-2000 period, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, air routes from the regional capital of Lhasa to
coastal cities will open Tibet to the rest of the world, special
economic zones, tourist attractions and major cities in southwest
China, he said.
</P>
<P>
The oil pipelines between Lhasa and Golmud in Qinghai Province
will be upgraded to increase its annual oil transport capacity to
250,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
At the end of this century, all counties will be connected by
the national long-distance direct dialing telephone network, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> China's Schoolyard Businesses Earn Billions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of schools across China
have been given a lesson in running businesses as part of the
reforms sweeping the country.
</P>
<P>
And so many are so successful that their schoolyard enterprises
are netting huge profits.
</P>
<P>
Official figures released here today show that more than 770
campus companies each earned profits of over a million yuan
(125,000 US dollars) in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Their rich pickings were ploughed back into education because
schools are banned from operating on a commercial basis.
</P>
<P>
China's State Education Commission reported that enterprises
run by primary and high schools generated almost 300 billion yuan
(37 billion US dollars) during the 1991-1995 period, with an
average annual growth rate of 33.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
About 710,000 primary and high schools or 93 percent of all
schools nationwide have launched campus enterprises, according to
the commission.
</P>
<P>
The total number of school companies was 777,000 last year, an
increase of 150,000 from early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Running profitably, they earned more than 40 billion yuan
(about five billion US dollars) in the past five years. More than
half of the profits have been used to make up shortages in
educational funding.
</P>
<P>
The commission revealed that 772 campus companies earned more
than one million yuan (125,000 US dollars) each last year, and 17
companies earned more than 10 million yuan (1.25 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
They are engaged in various fields, including conventional
industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, commerce, service
industry and information industry, according to the commission.
</P>
<P>
China's education law stipulates that schools should not run
enterprises for commercial purpose. However, the government allows
them to go into business if the profits are mainly used to improve
educational conditions of their own.
</P>
<P>
China has a new policy that educational funding should be
raised from various channels, including both the public and
private sectors. The method means a change in the previous system
under which the government covered all educational budgets.
</P>
<P>
Campus schools are exempted from major taxes -- this is one
reason why they find it easier to succeed.
</P>
<P>
The school firms are operated entirely by adults, and there
exist no child laborers, the commission said, adding that they
occasionally accept students who are curious about work processes.
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese schools open a special course to teach some basic
labor skills to the students.

<HEADLINE> Ocean Disasters Cause Losses of 10 Billion Yuan Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Four ocean storms swept China's
seas last year, causing economic losses of ten billion yuan (1.2
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The number of storms was lower than in 1994, but there were
more perils from the seas caused by destructive tidal waves, the
State Oceanic Administration reports here today.
</P>
<P>
All four storm tides occured in the offshore areas of southern
Guangdong province, and the number of days with destructive waves
of four meters-plus high was 278.
</P>
<P>
One of the destructive tidal waves in the seas of Bohai,
Huanghai, and Donghai on November 7 last year sank more than 500
ships and killed more than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
Eight red tides and 13 oil spills also hit the seas of China
last year.
</P>
<P>
Oceans provide people with bountiful resources, but it also
causes terrible havoc to lives and development of the
mankind. Almost half of the economic losses caused by natural
calamities are related to the ocean disasters.
</P>
<P>
China has been hit by 15 big storm tides since 1949, and
according to statistics from 1982 to 1990, huge waves in offshore
China sunk 14,345 ships, killing 4,734 people and injuring nearly
40,000 people.
</P>
<P>
More oceanic natural disasters are expected to hit areas of
coastal southeast China this year, according to a forecast by the
administration, which has appealed to local authorities to raise
their awareness of the threat posed by such disasters, and urged
them to try every means to minimize the risks by working out
prompt counter measures.

<HEADLINE> Australian Building Approvals Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian housing industry
was on the threshold of recovery as the building approvals figure
continued to rise in May.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced today that
building approvals rose 1.7 percent to 10,597 units seasonally
adjusted in May from 10,421 units in April.
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive month that the number of building
approvals rose.
</P>
<P>
Building approvals, along with housing finance and building
start figures, are three main indicators of the housing industry.
</P>
<P>
ABS figures released earlier showed that housing finance, or
the number of loans made for housing purchases, also began to rise
after declining for the past year.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the number of housing approvals and housing finance
was a good news for the housing industry, foreshadowing a recovery
in the latter half of the 1996-97 fiscal year starting July 1.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of building start was still decreasing,
showing that the industry has yet to come out of the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
The housing industry is a barometer of the national economy.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) raised official interest rates
to slow down the economy in late 1994. The housing industry was
among the hardest hit because it was already in over supply.
</P>
<P>
The RBA announced that the economy would continue to grow at a
subdued rate in the second half of this year with inflation rate
falling to 2.5 percent annually.

KAMPALA, July 3 (Xinhua)-- Taxi fares and food prices in
Uganda's capital of Kampala and its suburbs remained unchanged
today despite the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) on July
1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Taxi fares remained unchanged despite a 10 percent increase in
fuel pump prices starting from Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda Taxi Operators and Drivers Association said they
will let market forces determine their trend.
</P>
<P>
However, a few businessmen and manufacturers hiked retail
prices of their products, blaming VAT.
</P>
<P>
The VAT department pointed out that these businessmen were
adding VAT on the old prices without deducting the old sales tax
figure.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Uganda started to introduce the VAT and at the same
day cancelled the sales tax and commercial transaction levy.
</P>
<P>
In his budget speech on June 15, 1996, Ugandan Minister of

HARARE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- About 1.4 million foreigners
visited Zimbabwe last year, with earning of 130 million
U.S.Dollars, a Zimbabwean tourism official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a three-day workshop on statistics organised by the
World Tourism Organisation, Secretary in the Environment and
Tourism Ministry July Moyo said that Zimbabwe has a great
potential of increasing its tourism earnings from the present 130
million U.S. Dollars to over 300 million U.S.Dollars annually by
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics showed that over 80 percent of tourists
come from within southern Africa while the overseas markets only
contribute about 15 percent of total arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said, ''From these statistics, our marketing strategies
have to focus and target the overseas markets which have not been
tapped for some time.''
</P>
<P>
Looking at the economic contribution of the industry to the
country's economy, beyond the foreign currency earning, tourism
employs over 83,000 people and accounts for 4.6 percent
proportions of the national output as measured by the Gross
Domestic Product, Moyo said.

The Standing Committee of Fujian Provincial People's Congress
has approved the regulation on the implementation and management
of family planning among its migrant population.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua was told that this is the first local regulation on the
implementation of family planning among floating population in the
country. It will mean that millions of migrant workers will have
to show cards when applying for work to prove that they will not
produce more children. The cards will be issued after family
planning centers have certified that floating women workers cannot
have more babies, or that men have had vasectomy operations.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation lays down the scope of application,
responsibilities of relevant departments, operation of regular
management and simplifying procedures to provide convenience for
the masses.
</P>
<P>
Fujian province is a comprehensive experimental zone in the
reform and opening up policies in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by local public security departments in
1994 show that the daily floating population in the province
exceeded three million, and more than one million people had lived
in the province for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary statistics about 80 percent of
newly-born babies are produced by the floating population.

<P>
HEFEI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A 200,000-hectare forest belt along
the section of the Yangtze River in Anhui Province is helping to
improve the local ecology and to benefit farmers.
</P>
<P>
A survey has shown that 33 percent of 460,000 hectares of
eroded land have been put under control, and the river bed has
gradually moved.
</P>
<P>
At present, five counties along the river have set up 1,300
forest farms and 118 projects to make full use of forest resources.
</P>
<P>
The presence of humans was the cause of destruction of the
ecology in the areas along the river until 1990, when the province
began to reverse the effects with its tree-planting project.

<HEADLINE> NPC Strengthens Supervision on Law Enforcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A supervision group of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress carried out
investigations on the enforcement of the Law on Environmental
Protection in Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin from April to June.
</P>
<P>
It was part of the efforts by the NPC, China's top legislative
body, to strengthen supervision on law enforcement throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
During the NPC group's three-city tour, over 5,000 local
residents, experts and NPC members reported pollution problems in
the cities to the group.
</P>
<P>
When the group visited the cities, several 24-hour special hot
lines were opened to public to receive comments from the local
residents.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, over 40 percent of the reported
pollution problems were solved by local governments with the help
of the NPC supervision group.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, press and media reports of the group's
supervision efforts also produced a great impact.
</P>
<P>
China has achieved great developments with new tough laws in
recent years, but enforcement has been a weak point.
</P>
<P>
Senior leaders of the NPC Standing Committee, as a result,
urged the legislative body to strengthen the supervision of law
enforcement, and put the supervision and law-making on an equal
basis.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years the NPC arranged for a number of law
enforcement supervision groups to visit provinces and cities for
inspections.
</P>
<P>
NPC enforcement supervision groups for Environmental Protection
Laws, adopted by the NPC in September, 1979, have toured 26 of
China mainland's 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
Another NPC group is to go to Shaanxi, Qinghai and Ningxia in
the second half of this year to continue its supervision on
environmental protection law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese law, the local people's congress is
entrusted to supervise work of local authorities at the same level.
</P>
<P>
The NPC will participate in the law enforcement supervision in
provinces and cities when important or popular problems are
reported to them.
</P>
<P>
An official of the NPC Standing Committee said the NPC plans to
launch supervision operations on the enforcement of Education and
Labor Laws and laws on public security this year.

<HEADLINE> Owl Builds Nest In Farmer's Home in Hunan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A farmhouse in central China's
Hunan Province has become a sweet home for a female owl.
</P>
<P>
The owl, known for their wisdom, has built a nest in the same
home for three years runnings. She has laid eggs and hatched young
owls for two of the years.
</P>
<P>
The farmer He Chunzai, lives in a tree-shaded house in Wawu
Village, Runshan Township, Jiangyong County, near a reservoir.
</P>
<P>
The owl first flew to his home in February 1994 and left
later. It returned to his home in February 1995 and built a nest
under the eaves.
</P>
<P>
He Chunzai ordered all members of his family not to disturb the
owl, which laid three eggs in late April, 1995. Three young owls
were hatched in early June. The mother owl and her three young
owls flew away in early August 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I assumed that the mother owl would not come back."
</P>
<P>
But she did return in February 1996 and laid three eggs in her
old nest.
</P>
<P>
He said: "With the presence of the owl, there are no mice in my
home. What a pity that the owl does not live in my home for more
months!"
</P>
<P>
He promised that his family will guarantee the owl complete
freedom if she returns again next year.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Benefits Dam Site City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The building of the Three Gorges
Project is unleashing great benefits for Yichang city, Hubei
province, where the world's largest hydropower dam is located.
</P>
<P>
Great changes have taken place in the city since the launch of
the massive dam project, with a far-reaching impact on helping the
locality further opening up, strengthen economic strength, quicken
the pace of infrastructural construction, and promote tourism,
said a local official.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest impact of the dam project on Yichang, perhaps, is
that it will serve as a locomotive to propel the city into a
metropolis," Tian Zhenya, local Party secretary said, adding that
the Three Gorges Project, which started in 1994, has provided a
"golden opportunity" for his city.
</P>
<P>
Along with the damming of the Three Gorges Project, Yichang has
become increasingly attractive to both Chinese and overseas
investors. Domestic entrepreneurs have pumped a total of three
billion yuan into the city, involving 744 projects. So far 414 of
the projects have been completed or put into operation. There are
also more than 600 foreign-funded enterprises in the city,
involving a total of 1.8 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Tian, 100 key projects, financed by domestic and
overseas enterprise groups, have already been listed in the
current development plans of both central and provincial
authorities.
</P>
<P>
And the city's industrial output in 1996 is expected to grow 30
percent over last year, with pre-tax profits estimated to rise 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
Building of the Three Gorges Project has not only directly
necessitated the construction of the Three Gorges Airport, the
Yichang-Huangshi highway and the installation of 60,000
program-controlled telephone lines, but also spurred rapid
development of transport, telecommunications and urban
infrastructure, the Party secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Yichang has nine star-rated hotels. During the
1991-1995 period, the city received a total of about 400,000
overseas tourists, earning 25 million US dollars.

HANGZHOU, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Continuous rain has forced three
islets in Hangzhou's West Lake, one of China's most popular
tourist attractions, to close for sightseeing until tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in the past four decades that the lake has
been closed to visitors because of heavy rainfall.

Lake by half a meter.
</P>
<P>
Water submerged parts of three mid-lake islands and lake-side
areas. The number of visitors sharply reduced, leaving the whole
lake area deserted.
</P>
<P>
"We had to close the islets to guarantee tourists' safety,"
said Wang Bairong, director of the administrative department of
West Lake.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Suzhou Injects Lifeline into Loss-Making Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Suzhou in east China's Jiangsu
province has injected 32.5 million yuan to help revitalise 29
loss-making state and collectively-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The money-losing enterprises involve eight sectors. During the
first four months of this year the enterprises witnessed a drop of
12.6 percent in their sales compared with the same period of last
year, losing potential profits of over six million yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the enterprises gaining financial
support are the most promising, with marketable products but a
poor management structure.
</P>
<P>
To make the best use of the funds, the municipal economic
committee has signed letters of responsibility with the
enterprises for the purpose of eliminating losses and increasing
profits.
</P>
<P>
If the enterprises fail to become profitable, or pay back the
loans on schedule, the risk-mortgage paid by a responsible legal
person from the enterprises will confiscated and handed over to
the financial department.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xingguo, vice-mayor of the city, noted that the municipal
government has paid high attention to helping loss-making
enterprises. The current financial injection of funds aims to give
full play to the initiatives of the enterprises.

<P>
MADRID, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A group of Spanish political parties
will meet here next week to mobilize against the Basque separatist
group ETA, Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said today.
</P>
<P>
The July 10 meeting is aimed at "uniting all democratic forces
in the struggle against terrorism," Mayor Oreja said.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the meeting will be those who adopted in 1987
a common stance in fighting the terrorist war launched by the ETA,
and have since formed a political alliance.
</P>
<P>
The national alliance has been allying with its regional
counterpart in Basque, in northern Spain, to quell the ETA, namely
the Basque Homeland and Freedom.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which came on after the ETA's week-long unilateral
truce ended Monday, was expected to strengthen the links between
the national and regional anti-terrorism alliances.
</P>
<P>
The Herri Batasuna party, the ETA's political wing, will be
excluded from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ETA has been fighting for a separate Basque state for 27
years. About 750 people were killed in the pro-independence war.

COLOMBO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Tenure of two of Sri Lanka's

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Governor of Bank of Thailand Quits Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Vijit Supinit, governor of the Bank
of Thailand, tendered his resignation to Finance Minister Bodi
Chunnanond on Tuesday without giving reason for his act.
</P>
<P>
However, giving no reason does not mean having no reason.
</P>
<P>
His resignation was not unexpected as it had been known that
the government was not happy with his work and he resigned to
avoid being sacked.
</P>
<P>
Last week, several cabinet members including Justice Minister
Chalerm Yubamrung and Deputy Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra
accused him of failing to tackle the problems of the
trouble-plagued Bangkok Bank of Commerce (BBC) efficiently, and of
failing to tell commercial banks to lower lending interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He was on a friction course with the government, which wants
lower lending rates to encourage exports, while Vijit maintained
high interest rates to curb inflation from rising too fast.
</P>
<P>
Exports growth decline and rising inflation are two of the main
concerns of the government.
</P>
<P>
Vijit was also accused of allowing the BBC's executives,
including its former president Krirkkiat Jalichandra and his
treasury adviser Rakesh Saxena, to damage the BBC for more than
two years.
</P>
<P>
In May the opposition revealed during the censure debate that
the BBC was collapsing under the weight of more than 77 billion
baht (about 3.1 billion US dollars) in bad and doubtful loans,
some of which were to a group of politicians and some deputy
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Vijit was accused of moving slowly because Krirkkiat is his
friend and that Vijit had borrowed from the bank about five
million baht (200,000 dollars) without collateral.
</P>
<P>
Another factor that overshadowed Vijit's quit is his
acquisition of 40,000 shares at par in a listed finance company.
He was said to have chaired a commission meeting to approve the
listing of the company's shares. He later conceded selling the
shares after listing and making several million baht (tens of
thousands of dollar) profit.
</P>
<P>
Critics also accused Vijit of engineering, out of personal
conflict, the controversial dismissal of Ekamol Khiriwat as deputy
governor of the central bank and of forcing Ekamol to resign as
secretary-general of the Securities and Exchange Commission in
December last year.
</P>
<P>
Vijit was also blamed for sluggishness in various business
sectors stemming from the central bank's tight monetary policy
designed to fight inflationary pressures and reduce the current
account deficit.
</P>
<P>
His resignation is seen because of political pressure as well
as of his unethical performance.
</P>
<P>
With Vijit gone and his replacement yet to emerge, local
bankers believe that the central bank needs a good leader to
restore public confidence in its credibility which was shaken
under Vijit, and the new comer will face a hard job in tackling
the country's current economic problems including high inflation,
worsening current account deficit and export growth decline.

<HEADLINE> Germany Rejects U.S. Claim, Promises to Open Up Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Germany today promised to give foreign
firms better chances in the bidding for German government
contracts after rejecting a U.S. claim that Bonn's public
procurement rules discriminate against American companies.
</P>
<P>
Both sides now backed off from a trade war as the United States
also showed its will to ease the tension Monday by agreeing to
hold off a trade sanction for another three months.
</P>
<P>
"The German government remains convinced that the U.S.
government's accusation ... is incorrect," an Economics Ministry
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added the government plans to reform the way Germany awards
public works contracts and "strengthen the legal position of
bidders."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot say yet how this will work out in detail," and
Germany can "make no promises" about when parliament might pass
new rules, ministry spokeswoman Christine Kern said.
</P>
<P>
But in trying to soothe Washington, Chancellor Helmut Kohl will
have to face Germany's powerful industrial lobby, which has urged
him to resist U.S. pressure for changes.
</P>
<P>
The German government has been under fire from the U.S. after
acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky in her April
report accused Germany of "significant and persistent"
discrimination against U.S. bidders for public contracts in the
heavy electrical equipment market.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky's report cited the failure of the General Electric
Corporation and the Westinghouse Corporation to win turbine
projects in former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Bonn said both contracts went to the ABB,
an international concern that has operations in Germany.
</P>
<P>
General Electric maintains it was "unfairly eliminated from the
final stage of bidding" for a project in Lippendorf by the German
utility, VEAG, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said Westinghouse was denied the other contract, for a steam
turbine and generator project in Cottbus, even though "two
independent analyses commissioned by Cottbus concluded that the
technology proposed by Westinghouse was the best solution."
</P>
<P>
"This is a procurement sector with a long history of
discrimination against U.S. firms, and we need more than a promise
that problems won't recur," Barshefsky said in the report.
</P>
<P>
She gave Germany until June 29 to offer a remedy or face U.S.
trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
However, on Monday Barshefsky said she had put off sanctions
until September 30 because a solution "may be possible" if
negotiators got more time. Negotiations have been going on since
the end of April.

<HEADLINE> Australia Cuts Migrant Level to Attack Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government today
announced it would slash immigration levels by 8 percent to 74,000
for 1996-97, in an attempt to cut unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant reduction on last year's intake, the
number of skilled migrants would rise while the numbers coming in
under the family reunion scheme, among whom unemployment is
running at more than 30 percent, would drop," Prime Minister John
Howard said here.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the selection of migrants would be
non- discriminatory, and "we are not going to look at the color of
a person's skin or their country of origin."
</P>
<P>
"We are going to put some greater emphasis on English language
skills and we are going to introduce some additional obligations
in relation to sponsorship," he added.
</P>
<P>
Here are the main points of the changed immigration program:
</P>
<P>
-- The total non-humanitarian intakes will be cut by 9,000 to
74,000 for the 1996-97 financial year;
</P>
<P>
-- The humanitarian and refugee category will remain stable at
14,000;
</P>
<P>
-- More emphasis will be put on skilled migrants, with their
number to increase by almost 5,000;
</P>
<P>
-- Family reunion numbers will be cut by 13,000;
</P>
<P>
-- Family reunion applicants will be awarded points for
speaking English.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Urges Government to Amend Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of Nepal
(CPN-UML), the country's main opposition, has urged the government
to amend its policies for the 1996-97 fiscal year beginning on
July 16.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party said Tuesday that the government's policy
platform for the 1996-97 fiscal year, presented to parliament by a
royal address on Monday, is not in the interest of the nation and
its people.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to raise strong voice in the parliament for the
amendment of the government's policies and programs," chief whip
Devi Prasad Ojha said Tuesday after a meeting of the CPN-UML
parliamentary party.
</P>
<P>
The meeting demanded that the government pay equal attention to
the country's five development regions.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML also urged the government to take into account the
country's interest and need while pursing its liberal economic
policy and privatization program.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML, with its 88 MPs in the 205-seat lower house, is
the biggest party in the Nepali parliament.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML MPs at the Tuesday meeting accused the government of
failing to mention women's property rights issue in its policy
program, requesting an amendment for the introduction of a bill
on women's equal rights to parental property in the on-going
parliament session.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court of Nepal last year issued an order to the
coalition government led by the Nepali Congress (NC) party for an
introduction of the women's property rights bill in this
parliament session, which began last Wednesday.

BONN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Germany today agreed to grant four
million German marks (2.61 million U.S. dollars) in aid to
Azerbaijan, adding its aid to the former soviet republic since
1993 to 25 million marks (16.3 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The agreement for the aid was signed today between German
President Roman Herzog and his visiting Azerbaijan counterpart
Gejdar Alijiew, who arrived here for a four-day state visit Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed other agreements on economic cooperation
as well, including that for a loan of 10 million German marks
(6.53 million dollars) to the former Soviet republic for
renovating the Baku Airport.
</P>
<P>
President Alijiew expressed his gratitude for the generosity of
his German host, saying that "Azerbaijan has found a friend and
supporter in Germany".
</P>
<P>
But he wanted more: German investment, when he said that
Azerbaijan's rich oil and other resources and successful reforms
in its political and legal systems make it a sound choice for
investors.
</P>
<P>
Alijiew's idea seemed to be shared by German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, who told the visitor in an earlier meet that the two
countries have a great potentiality in developing economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Alijiew is also expected to meet Foregin Minister Klaus Kinkel
and German party and business leaders later.

<HEADLINE> Indian Trade Deficit Registers Sharp Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- India's trade deficit has
registered a sharp increase during the first two months of the
current financial year (April, 1996 - March, 1997) as compared to
the same period of the last financial year, The Hindustan Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to official trade figures, the deficit stood at
771.45 million US dollars during April-May, 1996 as compared to
275.51 million dollars during April-May, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Figures showed that during April-May, 1996, India's imports
outgrew exports.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in trade deficit in April and May posed a
major challenge to the government's commitment to narrow down the
country's trade deficit sharply.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
announced a massive price hike for petroleum products, which comes
into effect from today.
</P>
<P>
Prices of petrol will go up by 25 percent while that of diesel
and cooking gas by 30 percent each, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Kerosene prices, however, remained unchanged. Prices of other
petroleum products like paraffin will also go up by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
For residents in Delhi, petrol will become dearer by 3.21
rupees (about 9 US cents) per liter, exclusive of service charges
and sales tax.
</P>
<P>
An official press release tried to justify the price hike,
saying that subsidized prices had led to inefficient and wasteful
use of the petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
Bringing the prices in line with the cost would help conserve
the depleting natural resource and promote efficiency in the use,
the release added.

<HEADLINE> SDIC TO Focus on Nine Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The country's major investment
company has decided to concentrate its resources in mine areas to
boost development in key sectors.
</P>
<P>
The State Development and Investment Corp (SDIC) will give
priority to electric power, coal, construction of bridges, roads
and ports, building materials, chemical fertilizers, auto spare
parts, chemical fibres and chemical fibre raw materials,
electronics, and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
SDIC has chosen the nine areas because they have good
development prospects, follow State industrial policies, and are
sectors whose development is encouraged by the central government,
SDIC President Wang Wenze said.
</P>
<P>
Established in May 1995, SDIC is a policy-oriented investment
institution directly associated with the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Its major tasks are to make equity investments in the manner of
share participation and share-holding in policy-oriented projects
in energy resources, communications, raw materials, machinery,
electronics, light industry, textiles, agriculture and forestry.
</P>
<P>
SDIC has a registered capital of 5.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the company completed new investment totalling 8.5
billion yuan, of which 98 percent went to the construction of 21
large-and medium-sized policy-oriented projects, according to the
figures released by SDIC yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Of the investment committed last year, 62 percent was invested
in projects located in the country's central and western areas and
economically-under-developed areas.
</P>
<P>
This follows the central government's decision to accelerate
development in inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Among the projects invested by the SDIC, the Ertan Hydropower
Station in Southwest China's Sichuan Province is one of the
largest and holds great importance in helping economic development
in that region.
</P>
<P>
The Ertan Station, in which the SDIC holds 48 percent of the
total shares, has an estimated investment of 32.5 billion
yuan. About 930 million US dollars of the investment comes from
World Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The station is now the second largest hydropower project
following the Three Gorges Dam project. With a 240-metre-high dam,
the Ertan station will have six generators with a combined
capacity of 3.3 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The station started construction in September 1991. Its first
generator is expected to be brought into commercial operation in
October 1998 and the project will be completed in May 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Four Mexican, Brazilian and
U.S. networks are launching a project to beam down TV programmings
from satellite directly into Latin American viewer's home.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "DirectTV" project, an expansion of a successful
U.S. operation already existing for about two years, was announced
here today by Nelly Galan, general director of Canal Fox.
</P>
<P>
Galan told a press conference that the "Sky" project, to be
kicked off in the year's second half, will draw together Mexico's
Televisa, Brazil's TV O'Globo, and the United States' TCI and Fox.
</P>
<P>
TCI is a leading cable operator in the United States and Fox is
a major movie channel in the country.
</P>
<P>
Using satellite broadcasting technologies, the partners will
offer more than 15 Latin American nations a service similar to
cable television, but with dozens of additional channels.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Galan said the channels serving "DirectTV Latin America"
will be received in the home of a subscriber through a small dish
antenna aiming at a geostationary satellite overhead.
</P>
<P>
The digital transmission, the Fox executive said, produces a
quality and sharpness of image and sound superior to other means.
</P>
<P>
She said the companies participating in the "Sky" project will
contribute their channels, productions, co-productions and
programming in the operation.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 3 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province,
one of the most developed areas in the country, has introduced a
new labor system focusing primarily on a labor contract system.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Provincial Labor Department said that 7.3
million workers in state-owned, collectively-owned and
foreign-funded companies throughout Guangdong, 97 percent of the
total work force in the companies, have signed labor contracts
with their employees.
</P>
<P>
The move is a major part of implementing China's Labor Law, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60 percent of workers in township-run enterprises,
private companies and individually-run firms have also signed
labor contracts with employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with China's Labor Law, Guangdong's provincial
government last year announced the first ever minimum wage
levels. It raised the standards earlier this year to meet
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Agencies responsible for supervising the implementation of the
Labor Law have been set up by all labor departments at county,
city and provincial levels.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong currently has 1,400 agencies responsible for
arbitrating in labor disputes, the official said, adding that the
agencies employ a total of 5,800 arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong provincial government has also standardized the
operation of labor placement agencies, and established a labor

<P>
SHANGHAI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Chen Yi, a fifth grade student
from Datian No.1 Primary School in Shanghai, is admired by her
classmates, since so many "parents" care for her.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yi's mother left her when she was three years old, and
Chen lost her father at the age of six. Since then Chen Yi lived
with her ailing grandmother and her aunt, who is a sanitation
worker.
</P>
<P>
Living conditions for the family were very poor due to economic
reasons.
</P>
<P>
A year ago the Party branch of the public health bureau of
Jing'an District, established contact with Chen's family and
adopted the girl as their "daughter".
</P>
<P>
Chen's new "fathers" and "mothers" not only buy new clothes for
her, but also books and reading material. They also help her in
her studies.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has 450,000 comparatively low-income households. Local
government provides subsidies to guarantee their basic living
expenses. But many of the households still face difficulties for
various reasons.
</P>
<P>
Help-the-poor activities involving enterprises and government
organs started a year ago.
</P>
<P>
It was the Party branches which first established contact with
poor households to help them overcome poverty. More than 800
grass-root Party branches in Jing'an District have so far
introduced "poor partners" schemes.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 especially poor households have won help and
support under the scheme.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A new survey shows that China has
set up more than 4,800 Chinese-invested companies in 130 countries
and regions, with total investment of 5.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The survey, by Shanghai-based Fudan University, said that
nearly 3,000 of the companies are engaged in trade, with total
investments hitting 3.6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of non-trade companies reached some
2,000, investing a total of 1.9 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper "Business News" quoted the survey as saying
that China registered rapid growth in investing overseas in the
past few years. Both investment volume and the number of companies
investing overseas enjoyed annual growth rates of 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the structure of the companies improved with the
increased number. More money flew from restaurant management and
small-scale processing companies to sectors such as resource
development and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based newspaper admitted that the scale of China's
foreign investment is quite small, noting that the investment
volume accounted for less than a quarter of one per cent of the

<HEADLINE> Cooperation in Education, Culture between ROK and China Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A leading Republic of Korea
academic has called for more cooperation among educational and
cultural circles of China and his country.
</P>
<P>
Chungwon Choue, chairman of the Center for Asia-Pacific Studies
and vice-president of Kyung Hee University, said that China and
ROK share the same cultural roots and history, and both are
strongly influenced by Confucianism.
</P>
<P>
Since they are now two economic and cultural giants in the
east, academicians should strengthen studies on issues which are
of concern to both countries.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the conclusion of visits to Beijing
University and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Choue, member of the Korean Association of International
Relations, was the first ROK university president to visit
China. Since 1989 he has visited China every year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the amazing development of the Chinese economy in
recent years has laid a sound base for cultural cooperation
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Though ROK and China suspended contact for a period of time,
their relations developed quickly after they established
diplomatic relations, Choue said, adding that educational and
cultural cooperation should catch up with the pace of diplomatic
and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the 21st century will be an era for Asia to
rise. Therefore, Asian countries should learn from each other, and
enhance mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that many ROK people are eager to learn the
Chinese language, while many universities have opened
China-related courses, and exchanged scholars and students with
their Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, ROK and China can exchange their experience in
reforming higher learning, he said.
</P>
<P>
Choue said that he hoped to introduce traditional Korean
medicine, which has its root in ancient China, to the Chinese
people in the near future. He also said he would help expand
performing art exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kyung Hee University, founded 47 years ago, has set up
cooperative relations with 22 Chinese universities and research
institutes.

up the same number of police and more judges would be recruited to
speed up the course of justice, Bruton said.
</P>
<P>
These measures, to be discussed at a special parliament session
on July 25, were introduced following the murder of Ireland's top
crime reporter and an attempt to intimidate a parliament member.
</P>
<P>
Veronica Guerin, who wrote a series of articles exposing the
drugs trade for the Sunday Independent, was gunned down by two
motorists while she was driving her car last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Police were also investigating what appeared to be an attempt
to scare Labor parliamentarian Roisin Shortall by someone who left
the sound of six gunshots on her answering machine in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Dick Spring, also head of the Labor party,
told reporters that "neither Roisin nor anyone else will be
intimidated by people in the drugs trade."
</P>
<P>
Shortall gained her fame in fights against the growing drugs
trade in and around Dublin and other major cities in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The resurgence of organized crimes has alerted the Irish
government in fighting back more effectively.
</P>
<P>
The measures were made public as Ireland assumed the rotating
presidency of the European Union. Ireland said it would use its
tenure to tighten the 15-member bloc's collective action against
drugs by seeking the maximum sentences on traffickers.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The government of Sri Lanka is to
revive and rehabilitate Palmyrah-based industry in the northern
Jaffna district which was adversely affected as a result of the
13-year-long ethnic war, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Under this development program, 17 proposed projects with a
total investment of 3.1 million US dollars will be implemented by
the Palmyrah Development Board from this month.
</P>
<P>
The program envisages the reconstruction of damaged buildings,
replacement of vehicles and equipment, restoration of workshop to
give self employment and rehabilitation of Palmyrah-based exports.
</P>
<P>
Once the program is completed in December 1997, it is expected
to generate permanent employment for over 740, indirect employment
for 4,230 and self employment for over 11,500 in the district.
</P>
<P>
The reports stated that a number of foreign countries and donor

<HEADLINE> Nepali Telecom Workers Against Privatization Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A workers' union of Nepal Telecom
Corporation (NTC) is to launch a protest program soon against the
government's decision to privatize the state-run company, sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The NTC Workers' Association will go on a nation-wide strike on
Thursday under its first-phase protest program, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to the Ministry of Communications Tuesday,
the union said invitation for private companies to enter the
telecommunication sector would harm the country as well as the
NTC.
</P>
<P>
The NTC Workers' Association last month appealed to the
ministry to reconsider its decision to allow private companies'
entry into new telecommunication services like radio paging and
mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry had ignored the association's appeal, it
said.
</P>
<P>
According to officials from the ministry, the government has
granted permissions to nine private companies for these modern
telecommunication services, which are expected to go into
operation within this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a temporary strike was launched Tuesday in Kathmandu
by the NTC Workers' Association, closing all telecommunication
services except the automatic section in the capital for about
three hours.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government last year adopted a policy to involve the
 private sector in telecommunication services for the improvement
of the country's telecom infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Foreign Investment Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
approved a total of 571 foreign investment projects worth 20.9
billion U.S. dollars in the first half of 1996, an eight percent
increase over a year earlier, Investment Minister Sanyoto said.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen last night after meeting President Soeharto,
the minister said the direct foreign investment was mostly in the
areas of chemicals, electricity, paper and pulp.
</P>
<P>
Japanese investment made up the largest share, totaling 4.9
billion U.S. dollars, said Sanyoto.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said, the government had also approved
466 domestic investment projects worth 64.2 trillion rupiahs (27.4
billion U.S. dollars) during the same period, more than doubling
last year's domestic investment.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's high economic growth, a strong domestic market and
abundant natural resources still attract foreign investors, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Sanyoto expected the actual realization ratio of approved
investment projects to stand at 55.2 percent for foreign projects
this year, while for domestic projects, the ratio would be 44.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Approved foreign investment was valued at 39.9 billion U.S.
dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Rejects U.S. Demands to Extradite Drug Bosses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian foreign
ministry today refused to extradite four jailed bosses of the Cali
drug cartel to the United States to face charges, saying it
violates the nation's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"For a country like Colombia, which has a long tradition of
respecting laws and principles of a representative democracy, any
action tending to damage its internal institutionality is
unacceptable," the ministry stated in a communique.
</P>
<P>
Semana, a Colombian magazine, wrote on Monday that Washington
has requested Colombia to make the U.S.-Colombian extradition
treaty signed in 1979 part of its law before bilateral relations
can be normalized.
</P>
<P>
Colombia rejected the American request last week on the ground
that the Colombian congress clamped a constitutional ban on
extradition of Colombian natives in 1991.
</P>
<P>
After the rejection, the Washington Post published a note
Sunday, saying that U.S. ambassador to Colombia Myles Frechette
proposed sanctions against Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Describing the proposed sanctions as unilateral measures that
do not correspond to the reality and hurt Colombia's national
dignity, the ministry said that they could intensify the growing
anti-U.S. sentiment in the Colombian public opinion.
</P>
<P>
However, the Colombian government reiterated its willingness to
evaluate the bilateral relations to prevent, despite the present
difficulties, a further deterioration.
</P>
<P>
General Prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso Sarmiento said Monday
that Colombia should either denounce the treaty or seek a trial of
the criminals in the international courts.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Coal Strikers Reject Agreement with Authorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Striking coal miners today
rejected an agreement labor union leaders reached with the
authorities to end the strike they started in mid-May in Lota in
southeast Chile.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came short of the basic demands of the strikers,
worker leaders of the National Coal Enterprise (Enacar) told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 miners met in a rally rejecting the terms of the
agreement negotiated during 25 uninterrupted hours between the
union leaders and a government commission.
</P>
<P>
The strike was called after 97 miners of the Lota mine were
fired. Forty of the fired miners held a hanger strike.
</P>
<P>
The miners clashed with police during the strike.
</P>
<P>
The strikers demanded the rehiring the miners and protested
against the proposals to privatize the state-owned Enacar. The
47-day strike has caused a loss of at least 5 million U.S.
dollars, according to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The heavily-subsidized coal mine company, which has been
registering losses in recent years, has also decided to reduce its
payroll from 1,812 to 1,400 workers, as the cost of producing a
ton of coal is nearly triple the selling price.

Dr. Somsit Tancharoen, chief of the surgeons team, was quoted

<P>
Dr. Somsit said the patient was now 80 percent on his way to a

</P>
<P>
The patient had suffered from cirrhosis of the liver due to a
hepatitis virus infection and excessive alcohol consumption.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Somsit said Thai technology for transplant operations has
significantly advanced but the problem is that there is a shortage

<HEADLINE> Bildt Confirms Karadzic's Hands-Over of Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- International chief mediator in
Bosnia Carl Bildt today confirmed that Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic had already handed over his power and authority as
"president" to Vice President Biljana Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
Bildt made the confirmation after a three-hour meeting with
Plavsic in the Bosnian city of Pale outside Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was the first time for Bildt to meet the
Bosnian Serb Vice President, to whom Karadzic handed over power on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He added that the international community will pay close
attention to the development of situation in Republika Srpska, the
Serb entity in Bosnia, and will never allow Karadzic to continue
presence in office.
</P>
<P>
But Bildt did not rule out the possibility for Karadzic to stay
as head of his ruling Serb Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
He explained that according to the Dayton peace accord, which
ended the nearly four-year-old Bosnian war, a party leader is not
equal to a head of state.
</P>
<P>
Under mounting pressure from the international community,
Karadzic declared last Wednesday his resignation as "president"
and withdrawal from the post-war nation-wide elections on
September 14.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic also told reporters that her meeting with Bildt opened
a new way to implement the Dayton accord.
</P>
<P>
Bildt refused to deal with Plavsic earlier, claiming she was
merely a mouthpiece for Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether she will use her powers to deliver Karadzic,
an indicted war criminal, to the trial at the U.N. war crime
tribunal in the Hague, the acting president said no.
</P>
<P>
"By our law it is forbidden for a person on the territory of
the Republika Srpska to be handed over to a foreign court," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta City Council Risks Mayoral Veto to Raise Cab Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Atlanta City Council on Monday
approved another rate increase for taxi drivers, one they hope is
small enough to avoid another mayoral veto.
</P>
<P>
Under the new legislation, passed by an 11-5 vote, cab fares
for one person from the airport to downtown would increase to 22
dollars from 18. Parties of two would each pay 12 dollars instead
of 10 apiece, and a group of three would pay 30 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The council voted to limit to three the number of folks who can
ride in a sedan. However, the panel set for groups of four riding
in station wagons and minivans at 36 dollars.
</P>
<P>
If Mayor Bill Campell doesn't veto the proposal, the fares
increases would be in effect July 10 to August 30.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that he will be sensitive to the working poor,"
said Steve Belcher, president of the Taxi Cab Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
Campell votes the other Olympic fare increase the council
passed, saying the jump was too much and amounted to
price-gouging.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta convention and Visitors Bureau urged the mayor to
veto the legislation last time, arguing that it would hurt
Atlanta's image if tourists found our rates were raied solely for
the Games.

<HEADLINE> South Africans Eager to Compete for Unified Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African athletes have
geared up for Olympic honors under a flag of a unified nation, a
South African sports official said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first time that South Africa will be at the
Olympic Games under a flag and anthem supported by all our
people," said Sam Ramsamy, president of the South African Olympic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Even though its athletes compete in the 1992 Barcelona Games,
South Africa considers this its Olympic debut after 32 years of
isolation because of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
The 150-member South African delegation arrived at Atlanta
Hartsfield International Airport on Monday after their 19-hour
flight from Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to victory," the delegation sang in Zulu. The tune,
which used to be a war song, has become their national sports
anthem.
</P>
<P>
"We're telling Atlanta that South Africa is coming," said
Hendrick Mokganyetsi, a 400-meter runner who led the emotional
flag-waving procession in the airport.
</P>
<P>
Their grand entrance began late Monday, when a funky,
multi-colored South African Airways jumbo jet touched down.
</P>
<P>
After a brief ceremony that included the reading of a statement
from President Nelson Mandela, the team traveled to LaGrange,
where they will train for the next two weeks. About 15 members of
the cycling team will train at the velodrome in East Point.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the 85 South African athletes is white, but
Ramsamy said he hopes blacks will make up about half the team by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the Barcelona Games, less than 10 percent of the team was
black.
</P>
<P>
"We inherited the lagacy of apartheid," he said. "The important
thing is that color is not a significant part of South Africa
anymore."

<TEXT>
<P>
TASHKENT, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and his Uzbek counterpart Islam Karimov held a meeting here
today, with both pledging to strengthen their friendly and
good-neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Karimov said Uzbekistan and China are close
neighbors although they do not have common borders, and that both
countries have a history of friendly exchanges dating back to
ancient times.
</P>
<P>
As two independent and sovereign countries, Uzbekistan and
China should develop their good-neighborly and friendly relations,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Jiang's visit will greatly push
forward bilateral cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said this was the first leg of his three-nation central
Asia trip, which will also take him to Kyrghystan and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
"The moment I arrived at Tashkent I found myself among friends
and in a warm atmosphere," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"I agree with President Karimov's evaluation of bilateral ties
and believe the exchange of visits by leaders of the two countries
opens greater prospects for bilateral relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here earlier today from Bucharest, Romania to
begin his two-day state visit to Uzbekistan at the invitation of
Karimov. This is the first visit to Uzbekistan by a Chinese head
of state.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his visit to Romania, Jiang had made successful state
visits to Spain and Norway.

<HEADLINE> Power Supply Failure Blacks Out Much of U.S. West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Failure of one of the key power
lines has led to a black-out in 15 western U.S. states and parts
of Canada and Mexico on Tuesday, causing traffic jams and stopping
air conditioners for millions on a record-hot day.
</P>
<P>
Outages were reported from southern California into Canada and
telephone service also appeared to be affected in some areas. In
northern Nevada, so many traffic lights went out of service that
police ran out of temporary stop signs.
</P>
<P>
Train service was also disrupted in parts of California,
including the subway system in San Francisco, where some trains
lost power for about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
There were reports that 11 separate power plants were knocked
off line. Utility officials could not immediately explain what
caused the disruption, which was blamed on a 4,500 megawatt line
supplying power from the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the line forced all the power onto the two
remaining lines, which couldn't handle the load and shut down.
</P>
<P>
The accident came on a day when utilities were stretched to
their limits with temperatures soared past 100 degrees Fahrenheit
(38.8 Celsius) in some regions including Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
PacifiCorp in Portland, Oregon State, which supplies
electricity to Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Oregon, Idaho, Washington
and northern California, said four 500-megawatt coal-fired power
plants at Rock Springs, Wyoming State, went off-line about 2:30
p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
The disruption did not last very long in some places, but some
states remained in the dark, including California, New Mexico,
Idaho and Arizona. The U.S. Energy Department said late on Tuesday
that western power systems were coming back on line in late
afternoon.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Romania started today to raise
prices of petrol, electricity, fuel, bread as well as telephone
calls by 30 to 60 percent, in a bid to ensure economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu said that such a move will
ensure the continuity of Romania's macro-economic control policy,
according to Agentie De Presa (ROMPRES).

The existing price standards do not suit the current market
mechanism and fail to push forward the economic reforms.

World Bank representatives here have also voiced support for
the price-swelling measures, saying that they will be conducive to
the country's economic reforms and to building a new price system.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Anhui Fight Water Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A campaign to fight water pollution
in the Huaihe River Valley and the Chaohu Lake area has resulted
in the closing of 328 small paper mills in east China's Anhui
Province.
</P>
<P>
The mills, each with an annual production capacity of less than
5,000 tons, were shut down by the local government, which said
they posed a severe threat to the environment.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the province decided to close the small
industrial enterprises which are major polluters. Industries to be
shut down include small tanneries, chemical plants, printing and
dyeing mills, and breweries.
</P>
<P>
With the closing of the businesses, the province is expected to
hold the amount of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) discharged to
308,053 tons in 1996, a 15 percent drop from last year's level,
one local official said.
</P>
<P>
The COD in the Huaihe River is also predicted to drop to
70,000-100,000 tons by the year of 2000, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe River Valley is a leading national commodity grain
center, and Anhui's largest farm and sideline products center, but
water pollution in the area has worsened with the local
government's efforts to develop the economy.

<HEADLINE> Megawati Barred From Indonesia's 1997 Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government made it
clear Tuesday that the embattled chief of the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI), Megawati Soekarnoputri, will be barred
from next year's general elections, the Jakarta Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Home Affairs Moch. Yogie S.M. told local reporters
after a meeting with the newly elected PDI chairman Soerjadi, that
the legitimate PDI representative for the poll is Soerjadi's
executive board, elected at the government-sponsored congress held
in the North Sumatra city of Medan on June 20-22.
</P>
<P>
"We will only recognize Soerjadi's leadership. We will only
invite Soerjadi's camp to the institute's meetings," said Yogie,
who is also chairman of the General Elections Institute.
</P>
<P>
The PDI split into two camps through the Medan congress.
Megawati Soekarnoputri and her loyalists, who were not invited to
the congress, denounced the congress as illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
Megawati, daughter of Indonesia's late first president Sukarno,
was elected in 1993 to a five-year term as party leader.
</P>
<P>
The country's three political parties -- the United Development
Party (PPP), the ruling Golkar party and the PDI -- will compete
for 425 of the 500 seats in the parliament in next year's general
elections. The remaining 75 seats are reserved for the armed
forces, which will not take part in the elections.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved today a
loan and a credit totalling 30 million U.S. dollars to China for
its educational and training systems.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth and structural change of China's emerging
market economy are placing new demands on the country's labor
force and its educational and training systems, but China's
current system is not ready to meet the new demands, a World Bank
press release said.
</P>
<P>
To help China increase its supply of skilled labor force, the
World Bank agreed to support China's training systems through a
"Vocational Education Reform Project" with the loan and the
credit, it said.
</P>
<P>
The total project cost of 68.4 million dollars equivalent will
be partially financed by a 10-million-dollar loan from the bank
and a 20-million-dollar credit from the International Development
Association, the bank's concessional lending arm. The remaining
sum will come from China's local governments involved, namely
Guangdong, Jiangsu, Liaoning and Shandong provinces.
</P>
<P>
The loan is repayable in 20 years with five years' grace. The
credit will be repayable in 35 years including 10 years' grace,
the press release said.

<HEADLINE> Clear Skies Around Guangzhou Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, the traffic hub of
south China, has maintained clear skies around its Baiyun
International Airport by keeping a close eye on construction
projects in the vicinity of the airport.
</P>
<P>
With increased urbanization in many parts of China, some
airports have had to suspend or cut services when air clearance
was endangered by high-rise buildings whose heights exceed the
safety limit.
</P>
<P>
And despite Guangzhou's rapid economic expansion and Baiyun
Airport's location just six kilometers from the city center,
planes flying into and out of the city have never experienced
difficulty caused by air pollution around the airport.
</P>
<P>
The local urban construction planning department applies strict
height standards when examining and approving new construction
projects near the airport, and it oversees the entire construction
process.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the department conducted two major
checks of buildings that border an extended area of the airport's
runways. As a result, 81 buildings were required to demolish the
floors located above the safety-height limit.
</P>
<P>
The department will consider air clearance factors when
planning for the construction of a second airport near the
city.

TIRANA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Macedonian military and police
were mobilized today to enforce a blockade around Skoplje, Tito
Veles and two other cities to prevent a horse epidemic from

</P>
<P>
Neighboring Greece has already banned imports of horses and
horse products from Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> Science Research on Taklimakan Desert Proves Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A 522-km road running through the
Taklimakan Desert in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has been
named one of China's ten top scientific achievements in the field
during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
It is only one of the successes Chinese scientists have claimed
for the research of the desert, the second-largest shifting desert
in the world, according to scientists from the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
However, the majority of these research achievements fail to be
published, due to a lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, more than 100 science workers organized by the
Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted a four-year-long
comprehensive scientific study of the desert.
</P>
<P>
The scientists involved in the project have published more than
200 papers and three books on water resources, soil, land
resources and climate and weather in the desert, and also three
professional maps and a collection of pictures.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have unveiled mysteries of the desert, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
But most of the research results never reach the public because
there is not enough money for publication, according to Hu
Wenkang, secretary of the desert science research team.
</P>
<P>
Seven books concerning the geographics, flora, fauna,
archeology, weather and climate, resources and environment in the
desert are waiting to be published.

BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Yaohan Group, a Japanese-owned
retailing firm, has moved its international headquarters from Hong
Kong to Shanghai's Pudong New Area, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The company is the first foreign multinational group to base

<HEADLINE> Public Paid to Nurture Nature in Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Today's China Daily reported that
the Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve in Northeast China has been
severely damaged by frantic tourism development.
</P>
<P>
A new project has been launched to make communities living near
the nature reserves better-off without damaging protected areas,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is outlined in the ongoing Nature Reserve
Management Project, set up with 17.9 million US dollars from the
Global Environmental fund which is managed by the World Bank, the
United Nations Development Program and the United Nations
Environmental Program.
</P>
<P>
The six-year project will focus on preserving important natural
areas, and funds are being offered to help people set up
non-damaging, money-making schemes like handicrafts and mushroom
farming.
</P>
<P>
It is part of a project to encourage communities to take part
in the policy-making and management of nature reserves, according
to Yan Xun, an official with the Ministry of forestry.
</P>
<P>
He said that communities near nature reserves often take
advantage of the rich resources to make money, with little thought
to the effects on the environment.
</P>
<P>
The new project, which started early this year, includes
experiments in eight communities of Shennongjia, Xishuangbanna,
Boyang Lake and Qinling Mountain reserves.

<HEADLINE> Russia Begins Second Round Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Russian electorate will choose
their new head of state between the incumbent president Boris
Yeltsin and the Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov in the second
round of election starting today.
</P>
<P>
The two presidential candidates have made their final campaign
pitches on Monday. By law, all campaigning is banned on Tuesday,
the day before the election.
</P>
<P>
In the first round on June 16 in which 10 candidates were
contesting, Yeltsin got 35.28 percent of ballots with a razor-thin
lead over Zyuganov who gained 32.04 percent of votes.
</P>
<P>
None of the candidates got enough ballots -- more than 50
percent -- to seal their victory, so the top two candidates have
to meet in the second round run-off, which, by law, should be held
in 15 days after the result is announced.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's election law, a candidate who gets more votes
than the other in the second round will win the election by a
simple majority, given that the winner's votes surpass those
against both of them.
</P>
<P>
If neither of them wins out, parties in the country will name
new candidates to attend another presidential election in four
months.
</P>
<P>
Both candidates have made painstaking efforts to woo supporters
of the other eight candidates in the first round and tried to
mobilize their own supporters to turn out to vote.
</P>
<P>
The result of the second round polling is expected to be
announced on July 4.

<HEADLINE> Graf Moves Step Closer to her Wimbledon Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, ENGLAND, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Defending Champion
Steffi Graf of Germany continued her winning streak by defeating
the sixth seeded Czech tennis ace Jana Novatona in straight sets
to sail into the semi-finals of the women's singles at the
Wimbledon tennis Championships here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Graf, who is in awesome form, consistently found the corners
with her groundstrokes, allowing the Czech star few opportunities
to stage counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
The world number one player, who dominated the Wimbledon
Central Court, took only less than an hour to beat Novotana 6-3,
6-2 and captured the first spot in the women's singles semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot easier than I expected, but I returned really
well, right from the beginning. I think that she (Novotona) knew
she had to do something better, and keep on playing closer to the
lines, and I think that helped me a lot especially in the
beginning of the first set." Graf said after the game.
</P>
<P>
Asked on the semi-final clash with Kimiki Date, Graf said:"She
plays really low and she can use the power of the other
opponent. But her first serve maybe is not as strong as necessary
on the grass. But she definitely has an edge because she's so low
on the ground, she bends really well and she likes the flat speed
of the ball."
</P>
<P>
In another quarter-finals clash, 12th-seeded Japanese player
Date rallied from a first set down to defeat her arch-rival Mary
Pierce of France 3-6, 6-3, 6-1. This is the Asian player's first
experience of becoming one the women's top four at the world's
most pretigious tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain overcame another uncertain
start to win ten games in a row (6-4, 6-0) against Judith Wiesner
of Austria and power into the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The 27th seeded Meredith McGrath of the United Sates created a
great upset Tuesday when she defeated nine-seeded fellow-American
star Mary Joe Fernandez, 6-3, 6-1 and became the only non-seeded
women's singles semi-finalist at the Wimbledon Tennis
Championships.
</P>
<P>
During the semi-final clashes to be played later this week,
Graf will take on Date while Sanchez is to meet with dark horse
McGrath.
</P>
<P>
In the men's fourth round clashes, defending champion and
world-number one Pete Sampras moved a step closer to his fourth
consecutive Wimbledon men's singles title after routing Cedric
Pioline of Frence 6-4, 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
In the men's quarter-finals to be played on Wednesday, Sampras
will clash with Richard Krakicek of the Netherlands, who beat the
1991 Wimbledon men's singles champion Michael Stich of Germany in
straight sets 6-4, 7-6, 6-4.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- It sounds like a doctor's dream: an
artificial binding material that replaces traditional sutures.
</P>
<P>
But Professor Wang Aiben, chairman of the Jinan Century
Bio-Binder Research Institute in east China's Shandong Province,
claims his invention, the "Wab Bio-Binder" can heal surgical
incisions quickly without stitches.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he says the invention will reduce pain and eliminate
scars.
</P>
<P>
Wab, made from living tissue with modern technology, has been
approved by the Quality Test Center of China's State
Pharmaceutical Administration.
</P>
<P>
Results of clinical tests on 30,000 patients show that Wab can
relieve post-surgery pain and lower the risk of infection.
</P>
<P>
Wab can also be used in skin-transplanting, to stop heavy
bleeding, and to fuse nerve endings.
</P>
<P>
Wab has passed the examinations conducted by experts from
Chinese Medical Association, and is listed as one of the 100 key
medical inventions to be popularized in China over the next decade
by the Ministry of Public Health.

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises in Hebei Doing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises in north
China's Hebei Province have become a new source of local economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The province's township enterprises generated more than 350
billion yuan in total output value last year, and nearly 38
billion yuan in pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
More than 55 percent of the province's industrial added value
was brought in by the enterprises in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises' prosperity also gives impetus to the
province's agricultural development, with their output value last
year accounting for 77 percent of the industrial and agricultural
total in local rural areas.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, the enterprises employed more than
2.1 million rural laborers, and these workers accounted for
one-third of the province's total rural laborers.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 township enterprises in the province each earn
five million yuan in foreign exchange from export annually.
</P>
<P>
And more than 1,025 enterprises worked jointly with overseas
investors to expand production. Last year, the province added 263
foreign-funded township enterprises, using nearly 200 million yuan
in overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The province has set up 281 township (group) enterprises,
dozens of which are designated by the Ministry of Agriculture as
national groups.
</P>
<P>
The province's township enterprises mainly operate traditional
businesses that deal in goods such as fur, leather, electric
cable, cashmere, glass, garments and carved stone.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Sees Growth In Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Customs statistics show that the
previously nosediving export of China's capital started a slow
upswing in March, and stood at 193 million US dollar in May.
</P>
<P>
The export value in May went up 23 percent from April, and up
10 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Beijing's exporters said they are still not optimistic
about their businesses, because the total export value during the
first five months of this year dropped by 20 percent from the same
period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The export of both state-owned enterprises and foreign-funded
ventures has risen since March. However, foreign-funded ventures
have increased in export growth by a large margin. Their export
value in May surpassed that of the state-owned enterprises for the
first time in history.
</P>
<P>
During the first five months of this year, the capital's
primary products export dropped by four percent. However, the
finished industrial products export surged four percent.
</P>
<P>
And the export value of machinery and electronics products
accounted for 38 percent of the total export value of finished
industrial products.
</P>
<P>
The capital's export value of processed products with materials
provided by buyers also increased by 20 percent.

NEW YORK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- An index designed to forecast
future economic activity of the United States rose 0.3 percent in
May to its highest level in more than a year, suggesting the U.S.
economy will continue to grow steadily.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, released
today by the Conference Board, comes as Federal Reserve
policy-makers start a two-day meeting to decide whether to raise
interest rates to slow the economy and cool down inflation.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts feel the rate will remain unchanged since the
economy does not appear to be overheating. The May rise in the
leading index only slightly exceeded Wall Street estimates for a
0.2 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
The index's May reading of 102.4, the same as in February 1995,
compares with 102.1 in April.
</P>
<P>
The advance, the index's fourth in a row, follows a 0.3 percent
gain in April and a revised 0.4 percent increase in March. The
index's May reading is the highest since February 1995.
</P>
<P>
Designed to forecast the economy six to nine months in advance,
the May gain suggests the economy will continue growing towards
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Of the leading index's 11 components, seven rose in May. The
biggest gains came from changes in sensitive materials prices, the
average factory workweek, plant and equipment orders and stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
The leading index is seen by economists as most useful in
forecasting the econmy's direction rather than its pace. Three
moves in the same direction tend to be seen as a good indication,
with further such changes representing confirmation more than
anything else.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, based in New York, took charge of the
leading index from the Commerce Department at the beginning of
this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government has decided to back moves by the
Queensland government to indemnify the 1.1 billion Australian
dollars (0.85 billion US dollars) Century Zinc project from future
native title claims following the personal intervention of Prime
Minister Howard.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Australia is back into the two billion Australian dollars
(1.54 billion US dollars) plus current account deficit league once
more, with continued strong import levels and weak exports driving
the trade balance in May into its biggest shortfall in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government Tuesday tried to bolster support for
its planned 8 billion Australian dollars (6 billion US dollars)
spending cuts, warning that any Senate frustration of Budget
measures would harm the economy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Computer Maker to Cut 7,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Digital Equipment Corp., one of
the major computer makers in the U.S., said today it would cut
7,000 jobs in a huge restructuring amid more signs of trouble in
its personal computer business.
</P>
<P>
The company also said fiscal fourth-quarter earnings would be
well below expectations due to the PC problems and slow sales in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Analysts described the new layoffs as the result of market
competition. Price cuts of PC also cut hard into the profits of
many computer makers.
</P>
<P>
Digital said its jobs cuts -- more than 11 percent of its
60,900 jobs -- would take place worldwide. The company has
employees in 100 countries. Previous cutbacks have left Digital
with about half the number of people it employed in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
But increased inventories, depressed sales and price cuts put
Digital's PC business in the red for the latest quarter.
</P>
<P>
After reporting a 68 percent profit increase in the fiscal
third quarter, Digital's managers had said they expected to
sustain higher profit margins.
</P>
<P>
Digital lost 5 billion U.S. dollars during the first half of
the 1990s in its process of production restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The company in 1994 cut its work force by about 25 percent,
from 87,500 to 65,600. That followed two smaller cutbacks in 1992
and 1993. It cut 2,200 jobs in the 12 months leading up to the
last quarter.
</P>
<P>
Digital executives said the company's long-term outlook was
strong.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Get Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street moved lower
today as investors took a cautious stance during the Federal
Reserve's meeting on interest rate policy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 9.60 to 5,720.38,
recovering from an early loss of 35 points.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with the total volume reaching 387.46
million shares, as against 345.72 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 0.69 to 361.01, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.28 to 673.60.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 5.76 to 1,191.69, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 0.69 to 579.56.
</P>
<P>
Dow rallied 75 points on Monday, which was spurred by optimism
the Federal Reserve would leave interest rates unchanged. But
until the Fed issues an official verdict, few investors were
willing to bid prices higher.
</P>
<P>
Bonds slipped this morning, pulling stocks lower, after the
Commerce Department reported that new home sales rose 7.5 percent
in May to the highest level in 10 years. Analysts, noting sharply
higher mortgage rates, had expected sales to fall about 3.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The display of strong consumer demand fanned alive fears of
rising inflation, which would make fixed-income investments such
as bonds less worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, the Federal Reserve's policy-makers began a
two-day meeting to consider the latest economic data and decide
whether to change the central bank's lending rates, which have a
significant effect on the pace of business activity.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts have concluded that there hasn't been enough
evidence of rapid economic growth to justify a rate hike that
would slow economic activities, offsetting inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
There was less market reaction to an earlier report today that
the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, a tool used to forecast
future economic activity, rose 0.3 percent in May to its highest
level in more than a year. The increase slightly exceeded
expectations for a 0.2 percent gain.

<HEADLINE> Biggest Cellar Phone Fraud in US Uncovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Two New Yorkers have been arrested
and accused of using a scanner to steal cellular phone numbers
from motorists.
</P>
<P>
In what was called the biggest cell phone fraud ever happened
in the United States, the two suspects have collected at least
80,000 numbers in the past six months, some of which were "cloned"
by computer into other phones for sale, according to local press
reports today.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, members of an electronic fraud task force raied
an apartment near a busy Brooklyn highway and arrested Abraham
Romy and his girl friend Irina Bashkavich who have recently become
u.s. citizens.
</P>
<P>
The two people, charged with possession, distribution and
trafficking in access devices--a new federal crime-- could be
sentenced to 10 years in prison and face up a fine of 100,000 u.s.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The cellular industry estimated that losses to phone fraud are
around 1.5 million u.s. dollars a day nationwide.

<HEADLINE> New York State Set to End State Control Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- New York State has been set to
abolish its decades-old policy of setting the rates that hospitals
can charge for medical care.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to this effect had been reached between State
Governor George E. Pataki and legislative leaders, according to
New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The Governor and legislators believed that lifting price
controls would unleash market forces, pushing costs down in
insurers and eventually, for patients as well.
</P>
<P>
Under the old rules, the state added about 4 billion u.s.
dollars in surcharges in the hospital rates that it set and
channeled the money to finance an array of public health programs,
including the graduate training of medical students and charity
care.
</P>
<P>
Health care costs in New York are among the highest of any
state in the nation, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed plan, New York would be the first state to
establish a health care tax for graduate medical education.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Bank Predicts Modest Growth for Swiss Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss Bank Corporation predicted
that the Swiss economy would end a long-standing stagnancy with a
modest 0.6 percent GDP growth for this year and a 1.7 percent
growth next year, local press reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank's last economic forecast, the new boom in
Swiss economy is supported by a robust expansion in export.
Private consumption is also expected to pick up by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
A braking factor will continue to be the construction sector,
where real investment would drop by one percent this year. A
stabilization is only possible next year, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate for 1997 would be 4.2 percent, down from
4.5 percent this year, the Swiss Bank Corporation predicted.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- There are children in groups or
single these days in the Zambian television waving hands while
saying "bye-bye, polio".
</P>
<P>
It is a government advertisement to make public a campaign to
the whole country to wipe out the child disease polio.
</P>
<P>
Together with the moving pictures, there is the announcement
from the Ministry of Health urging parents to bring their
children under five to the nearest epidemic prevention center to
take polio-immunity pills on July 19 and 20 or August 23 and 24.
</P>
<P>
The pills are safe and free of charge, it has been announced.
</P>
<P>
The anti-polio drive was declared by President Frederick
Chiluba. While commemorating the Day of the African Child on June
25, Chiluba said the immediate challenge in health before the
government was to eradicate polio from Zambia for ever.
</P>
<P>
He urged all parents to take advantage of the program and
immunize their children against polio.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Offers Reward for Truck Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States offered on
Tuesday a reward of up to $2 million for information leading to
the arrest and the conviction of those responsible for the truck
bombing that blasted a U.S. military complex with a death toll of
19 American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns announcing the offer
at a news briefing said this would supplement the $3 million
reward announced by the Saudi government for the arrest of the
perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
This kind of rewards program, offered in the past in 20
different cases, "has been highly effective in the past", he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Administration has offered $3 million to individuals
who were instrumental in giving information leading to the arrest
and conviction of the culprits such as those responsible for the
bombing of the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
He said the administration is developing posters and matchbooks
to help advertise the reward.
</P>
<P>
Burns declined to answer reporters who asked whether any leads
have been developed since the bombing seven days ago.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in charge of the investigation. and I believe those
who are in charge of the investigation prefer to work in private
and not announce publicly every time that there's a lead. So I
can't speak to the question," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Reassures Arafat of Support to Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) - French President Jacques Chirac
telephoned this evening the President of Palestinian Authority
Yasser Arafat, reassuring him of France's support to the peace
process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesperson Catherine Colonna quoted Chirac as
telling Arafat that "France is disposed to do all so that the
peace process would be pursued."
</P>
<P>
Chirac also said that France "takes sides with those who move
in this direction," said Colonna.
</P>
<P>
The French President said that France's position on the Middle
East is based on the following principles - right of
self-determination by the Palestinian people, the principle of the
exchange of land for peace, and the respect for existing
agreements signed between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said these principles make up the conditions for making
a "fair and lasting peace" in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Monday
in Paris, Chirac said that France wishes that the two sides in the
Middle East should resume peace talks as soon as possible, and
that both sides should refrain from resorting to measures that
could bring harm to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told Arafat that this is also the position of the
European Union and France's partners at the G-7 Summit in Lyon
last week.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the world's seven most industrialized nations
last week explicitly called for the carrying-on of the peace
process, which refers to the agreements Israel has signed with its
Arab neighbors.

<HEADLINE> LSE Unveils Medium-term Business Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The London Stock Exchange (LSE)
Monday unveiled a medium-term business plan, which includes
cutting more than 53 million pounds (82 million US dollars) from
its annual budget and reducing its workforce by nearly 400 to 550.
</P>
<P>
Fields Wicker-Miurin, director of strategy and finance at the
LSE, said that the plan, which would reduce costs to 120 million
pounds (185 million US dollars), was intended to maintain the
prominent place of London in the global pecking order of stock
markets.
</P>
<P>
It was also a move to retain the market's present position of
accounting for about 90 percent of the worldwide trading in UK
equities, and to be the main market for cross-border equities and
to strengthen its position in gilts and eurobonds, she added.
</P>
<P>
Ms Wicker-Miurin pointed out that the exchange had been too
inward-looking. It now intended to cooperate with other exchanges
in an effort to "make the whole market more efficient".
</P>
<P>
In order to promote London as the best place from which to
operate a broking business, Ms Wicker-Miurin said the LSE planned
to extend its trading areas to include emerging markets and
European Union (EU) and non-EU securities.
</P>
<P>
The reforms, which should be completed within 2.5 years, would
make "the entire market more efficient" and "transform ourselves
into a leaner, more focused and effective organization", she
noted.
