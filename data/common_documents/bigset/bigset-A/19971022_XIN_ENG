<HEADLINE> Pakistan Minister on Convertibility of Rupee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Commerce Minister
Ishaq Dar said today his country will not make its currency of
rupee convertible until it acquires a position of healthy and
growing foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview, Ishaq said that as rich foreign
exchange reserves were essential for the convertibility of the
Pakistani currency, Pakistan needs to have its foreign exchange
reserves something to the tune of over 4 to 5 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very natural requirement because wherever in the
world there is a free market in the currency. In order to
stabilize the demand and supply, the central bank of a country
needs to intervene," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So, in order to avoid any speculative moves and exploitation
of the situation by profiteers after the convertibility of the
rupee, a backing of good foreign exchange reserves is required,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the government's concept on rupee
convertibility, he said the original version was one of Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif who wished to open up the currency as per
the existing practice of many developed countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
"So, the Prime Minister's vision is that we should make rupee
convertible as early as feasible and possible", he added.

<HEADLINE> Nevada, Prehistoric Comet Impact Site: Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nevada State in the
southwestern United States is believed to be one of the three
sites on Earth where prehistoric comet impacts occurred, U.S.
scientists said.
</P>
<P>
A comet at about two-thirds of a mile in diameter hit 90 miles
north of Las Vegas near a town called Alamo about 370 million
years ago, making the region, then an ocean 30 feet deep, 10 times
deeper and the crater extending out 120 miles, they said.
</P>
<P>
Geologist Charles Sandberg of the U.S. Geological Survey,
Denver, presented forms of evidence to judge his conclusion to a
Geological Society of America meeting in Salt Lake City Monday,
USA Today reported.
</P>
<P>
Fossilized tree remains dated to the period suggest that the
comet started forest fires in nearby Wyoming, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sandberg showed several forms of evidence found at the area,
including "shocked" quartz grains, deposits of iridium and
carbonate spherules that form in a superheated cloud after
limestone is pulverized.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that giant slabs of rock around Alamo which
were left twisted and lying at angles are also evidence of a
blast.
</P>
<P>
They said during the impact time, called the Devonian period,
80 percent to 90 percent of Earth surface was covered by water. As
a result of three impacts, including this one, over 70 percent of
life on Earth was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Two other impacts are believed to have taken place a few
million years apart in Belgium and Sweden.

<HEADLINE> Africa Gets Small Share in World Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Africa got a small share last
year in the global Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) despite
increased FDI in other regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
FDI inflows into Africa were last year less than the record
level of 5.8 billion U.S. Dollars as Africa got the lowest level
of FDI since early 1994, according to a report from the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
Africa's oil producing countries accounted for about 70
percent of the total direct inflows. Nigeria, being by far the
largest recipient of FDI, got 1.7 billion Dollars in 1996
followed by Egypt which got 740 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Africa's share of FDI inflows from developed countries was
less than 4 percent during the period under review, representing
the lowest share since early 1980, indicating that the region is
not participating in the global FDI boom.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD report, however, said that Africa can still expect
better prospects of inflows of FDI following recent development
of reduction in internal conflicts, the expected economic
recovery and improved macro-economic performance.
</P>
<P>
The World Investment Report 1997 said the potential of South
Africa's economy is a key factor in determining FDI prospects for
parts of sub-Saharan Africa as direct investment by South African
firms could play a crucial role in the development of neighboring
economies.

<HEADLINE> Party Official Urges Public Servants to Do Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese public servants were
called today to adhere to the principle of serving the people
wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
All public servants, whatever they do and whatever position
they hold, must uphold and follow the goal of serving the people
wholeheartedly, and place the interests of the people above
everything, Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China, said in a meeting with representatives of public
servants.
</P>
<P>
Public servants must resolutely implement the basic theory,
line and policies of the Party and make greater contributions to
the economic development and social progress of their respective
areas, thereby advancing the cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
All public servants must use their power to serve the people
rather than to seek interests for themselves, said Hu.
</P>
<P>
"The greater the rights in your hands, the heavier the
responsibilities on your shoulders," he said, urging all public
servants to accept the supervision of the people and fight against
the abuse of rights.
</P>
<P>
Hu urged the public servants to resolutely trust and rely on
the masses, stay in close touch with the masses, heed the voice of
the masses, be concerned with their difficulties and do what they
expect.
</P>
<P>
Bad work style such as bureaucracy and formalism must be
prevented or eradicated, he added.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: "One Country, Two Systems" and China's Reunification (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The concept of "one country,
two systems", a major component of Deng Xiaoping Theory, was used
to solve Hong Kong and Macao issues, and will be also the
guideline for solving the Taiwan issue which is crucial to the
ultimate reunification of China and the revitalization of the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The concept of "one country, two system" embodies the
principles of safeguarding China's sovereignty while achieving
national reunification. The highly flexible concept gives full
consideration to both history and reality.
</P>
<P>
"One country, two systems", based on the precondition of
reunification, requires China to adhere to socialism, with
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan retaining their capitalist system for
a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping's concept is by no means a measure creating an
impediment, but is instead a major strategy.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of "one country, two systems" is conducive to
China's reunification and world peace and development. The
realization of reunification is the common aspiration of the
Chinese people as a whole, including people from the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), Taiwan, Macao and overseas
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Successful implementation of the concept in Hong Kong has
proven that the format is practical and has a bright future.
</P>
<P>
Resolving the Taiwan issue is one of China's major priorities
after solving the issues of Kong Hong and Macao. President Jiang
Zemin introduced his eight-point proposal in 1995 setting forth
the basic principles of the Communist Party of China for solving
the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
The main points of Jiang's proposal follow:
</P>
<P>
First, adherence to the "one China" principle. Adherence to the
principle is the basis and primary condition for China's
reunification. The core of "peaceful reunification", "one country,
two systems" and the eight-point proposal centers on the fact that
China's sovereignty and territory should be reunified.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the two sides of the Taiwan Straits are
not as yet reunified, Taiwan is nonetheless an unseparable part of
the People's Republic of China, with the latter having
indisputable sovereignty over the former.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China resolutely opposes those who advocate "split
sovereignty, separate governments" and claim that the two sides
are equal political entities. All activities carried out with a
view towards creating "two Chinas", or "one China, one Taiwan" are
doomed to failure.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Extremists Kill Six in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed and
scores of others wounded today in a southern Philippine province
when a group of heavily armed men attacked a coconut cooperative,
local television reports said.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, believed to be members of the Muslim extremist Abu
Sayyaf group, fired at a crowd of villagers in Lantawan town,
Basilan province, and fled immediately after the carnage, the Sky
Cable television reported.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the authorities had so far failed to determine
the motive for the massacre.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, which is notorious for robberies, kidnappings
and harassment of villagers, has been pursued hard by the military
for abducting and killing eight villagers early this month.
</P>
<P>
The extremist group and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) are the two remaining Muslim rebel forces still fighting
the government.
</P>
<P>
The MILF began peace talks with the government early this year,
but the Abu Sayyaf has shunned peace negotiations with Manila.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) signed a
peace agreement with the government in September 1996.

<P>
Second, striving for reunification. Both sides of the Taiwan
Straits belong to the Chinese nation, and thus achieving
reunification through peaceful means and realizing national
revitalization will not only benefit people across the Straits,
but will also promote peace and development in Asia and the world
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Reunification is the common aspiration of all Chinese people
and is also welcomed by the international community.
</P>
<P>
However, the development of separatism in Taiwan and the
interference of foreign forces has prevented the People's Republic
of China from committing itself the abandonment of the use of
force. The stance is in no way directed at the people of Taiwan,
but instead at foreign forces meddling in the issue and at the
attempting to achieve "Taiwan independence".
</P>
<P>
Third, promoting peaceful reunification through
negotiations. Reunification will finally be achieved through
proper means. Deng Xiaoping once suggested that the Communist
Party and the Kuomintang hold talks on a equal footing -- the
third cooperation of CPC and the KMT in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin's report during the CPC 15th National Congress once
again called for political negotiations between the two sides at
the earlist possible date.
</P>
<P>
The first step, according to Jiang, will require the two sides
to hold talks designed to "formally end hostilities under the
principle of one China" and reach an agreement. The two sides
should commit themselves to certain obligations and proceed from
the standpoint of safeguarding the integrity of China's
sovereignty and territory, and draft plans for the future
development of relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The problem of reunification must be solved by the Chinese
people from both sides of the Taiwan straits, Jiang said. He
called to ideas and suggestions conducive to the reunification
effort.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Confirms Release of South Koreans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today confirmed the release of two South
Koreans who had mistakenly crossed the Korean Military Demarcation
Line (MDL) into the DPRK four days ago.
</P>
<P>
The two were handed over to South Korea earlier today, the
DPRK's official KCNA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In Seoul, the South Korean media said that the two South
Koreans were released today by the army of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, said the United States Forces stationed in
South Korea (USFK).
</P>
<P>
At about ten o'clock in the morning, representatives of the
USFK and the Korean People's Army (KPA) met at the site of the
October-17 Demilitarized-Zone incident where the two South Koreans
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
During a joint investigation by USFK and KPA officials, the two
South Koreans said they "accidentally" crossed the Military
Demarcation Line in an area that was not clearly marked, into the
DPRK's side.
</P>
<P>
They were released four days after their detention, said the
USFK.
</P>
<P>
The two South Koreans, a 66-year-old woman and her 41 year-old
son, is in good physical condition and have returned to
Taesong-dong, a village south of the 4-kilometer-wide buffer zone
between the DPRK and South Korea.

<P>
Fourth, adopting practical measures to promote exchanges
between the two sides. Jiang Zemin once said "we should pin our
hopes on the people of Taiwan." The great tradition of patriotism
of Taiwan people is an important force for developing relations
between the two sides and promoting peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
Expanding exchanges will promote efforts to enhance mutual
understanding and achieve common views. Therefore efforts should
be made to increase trade and economic cooperation between the two
sides. Policies to encourage Taiwan investment in mainland areas
must be continued and the legal interests of Taiwan businesspeople
must be protected under all conditions.
</P>
<P>
It is important to expand exchanges and cooperation in the
science and technology sectors, as well as the cultural
sector. Related efforts will also promote the realization of
direct commercial, postal and transportation links.
</P>
<P>
People from all parties and circles in Taiwan, apart from a
small group of hardliners calling for "Taiwan Independence," are
welcome to exchange opinions on the reunification issue.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, adherance to the principle of "one country, two
systems". Following the reunification of the two sides, the
Chinese maiinland will continue to practise socialism, with Taiwan
retaining its capitalist system for a long period of time. Taiwan
will retain its social and economic systems, lifestyle and
nongovernmental relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, a special administrative region following
reunification, will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, including
having its own legislature and administration of justice with the
right of final adjudication.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Taiwan can also have its own military force. The
central government will not send troops or public service people
to Taiwan. People from Taiwan will fill certain vacancies in the
central government leadership.
</P>
<P>
Finally, people from both sides share the same culture, and
should carry forward the fine tradition of the Chinese nation. The
small group of people in Taiwan who have attempted to sever
historic and cultural ties between the two sides are doomed to
failure.

<HEADLINE> African Exporters Urged to Improve Packaging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 21 (Xinhua) -- African companies need to
improve the packaging of their products if they are to
effectively compete with imported goods, exhibitors at Zimbabwe's
packaging and printing exhibition said today.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the three-day exhibition in Bulawayo,
Zimbabwe's second largest city, most exhibitors said other
countries had advanced ways of packaging their goods which most
African countries still had to catch up with.
</P>
<P>
Although most products such as coffee were grown locally,
Africans failed to market them because they lacked the ability to
package them attractively, they said.
</P>
<P>
''African products can penetrate the European market with good
packaging because that alone can sell a product,'' said Pankaj
Patel, Director of the Kenyan-based Prudential Printers.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean companies, however, expressed optimism that the
situation has been changing as they are constantly researching to
improve their packaging.
</P>
<P>
Paul Denton, an export executive with the locally-based Treger
Plastics, said one of the ways of doing this was through constant
participation in international fairs and conferences.
</P>
<P>
Organizer of the exhibition, Zimbabwe International Trade Fair
said 20 foreign companies and 100 local firms were attending the
exhibition which is aimed at promoting the printing and packaging
industry.

SHANGHAI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one-fifth of Shanghai's
population, or 2.31 million people, were aged above 60 at the end

</P>
<P>
To date, the city has set up over 400 old people's homes with
more than 12,000 beds. Meanwhile, more than 640,000 local people
have volunteered to assist poor or lonely old people, Feng said,
introducing Shanghai's experience in caring the old to other
participants.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests Turkish Violation of Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has strongly protested
to the United Nations against recent violations of its sovereign
airspace and the Nicosia Flight Information Region (FIR) by
Turkish military aircraft, Cyprus News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The protest was contained in a letter addressed to the 52nd
U.N. General Assembly and the Security Council by Cypriot
Permanent Representative to the U.N., Nicos Agathocleous,
according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
Agathocleous stressed in his letter that "these highly
provocative and aggressive actions of Turkey cause serious concern
and heighten tension in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out between September 30 to October 14, "an
alarmingly increasing number" of violations of Cyprus' airspace
and of the Nicosia FIR by military aircraft of the Turkish air
force took place.
</P>
<P>
He cited a detailed list of all violations by Turkish military
aircraft including F-16 fighters and RF-4 reconnaissance planes.
</P>
<P>
"Such provocative actions by Turkey, which are continuing, are
in contravention of the provisions of the Security Council
resolutions on Cyprus," the Cypriot diplomat noted.
</P>
<P>
The letter pointed out that such overflights increase political
tension on the island and undermine efforts toward achieving a
final settlement to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus held a military exercise code-named "Nikiforos '97"
from October 10 to 14, with the participation of Greek air and
naval forces.
</P>
<P>
Turkey responded with repeated violations of Cypriot and Greek
airspace and a plan of military exercises in northern Cyprus next
month.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island following a
failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved despite the U.N. and
international community's peace efforts for the past 23 year.

<P>
MOSCOW, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today met parliamentary factions leaders in the Kremlin in an
effort to dissuade Russia's leftist opposition from a censure vote
on the cabinet, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said after the meeting that the no-confidence motion on
the government scheduled for Wednesday's session of the State
Duma, or the lower house of parliament, will decide "whether the
political stability continues in the country or not."
</P>
<P>
Interfax noted that the president will send the State Duma a
message to show support to the issues raised earlier by the
leaders of the Communist Party faction, the Popular Rule and
Agrarian parliamentary groups.
</P>
<P>
As for today's meeting, Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky said the president is satisfied with the meeting,
describing it as "productive."
</P>
<P>
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov is also reported to be
satisfied with the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The conversation was fruitful and we were met half way on
practically all matters which the left-wing opposition put
forward," Zyuganov was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Shokhin, leader of Our Home Is Russia faction, said
the left guarantees to withdraw its back of the no-confidence
motion.
</P>
<P>
Only leader of Yabloko faction, Grigory Yavlinsky, insisted his
support to the no-confidence motion, if it is put to vote on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznev predicted that after
the president's meeting with Duma factions leaders, the

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges Action to Reduce Global Hunger by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today called on all states to take actions to reduce
the global hunger by half by the year 2015.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at a special ceremony to mark the World Food Day,
the secretary-general said that 800 million people in the world
were chronically hungry, which represented roughly one out of
every seven people on earth and included more than 200 million
children under the age of five.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said millions more were plagued by blindness,
retarded growth and other ailments related to hunger and
malnutrition, and by deliberating effects of diets lacking in
essential vitamins and minerals. Twenty-nine countries, mostly in
Africa, were experiencing food emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Annan said on the threshold of a new century, the age-old
problem of hunger was tragically widespread. As long as such
suffering was allowed to continue, the hopes for an era of
enduring peace and sustainable development would go unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
He said this year's World Food Day theme "Investing in Food
Security" highlighted the question of resources. Recent years had
not only seen a decline in official development assistance, but
also a drop in agriculture's share of aid. Moreover, countries
most threatened by food insecurity were not investing enough in
the agricultural sector or in the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said investment was not just a question
of building irrigation system, roads and other infrastructure.
Investment in human resources, and particularly in the education
of women and girls, was just as vital. It was by now common wisdom
that investment in the education of women and girls had the
highest rate of return of any type of investment in development.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that at last November's World Food Summit in Rome,
world leaders pledged to reduce the number of hungry and
malnourished people by half by the year 2015. That was a practical
and attainable target. He called on the governments to rise to
this challenge and encouraged the partnership of private sector
and civil society in this effort.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the United Nations, for its part, had worked since
its inception to help break the vicious circle of hunger,
malnutrition and poverty. The Food and Agriculture Organization,
along with the World Food Program and the International Fund for
Agricultural Development, together with the World Bank, the United
Nations Development Program, the United Nations Children's Fund
and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, had all
been deeply involved. Today in the spirit of United Nations
reform, each had taken steps to improve its effectiveness and
coordination.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed the world had enough food. What it lacked was
the political will to ensure that all people had access to this
bounty, that all people enjoyed food security.

<HEADLINE> Protection of Three Gorges Cultural Relics Well Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A large group of Chinese
archeologists are working hard to rescue and protect cultural
relics affected by the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey showed that some 1,280 cultural relics sites
have been discovered in areas near the Three Gorges Dam, China's
largest water conservancy project on the Yangtze River which will
be dammed early next month.
</P>
<P>
The 590 buried and 293 above ground cultural relics sites in
areas near the municipality of Chongqing which will be submerged
account for over two thirds of the total number of cultural relics
in the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists noted that their work over the next 12 years will
proceed in accordance with the progress of the Three Gorges
Project.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, work for the remainder of this year will focus on the
32 cultural relics near Wushan County and Fuling
city. Archeologists working in the areas expect to record
breakthrough in prehistoric studies.

<HEADLINE> Economists on Continued Weakness of SE Asian Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Although speculative pressures
were behind the initial depreciation of Southeast Asian
currencies, substantial short-term foreign debts, increased demand
for foreign exchanges and lack of confidence have played a role in
the currencies' continued fall.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reasons behind the continued weakness of
Southeast Asian currencies, World Bank economists Amar
Battacharya, Stijn Claessens and Leonardo Hernadez said
substantial short-term external liabilities of financial
institutions and corporates, the sharp reduction in external
financing and unwillingness among foreign investors to roll-over
short-term loans have resulted in increased net outflow from the
region.
</P>
<P>
In a paper presented to a meeting on Asia's economic outlook
here, they said there has been increased demand for foreign
exchange as many banks and financial institutions try to cover
open positions in anticipation of further depreciation and
currency volatility.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors, especially equity fund managers, have been
adopting a wait-and-see approach and are withholding new
investments, because they lack confidence in economic fundamentals
and policy measures of Southeast Asian countries, the economists
said.
</P>
<P>
"These three factors have created perceptions of further
currency declines, thus increasing incentives for buying foreign
exchange today," they said.
</P>
<P>
Since early July, the currencies of Singapore, Thailand,
Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia have depreciated between 10
percent to over 30 percent respectively. Economists say the
currency crisis could last another several months.

<HEADLINE> Private Firms Invited to Join in SADC Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The 14-member Southern African
Development Community (SADC) intends to actively involve the
private sector in its proposed multi-million Dollars drought
mitigation program, an SADC official said today.
</P>
<P>
The fund would assist drought prone countries in the region,
which have experienced two poor agricultural seasons in the last
five years.
</P>
<P>
Reginald Mugwara, the SADC food security sector coordinator
noted that his sector and the Development Bank of Southern Africa
are given a task to negotiate with, among others, the World Bank
and the European Union to see what role the private sector would
play.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of the year negotiations with the World Bank will
begin," Mugwara told the Zimbabwe News Agency, adding that the
initial 30 million U.S. Dollars proposed would have to be
reviewed as well as various other details pertaining to the fund.
</P>
<P>
A workshop was held last year in Harare where each country
presented a project proposal of a nutrition and information
system needed to identify vulnerable groups.
</P>
<P>
The final document from these proposals would assist in
determining the optimum level of the financial facility.
</P>
<P>
There would also be need to look at control measures of the
fund, as well as legal procedures governing its operations,
Mugwara added.
</P>
<P>
Seed money would come from governments and non-governmental
organizations, and the fund would not be a welfare scheme as
borrowing would be at concessionary interest rates to encourage
countries to utilize it.
</P>
<P>
During the inception stages of the fund, it was expected to
finance maize purchases and would be expanded when its capital
base has increased to purchase other corps, Mugwara explained.

<HEADLINE> LPC on Minimum Wage Fact Finding Tour in Scotland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Low Pay Commission has been
in Scotland today to gather information on the likely impact of
the minimum wage in Scotland, according to an announcement from
the commission.
</P>
<P>
During the day the commission met a wide range of people --
employers, employees, voluntary organizations, low paid and
unemployed people -- to hear their views on what effect a national
minimum wage might have on them.
</P>
<P>
Questions asked include: What should be included in the minimum
wage --tips, bonuses, overtime? Should there be different rates
for people between the ages of 16-25? What will the minimum wage
mean for particular business and voluntary sectors?
</P>
<P>
The commission said it had already written to over 600
organizations. Today's visit is the first of a series the
commission will make across Britain to meet people and gather the
evidence they need on which to base their recommendation on the
minimum wage to the Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Georte Bain, chairman of the Low Pay Commission, said, "We have
to recommend to the prime minister an initial rate for the minimum
wage that will apply in every sector of the economy right across
the United Kingdom."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore it is important that we visit all parts of the
United Kingdom... so we can find out what effect the minimum wage
might have," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Low Pay Commission is an independent advisory body set up
to recommend to the prime minister the initial level at which the
National Minimum Wage might be set.

<HEADLINE> Ross Arranges Meeting Between Arafat, Mordechai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Amid reports of some
progress in the Israeli-Palestinian talks, U.S. peace envoy
Dennis Ross will host later today a meeting between Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
The Arafat-Mordechai meeting is to be held at the Erez
Checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip. Ross arranged the
meeting in a bid to push the two sides to wrap up an agreement
on opening the Gaza airport in Dahaniya by resolving the dispute
over security matters.
</P>
<P>
Ross held a third meeting here with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu this afternoon after he participated in a
committee-level meeting held in Tel Aviv by Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators. Attending the Tel Aviv meeting were
Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, Foreign Ministry's adviser
Yaacov Bardugo and senior Palestinian negotiators Saeb Erekat
and Hasan Asfour.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said after the meeting that Ross demanded for progress
in the talks despite Israeli positions. He added the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) does not have trust and confidence in
the current Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, Palestinian negotiator Jamil
Tarifi, who is in charge of civil affairs talks, said progress
was made in increasing the annual residence permits issued for
the reunion of Palestinian families.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1995 peace accord, Israel issues 2,000 residence
permits annually to Palestinians for reunion. Now the PNA is
demanding Israel increase the number to 10,000, a request that
Israel is reportedly considering favorably.
</P>
<P>
The major headway in the Israeli-Palestinian talks seems to
be the negotiations on forging an aviation accord over the Gaza
airport. Israeli officials told local newspapers that
progress was made at the meeting held Monday between Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy and chief PNA negotiator Mahmoud
Abbas (Abu Mazen) hosted by Ross.
</P>
<P>
The accord reportedly comprises three main categories: entry
into Israeli-controlled air space, customs procedures, and
security arrangements on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Israel and PNA negotiators are on the verge of agreeing on
letting Arafat's helicopter to use the Gaza airport, where the
runway is expected to be available to his private jet soon.
</P>
<P>
The PNA preferred to separate the specific airport
arrangements for Arafat and his family from other terms of the
embryonic accord. Levy sought a "package deal," which would
encompass the crucial security aspects of the airport's
operations.
</P>
<P>
But there are no indication if the two sides have narrowed
their dispute over the issue of security control in the
airport. Israel has maintained that it should be granted
security presence in all entries into the airport, while the PNA
is trying to limit Israel's control.
</P>
<P>
The Arafat-Mordechai meeting is aimed at nailing down details
on allowing Arafat's helicopter to use the Gaza airport as a
good-will gesture by Israel to improve the atmosphere for
advancing the talks.

<HEADLINE> Britain Pledges Not to Give Up EU Budget Rebate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
strongly indicated that it will not give up the country's annual
European Union (EU) budget rebate.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a House of Lords select committee early today,
Britain's Economic Secretary to the Treasury Helen Liddell said,
"That is written in stone, and we will insist that it remains
written in stone."
</P>
<P>
The rebate has put some 20 billion pounds (about 32 billion
U.S. dollars) back into British Treasury coffers over the past 13
years and in 1996-97, it amounted to 2.19 billion pounds (about
3.50 billion dollars), more than half of the country's EU
membership fee.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Britain, even with the rebate, was a net
contributor to the EU budget despite ranking 11th among the 15 EU
member states.
</P>
<P>
"The British government is not prepared to countenance any
change in the abatement structure that exists for the United
Kingdom at the present time," she said.
</P>
<P>
On Germany's proposal to reduce its net EU contribution,
Liddell said that Britain had sympathy with Bonn but it was up to
Germany to ease its own burden by agreeing to slash EU agriculture
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
"The quickest way to get net contributions from Germany down is
for Germany to agree to cut EU agriculture spending," she added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Help Handle Indonesia's Monetary Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong today agreed to join in the efforts of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) in helping Indonesia cope with its the current
monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Goh and President Soeharto will instruct their
(respective) apparatuses to explain the agreement," Minister/State
Secretary Moerdiono said following the two leaders' meeting at the
Merdeka Palace.
</P>
<P>
Goh arrived here Monday for a two-day working visit as part of
regular consultations among regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Moerdiono said, Soeharto briefed his guest
about the ongoing monetary crisis in the country and the efforts
Indonesia are making to overcome the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The president also briefed Goh about the meeting between
Indonesian officials and an IMF team, he added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team has been talking with Indonesian officials since
last week for a long-term loan sought by the Indonesian government
to deal with the monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah, along with other regional currencies,
have been under speculative attacks since the devaluation of the
Thai baht in July. The rupiah has dropped by about 50 percent
against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Singapore will pump in funds, Moerdiono said
officials of the two countries will soon meet on the issue.
</P>
<P>
On progress in the dialogue between Indonesian officials and
the IMF, he said the discussion is approaching the final stage.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Goh said the policies on market orientations
implemented by the Indonesian government at the start of the
crisis will help Indonesia weather the monetary turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Goh said the loss of confidence on the part of investors had
weakened the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
On the Singapore's planned assistance for Indonesia, Moerdiono
said, it could be in the form of fresh money.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Sell Two Sugar Factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government will
sell two state-owned sugar making factories, Director of the
National Sugar Association Arnaldo Ribeiro has said.
</P>
<P>
Local press today quoted Ribeiro as saying that a Mauritius
enterprise is now negotiating with the Sena Sugar Company which
has the two plants under it at Marromeu of Sofala province and at
Luabo of Zambazia province respectively.
</P>
<P>
Damaged during the civil war, the two factories would be
rehabilitated with a capital of 90 million U.S. Dollars, starting
to planting sugarcanes after levelling the fields next year.
</P>
<P>
At the first stage, the two factories need 2,000 farm hands,
and by 2005, they will need about 5,000 laborers to restore its
best capacity of turning out 120,000 tons of sugar annually, the
director said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Mauritius, Malaysia and Cuba are also bidding for
the purchase of the two plants under the Sena Sugar Co.
</P>
<P>
Ribeiro added that it needs to invest in rehabilitating the
road and railway linking the two plants with sea ports for
the exports of its sugar.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique produced 41,000 tons of sugar while its sugar
export once topped 350,000 in history.

<HEADLINE> Manila Begins Troop Withdrawal From Near Rebel Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military began to
pull back troops today from positions near a major Muslim rebels'
camp in the southern Philippines after the latter agreed to stop
executing people they themselves found guilty.
</P>
<P>
The compromise was reached during an emergency meeting between
negotiators from the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) in Cotabato city, capital of southern Maguindanao
province.
</P>
<P>
The MILF also agreed to reposition its fighters in three towns
in Maguindanao where they have been preparing for a possible
offensive by the military against their main headquarters in Camp
Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Fortunato Abat said the MILF vowed not to
initiate any more public executions before November 12 when the
MILF and the government begin their next round of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Both parties will closely monitor the implementation of the
agreement to ease tension in the towns of Buldon, Matanog and
Barira, all surrounding Camp Abubakar, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government troops are now withdrawing from the three towns
and returning to positions they occupied before October 16, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been building around Camp Abubakar these days as
the military deployed as many as some 1,000 troops near the camp
in a sign of being poised for an attack on the rebel stronghold.
</P>
<P>
The troop movement was widely believed to be in retaliation for
a terrorist attack against a military camp last week and the
execution of "criminals" by the MILF early this month.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, two Arabians raided a military camp in
Maguindanao, killing three soldiers before they themselves were
shot dead. The military blamed the attack on the MILF, but the
rebels strongly denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the MILF defied the country's constitution
and ordered the public execution of two people whom a rebel court
found guilty of murder. The executions were strongly condemned by
the government.

<HEADLINE> Iran Pays Off 75 Percent of Rescheduled Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Central Bank Governor
Mohsen Nourbakhsh announced here today that it has paid off 75
percent of its arrears.
</P>
<P>
Nourbakhsh was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as
saying that only 3.6 billion U.S. dollars has remained from
Iran's total rescheduled debts which should be paid next year.
</P>
<P>
Giving an explanation to the Parliament's session on the
economic situation of the country and the budget plan,
Nourbakhsh said that Iran's financial and credit status at
international level is satisfactory and foreign banks have
offered credit-lines to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Defining foreign debt is a problem in Iran. Estimates of
total liabilities ranged 30-35 billion dollars in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
However, after two years of conflicting government statements
about Iran's real external debt position, Nourbakhsh stated in
January 1996 that the total external debts amounted to 23.41
billion dollars in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
The higher oil export revenue and tightened economic policy in
the past two years have reduced the pressure upon the debt
servicing of the Iranian government.

<P>
KATHMANDU, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from the
seven South Asian countries met here today to formulate an action
plan for the transition to a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA)
by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The second meeting of the Inter-Governmental Expert Group
(IGEG) on Transition to SAFTA will focus on finalizing its terms
of reference and draw a broader road map and timeframe for this
process, said a press release issued by the Kathmandu-based South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Attending the three-day meeting are about 20 representatives
from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and
Sri Lanka -- all are SAARC member countries.
</P>
<P>
At a May summit held in the Maldives, the SAARC countries
decided to move from the South Asian Preferential Trading
Arrangement to the SAFTA by 2001.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in late July in Kathmandu, the SAARC's
Inter-Governmental Group (IGG) on Trade Liberalization urged the
IGEG to expedite the formulation of an action plan on the SAFTA
which will serve as a blueprint for successive rounds of trade
negotiations by the IGG.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends MONUA Mandate Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today recommended extension of the mandate of the
United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) for three months
until January 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his report, the UN secretary-general expressed concern over
the very slow pace of the demilitarization of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) which was absolutely
essential for the successful implementation of the provisions of
the Lusaka Protocol, and the recent slowdown of the extension of
state administration into the areas controlled by the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Annan called on the UNITA to finalize arrangements for the
transfer of all areas to government control and ensure that local
UNITA structures cooperate with the newly installed government
administrations.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said that it would be difficult to consider that
the UNITA had taken all steps necessary to comply with the
provisions of Security Council resolutions unless additional
concrete steps were taken to accelerate the implementation of the
remaining tasks, including the transformation of Radio Vorgan into
a non-partisan broadcast facility.
</P>
<P>
He once again strongly urged the Angolan government and the
UNITA to take a number of specific steps that could enhance mutual
trust and confidence, and improve the prospects for national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Annan also expressed concern over the reports of the presence
of Angolan armed elements in the Republic of the Congo and called
on all concerned to avoid any action that could exaggerate tension
in the conflict-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed the continuing goodwill of the international
society was imperative to the peace process in Angola. He called
on the international society to make every effort to ensure that
gains achieved so far were sustained and reinforced.

<HEADLINE> Reno, Freeh Defend Selection of New FBI Lab Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Louis J.
Freeh today defended the selection of a physicist with no forensic
background to head the FBI crime lab, saying a scientist-manager
is needed to take the troubled facility in new directions.
</P>
<P>
FBI lab head Donald M. Kerr Jr., 58, is a physicist-engineer,
who from 1979 to 1985 headed the government's Los Alamos National
Laboratory that designed nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Reno told a news conference that Freeh broadened the search
beyond forensic scientists "when it became clear that the immense
challenges facing the laboratory's next director required a
brilliant scientist as well as a brilliant manager."
</P>
<P>
Freeh said Kerr's management skills would help the FBI build a
new laboratory, expected to be completed in summer 2000, at its
training facility in Quantico, Virginia, and help lead the lab
into new research on chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and
computer crime.
</P>
<P>
Freeh said Kerr's "remarkable background will be invaluable as
the FBI carries out its priority efforts to prevent terrorists
from using nuclear, biological or chemical weapons in the United
States."
</P>
<P>
Freeh said Kerr would hire four top scientists in the areas of
biology, chemistry, physical-material science and computers to
assist him.
</P>
<P>
Kerr said a report by the Justice Department inspector general
last April "made clear we have to tighten our procedures for
handling evidence and the way we communicate our results to
courts." He promised to "make sure our processes and protocols are
defensible and appropriate."

<HEADLINE> US Firm Uses Fuel Cell to Turn Gas Into Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 21 (xinhua) -- Plug Power, a New York-based
company, said today that it has successfully converted gasoline
into electricity through a fuel cell module with expectations for
lower energy costs and gas emission.
</P>
<P>
The company, which developed the technology in collaboration
with the U.S. Department of Energy, sees this as a breakthrough
and a major step toward the advancement of zero emission vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Unlike traditional combustion engines, fuel cells generate
electricity through an electro-chemical process, it said in a wire
service report.
</P>
<P>
The system converts the chemical energy of hydrogen -- and/or
hydrocarbons -- and oxygen into electrical energy and it produces
negligible amounts of sulfur and nitrogen oxides and less than
half the amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The company is considering mass manufacturing of this kind of
fuel cells and is planning to convert natural gas into electricity
for residential uses.
</P>
<P>
It believes that homeowners will save on their energy bills as
fuel cell operating costs will be lower than the cost of
electricity delivered through a utility's distribution system.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Places Order for War Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone has placed orders for three war planes to boost its attacks
on west African peacekeepers known as ECOMOG battling to overturn
the regime in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's defense spokesman, Col. Godwin Ugbo, said here today
that information on the buying of the jet fighters from Ukraine
was received from intelligence reports.
</P>
<P>
Unaware of whether the jet fighters had arrived, the spokesman
said "there is some connection between Sierra Leone and Ukraine."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the alleged defying of the current
economic blockade on the junta by gun-running Ukrainian ships.
</P>
<P>
Ugbo urged the international community to call on Ukraine to
stop its subversive support to the illegal regime, saying that
giving support to the junta was against the convention of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The buying of the fighter planes, according to military
sources, would help the junta to consolidate its war efforts
against ECOMOG, which has been raging for months after ECOMOG
stepped up attacks on the regime to restore ousted President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah was sacked by a military coup by Major Johnny Paul
Koroma on May 25 this year. The Koroma-led junta has vowed to
stay in power until 2001.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Alpha jets are part of arsenals deployed to Sierra
Leone by ECOMOG to enforce an economic embargo imposed by the UN
and west African leaders.
</P>
<P>
However, the defense spokesman restated the difficulty of
sacking the junta through sanctions, saying that "economic
blockade is always difficult to succeed."

killed and more than 300 injured in the bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
He said he is optimistic about the progress in the peace
negotiations between Israel and the PNA, which were resumed early
this month after a seven-month-long deadlock and will continue in
Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
The envoy called for Israel and the PNA to "take profit of this
peaceful moment to create a mechanism and institute an
international framework in order that we will not go back to the
same situation that we were unfortunately facing during last
month."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the mechanism, EU has proposed that Israel and the
PNA adopt a code of conduct, which was described by Moratinos as a
framework for final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos confirmed that the code proposal, that calls for
safeguarding all the signed agreements in the peace process and
for introducing confidence-building measures to bolster the fight
against terrorism and refrain from activities harmful to the
progress, has won positive responses from Israel and PNA.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai Tuesday morning, the envoy also raised the issue of a
permanent security committee as a part of the code, which would
consist of Israelis and Palestinians and could include EU and the
United States representatives if the two parties agreed.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said that the establishment of the committee is aimed
at boosting international cooperation in the region to fight
terrorism and avoid violence in a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the possibility of the resumption of
Israeli-Syrian peace talks, Moratinos said more work is needed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian process was stalled in March last year after
a series of bombing attacks against Israelis by Muslim
extremists. Syria conditions peace talks on an Israeli promise of
total withdrawal of troops from the occupied Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> French FM Intervenes in Dispute Over Vichy Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin today intervened in the on-going debate over the trial of
former Vichy official Maurice Papon, and denied that the Socialist
Party is taking advantage of the trial to defame former President
Charles de Gaulle and the Gaullist movement he created.
</P>
<P>
In an article entitled "Assez! Assez! Assez! (Enough! Enough!
Enough!)" published today by Le Figaro, former parliament speaker
and president of the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR)
Philippe Seguin said that the trial of Papon is "the pretext for
two trials:" those of General de Gaulle and Gaullist movement.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Socialist government of "benevolent complicity"
in the defamation movement which is aimed at replacing the classic
rightwing of France with the extreme-right National Front of
Jean-Marie Le Pen.
</P>
<P>
Just before Jospin was to make a statement over the trial of
Papon, Seguin quit the hemicycle meeting hall of the National
Assembly in an unprecedented confrontation with the prime minister
since the latter came to power in June.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a trial of Gaullism, it was not formulated by the
leaders of the majority or by the government," said Jospin.
</P>
<P>
As for the question of whether France was responsible for the
deportation of some 76,000 Jews to Nazi death camps during the
occupation period from 1940 to 1944, Jospin echoed a 1995
statement by President Jacques Chirac that it was the "French
state" which had done the "irreparable."
</P>
<P>
"France was in London or in Vercors, it was not in Vichy.
Vichy, it was the negation of France, of the republic," said
Jospin.
</P>
<P>
Vercors, a mountain area located in northern France, was the
shelter of many resistance fighters of France during World War II.
It was also the scene of a battle between French guerrillas and
German troops in June and July of 1944, in which many French
fighters were killed by the Germans.
</P>
<P>
Papon, 87, is being tried for the deportation of 1,690 Jews
from 1942 to 1944, when he served as the secretary general of
Gironde Prefecture under the Vichy regime.
</P>
<P>
Papon also served as Paris police chief in 1961 and budget
minister in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Sends Letter to Duma Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today instructed the government to withdraw a draft tax code from
the State Duma and declared the creation of a conciliatory
commission on the law "On Government of the Russian Federation."
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, this was contained in
a message of the president to Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov,
Russian Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the
Agrarian faction Nikolai Kharitonov and leader of the Power to
the People bloc Nikolai Ryzhkov.
</P>
<P>
The report said the message was made in the light of today's
meeting between the president and both speakers of parliament,
heads of factions and deputy groups and Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
In the message Yeltsin expressed the hope that Duma deputies
will support his strife for public accord and political stability.
He confirmed the work of "the council of four" and "the
round-table meeting" would become permanent.
</P>
<P>
On the adoption of the 1998 draft budget, Yeltsin said all
participants in the meeting agreed the budget must be adopted
before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that it was decided to form a commission on
the reform of housing and public utilities. He also confirmed
agreements on mass media and formation of observer councils at the
ORT television company and the all-Russian state television and
radio company to involve deputies of the State Duma, members of
the Federation Council and intellectuals.

<HEADLINE> US Government Endorses EU Currency Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government said
today that it expects a single European currency has no negative
impact on the U.S. economy or to the dollar's continued dominance
of the international financial system.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration endorsed preparations for a single
European currency although the U.S. government has no direct role
in preparations for the EMU.
</P>
<P>
"If the European Monetary Union works for Europe, it will work
for the United States," declared U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence H. Summers.
</P>
<P>
"We have the same interest with regard to the creation of a
single economy.... We are well served when the region is vibrant
economically, and is working to open its markets and strengthen
its ties with the global economy," he told a penal of the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government in the past has been reluctant to comment
publicly on arrangements for the European Monetary Union, deeming
it inappropriate to meddle in debates over whether a single
currency is right for Europe or over details of how it should be
structured.
</P>
<P>
"When Europe is growing rapidly, it is a more dynamic market
for our exports, and a stronger partner for us around the world,"
Summers said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, America's trade with the EU's 15 nations exceeded
270 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Summers also said that it was difficult to predict with any
certainty what role the euro will have in the international
financial system. Currently 64 percent of foreign exchange
reserves worldwide are held in U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Bundesbank Chief Upbeat About Euro Filling Mark's Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- German central bank president Hans
Tietmeyer expressed optimism today that a stable euro could fully
replace the mark as an international reserve and investment
currency.
</P>
<P>
"A stable euro can follow in the footsteps of the D-mark as a
worldwide investment and reserve currency and extend its role
considerably," he told a 50th anniversary meeting of the German
Association for the Protection of Shareholders in Duesseldorf.
</P>
<P>
Tietmeyer stressed the need for the same confidence in the euro
as in the mark, and assured that the German central bank, the
Bundesbank, would work very hard to prevent the inflationary
pressures which he warned would build up before the introduction
of the common European currency.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he noted that any harm to the independence of the
future European Central Bank would "endanger the euro's
international reputation."
</P>
<P>
"The more convincingly the European Central bank can safeguard
price stability, the better the euro's chances," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Arab businessmen and investors called for the
creation of an Arab bank with a capital of 500 million U.S.
dollars to finance investments and trade in the Middle East, local
newspaper Beirut Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The bank was essential to help boost investments in the Arab
states, the paper said, quoting recommendations at the end of the
three-day 7th Arab Business and Investors' Conference which
concluded here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The conference underlined the need for the establishment of big
Arab commercial banks to cope with the tough competition from
Western counterparts, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The participants urged Arab banks to merge to make them more
capable of handling a crisis, it reported.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations also called for modernizing and regulating
the banking system in Arab states to keep pace with developments.
</P>
<P>
The Arab states must remove all the obstacles to movements of
capital and to open their financial and banking markets to
increase the volume of transactions, the recommendations said.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt is striving to bring the annual volume of
foreign investment up to 3 billion U.S. dollars by the year of
2000 from the estimated 1.5 billion dollars for 1997, Chairman of
the General Authority for Investment Ibrahim Fawzi said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Industrial sectors had absorbed 70 percent of the foreign
investments in Egypt, according to Fawzi.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's Central Bank Governor Mohsen Nourbakhsh
announced here today that it has paid off 75 percent of its
arrears.
</P>
<P>
Nourbakhsh was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as
saying that only 3.6 billion U.S. dollars has remained from
Iran's total rescheduled debts which should be paid next year.
</P>
<P>
Giving an explanation to the Parliament's session on the
economic situation of the country and the budget plan,
Nourbakhsh said that Iran's financial and credit status at
international level is satisfactory and foreign banks have
offered credit-lines to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Defining foreign debt is a problem in Iran. Estimates of
total liabilities ranged 30-35 billion dollars in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
However, after two years of conflicting government statements
about Iran's real external debt position, Nourbakhsh stated in
January 1996 that the total external debts amounted to 23.41
billion dollars in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
The higher oil export revenue and tightened economic policy in
the past two years have reduced the pressure upon the debt
servicing of the Iranian government.

<HEADLINE> Northern Iraqi Party Criticizes Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK), a major northern Iraqi party, today accused
Turkey of taking a partial position over the northern Iraqi
issue.
</P>
<P>
Shazad Saib, the PUK representative in Ankara, rebuffed
Turkey's accusations that the PUK had provoked the latest
clashes with its rival, Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), the
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey's involvement in the fight between us and the KDP has
actually ended the Ankara process," Saib said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military jets repeatedly bombed the PUK positions in
northern Iraq on the grounds of striking the rebels of Turkey's
outlawed group the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) fleeing into the
area controlled by the PUK, which maintains a relaxed
relationship with the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Twelves PUK militants and eight civilians were reportedly
killed in the Turkish air raids.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iranian PUK and the KDP, allegedly backed by Turkey
and Iraq, have been fighting each other for the control of
northern Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War. Their clashes
intensified since early last week.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, Britain and the United States, three sponsors of the
Ankara process, had blamed the PUK for the fresh clashes,
demanding immediate withdrawal of the PUK troops from certain
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Ankara process, designed to restore peace and stability in
northern Iraq, has witnessed three rounds of peace talks in the
Turkish capital since last year.
</P>
<P>
"I am not sure if this is a process for war or for peace,"
Saib added.
</P>
<P>
The PUK denied the three sponsors' charges that it provoked
the latest clashes with the KDP, saying that they had stopped
offensive even before the start of a cease-fire reached last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the two warring northern Iraqi parties and
representatives from Turkey, Britain and the United States held
a meeting here to discuss the current situation in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the PUK was again urged to withdraw its
forces from the positions captured over the last several
days.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Basic Law Fully Implemented: Tung Chee Hwa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Basic Law and the
"one country, two systems" principle have been fully implemented
since the island was returned to China on July 1, Hong Kong chief
Tung Chee Hwa said here today.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region made the remark at a reception given in his honor by
Chinese Ambassador to Britain Ma Zhengang this evening.
</P>
<P>
"On July 1 Hong Kong was reunited with China and we began a new
era in Hong Kong," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"Since then, the fundamental elements outlined by the Basic Law
and the 'one country, two systems' concept have been fully
implemented," he stressed. "Life in Hong Kong goes on as well," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive said that with the return of Hong Kong, the
Sino-British relationship will turn to a new and glorious page and
Hong Kong will be a bridge for improving the relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
In his toast, the Chinese ambassador said that continued
prosperity, stability and development in Hong Kong is the common
aspiration of the people the world over, and what happened in the
past 112 days in Hong Kong has fully lived up to those
expectations.
</P>
<P>
"All the successes should be attributed to the Chinese
government's determination to carry out to the full the principles
of 'one country, two systems', 'Hong Kong people administering
Hong Kong' and 'a high degree of autonomy', to strenuous efforts
of the 6.5 million people of Hong Kong, and to the able and
brilliant leadership of Mr.Tung Chee Hwa and his colleagues," Ma
said
</P>
<P>
The reception was attended by over 100 guests, including former
British prime minister Margaret Thatcher and British minister of
state for foreign affairs Derek Fatchett.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa arrived in London this morning following talks in
Brussels with senior European Commissionn officials.

<HEADLINE> German Money Supply Growth Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Germany's money supply growth
slowed down in September and was for the fourth successive month
kept within the official targets for the year, the Bundesbank
reported today in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
The M3 supply last month was 5.2 percent above the average for
the last quarter of 1996, compared with 5.8 percent in August and
5.7 percent in July, said the German central bank.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the lower growth rate in September to a slight
drop in cash in circulation and in bank lending to private
customers and companies.
</P>
<P>
The M3 consists of cash in circulation, sight deposits, fixed
deposits under four years and savings deposits with a mandatory
withdrawal period. It was a key factor in deciding interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank has set a target corridor of 3.5 to 6.5 percent
this year for the M3 growth.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Wants More Imports from Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Rwandan Foreign
Minister Gasana Anastase said here today that his country is
depending on its neighboring countries in its reconstruction
after the civil war of 1994.
</P>
<P>
When he visited Mazabuka Sugar Plantation and Chilanga Cement
Works near Lusaka, he said that his country is in the process of
rehabilitation and needs a lot of help from the neighbors,
especially needs sugar, telephone and electric cables and cement,
which are available in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to depend on European countries to supply us
with these commodities because we believe they can be obtained
here in Zambia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of Zambia Sugar PLC Jeff Hatt told the
minister that his company, which exported 1,300 tons of sugar to
Rwanda last year, welcomes the opportunity to export sugar to
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Deputy Transport and Communication Minister Gilbert
Mulululu urged Zambian businessmen not to wait for the government
to organize a trip to Rwanda for them but should instead start on
their own.
</P>
<P>
During the tour of the cement works, Zambian Deputy Commerce
Minister Jazzman Chikwakwa said that the economy of Zambia lays
in the hands of the private sector that is why the government has
moved away from dictating to them what to do.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister appealed industries to move with the times
by constantly acquiring new technology and rehabilitating the old
equipment instead of blaming the government.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has exported 1,000 tons of cement to Rwanda this year
and is looking forward for more business opportunities with it.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Gas Emissions up Sharply in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Cars, power plants and
factories in the U.S. released record amounts of the pollutants
believed to contribute to global warming, according to a U.S.
governmental study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
A report of the U.S. Department of Energy carried by newspapers
today indicated that U.S. emissions of the so-called greenhouse
gases rose 3.4 percent from 1995 to 1996. Much of the increase was
attributed to an increase in carbon dioxide emissions, which come
from burning fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
Cold weather and higher natural gas prices meant more reliance
on coal, which emits more carbon dioxide. Another factor was the
vigorous economy, which kept factories and power plants operating
at higher capacities, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The increase, the largest in recent times, illustrates how
difficult it will be for U.S. businesses and consumers to reduce
greenhouse gas levels.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government will propose mandatory limits on developed
countries' carbon dioxide output. But the plan is expected to be
much weaker than the demands of environmentalists, who call global
warming the Earth's No.1 problem. A European plan would lower
those emissions to 2.8 billion tons a year by 2010. If no action
is taken, emissions are likely to be about 4.1 billion tons a year
by then, according to the newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. plan is expected to propose smaller cuts over a longer
period, perhaps a return to the 1990 level of 3.3 billion tons a
year by 2020 or 2030.
</P>
<P>
In December, officials from 169 countries will meet in Japan to
finalize the treaty now being worked out in Bonn, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980s, the Earth's average temperature has risen
one-half to one degree Fahrenheit, which scientists attribute
partially to heat trapped by greenhouse gases. It is feared that
continued warming could bring more floods and droughts and sea
levels high.

NICOSIA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has achieved a unique

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Issues Statement on Greek Air Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government said
today that it reserves the right to decide whether it should avoid
inviting the Greek Air Force to participate in its military
exercises.
</P>
<P>
This position was outlined in a Foreign Ministry statement
issued here today in response to statements made by U.S. State
Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference Monday, Rubin called for a
return to an overflight ban over Cyprus. "We would hope that all
sides would appreciate the benefits of reinstituting a complete
and open-ended moratorium on military overflights in Cyprus at
the earliest possible time," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot Foreign Ministry statement, however, explains that
"there has never been an agreement for a moratorium of
overflights in Cyprus' sovereign airspace."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus held a military exercise code-named "Nikiforos '97"
on October 10-14, with the participation of Greek air and naval
forces.
</P>
<P>
The statement clarifies that the Cypriot government announced
last year that in an effort to contribute to a good climate to
conduct the U.N.-sponsored direct negotiations, it had decided not
to ask the participation of the Greek Air Force in exercises until
September this year.
</P>
<P>
But "the results of the talks in New York and Montreux
(Switzerland) did not justify an extension of the unilateral
decision" during the five-day military exercises, which ended last
week, the statement says.
</P>
<P>
"Parallel with our unilateral decision, the U.S. administration
said that Turkey decided to avoid overflights for the same
period," it says.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to remind that Turkey repeatedly violated
its promise toward the U.S. administration," the statement notes.
</P>
<P>
It says that the Cypriot government reserves the right to
decide, if it judges that circumstances require so, whether it
should or not and for how long, avoid extending invitations to the
Greek Air Force to participate in its military exercises.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved despite the U.N. and
international community's peace efforts for the past 23
years.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Issues Commentary on Interest Rate Cut  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, the leading
newspaper of China, will publish a commentary tomorrow
reinterating the need to follow a moderately tight monetary policy
and conduct proper economic macro-control.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, titled Adhere to an Appropriately Tight
Monetary Policy and Exercise Proper Economic Macro-Control,
describes the decision of the People's Bank of China to lower the
interest rates on bank loans and deposits as of tomorrow as a new
important move by the central bank to apply the lever of interest
rates, follow a moderately tight monetary policy and conduct
proper and timely economic macro-control.
</P>
<P>
"To readjust the interest rates on loans and deposits is
imperative to exercise economic macro-control," the commentary
says.
</P>
<P>
The timely interest readjustments since economic macro-control
started in 1993, including two raises and two cuts, have
effectively helped to curb the growth of money supply and boost
the sustained, rapid and sound development of the national
economy, it notes.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the effective implementation of macro-control
policies, the national economy has continued to grow steadily and
healthily while prices have been on a steady downward trend, the
commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Between January and September this year, the retail price index
and the consumer price index rose 1.3 and 3.4 percent respectively
from the same period of last year. The two indices by the year-end
are expected to be around two and less than four percent.
</P>
<P>
Calculated on this basis, the actual annual interest rate on
one-year deposits is 6.17 and 4.07 percent respectively after
inflation is adjusted.
</P>
<P>
This level of positive interest rate is the highest in China
since 1990 and is about two percentage points higher than the
interest level in many developed countries, the commentary says.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Issues Commentary on Interest Rate Cut  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decision of the People's Bank of China to further lower the
interest rates is in response to declining prices, and is to
reduce the interest cost of enterprises and promote the sustained,
rapid and healthy development of the national economy, the
commentary points out.
</P>
<P>
It adds that the decision is made under the principle of
protecting the interests of the depositors, adding that the actual
interest rates and interest income of depositors will increase
after the latest readjustment.
</P>
<P>
Though the interest rate cut is aimed to reduce the interest
cost of enterprises, it must be pointed out that the current
difficulties of Chinese enterprises are not a result of high
interest rates, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
It will not work to resolve the difficulties of enterprises
merely through lowering the interest level, the commentary notes,
adding that the key to revitalizing the state-owned enterprises is
to do what set forth by Party leader Jiang Zemin in his report to
the 15th national congress of the Communist Party of China last
month.
</P>
<P>
The commentary points out that the decision to lower the
interest rates, made under the backdrop of dropping prices, must
not be interpreted as a sign to ease the supply of bank credits
and change the moderately tight monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The latest interest rate cut is also conducive to narrowing the
gap in the interest rate level of the Chinese yuan and major
foreign currencies, thereby preventing speculators from taking
advantages of the differentiations, the commentary says.

<HEADLINE> Four CIS Nations Decide to Set Up Free Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and
Kyrgyzstan decided, at a meeting here today of the parliamentary
committee of the four countries, to set up a free-trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Among the 12 resolutions passed at the meeting was the one
providing that value-added tax (VAT) should be levied at the place
of destination of goods rather than the place of production.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, said an Itar-Tass news agency report, also elected
Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev chairman of the so-called
"Union of Four" to replace Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
After the gathering, Nazarbayev said "different rates of
integration" among some members of the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) will set a good example to other CIS countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is of extreme importance for the four
nations "to create a real common market and free space."
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin told reporters that the
Russia-Belarus Union and the "Union of Four" are keeping the CIS
together, and are the force behind solutions to many problems.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin noted that "a very bold resolution" was adopted, also
at the meeting today, on the customs union and the customs duty.
</P>
<P>
Kyragyz President Askar Akayev said he was satisfied with the
current integration pace as conditions have been turning favorable
for the process since the "Union of Four" was forged 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
On March 29, 1996, Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan
signed an agreement on deepening their integration in economic and
social areas.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Xiaolangdi Dam Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAOLANGDI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Xiaolangdi Multipurpose
Dam, the largest project of its kind ever built on the Yellow
River, China's second largest river, will be completed on October
28.
</P>
<P>
The damming process includes four phases.
</P>
<P>
The first phase, which commenced on September 25 and will be
completed on October 14, required the dumping of 210,000 cubic
meters of stone into the river in order to narrow the water
channel to a width of 106 meters.
</P>
<P>
The second phase, which commenced on October 19, included the
dismantling of two cofferdams, one upstream and the other
downstream.
</P>
<P>
The third phase, which will be completed in 40 hours between
October 26-28, will involve dumping 90,000 cu.m. of stone into the
river at a rate of 2,280 cu.m. per hour.
</P>
<P>
The fourth phase will involve filling the stone dam with sand
and gravel in order to raise the height of the dam to 143
meters. Some 160,000 cu.m. of stone and earth will be handled in a
period of 120 hours.
</P>
<P>
Damming the river is a challenging due to the rapid current at
the mouth of the dam. The average flow rate in the section is 7.05
meters per second, according to Cao Zhengqi, chief engineer of the
project.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the water level between upstream and the downstream
will drop by as much as 3.2 meters, Cao said.

HONG KONG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has reached
agreements separately with Germany and Britain on arrangements to

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sparked
another political storm today when his secret inciting remarks
against the leftists were recorded and broadcast on TV and radio
stations.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting Tuesday with popular Rabbi Yitzhak Kadouri,
Netanyahu accused the leftists of forgetting that they are Jews by
entrusting the security of the country to Arabs.
</P>
<P>
"The left has forgotten what it is to be Jews. They think
they'll place the defense of the land in the hands of the Arabs.
That the Arabs will look after us. Have you ever heard such a
thing", Netanyahu reportedly told Kadouri.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were recorded by an Israeli radio reporter without
his knowledge and broadcast as the leading story on television and
radio stations Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio today, Netanyahu defended
his remarks saying that they "were taken out of the context." He
said he only doubted how Kosher (purity of being a Jew) the
leftists are as Jews since they entrusted Israeli security to
Arabs.

Hun Sen rejected Tokyo's proposal that a draft electoral law be

receive a royal pardon, a senior aide to Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
"Hun Sen said to do that would allow others who have received
amnesty to also run for election, for example (former Khmer Rouge
leader) Ieng Sary and common criminals," Prak Sokhon told

<HEADLINE> Philippine Towns on Alert for Terrorist Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- At least three towns in Basilan
province, the southern Philippines, have been put on "red alert"
for possible terrorist attacks by an extremist Muslim rebel group,
the Philippine News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Security has been tightened in Isabela city, capital of
Basilan, and the towns of Lamitan and Tipo-Tipo following reports
of an impending attack by the extremist Abu Sayyaf, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said they had received reliable information
that Abu Sayyaf planned to spread terror in the provincial capital
and other towns.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf, which has been pursued hard by the military for
kidnapping 10 people on October 15 along a highway in Basilan,
have stepped up attacks in the island province these days.
</P>
<P>
Military reports said earlier that nine of the 10 kidnapped
victims had been summarily executed by the extremists and that the
remaining capturer, a woman, is still listed as missing.
</P>
<P>
During the past few days, Abu Sayyaf launched a new wave of
attacks in Basilan, killing 10 people and wounding scores of
others.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) are the
two remaining Muslim rebel groups still fighting the government.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) signed a
peace agreement with Manila last year.

<HEADLINE> Silting Not Expected to Impede Yangtze Dam Project: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- An expert working in Yichang
said that silting in the water diversion channel no longer poses a
problem for the project to dam the Yangtze River, an event marking
completion of the first phase of the giant Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
The water diversion channel between two cofferdams, which will
be closed on November 8, currently facilitates 53.9 percent of
water flowing through the dam site and is expected to be handling
over 70 percent of the flow prior to the aforementioned date. The
increased capacity will meet the requirements for water diversion
when damming the river, according Wang Jiazhu, the director of
technology.
</P>
<P>
Wang works as deputy general manager of technology for the
China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development. Corp., which is
undertaking the country's largest water control project in history.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that silting in the channel will create difficulties
for the damming effort by forcing more water towards the
cofferdams in the main channel.
</P>
<P>
The channel, which stretches some 3.5 km in length and is 350 m
wide and 20 m deep, will be the only Yangtze River channel through
the dam area for the next six years.
</P>
<P>
The channel, which opened in May last year, was subject to
heavy silting during the flood season from June-September owing to
the heavy volume of silt, and the fact that most of the water
flowed through the cofferdams and spilled into the main channel.
</P>
<P>
"Silting, a normal phenomenon in such cases, will not affect
normal navigation, and will not create environmental problems,"
said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Narrowing the openings of the cofferdams will enable more water
to flow through the channel, with the flow rate of 1.3-1.4 meters
per second expected to wash away silt.
</P>
<P>
Wang said silting in the water diversion channel is being
monitored closely, and an alternate plan is being drafted in
case silting creates a problem in blocking the river.
</P>
<P>
The width of a cofferdam upstream has been reduced to 150
meters and will be further reduced to 130 meters in two days.

PARIS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- France today played down a media
report claiming France had been committing secret tests on
chemical weapons in Algeria until 16 years after its independence.
</P>
<P>
"We have never denied these facts nor confirmed that such
activities did take place," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman

Nouvel Observateur, a French magazine, said in its latest issue

France had been kept using the base, codenamed "B2-Namous,"
until 16 years after Algeria's independence in 1962, it said.

LUANDA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres has said Portugal would like to become a
strategic partner of Angola and to develop a new type of economic
and business cooperation relationship with the country.
</P>
<P>
He said Angola will become Portugal's precedent cooperative
partner in the process of achieving its economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here on Tuesday while speaking at the
Angola Investment Forum.
</P>
<P>
Guterres said the new bilateral cooperative relationship that
is expected to be set up should make a feature of two-way
pattern.
</P>
<P>
That means that Portuguese can invest in Angola while Angolans
can do the same in Portugal and the two countries can also
cooperate with each other in the third market, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Guterres pointed out that the two countries should develop
strategic partnership in a bid to make greater achievement in
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should open up long-term cooperation,
instead of taking it as an expedient measure, he further noted.
</P>
<P>
Guterres said Portugal hopes to clear away obstacles that
hinder the bilateral cooperation in order to make a new start for
the cooperative relationship of the two countries.
</P>
<P>

in the bilateral cooperative activities and act in concert to
make more fortunes for the two peoples.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Confident About Hong Kong's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- "We are moving forward in Hong
Kong with pride and confidence," Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of
China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China,
told Britons here today.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote address to British business leaders and political
figures at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Tung said
he was very confident about Hong Kong's future because the HKSAR
enjoys "a high degree of autonomy under the 'one country, two
systems' concept as guaranteed by the Joint Declaration and the
Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
"Four months after the establishment of the HKSAR, there is not
a single suggestion that autonomy has been violated," said the
chief executive who arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Tung to visit Britain in the
capacity of Hong Kong's chief executive since the region's return
to China on July 1 after 156 years of British colonial rule. He
said his mission was to give friends overseas some first-hand
information about Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the reality is that business continues as it has done
before. "The economy is growing at a healthy rate, with the gross
domestic product (GDP) forecast for 1997 at 5.4 percent."
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong dollar, backed by our huge foreign reserve and
our sound economic and financial fundamentals, maintains its
strength amidst the turmoil on Asian currencies. Hong Kong
people's confidence towards the HKSAR Administration and the
future is running high," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since July 1, He said, Hong Kong people have been exercising
the rights of free speech, of demonstration, and of scrutinizing
government policies and decisions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the "one country, two systems" concept developed by
China, Tung expressed the belief that its successful
implementation in Hong Kong can serve as "a significant step
towards the greater and final objective of reunification of the
entire nation."
</P>
<P>
As part of China, Tung said, "Hong Kong can not and should not
do things which are not in the long-term interests of China."
"Certainly Hong Kong should not be permitted to be used as a base
to destabilize China," he added.
</P>
<P>
"China needs social stability, China also needs stability and
peace in Asia and around the world," Tung stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced his confidence that China will be more open and
more prosperous as it enters the 21st century, while Hong Kong
will be one of the chief beneficiaries of China's growth and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Tung's trip is aimed at strengthening the close economic and
trade ties between Hong Kong and Britain, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is Britain's second largest export market in the
Asia-Pacific region while Britain is the leading foreign investor
in Hong Kong with investment in its manufacturing and services
sectors estimated at around 20 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Denies Negotiating With U.S. on Naval Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today flatly denied press reports that his country is negotiating
with the United States to build a new naval base in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"We have denied this story many times. First, on the
establishment of a U.S. naval base in Mindanao. I denied that
completely. That story is unfounded and it is at best a
fabrication," Ramos said at his weekly press conference.
</P>
<P>
"Second, in regard to negotiations, I have the same answer. No,
none. Period," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said the U.S. Navy plans to construct a base at
Sumbang Point in Glan, North Cotabato, similar to the former Subic
Naval Base which the Americans turned over to the Philippine
government after its 25-year lease contract expired in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. used to have a number of military bases in the
Philippines after the Second World War. Two former big U.S. bases
were Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was forced to abandon Clark after the destructive
eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. The whole air base was covered
by volcanic ashes, forcing the U.S. Air Force and their families
to flee from Clark.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Subic, the U.S. tried in vain to extend its
lease by 10 years after the contract with the Philippine
government expired on November 24, 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Ramos government has transformed the former U.S. bases into
economic zones with foreign companies investing.

<HEADLINE>   Netanyahu's Remarks Against Oppositions Sparks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu sparked another political storm today when his
secret inciting remarks against the leftists were recorded and
broadcast on TV and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting Tuesday with popular Rabbi Yitzhak Kadouri,
Netanyahu accused the leftists of forgetting that they are Jews
by entrusting the security of the country to Arabs.
</P>
<P>
"The left has forgotten what it is to be Jews. They think
they'll place the defense of the land in the hands of the
Arabs. That the Arabs will look after us. Have you ever heard
such a thing", Netanyahu reportedly told Kadouri.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were recorded by an Israeli radio reporter without
his knowledge and broadcast as the leading story on television
and radio stations Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio today, Netanyahu defended
his remarks saying that they "were taken out of the context." He
said he only doubted how Kosher (purity of being a Jew) the
leftists are as Jews since they entrusted Israeli security to
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's remarks set off another political storm as the
upset oppositions have began a new campaign to oust him from the
office. Netanyahu has yet cleared himself of the recent
political crisis sparked by the failed attempt to assassinate a
Hamas leader in Jordanian capital Amman in late September.
</P>
<P>
Leading opposition party Labor's leader Ehud Barak blasted
Netanyahu for inciting against the left by making "whispering
sedition into the ear of such an important and venerable Rabbi on
a holiday of unity." He said Netanyahu does not have right to
teach the left what Judaism is or what responsibility for
security is.
</P>
<P>
The Labor's caucus in the Knesset (Parliament) called
Netanyahu's remarks as an extra strategy to divide the Jewish
nation. And Labor lawmaker Ohpir Pines has filed a police
complaint against the prime minister for incitement.
</P>
<P>
Pines said that given the remarks made Tuesday, Netanyahu is
clearly responsible for the incitement that led to the
assassination of former Labor Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who
was shot on November 4, 1995 by a radical Jew who accused Rabin
of being a traitor by giving land to Arabs.
</P>
<P>
He demanded for a review of Netanyahu's role in Rabin's
murder. Following Rabin's assassination, Netanyahu was blamed for
organizing rightist demonstrations and propaganda against Rabin's
government, in which he often made harsh attacks against Rabin
and his peace policies.
</P>

The caucus head of another opposition party Meretz, Haim

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met here today with Agbo A. Valentin,
chairman of the Economic and Social Council of Benin (ESCB).
</P>
<P>
Qian said the council plays an important role in Benin's
politics, economy, society and culture.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that the ESCB and the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) share many things in common, and
expressed his hope for close friendly relations between the two
organizations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that friendly relations and cooperation have witnessed
steady growth since the two nations established diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Premier said the two governments should not only
promote cooperative projects, but should also encourage
cooperation between their companies and enterprises in order to
expand areas for bilateral economic and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Agbo said the ESCB, a relatively new organization, hopes to
learn more from the CPPCC, and called for the two countries to
expand cooperation in politics, culture, public health and sports.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Economic Growth Decelerating Since April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan's economy has been slowing
down since April, following the consumption tax hike from 3 to 5
percent, Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Yasuo Matsushita said today.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to judge whether the nation's economy has
returned, after the summer, to the recovery path that was seen
before the deceleration," Matsushita told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Matsushita's remarks reflected some bearish reports on regional
economies at a quarterly meeting of BOJ branch managers, held
Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Many branch managers reported stagnation in personal
consumption and housing investment as a result of the consumption
tax hike, and expressed their worries on further negative effects,
Matsushita said.
</P>
<P>
"Business confidence among corporate executives has been
affected by these negative factors, according to the managers, and
some of them said their regional economies have actually come to a
standstill," the central bank chief said.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, the central bank "will continue
giving policy priorities to consolidating the basis for economic
recovery," Matsushita said, hinting that there would be no
immediate change in Japan's current easy monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The BOJ has maintained an easy monetary policy for more than
two years, with its official discount rate at a historic low of
0.5 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
Despite the economic deceleration, Matsushita reiterated that
"the basis for economic recovery has not been damaged, and is
underpinned by favorable net exports and corporate capital
investment."
</P>
<P>
Citing an improving employment index and employees income as
positive factors, Matsushita expressed his belief that the economy
will eventually come back to a mild recovery path.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman Denies ABC Report on Sale of Organs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman today denied a US television report that some hospitals
under the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) sell foreigners
the organs of convicts sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
When asked to confirm the report carried by an ABC documentary,
Spokesman Shen Guofang said the report was piecemeal and nothing
more than a "pure fabrication."
</P>
<P>
Shen said that relevant Chinese departments have conducted
investigations and confirmed the falsity of the report.
</P>
<P>
All scenes in the documentary, with the exception of a few
showing entrances to medical centers in South China which are open
to foreigners, are "fabricated" and have nothing to do with PLA
hospitals, said Shen.
</P>
<P>
"Military surgeons" appearing in the documentary are not PLA
medical personnel, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, and the General Administration of
Customs have issued regulations banning sales of human tissues and
organs, and banning donations or exchanges of human tissues and
organs with foreign institutions or individuals, said Shen.
</P>
<P>
Voluntary organ transplants in a few Chinese hospitals with
advanced technology are carried out in strict conformity with the
relevant state rules and regulations, according to Shen. He said
that hospitals have never sold the organs of convicts sentenced to
death.

<HEADLINE> HK Land Registry Trading Fund Makes Big Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Land Registry Trading
Fund of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) had a
very successful operation in 1996-1997, with a net profit of 131.4
million HK dollars (about 16.89 million U.S. dollars), local
officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents an annual rate of return of 29.1 percent
on average net fixed assets and 19.1 percentage points higher than
the target of 10 percent, Secretary for Planning, Environment and
Lands of the SAR government Bowen Leung said when presenting the
Fourth Annual Report of the fund to the Provisional Legislative
Council.
</P>
<P>
"This significant outturn reflects an increase in workload and
an effective and rigorous control over operating expenses," chief
of the Land Registry and General Manager of the fund Anthony
Cooper told the legislators. "This has enabled the Land Registry
to continue investing in large-scale information technology
projects to bring about improved services at reduced costs."
</P>
<P>
The Land Registry is one of the first trading fund government
departments, established in August 1993 to operate on a
self-financing basis. Its primary objective is to deliver
value-for-money and business-friendly service to customers.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Says Ranariddh Not Allowed to Run for Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia'a Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen today said the deposed co-premier Prince Norodom
Ranariddh would not be allowed to run in elections in May even if
he is convicted and then pardoned from criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Japanese Ambassador to Cambodia Masaki Saito,
Hun Sen rejected Tokyo's proposal that a draft electoral law be
amended to allow convicted criminals to stand for election if they
receive a royal pardon, a senior aide to Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
"Hun Sen said to do that would allow others who have received
amnesty to also run for election, for example (former Khmer Rouge
leader) Ieng Sary and common criminals," Prak Sokhon told
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A Phnom Penh court has charged the prince, who was ousted in
early July, with illegally importing weapons and negotiating with
the outlawed Khmer Rouge guerrilla faction.
</P>
<P>
The international community has demanded that Hun Sen allow
Ranariddh to run for general elections scheduled for May.
</P>
<P>
During today's meeting, Hun Sen also pledged to accept results
of the elections and said he welcomed international observers to
monitor the polls, Prak Sokhon said.
</P>
<P>
Japan, Cambodia's largest aid donor, is expected to raise the
issue of the prince's participation in the elections again next
month when Hun Sen visits Tokyo from November 5 to 10.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen is expected to meet with Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto during the visit, according to Prak Sokhon.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Will Not Mediate Lockerbie Issue: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
will not mediate between Libya and the U.S. over the hand-over of
two Libyans allegedly involved in the Lockerbie air disaster,
local media quoted Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo as saying tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nzo made the clarification after Egyptian media reported that
Mandela would try to convince Libyan leader Col Muammar Qaddafi
to reach an understanding with the west over the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Piet Swanepoel said reports that
Mandela intended to mediate on Lockerbie issue were simply
speculation.
</P>
<P>
"There has never been any intention on the part of South
Africa to assume the role of mediator on this issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Swanepoel said Mandela may discuss the matter with the Libyan
leader during their meeting, but it was not on the official
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is expected to arrive in Libya today for a
controversial state visit, which was opposed by the United States
and South African opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Mandela will travel to Tripoli by road to sidestep a U.N.
flight embargo against Libya, imposed after Libya refused to
extradite the two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Libya, backed by the Organization of African Unity and the
Non-aligned Movement, has suggested a compromise that the trial
of the two Libyans be held in a neutral country, by Scottish
judges under Scottish law. But the proposal was rejected by the
UN and the US.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Trade with Finland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Co-operation Wu Yi, meeting here today with the
Finnish Minister of European Affairs Ole Norrback, said that China
is confident of economic co-operation and trade prospects with
Finland, and that there is great potential for development.
</P>
<P>
China needs Finland's advanced technology, managerial
expertise, capital, and markets, Wu said, adding that Finland also
needs China's markets and commodities.
</P>
<P>
After the 15th National Party Congress, China will be more open,
offering more opportunities for Finnish products to enter Chinese
market, she said.
</P>
<P>
Stronger co-operation between the two countries' small and
medium-sized businesses is in both countries' interest and the
Chinese government would like to encourage co-operation, she told
the guests, noting that entrepreneurs with vision are paying
greater attention to markets in central and western China, and
that Finish businesses should look for opportunities in that
region.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed her hope that the Finnish government could make
more flexible loans for China and accelerate the approval
process. She said that two-way trade between China and the EU has
been perplexed by the EU's anti-dumping investigation of Chinese
products.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates Finland's opposition to levying anti-dumping
duties on Chinese products, and hopes that Finland will stick to
this, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
She also spoke about Hong Kong's economic growth after the
return to the motherland and on China's reform of state-owned
enterprises and foreign investment policy.
</P>
<P>
Norrback said that the purpose of his visit is to increase
bilateral trade and economic cooperation, and that Finnish
businesses are very interested in China, and many small and
medium-sized enterprises are already doing business in China. He
said he also welcomes Chinese investment in Finland.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country supports China's entry into the World
Trade Organization because China's presence in the organization
would benefit both the Chinese and the world economy.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Shares Down for Third Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong shares were pounded
today for the third day this week, slumping by more than 700
points to close at a six-month low.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed at 11,637, down 765
points, the lowest finish since April this year. The index had
already lost 630 and 567 points respectively Monday and Tuesday
following sharp falls on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
However, the market turnover amounted to 23,561 million HK
dollars (about 3,028 million U.S. dollars), up from both Tuesday's
19,260 million HK dollars (2,470 million U.S. dollars) and
Monday's 17,260 million HK dollars (2,210 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The market has been further weakened partly by selling
pressures from overseas and domestic funds managers and by
renewed currency volatility in the Asia-Pacific region, some
experts here said.
</P>
<P>
But Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region Donald Tsang urged local residents to keep calm, describing
the running fall as fraudulent buying and selling at the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the fact that "Hong Kong remains stable, the
currency remains stable, and economic performance remains stable."
"We have the reserves of 80-odd billion U.S. dollars. We have no
debt," he added.

<HEADLINE> Conference on China's Service Industries Held in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Officials and businessmen
from China's inland areas and Hong Kong exchanged views on how to
promote the development of China's service sector at a conference
held here today.
</P>
<P>
The conference, entitled "Serving China: Prospects and
Challenges," was organized jointly by the Hong Kong Coalition of
Service Industries (HKCSI) and the Office of Tertiary industries
of the State Planning Commission of China.
</P>
<P>
Brian Stevenson, chairman of the HKCSI, said in his welcome
speech at the opening ceremony that the conference would help
develop broader and closer relationship between China's mainland
and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"It is particularly appropriate that we have an opportunity to
meet with the leading policy makers of the service industries of
China's mainland, to hear them talk about the development of the
vast service sector of China and to discuss opportunities ahead
for the service industries of Hong Kong and the mainland,"
Stevenson said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that through listening to and learning
from each other, the service sector and the wider economy of both
Hong Kong and the mainland will benefit.
</P>
<P>
Donald Tsang, financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China, noted in his opening remarks
that the conference would provide an excellent forum for the
discussion of development potential of the mainland's service
industries and further cooperation between Hong Kong and the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Lan Shiliang, director of the Office of Tertiary Industries
Leading Group of the State Planning Commission of China, also
delivered an opening speech at the conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference is of great significance for understanding the
current development of the service sector in the mainland and
Hong Kong, exchanging experiences in the development of service
industries, producing more cooperation opportunities between the
two sides and promoting the growth of the tertiary industries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Topics discussed at the one-day conference included the
development of the service industries, modernization of the
financial services and expansion of the distribution industries
and information and communication services in China.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Open To Different Suppliers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The giant Three Gorges
Hydro-electric Power Project has been opened to both Chinese and
foreign suppliers, in a move to reduce costs and guarantee
quality, according to officials in charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
The China Three Gorges Development Corporation has decided to
allow competition among material and equipment suppliers. Deputy
General Manager Qin Zhongyi told Xinhua that 10 million tons of
steel, timber, cement, coal ash, oil and explosives are needed,
accounting for about 40 percent of the total cost.
</P>
<P>
And billions of yuan will be spent on generators and machinery.
</P>
<P>
To ensure quality and cost, the corporation plans to begin
purchasing all materials and equipment from both local and
international suppliers after the river-blocking, which is the
start of the second phase of the project, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
An equipment exhibition center has been built for this, which
will serve as a permanent market-place for suppliers to show their
goods. On Tuesday, a materials and equipment exhibition opened at
the center, attracting suppliers from the United States, Germany,
France, Sweden, Japan, Finland, Singapore and other
countries.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Controversial Health Bill Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's national
assembly has approved a controversial legislation which will
allow the health minister to override pharmaceutical companies'
patent rights by allowing parallel imports of cheap drugs.
</P>
<P>
The medicines and related substances control amendment bill
passed in the lower house of parliament by a vote of 201 to 71 on
Tuesday night, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
All opposition parties except the Pan-Africanist Congress
voted against the bill, which will also legalize generic
substitution, force doctors to seek licenses to dispense
medicines, and prevent the pharmaceutical industry from offering
free samples, bulk discounts and "perverse incentives" such as
free holidays for doctors.
</P>
<P>
The bill is one of a trio of measures before parliament aimed
at transforming South Africa's health system.
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceutical industry has said it is prepared to bring
the bill to the constitutional court, and there has been
speculation that the United States may challenge it through the
World Trade Organization on the grounds that it breaches the
international trade related intellectual property agreement.
</P>
<P>
The legislation is scheduled to go to the National Council of
Provinces (upper house of parliament) for debate on November 20.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties attacked the legislation in the Lower House
debate.
</P>
<P>
National party health spokesman Kobus Gous said the bill was
fatally flawed, and that it could bring in unsafe and potentially
lethal medicines.
</P>
<P>
"The negative signal that we have sent out to our economic
partners will soon damage the entire economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The ANC might have won the battle but they will certainly
lose the war."
</P>
<P>
Inkatha Freedom Party health spokesman Ruth Rabinowitz said
the bill would send negative signals to the type of high
technology companies that should contribute to South Africa's
development.
</P>
<P>
Freedom Front health spokesman Pieter Grobbelaar said while
Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma's aim of providing cheaper
medicine was praiseworthy, the bill's message would not create
confidence in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zuma, who pushed strongly ahead with the bill, hit back at the
attacks. The pharmacy industry had maintained that drug prices in
South Africa were not higher than in other countries. If this was
true, then there would be no parallel imports, she said.
</P>
<P>
Zuma also rejected opposition claims that the bill gave her
excessive regulatory powers.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin told the National
Assembly that the whole debate was a matter of interpretation.
</P>
<P>
He said blatantly inaccurate statements had been made by some
pharmaceutical companies and their lobbyists during hearings on
the bill, and that their "excessive bluster" had prevented an
accurate understanding of what was at stake.
</P>
<P>
What was at issue was whether the exercise of a commercial
right -- in this case the provision giving the patent holder of a
drug the right to prevent imports -- should be allowed to protect
pricing policies that could have a detrimental effect on health
care.
</P>
<P>
His department had proposed that the parallel imports clause
should be invoked only in narrowly defined circumstances related
to affordability.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The budgetary expenditure of the
Macao government will rise to 10.7 billion patacas (about 1.35
billion U.S. dollars) next year, the Macao governor said.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued by the Government Information Office,
 the governor said on Tuesday that the expenditure for 1998 will
rise 3.2 percent from the actual cost of this year and there will
be no deficit.
</P>
<P>
Most of the money will be spent on education, culture,
medicare, social affairs, security, the improvement of living
standards, infrastructure and others.
</P>
<P>
The governor expects no budget deficit because, he said, the
amount of income will increase as the tax rate on casinos will go
up from 30 percent of gross profit to 31.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to inject 1.9 billion patacas (about 240.5
million dollars) into infrastructure construction in 1998, up 300
million patacas (about 37.97 million dollars) from last year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK to Play Key Role in Chinese Service Sector: HK Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has a key role to
play in helping China's inland areas develop the service sector
just as it has helped in the profound industrialization of the
mainland, a senior financial official of Hong Kong said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"We indeed have a lot to offer as a highly-developed
service-oriented economy," said Donald Tsang, financial secretary
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, in
an address at the opening ceremony of a conference on China's
service industries here today.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a high-quality, competent workforce apt to work
in the service sector, Tsang said at the conference co-organized
by the Hong Kong Coalition of Service Industries and the Office of
Tertiary Industries of the State Planning Commission of China.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, a cosmopolitan city where East meets West and
information is freely accessible, serves as China's window to the
world, through which China and the rest of the world can
understand each other, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is a leading financial center in the world. It is not
only the main conduit of foreign capital for the mainland, but it
itself is the mainland's largest external investor, Tsang added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a very high concentration of enterprises with
considerable expertise and experience in finance, trade and other
service sectors, which can help the development of the tertiary
industries in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Most important, Hong Kong and the mainland have very close
cultural, language and geographical ties that could not be
severed, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
An important component of the mainland's future economic growth
is the concerted development of the tertiary industries on the one
hand and the primary and secondary industries on the other, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Tertiary industries, or service industries as we commonly call
them, now account for about 30 percent of the mainland's gross
domestic product (GDP). There is huge room for growth as the
mainland acquires the characteristics of middle-income market
economies," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Given the mainland's bright economic prospects and Hong Kong's
competitive edge, Tsang urged Hong Kong's business leaders to
seize the opportunities to tap the vast potential of the mainland
and contribute to its development.
</P>
<P>
"Our vision for the 21st century is that Hong Kong will
continue its development as a world-class, high value-added
service economy and the premier services center in the region. And
in our pursuit of that vision a lot will hinge on further
collaboration with the mainland," Tsang said.

<P>
BRUSSELS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Employment and euro are the
top priorities defined by the work program of the European
Commission (EC) for 1998, which was published by the EC today.
</P>
<P>
Other priorities include reforms, external relations and public
health.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union, called for a general mobilization of resources and
for concerted efforts in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Actions will concentrate on the pursuit of a sound
macro-economic policy, completion of the single market, the
development of all union policies to take account of employment
considerations, better coordination of national employment
policies, closer linkage between employment policy and economic
policy, substantial improvement to labor markets, the fight
against social exclusion and a firmer basis for the social
dimension of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The commission, according to its work program, will fix next
spring the exchange rates between participating currencies and the
euro as the final technical preparation for the introduction of
the single currency to be launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The commission will give special attention to Turkey, Ukraine,
Russia and the Balkans while it strengthens external relations and
prepares for enlargement that will be the main challenge in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ten central and eastern European countries and Cyprus are
applying for full EU membership.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of public health will be one of the
commission's main activities aimed at serving the public in 1998.
This requires raising the standards of protection when products
for human consumption are placed on the market and strictly
applying rules on labeling and checking production processes.
</P>
<P>
In all, the commission is expected to present 31 new
legislative proposals focusing on the priority areas.

<HEADLINE> India to Offer Gas Reserves for Private Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government would
shortly offer some blocks with estimated reserves of 600 billion
cubic meters of gas to the private sector for exploration, a
senior government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The registered demand of natural gas is about 280 million
cubic meters a day as against the current production of 64 million
cubic meters and to meet this challenge the government has taken
bold initiatives to explore and develop coal bed methane," said
Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas T. R. Baalu.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on offshore safety legislation organized
by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, he said a national
task force has been formed to explore gas hydrates in the offshore
areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
The estimated resource base of India is 28.5 billion tons of
hydrocarbons out of which about 6.5 billion tons have been
geologically established. About 50 percent of the country's 3.2
million square kilometer sedimentary area has been explored and
there is need to work in new and lesser explored areas as well as
increasing the intensity of exploration in the existing areas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The country did not have any safety regulations for the
offshore operations and there is an urgent need to formulate
suitable regulations for avoiding accidents during operations in
the offshore sector, he added.

<HEADLINE> Captains of Collided Tankers Charged in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The captains of the two oil
tankers that collided in the Singapore Straits, off the southern
part of the Singapore island, were charged in the subordinate
court here today.
</P>
<P>
Jan Sokolowski, 54, and Michael Chalkitis, 58, were charged
with reckless navigation and endangering human lives.
</P>
<P>
The two allegedly committed the offense last Wednesday night
when their vessels collided, causing about 25,000 tons of marine
fuel oil to be spilt into the sea, the worst oil spill Singapore
has ever suffered.
</P>
<P>
Sokolowski, the Polish master of the Thai-registered Orapin
Global, a very large crude carrier which carried no cargo when the
collision took place, is said to have navigated the vessel in a
rash manner and failed to take appropriate action to avoid the
collision.
</P>
<P>
Chalkitis, the Greek master of the Cyprus-flagged tanker
Evoikis, which was carrying 120,000 tons of marine fuel oil, is
alleged to have failed to reduce speed and prevent his ship from
being seriously damaged while in the territorial waters of
Singapore. He is also charged with a breach of duty.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, Sokolowski faces a six-month jail, or a fine
of 1,000 dollars, or both, while Chalkitis faces a fine of 50,000
dollars or two years' jail, or both.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Wants to Be Heard at Commonwealth Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria yesterday appealed to
the Commonthwealth that it deserves a chance to defend itself at
Friday's summit in Edinburgh, which is to decide on Nigeria's
membership.
</P>
<P>
"One of the fundamental principles of the Commonwealth is
respect for the sovereign rights of members and Nigeria should
not be tried in absentia," Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi was quoted
by local media as saying.
</P>
<P>
Worried that Nigeria will not be re-granted its membership,
Ikimi, in his letter to the Commonthwealth Secretary-General
Emeka Anyaoku, seemed to be appealing to the latter's patriotic
feeling.
</P>
<P>
"It will be sad and unusual to have a Secretary-General of the
Commonwealth whose country is not a member of the association,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth two year ago for
executing author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight minority activists on
charges of murdur.
</P>
<P>
As the Commonthwealth heads of state are expected to meet in
Scotland on Friday and decide whether to re-admit Nigeria or
expel it, Ikimi said, "It is important that our country is not
discussed in Edinburgh and we will be denied the chance to
respond."
</P>
<P>
He, therefore, informed Anyaoku that arrangement have been
concluded for Nigeria's delegation to fly direct from Abuja to
Edinburgh to attend the discussion on Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigerian Minister of Culture and Information,
Walter Ofonagoro said Tuesday that the country's priority now is
not membership of the Commonwealth but fostering unity within the
ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West African States) and
maitaining peace on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while addressing newsmen after the opening
of the eighth Bauchi State festival of arts and culture.

<HEADLINE> Indo-Australian Trade to Double in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Australia and
India is expected to double within the next five years, Australian
High Commissioner to India Dareen Gribble said here today.
</P>
<P>
The present bilateral trade between the two countries stands at
over 2 billion Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters, Gribble said he was optimistic about a
substantial increase in bilateral trade as there has been a
proportional rise in exports to India of hard coking coal, wheat,
pulses and wool among other things.
</P>
<P>
"We have appreciated the tariff reduction on textile and woolen
sectors and are hopeful that the reduced government revenue
earnings as a result would be offset by increased investments from
Australia to make the raw wool available in India at a cheaper
price," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both the countries should have multi-dimensional relations on
coal, he said.
</P>
<P>
The attitude of the Australian investors and business people to
India would be gauged by the level to which the banking and
finance sectors are unfettered from interference, he added.

JAKARTA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
said here today that counter-trading could help solve various
economic challenges such as fierce competition, capital limitation
and supply of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia has a number of experiences in counter-trading, both
government-to-government and inter-private sectors," the president
said at the opening of the Asia-Pacific Counter-Trade Association
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the system could bring in enormous benefits, among
which are the opening of new markets, assurance of supply and
financial support for raw materials, capital goods purchase and
the creation of a financial mechanism that can boost inter-state
direct trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The counter-trade system could also facilitate the transfer of
technology and the increase of investment, he added.
</P>
<P>
The counter-trade/counter-purchase system is a kind of barter
in the world market by bilateral or multilateral transaction in
the lack of foreign currency between the buyer and the seller.
</P>
<P>
A total of 175 participants from 24 countries are attending the
conference which will last till Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela left here this morning for Tunisia to continue his
northern Africa tour, which will also take him to the
sanction-stricken Libya.
</P>
<P>
Mandela arrived here on Monday for a three-day visit at the
start of his four-nation tour that also includes Libya, Morocco
and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by four ministers, Mandela will travel by road
today to Libya, where flights are banned under U.N. sanctions for
Tripoli's refusal to surrender for trial in Britain or the
U.S. two suspects in the bombing of a Pan Am plane over Scotland
in 1988 that killed more than 300 people on board.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak have reportedly
coordinated their stance on the issue. Both countries have
expressed support to a Libyan proposal on trying the two suspects
in a neutral country and having the comprehensive embargo lifted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has failed to compel Mandela to cancel the visit to
Tripoli. South Africa's Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo told reporters
earlier that his country won't bow to U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Mandela met with Mubarak for the third
session of talks on the Mideast peace process, African issues and
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Mandela on Tuesday awarded each other with their
countries' highest medals, in appreciation of the other's
contribution to peace, freedom and development.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Middle East News Agency,
Mandela said his tour of the region is aimed at enhancing trade
and military cooperation together with discussing recent
developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, on his first visit to Egypt since becoming president
in 1994, also expressed his support to the Mideast peace process
and especially the Palestinians' right to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
During the days of apartheid that ended in 1994, South Africa

ZHENGZHOU, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Health departments of central
China's Henan province have taken steps to improve the
certification system for health care products.

<P>
Health care products have developed rapidly in China in recent
years, and more than 2,100 factories now produce 3,387 health care
items in China.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the sector has also meant the cropping up of major
problems, which include listing drugs as health care products and
using some new medicines both for medical treatment and for health
care.
</P>
<P>
So, to get its health care house in order, the province will
ban the production, sale, and use of non-health care products, and
ask factories, even those whose products have been approved, to
hand over samples to the Health Ministry for a second round of
approval.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rejects Proposal on New Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has rejected a U.S.-British
proposal to impose new United Nations sanctions on Iraq, local
English-language daily The Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has delivered its official stance to the United Kingdom,
the paper quoted Sayed Kassem el-Masri, an Egyptian assistant
foreign minister, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt, while extremely concerned about Iraq's commitment to
carry out the United Nations resolutions, is keen on easing the
suffering of the Iraqi people," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Masri received a copy of the proposal
from London during a meeting Tuesday with British envoy in Cairo
David Blutherwich.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal drawn up by the U.S. and Britain last week,
a travel ban should be imposed on Iraqi officials for its blocking
of the U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Washington has eased its insistence
on immediate travel bans against Iraqi officials, but the Security
Council is still divided on whether to renew the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has urged Russia, France and China, the other three
permanent Security Council members, to use their veto power to
block the U.S.-British proposal.
</P>
<P>
It slammed the U.S. and Britain for proposing the travel
sanctions to the U.N., saying that their aim is to prevent the
Security Council from discussing an end to the seven-year-old
U.N. economic sanctions on Iraq imposed for Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq warned that it would drop all cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors if new sanctions were imposed on it.

<HEADLINE> Russian Parliament Drops No-Confidence Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communists, the largest
faction in the lower house of parliament, today formally withdrew
a motion of no-confidence in the government.
</P>
<P>
Communist Party Leader Gennady Zyuganov told a plenary session
of the State Duma that legislators who signed a petition two weeks
ago calling for the vote had now withdrawn their signatures,
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Considering latest decisions taken by the president and the
government...the faction withdraws the question of no confidence,"
Zyuganov said at the session.
</P>
<P>
But Zyuganov said his faction "reserves the right to put the
issue on the agenda again if the agreement reached with the
president and the government are not fulfilled."
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin had agreed he and Prime Minister Victor
Chernomyrdin would consult regularly with the speakers of
parliament's two chambers in the so-called "Group of Four".
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, addressing the Duma today, said he was satisfied
with the Communists' decision.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party spearheaded the drive to hold the vote of
no-confidence, arguing that the government's budget and other
economic policies were too austere and were destroying the country.
</P>
<P>
The vote was originally planned for last week, but after
President Yeltsin promised concessions, legislators rescheduled it
for Wednesday. Yeltsin spent most the week striving to avert a
second vote attempt, and finally removed the threat in a meeting
with parliament leaders.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Splits from W. African Effort on S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Signs show that Liberia may have
distanced itself from the efforts of the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG on Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The signs emerged on Tuesday when Liberia prohibited ECOMOG to
use its land for bombing targets in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Liberian President Charles Taylor ordered on Tuesday the
recruitment and deployment of specially trained Liberian troops
to man the nation's borders with Sierra Leone, according to
reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The order came one day before the dialogue between west
African foreign ministers and representatives of the junta which
is expected to resume today in Conakry, capital of Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Taylor also ordered the relocation of over 20,000 Sierra
Leonean refugees currently in Liberia to places some 100 miles
from the border, a measure he said would "make Liberian a safe
zone".
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government further criticized ECOMOG's resort to
bombing of Sierra Leone's military installations, saying that
Liberia did not support the use of force in a bid to restore the
ousted government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The action was part of the decision made Monday night at a
major cabinet meeting which reviewed Liberia's role in the Sierra
Leonean crisis and the refugee situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after the meeting, the government condemned
recent ECOMOG air raids in Sierra Leone, saying it would no
longer encourage the use of Liberia as a launching pad for ECOMOG
forces against Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, ECOMOG has launched continuous air raids
against the military junta in Freetown. ECOMOG jet fighters have
reportedly been flying out of Liberia to drop bombs on targets in
Freetown.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Date For Damming Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow River, the second
largest in China, is scheduled for blocking on October 28 to
prepare for work on the multi-billion yuan Xiaolangdi Hydropower
Project in Luoyang, Henan province.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on Tuesday at a meeting on the project,
presided over by Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
The project is meant to control the Yellow River, where the bed
has been rising because of the large amount of sand brought down
from the upper reaches that pass through the severely eroded Loess
Plateau, and to generate electricity.
</P>
<P>
The project began in October 1994.

<HEADLINE> Australia Boosts Spending on Films, TV Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia increased its
spending on feature films and television programs in the last
financial year, but the film expenditure was still less than the
record 1993/94 level, according to figures released today.
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed a decline in the level of Australian
government investment as a percentage of the overall figures and a
rise in Australian private investment in productions being shot
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Total Australian and overseas production for film and
television was 561 million Australian dollars (409.53 million U.S.
dollars), an increase of 62 million Australian dollars (45.26
million U.S. dollars) over 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
The 561 million Australian dollars represented 87 projects,
compared to 86 the year before, of which 33 were mainly financed
by government sources, compared to 43 in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The figures are contained in the eighth annual National Survey
of Feature Film and Independent Television Drama Production,
released by the Australian Film Commission.
</P>
<P>
Independent Australian feature film and television drama
production soared to 366 million Australian dollars (267.20
million U.S. dollars) in 1996/97, from 297 million Australian
dollars (216.8 million U.S. dollars) in 1995/96.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Advises U.S. to Drop Textile Export Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has sent a government
delegation to the United States to negotiate an end to quota
restrictions placed on Kenya's textile exports, said the Kenyan
Minister for Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Commerce and Industry Joshua Angatia told the
National Assembly Tuesday that three members of the delegation
are already there and two others left Nairobi last night, the
Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question by John Mwaura, Member of Parliament from
Kigumo, Angatia said that some 15,000 Kenyans had lost their jobs
due to lack of a market following the imposition of the quotas
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the delegation would lobby the U.S.
Congress to pass a law ending the quota restrictions and the
Kenya government was negotiating a new deal with the U.S.
government to ensure a larger share for Kenya textile products.
</P>
<P>
The quotas imposed in July 1994 has had a devastating effect
on the country's textile industry and the worst hit by the quotas
are firms operating under the Manufacturing Under Bond (MUB)
scheme.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said that about 50 firms under the MUB had
to close down and firms operating under the Export Processing
Zones had to cut their production by half after being cut off
from the lucrative U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Ambassador to Kenya, Prodence Bushnell, said earlier
this month that she did not see why the quota could not be moved
given that Kenyan exports did not threaten the U.S. textile
interests.
</P>
<P>
She said that the issue was currently under review in the U.S.
Congress and expressed optimism a decision favouring Kenya would
be reached.

<P>
ALMA ATA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- There are bright prospects in
the development of oil and natural gas industries in Kazakhstan,
Kuandykov Baltabek, chief executive of the National Petroleum and
Natural Gas Company, said today.
</P>
<P>
This year's output of petroleum of Kazakhstan is expected to
reach 26 million tons, an increase of 3 million tons above last

</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan has introduced from abroad a big amount of funds and
imported advanced technology and equipment for oil development,
said Kuandykov, whose predecessor Nurlan Balgimbaev was appointed
as prime minister of the oil-rich central Asian country earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan is boosting cooperation with major petroleum
businesses from China, Russia, Iran, the United States and Italy,
said Baltabek.
</P>
<P>
He told the press that agreements on cooperating with foreign
countries in developing natural gas in Kalachaganak and oil and
natural gas in the continental shelf of the Caspian Sea are
expected to be finalized in November.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Likely to Be Affected by El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The El Nino phenomenon
could have a devastating impact on South Africa's rural
communities which do not have access to stored water and rely on
run-off from streams and rivers, a South African expert warned.
</P>
<P>
Chris Swiegers, chief engineer for the Department of Water
Affairs, told parliament in Cape Town Tuesday that the
department's latest forecasts show that the 1997/98 El Nino is
likely to be as bad as the one which occurred in 1982/83.
</P>
<P>
The impact of that event had been devastating, with rainfall
figures substantially bellow normal levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
El Nino would exert great influence on water availability,
crops, livestock and health in rural communities, as well as
South Africa's fishing industry.
</P>
<P>
The department has various plans to counter El Nino impact,
Swiegers said, but the main focus of its efforts will fall on the
country's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
This, he added, includes close monitoring of the situation in
these areas, the repair of water supply works, and pushing ahead
with the department's rural water supply program as fast as
possible.
</P>
<P>
El Nino is a phenomenon linked to the warming of surface water
in the tropical Pacific ocean. It exerts an influence on
atmospheric circulation patterns around the world, disrupting
weather patterns in many countries.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon typically lasts 18 to 20 months and occurs
every three to eight years on average.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, El Nino events go hand-in-hand with
below-normal rainfall in summer rainfall areas, especially during
the second half of the season.

HARBIN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A patient in northernmost
China's Heilongjiang Province who was suffering from serious edema
on his left leg, got help long distance over the information
superhighway at the No. 1 Hospital of Harbin Medical University,
where he had a successful operation as a result.
</P>
<P>
This was one of the first group of patients to benefit from the
hospital's new multi-media system that allows doctors from more
than 20 renowned hospitals all across the country to help with a
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
When the patient was admitted to the hospital, his left leg was
so swollen that it was as big as his waist. Doctors consulted with
two professors at Beijing Union Hospital, who reached the decision
that the cause was filariasis, and they worked out a plan for
surgery, which proved successful.
</P>

Heilongjiang Province is now trying to build a medical
consultation network that connects more than 30 hospitals in ten

<HEADLINE> Two Asian Records Fall on Track of National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Two Asian records cracked in
the women's 200 meters and 400m hurdles at the Eighth National
Games here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sprinter Li Xuemei claimed the 200m national title with an
Asian mark of 22.01 seconds, breaking the previous record of 22.39
set by Susanthika Jayasinghe of Sri Lankan in the World Athletics
Championships in Athens in August.
</P>
<P>
Her teammate Liu Xiaomei also surpassed the Asian record by
clocking 22.36 for the second place.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Limei of Guangxi won the 400m hurdles title with another
Asian mark of 53.38 seconds, slicing 0.58 seconds off the previous
mark of 53.96, which was established by her compatriot Han Qing in
1993.
</P>
<P>
Early in the National Games, Li Xuemei took the 100m title by
breaking the Asian mark twice. She first timed in 10.90 seconds
in the heats and later claimed the natioanl title in 10.79
seconds.
</P>
<P>
The women's 100m and 200m world records were all held by
Florence Griffith Joyner of the United States in 10.49 and 21.34
seconds respectively.
</P>
<P>
Li, 20, failed to leave her presence on the podium at the
Athens Worlds, but she said she could have performed much better
there.
</P>
<P>
"That's my first time to take part in an international meet,"
she said. "I felt very nervous to compete along with so many big
names."
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe emerged as Asia's top women spinter by winning the
silver in the 200m event in Athens. But Li is confident now that
she can overtake the Sri Lankan for the honour.
</P>
<P>
"I belive I can beat her in the Asian Games in Thailand next
year," she said.
</P>
<P>
Lang Yinglai of Liaoning, a new protege of Ma Junren, grabbed
the gold in the women's 800 meters by clocking 1:57.62. Chen
Xuehui of Guangxi finished second with 0.20 seconds behind and Lin
Na, also from Liaoning, ranked third in 1:58.16.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed her great thanks to coach Ma, saying that
"without coach Ma's unique training, I could never win a gold and
I will definitely make more progresses under his charge."
</P>
<P>
"It is not too bad to take the gold without a record time from
the 800m event as it is not our strong event for these young
runners," said Ma.
</P>
<P>
The coach explained that both Lin and Lang suffered injuries in
their ankles.
</P>
<P>
"It's a hard victory. I extend my congratulations to them," Ma
said, sitting at the first row of the stand.

<P>
SEOUL, October 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will not allow the
Japanese Self-Defense Force (SDF) to operate in South Korea's
sovereign territory, though the recently revised Washington-Tokyo
defense guidelines allows Japanese troops an expanded role in case of
regional conflicts, the South Korean Defense Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry has also notified the U.S. and Japanese
defense authorities that they must have prior consultations with South
Korea when they work out details of new guidelines which may contain
issues related to South Korea's sovereignty, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"We have also delivered our intention that the Japanese forces,
prior to their operations in international waters close to the South
Korea side and in the South Korea air identification zone (KADIZ),
should consult with us in advance," the ministry said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the new defense guidelines will not lead to revision of
Japan's constitution, which allows Japanese armed forces to engage
only defensively, and for Japanese forces to become a `projection
power' in the region," a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Consultations with neighboring countries are needed lest Japanese
forces' operations in the region cause tension, he said.
</P>
<P>
The revised U.S.-Japan military guidelines, which was unveiled
Sept. 23, cover bilateral security arrangements in case of an armed
attack against Japan and "in situations in areas surrounding Japan."
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Seoul express the concern that the existing South
Korea-U.S. mutual defense treaty might be reduced to a subordinate
agreement against the new U.S-Japan defense guidelines.

<HEADLINE> Pilgrimage Season Begins in Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The old man who lay prostrate in
front of the Johkang Monastery in Lhasa, murmuring prayers, said
that he and 39 others had come from their hometown in eastern
Tibet to reaffirm their vows to Buddha.
</P>
<P>
"We prayed and offered lamp oil to the monastery, hoping that
we and our families have good health and long life, and do better
year by year," Zhaba said. The Johkang, in the center of the old
urban area of Lhasa, is worshiped by various Tibetan Buddhist
sects, and burning incense has been around for more than 1,300
years.
</P>
<P>
Pilgrimages normally begin in the middle of October and last
until the end of the following March, according to Nyima Cering,
deputy head of the monastery's Democratic Management
Committee. The slack winter season for farmers on the Tibetan
plateau has not come yet, but the incense in front of the
Monastery is burning again.
</P>
<P>
The monastery contains a life-size gold sculpture of Sakyamuni,
the founder of Buddhism that was brought to Tibet in the middle of
the seventh century by Princess Wen Cheng of the Tang Dynasty
(618-907).
</P>
<P>
Tibetans from Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces,
and other areas outside Tibet come to Lhasa to pray, and a visit
to the Johkang Monastery is a must.

"Sometimes, as many as 10,000 people worship at the monastery
in a single day," Nyima Cering said. Large numbers started coming
from early October this year.
</P>
<P>
"They come in an endless stream, giving us a lot of management
work, and many lamas don't have their meals on time," he said,
"But it is our duty to meet their religious needs to the best of
our ability." Many lamas rise early and go to sleep late in order
to find time to study Buddhist scriptures.
</P>
<P>
Nyima Cering came to the monastery ten years ago and studied at
the Chinese Buddhist College in Beijing from 1989 to 1990. The
college is the highest learning institute for Tibetan Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot be taken as an authentic lama just by putting on
the kasaya, but must work hard at Buddhist scriptures," Nyima
Cering said. "Only in this way can one obtain the essence of
Buddhism and become a true monk."
</P>
<P>
Nyima speaks Tibetan, Han language (Chinese), and English, and
is in charge of receiving visitors. Summer is the best tourism
season in Tibet. But now, with the approaching pilgrimage season,
he and some of the 120 other lamas in the monastery are busy with
the Buddha halls and putting things in good order.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's state visit to the United States next week will be
successful, former U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig said
today.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very optimistic over the visit of President Jiang Zemin to
the United States." said Haig in an interview with Xinhua in his
office in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
Haig, currently chairman of the Worldwide Associates Inc.,
noted that Jiang's week-long visit, which will begin on October
26, will be a "turning point" in the development of the relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. senior official anticipated that there will be
"a cordial meeting" between Jiang and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Haig, who served as the U.S. secretary of state between
January, 1981 and July 1982, recalled the normalization of the
bilateral relations,
</P>
<P>
It has been a general trend the U.S. and China develop a
cooperative and friendly relationship since former President
Richard Nixon launched the normalization of the U.S.-Chinese
relations despite difficulties, Haig said.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, negotiations on resolving some differences
between the two countries also made a lot of progress, he
noted. "All these make me optimistic," he added
</P>
<P>
Haig, who has paid at least 30 visits to China since 1972,
criticized a number of special interest groups in the United
States for hindering the development of U.S.-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
"When they see the Soviet Union collapse, then they have to go
to look for a new enemy... But these are very short-sighted and
wrong-headed people, and they do not represent the majority of the
American people," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
"They are the minority, they are vocal and noisy, but they
don't represent the basic attitudes of the American people, nor
the American government," Haig said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the obstacles in the U.S.-Chinese relations as "part
of the course," Haig said, "It's been always my considered view
that the two great nations ... are bound to have differences, it
will be impossible for them not to have differences."
</P>
<P>
"The question is how you deal with it," Haig said, emphasizing
that disputes cannot be settled by "intimidation" or the
"intervention of internal affairs of a friendly nation."
</P>
<P>
Haig highly commented on China's development, saying "No
country in the world has made such remarkable progress."

<HEADLINE> Lebanese General Deficit Falls in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese general deficit fell
by 3 percent in August from the previous month, to some 23
trillion Lebanese lires (about 48 million U.S. dollars), local
newspaper Beirut Times quoted a bank report as saying today.
</P>
<P>
In its September report, the Lebanese Bankers Association said
that public deficit accounted for 85.4 percent of the total
deficit while trade deficit took up the remaining 14.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The consolidated balance sheets of the commercial banks of
Lebanon rose from about 26.9 million U.S. dollars at the end of
July to 27.3 million U.S. dollars at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
The balance of trade also increased by 14.3 percent in the
month of August, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese exports rose by 1.9 percent in that month whereas
imports drooped by 13.1 percent. The balance of payments achieved
a surplus of 800 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bankers Association, the balance of payments
surplus will allow the Banque du Liban, the country's central
bank, to offset the deficit of the treasury for several months.
</P>
<P>
It said that the central bank had exempted commercial banks
from mandatory subscription to government's bonds, at an average
rate of 40 percent, and also refused to accept further
subscription from individuals and institutions outside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the reserves of the commercial banks at
the Banque du Liban had finance the bulk of public deficit. The
share of commercial banks in settling the public deficit
represented 69.3 percent of the total general deficit.

<HEADLINE> Much Sooner Approval for Urgent Passport Application </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Any Chinese citizen who has
urgent affairs to deal with outside the country now can obtain
police exit approval within one day, an official from the Ministry
of Public Security said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Exit-Entry Administration under the Ministry of Public
Security has issued a temporary provision which governs citizens'
passport applications.
</P>
<P>
Urgent applications will be approved within five work days,
while people with extremely pressing issues can be approved within
one day.
</P>
<P>
The provision includes seven types of emergency affairs, such
as visiting overseas patients who are in critical condition;
attending a relative's funeral or making funeral arrangements;
having urgent business affairs; students with new school terms
approaching abroad; seeing doctors in other countries or
territories; expiring foreign visas; and emergency reasons
recognized by local exit-entry agencies.
</P>
<P>
If an applicant is not instantly able to prove the emergency
with valid materials but has convincing reasons for his overseas
trip, exit-entry administrators still will consider applications
on their merits.
</P>
<P>
Previous regulations stipulated that the examination and
approval of passport applications should be completed within 30
working days.
</P>
<P>
Administrators are not allowed to overcharge passport
applicants in urgent cases, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The existing price is 105 yuan, or 12.65 U.S. dollars,
including the cost of the passport itself and a service charge.
</P>
<P>
Complaints should be directed to public security agencies at or
above the provincial level, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Tung Says Hong Kong Moving on With Pride, Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is moving forward with
pride and confidence after its return to its motherland on July 1,
Chief Executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
Tung Chee-Hwa said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told a large audience at a dinner that "Pride in that we are
now reunited with the motherland .....Confidence in that we can
and will make our city an even better place going forward."
</P>
<P>
Tung said the solid promises of "the Basic Law" are the
fundamental reasons why Hong Kong people are so confident in their
ability to manage their future.
</P>
<P>
Referring to China's open-door policy, Tung said China has
undergone dramatic changes since it opened up to the outside world
in 1978. The economy has grown at a remarkable rate, averaging
some 10 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
It is a tribute to the vitality and energy of the Chinese
people and the vision of China's leaders who have guided these
developments, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed, "these leaders have the ability and the
acumen to steer China successfully into the 21th century."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China, Tung said it has reaffirmed the path of
China's development. "We are confident that China will be more
open and more prosperous as it enters into the 21th Century," he
added.
</P>
<P>
On Britain's presence in Hong Kong, Tung said it is one of the
largest investors there. British retailers have been particularly
successful in winning over Hong Kong's consumers.
</P>
<P>
"Many British companies use Hong Kong as a springboard to the
Chinese Mainland and the region's new consumer markets," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung, who arrived here today, is on a three-day visit to
Britain. It is the first time for Tung to visit Britain as the
chief of Hong Kong since the island was returned to China on July
1 after 156 years of British colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
Tung's trip is aimed at strengthening the close economic and
trade ties between Hong Kong and Britain, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is Britain's second largest export market in the
Asia-Pacific region while Britain is the leading foreign investor
in Hong Kong with investment in its manufacturing and services
sectors estimated at around 20 billion U.S. dollars.

province continues opening wider to the outside world and its
foreign trade has increased by an annual 13.5 percent in recent

<P>
TIANJIN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Imports and exports in the
processing business in Tianjin, the largest port city in north
China, hit a record four billion US dollars in the first three
quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a year-on-year increase of 15.9 percent,
2.1 billion US dollars in exports and 1.8 billion US dollars in
imports, according to the customs office.

Solely foreign-funded enterprises accounted for more than 50
percent of that amount. Goods with a high added value, and goods
from private enterprises have begun to account for a larger part
of the foreign trade.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Motorola Catalyst in Tianjin's Entry to World Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Motorola, celebrating the 10th
anniversary of its entry into China, has announced plans to turn
its Tianjin manufacturing facility into both an Asian center and a
global source of cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
With an initial funding of 120 million U.S. dollars, the
Tianjin plant becomes Motorola's largest single project in China.
</P>
<P>
Motorola, with more than 8,000 employees and six plants in its
Tianjin operation, produces pagers, mobile phones and
semiconductor products -- mostly for China and other Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
Motorola's emphasis on local markets has brought considerable
profits to many plants, some becoming international suppliers.
</P>
<P>
"Motorola serves as a catalyst for Tianjin's participation in
the international market," said Meng Xianzhong, general engineer
of the Tianjin economic committee.
</P>
<P>
According to P.Y. Lai, president of Motorola (China)
Electronics Ltd., since the establishment of the Tianjin plant in
1993, Motorola has invested 1 billion U.S. dollars, more than 80
percent of its total investment in China of 12 billion
U.S. dollars. The China subsidiary was established in 1992, five
years after Motorola first established an office in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Motorola will further expand its cooperation with Tianjin, and
is confident about the prospects," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
A large-capacity, integrated-circuit wafer fabrication facility
is under construction at a cost of 720 million U.S. dollars. Upon
completion, Lai said, it will be Motorola's first sub-micro 8-inch
wafer facility outside the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Motorola's success in Tianjin has won recognition from the
government. In 1994, Motorola was listed among the top 10 foreign
investors in China in terms of both export and sales volume.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, praised the company's
cooperation with Tianjin. During a meeting earlier this year with
Robert Galvin, chairman of the Executive Committee of Motorola, Li
said the U.S. manufacturer has simultaneously produced profits and
contributed to the social welfare of the city.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Urges Kenya to Remove Trade Obstacles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has called on Kenya to
remove all major trade obstacles between the two countries which
are heavily biased in favour of Kenya, the local newspaper The
People reported today.
</P>
<P>
Recent official statistics show that Kenya exported goods
worth 184 million U.S. dollars to Uganda in 1995/96 while the
latter's exports to Kenya were a mere 19 million dollars in the
same period.
</P>
<P>
However, the 19-million-dollar exports include tea, one of
Uganda major exports, which is auctioned in Mombasa, a port city
in Kenya, but does not end up in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The paper said unfavorable bureaucracy frustrated Ugandan
exporters through cumbersome licensing, road block, gratuity
demands at road-blocks and imprisonment of Ugandans on genuine
business trips.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest management
consultant opened a branch recently in the Pudong New Area of
Shanghai, China's industrial center.
</P>
<P>
Roland Berger &AMP; Partners's Asia manager says the company has
the idea of developing this potential market, as the country
increases efforts to reform its state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China's economic development creates a need for management
expertise and development strategies. The German company's annual
business in China has grown from 9 percent of its total in 1995 to
the present 14 percent, and is expected to grow to 30-40 percent
in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The field of consulting in China is at an early stage. There
are some 400 businesses, doing 30 to 40 million US dollars in
business annually, mainly at a rudimentary level, with information
gathering, market surveys, and investment advice.
</P>
<P>
Roland Berger has more than 30 branches and offices around the
world, and nearly 700 consultants. It did 413 million Deutschmarks
in business last year, putting it first in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai branch will provide consulting services for
Chinese enterprises in the area of acquisition, reorganization,
modern enterprise system, development strategies, and marketing
plans.

HARBIN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- St. Sophia Church in the city of
Harbin has taken on a new look after recent renovation, helping
the architecture of the European-style city, which is the capital
of Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Work on the church first started in 1907 and it suffered the
ill effects of neglect for many decades, until the city government
took on the job of repairing the structure. That job took from
July 11 to the end of August and cost 16 million yuan (about 1.93
million US dollars). Local enterprises and citizens donated 10
million yuan of that.
</P>
<P>
The church has a 7,000-sq.m. square in front, made of granite,
which opened to tourists in September, and more than 500 people
visit it daily.
</P>
<P>
According to historians, the church is a typical example of
Byzantine architecture and is the biggest Eastern Orthodox church
in the Far East. There are only four similar churches in the
world, in Istanbul, Kiev, and Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Elder Coach Challenges Life for High Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen years ago, coach Hu
Hongfei nodded his grey-hair head to answer the salute when his
disciple high jumper Zhu Jianhua cleared 2.38 meters for a world
record.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years later, the 73-year-old man, a patient of nose
cancer, raised his shaky hand to wipe the tears off his eyelids in
a distant corner stand as his new protege Niu Jian claimed the
national title at the height of 2.29 meters.
</P>
<P>
With the gold medal around his neck, Niu Jian set his sights
upon the old man, whispering the words from the bottom of his
heart "I know it is not easy for him, an old man with few teeth
left, and I only hope to know how I can reward him in return."
</P>
<P>
Yet, the elder coach cherished his own hope and remained firm
in mind to bridge the gap of the nine centimeters between his two
proteges. "I will and I can zero the difference and even better,"
said coach Hu, "nothing can stop me but death."
</P>
<P>
Hu Hongfei is a man of confidence instead of conceit. He
devoted his life in whetting the skills of Zhu Jianhua from an
innocent child to a world-class star in 1983.
</P>
<P>
When all things went smoothly, Zhu Jianhua suffered his defeat
in the Los Angeles Olympic Games and eventually bidded farewell in
1989.
</P>
<P>
"I was 66 years old at the time, but I had to re-start my
campaign against the bar from the very beginning," recalled the
retired old man.
</P>
<P>
Misfortunes never come singly. Cancer stealthily invaded upon
his nose when Hu was remapping his training schedules. However,
he refrained himself from staying in hospital and hurried to and
fro for radiative treatment by bicycle.
</P>
<P>
Months of treatment stopped the spread of the cancer virus, but
also stripped him of hairs, eyesight and some 10-kilogram weight.
</P>
<P>
Against doctors' warning of a 50-percent prospect of recovery,
the old man challenged himself to death by strolling around the
schools and alleyways for any hopefuls of potential.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he was rewarded with two seven-year-old boy and
girl kids.
</P>
<P>
In seven years, Hu has led the kids to shift their training
venues four times, kept cycling to the sites for a daily training
of five to six hours and even resorted to his personal account for
training equipment.
</P>
<P>
Through his scientific training, 15-year-old Cui Kai can now
clear 2.15 meters at his will while Wang Chen, with 1.89 meters in
height, also beat 1.66 meters when she was at the age of 14, Hu
said.
</P>
<P>
His efforts were not off the minds of the municipal officials
and Gong Xueping, then vice mayor, led Niu Jian to Hu's resident
house in May, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Tagged as a nut not to clear 2.10 meter barrier, Niu Jian found
his rhythm under the impetus of coach Hu, breezed over 2.24 meters
months later and conquered 2.31 meters prior to the National
Games.
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, Niu Jian won the national gold, a precious gift
for coach Hu, yet the old man kept himself busy again in his "fast
run and swift jump" theory, hoping for another world high jump
champion from China.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Game of Money and Politics: Will Baht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Thai currency, baht, hit
another record low on Tuesday when it hit bottom at 38.85 against
the US dollar in the offshore market and 38.40 onshore.
</P>
<P>
It was the second record low in the past two consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
In the offshore market, it closed at 38.45/38.65, following a
low rate of 37.70 to the dollar on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In domestic trade, the baht ended 38.55/38.65, down from
37.55/37.65 at Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that political uncertainties have been the main
factor causing the continued slide of the baht.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya announced his
resignation, which will take effect when the expected cabinet
reshuffle completes.
</P>
<P>
Thanong's quit was followed by an announcement by leaders of
the six coalition government parties for all 48 cabinet members to
resign to give Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh a free hand to
make cabinet changes.
</P>
<P>
However, while political maneuvering is under way for the
shakeup, money dealers are further concerned about the continuity
of the economic programs put in place by Finance Minister Thanong
during his four months in office.
</P>
<P>
Since the government decided to float the baht in July and seek
financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in
August, the country's economy has further worsened, resulting in
rising prices, massive lay-offs, firm closedown, tax increases and
shrinking value of the baht.
</P>
<P>
During the last few months, the prime minister has been under
strong pressure to resign, because of alleged mismanagement of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The general public's confidence in the government is at a low
ebb. Demonstrations have been held during the last three days to
demand the prime minister's resignation. Government sources expect
more protesters could come from the provinces in the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
However, the cabinet reshuffle is easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
The Chart Pattana party, the second largest in the government
after the prime minister's New Aspiration, reportedly demands full
control of economic ministries, while the prime minister wants to
include more capable economic specialists in the reshuffled
cabinet to bail out the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
But, at a time of economic slump affecting almost all sectors,
it would be hard for any new minister to achieve any remarkable
accomplishment, let alone there is little time left before
parliament is dissolved, possibly in next March.
</P>
<P>
It is speculated that the prime minister may effect a major
cabinet shakeup to head a minority government.
</P>
<P>
A New Aspiration party source said the prime minister's
resignation would be the last resort and admitted that a major
cabinet reshuffle would be fraught with many difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Mark Rainake, head of trading at Asset Plus, said, "if the
current political deadlock and uncertainties continue, the baht
will go down further. It's a function of confidence and timing,
not fundamentals any more."
</P>
<P>
Pending the settling down of the political uncertainties, the
baht could weaken further. It may test the 40 level per dollar or
even go down further before it starts to rebound and settle at
around 35 to 37 to the dollar, a treasury chief at a foreign bank
said.
</P>
<P>
This prediction is echoed by Chart Thai party spokesman Somsak
Prisnananthakul, who said the baht might fall to 40 baht to the
dollar if Chavalit remains prime minister.

the other one, China United Telecommunications Corp (China Unicom)
does not.
</P>
<P>
After the introduction of the new charging system, China
Telecom's profits are expected to decrease in the short term, but
in the long run the new charging system will attract more people
to buy mobile phones and create a bigger mobile market.
</P>
<P>
The number of subscribers exceeded 10 million this July,
compared with 3,200 in 1987. MPT predicts that China will have 30
million cellular phone subscribers by the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA Agree to Resume Full Security Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- In another move to create
favorable atmosphere for advancing the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has agreed to resume
full security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the Arafat-Mordechai meeting
held late Tuesday at the Erez Checkpoint between Israel and
the Gaza Strip under the auspices of American peace envoy
Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said after the two-hour meeting, which focused on
Israeli demand for a tougher Palestinian fight against
terrorism, that Israel and the Palestinian side had "agreed to
cooperate on all security matters."
</P>
<P>
"We were able to review a wide range of security issues
and concerns," Arafat said. "We see a good basis here."
</P>
<P>
Mordechai reportedly presented Arafat a list of what he
said the Palestinian leader has avoided doing, including
arresting those who were responsible for carrying out terror
attacks against Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that we will be able to hold similar meetings
to advance the security needs of both sides," he said. "The
main matters which we discussed today were coordination and
integration in the field of security."
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the resumption of full security
cooperation came several weeks after low-level cooperation was
launched under the mediation of the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency's station chief in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The PNA broke off peace talks, including security cooperation,
with Israel in last March when Israel started constructing a
settlement in the disputed East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Following the July 30 twin suicide bombings and the
September 4 triple suicide bombings in Jerusalem launched by
the militant Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) which killed 25
people, Israel has increased its demand for the PNA to launch
a tougher crackdown on the Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
The Arafat-Mordechai meeting was another step forward in
advancing the peace negotiations, which were resumed under the
American mediation early the month after a seven-month freeze.
</P>
<P>
It was also held amid reports that Israel and the PNA
have made progress in the committee-level talks, especially on
wrapping up an agreement on opening the Gaza airport in
Dahaniya.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived here Sunday on a new shuttle mission,
has held the third round of meetings with Netanyahu and
Arafat to bridge the huge gap between the sides. He is
trying to persuade Israel to agree to accept a time-out in
its settlement activities, which the PA listed as a condition
for moving forward.

<P>
HARARE, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim arrived in
Zimbabwe on Tuesday to attend the chiefs of defence staff meeting
on Africa's peace-keeping missions which will open here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists on arrival, Salim said the meeting
comes at the right time when the continent meets with some
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting will allow the defence chiefs to exchange
ideas and come up with peacekeeping initiatives.
</P>
<P>
''Africa must resume its own responsibilities in conflict
resolution because if it does not the international community
will not help,'' said Salim.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting will focus on the continent's present
and future peacekeeping initiatives since the launch in 1993 by
OAU of the Mechanism For Conflict Prevention, Management and
Resolution in Africa.
</P>
<P>
On the Congo crisis, Salim had told ''The Herald'' news paper
that the OAU and the international community at large failed to
intervene in the Congo (Brazzaville) crisis because of a slow
response in assembling and deploying a peacekeeping force and a
refusal by the principal parties to respond favourably to the
call for a ceasefire.

<HEADLINE> Kim Young-sam Refuses Request to Quit Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Ruling New Korea Party (NKP)
leader Lee Hoi-chang demanded today that President Kim Young-sam
bolt from the party, but the president refused.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the NKP's headquarters this
morning, Lee, also the party's presidential candidate, requested
Kim relinquish his NKP membership so that he would be able to
oversee the forthcoming election in a "fair and objective manner".
</P>
<P>
However, Kim, who handed over the NKP presidency to Lee three
weeks ago and serves as honorary party head, rejected Lee's request.
</P>
<P>
Political observers say Lee's demand is actually, by distancing
Kim from the NKP, aiming to pave the way for demanding the
prosecution launch a thorough investigation of the NKP alleged
slush fund scandal, which involves opposition presidential
candidate Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Lee urged the prosecution to immediately
start the investigation, stressing that "there should not be any
sanctuary left in the ruling and opposition parties in the slush
fund probe."
</P>
<P>
"I ask the prosecution to make a thorough investigation of the
suspicions involving President Kim's 1992 presidential campaign
fund and my own fund used for the NKP's presidential nomination
race in July," the judge-turned politician said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor general Kim Tae-joung decided Tuesday to suspend the
probe on opposition Kim Dae-jung, considering the past
circumstance of political funds and fearing possible consequent
national chaos.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the decision, the leading opposition National Congress
for New Politics (NCNP) led by Kim Dae-jung, warned on the 1992
presidential campaign fund dispute involving President Kim
Young-sam and Lee Hoi-chang's fund suspicion, as a counter-measure
against the NKP's allegation on Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung is the leading presidential candidate in opinion
polls while Lee takes the third place, trailing far behind.

<HEADLINE> 23 Kenyans Die due to Heavy Rains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's weather experts has warned
that more and heavier rains are expected in two weeks although
torrential rains has claimed 23 lives since Sunday at Coast Province.
</P>
<P>
Five more deaths were reported Tuesday in Kilifi and Mombasa
districts in the country's southern area bordering the Indian
Ocean. Three people were drowned when trying to cross a stream
which had turned into a raging river. The two others died
in the freak floods.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people have been left stranded by the washing away
of the bridge at Marere in Kwale, said reports reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
The rains, which the meteorological department said had been
the highest recorded in the Coast Province in recent years, have
also paralysed road services in Kilifi, Tana River and Lamu
districts.
</P>
<P>
Power supply was intermittent in many parts of the Coast.
</P>
<P>
Lands and Settlement Minister Noah Katana Ngala was marooned
by floods in his Ganze constituency from last Saturday and had to
be airlifted by a helicopter on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a disaster because of the loss of lives and property
being destroyed while hundreds of people have been rendered
homeless by the floods which have not been experienced here
before," said Coast Provincial Commissioner Timothy Sirma.
</P>
<P>
However, meteorological department forecasters said the death
and destruction caused by unusually heavy rain at the Coast is
just the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
Western and eastern provinces will have to prepare for similar
downpours and flooding as now wreaking havoc at the Coast, the
department warned.
</P>
<P>
The rains would climax next month and would decline by early
next year, said the department's acting director Stephen Njoroge.
</P>
<P>
The unusual rain was due to the effects of high sea surface
temperatures (simply known as El Nino) which cause changes in the
rain pattern, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The eastern African country will experience a shortage of rain
next year also due to the El Nino, he added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Military-Political Alliance With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The relationship with China is
of strategic importance to Russia, but neither sides have the
intention to form a political and military alliance, Russian
Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a forum held here, Karasin said Russia is actively
developing its relations with China and he believed that the
Chinese leaders are also working seriously to turn its
relationship with Russia into a more friendly one.
</P>
<P>
But both Moscow and Beijing have no intention to make a
military-political alliance, he said, "that is a principle stand."
</P>
<P>
He told the forum that the two neighboring countries are
positively preparing for President Boris Yeltsin's visit to China
in early November. Some important documents are being drafted,
including a final settlement of the border issue between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
Karasin said the two countries plan to bring the bilateral
annual trade to 20 billion U.S. dollars at the beginning of next
century.

The forum on the theme of international cooperation and foreign
trade was co-sponsored by the Presidential Office of Russia, the

<HEADLINE> Road Accidents Cause Big Losses in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe lost more than 100
million Zimbabwe Dollars (about 10 million U.S. dollars) in
39,000 road accidents reported throughout the country last year,
The Herald daily paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Up to 1,205 people were killed and another 18,070 were injured
in the accidents.
</P>
<P>
It is vital to note that it is not only life that was lost in
an accident, but thousands of dollars which could be channelled
to development programs, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Augustine Maminimini, promotion officer of the Zimbabwe
Traffic Safety Board, told the paper that most of the accidents
last year involved light motor vehicles and buses.
</P>
<P>
He said accidents were caused by a number of factors, adding
that the main cause was human error.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown of the causes of last year's crashes showed that
inattention and poor judgment by drivers resulted in 5,188
accidents. Speeding caused up to 4,549 accidents and more than
3,060 accidents were due to failure by drivers to give way at
intersections, Maminimini added.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Increase Defense Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Italy's defense budget will swell
by an extra 500 billion lire (289.18 million U.S. dollars)
annually for the next three years mainly due to renegotiated
supply and maintenance contracts, Defense Minister Beniamino
Andreatta announced.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's budget for the 1998-2000 period will thus climb
from 4 trillion lire (2.31 billion dollars) to 5.5 trillion (3.18
billion dollars), at a time when the budgets of all other
ministries are being squeezed in a bid to bring the total public
spending down in line with Maastricht-imposed economic targets.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Peace, Security and Development conference here
Monday, Andreatta estimated that savings from contract revisions
would provide 80 percent of the additional 1.5 trillion lire
(867.6 billion dollars) over the three-year period.
</P>
<P>
The remainder would come from the selling of the ministry's
property and from the Ministry of Industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have already begun comparing prices of military supplies in
other countries," Andreatta said. "I want to spend where the
prices are lowest and the innovations greatest."

<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A Danish nurse working in a
Copenhagen hospital has been detained on the charge of killing 22
elderly patients.
</P>
<P>
The Danish News Agency reported today that the 32-year-old
nurse killed the old people by injecting them with a
morphine-based drug.
</P>
<P>
The first murder occurred in August 1994, two months after she
was employed in the hospital. During the period of 1994-1997, she
killed 15 women and seven men between the ages of 65-97.
</P>
<P>
The nurse is also suspected of embezzling and stealing 100,000
U.S. dollars from nursing home patients. She was fired in March
after admitting minor embezzlement and detained six months later
following a police investigation of the case.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said a woman doctor in the same hospital was
also detained on the charge of negligent homicide and breach of
duty.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Economy Maintains Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's economy is expected to
grow by nine percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Official newspapers here today quoted sources from the regular
meeting of the government review on the implementation of the
socio-economic development plan and the state budget.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed that the economy still maintained its growth
impetus with a nine percent increase in GDP, and a 4.8 percent
increase in agriculture, forestry and fisheries production.
</P>
<P>
Food production had reached 30.6 million tons a year, up by 1.4
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Export values stood at about nine billion U.S. dollars, up by
24 percent, and inflation was kept at four to five percent for the
whole year.
</P>
<P>
However, the government noted "serious difficulties and
challenges to the economy, especially the recent slow-down signs
in the growth rate, and even reductions in several sectors".
</P>
<P>
It said:"Industrial production in some localities, even in big
industrial centers such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang,
stopped growing."
</P>
<P>
It added that the number of businesses running at losses
increased while the foreign investment flow reduced.
</P>
<P>
While a bumper crop was harvested, the price of rice had
dropped too low in some areas, causing difficulties for farmers.
</P>
<P>
Many social problems, especially corruption, illegal business
operations and social evils, had not been effectively solved.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai called the government's attention
to the low quality and efficiency of the country's economy, the
poor competitiveness of domestic products on the domestic and world
markets, and the falling purchasing power of the people, as well as
increasing corruption and smuggling.

<HEADLINE> Italy Repeats Offer to Mediate in Algerian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Italy today repeated its offer to
mediate in the Algerian crisis, despite Algeria's protest about
foreign interference in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini told reporters here that
Italy "wants to begin talks with the Algerian government" to find
a solution to the crisis of terrorism in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
No end to Algeria's internal strife was in sight and the
international community had not yet found the key for resolving
the problem, Dini added.
</P>
<P>
He also called for involving non-governmental organizations in
the search for a solution.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Dini provoked strong protests from Algerian
authorities by proposing foreign mediation in the Algerian
crisis. Algeria immediately rejected the proposal, claiming it
constituted interference in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
At least 89 people have been massacred in a recent series of
killings committed in Algeria since October 2.
</P>
<P>
The newest killings took place after Algerian President Liamine
Zeroual rejected a call for talks by the outlawed Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS).

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini is appealing to parliament today for an increase in his
ministry's funding.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his ministry's budget for 1998 to the Senate Foreign
Committee, Dini expressed a "strong and convincing" commitment
justifying his ministry's organization and optimizing its use of
resources.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if no new funding was made available "the
increasingly responsible role Italy will be expected to play on
the international scene" could be seriously compromised.
</P>
<P>
Dini said the ministry's budget has remained "substantially"
the same for the past ten years, even though it is required to
match Italy's growing international role in the European Union,
the United Nations and other forums.
</P>
<P>
In the 1998 budget, the foreign ministry is scheduled to
receive just over 2 trillion lire ( about 1.1 billion dollars),
the same as its 1997 budget.
</P>
<P>
Dini said he would pursue a course of reducing Italy's
consulates abroad, following the success of this plan in
Switzerland, where the number of Italian consulates has been
reduced from 22 to 13.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Main Opposition Favors Devolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition
party the United National Party (UNP) said in a statement
published in today's newspapers that it is for devolution of power
within the framework of an indivisible Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to state with emphasis that the UNP has accepted and
even implemented and will support devolution of power as a means
to bring about a lasting political solution in Sri Lanka," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Our party however cannot agree to any process that will lead
to the division and dismemberment of the country," it added.
</P>
<P>
The UNP, which participated in the Parliamentary Select
Committee on Constitutional Reform, said it had made several
constructive proposals with a view to strengthening the democratic
process of the country.
</P>
<P>
The party proposed to set up an executive committee system at
regional level to bring about a qualitative change in the
functioning of devolved authorities.
</P>
<P>
Other proposals include the establishment of an independent
election commission, a police commission and a public service
commission.
</P>
<P>
The UNP statement was in response to the government's intention
to present the parliament with a white paper on constitutional
reforms, which contains proposals for the establishment of a Union
of Regions with more autonomy given to local authorities in view
of ending the country's ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
The conflict between the majority Sinhalese people and minority
Tamil people has been going on for 14 years. The Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) insists on having a state of their own in
the north and east. So far the bloody war has claimed 55,000 lives
and rendered many people homeless.
</P>
<P>
The support of the UNP is essential for the two-thirds majority
required for the passage of the new Constitution in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The UNP said that questions relating to the nature of the
state, land, police powers, finance and the unit of devolution
require further consideration.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed reservations regarding the composition of the
proposed Constitutional Council and its jurisdiction and powers.
</P>
<P>
The party insists that the constitutional reform must strictly
follow the procedure set out in the present Constitution, which
requires a two-thirds majority in the parliament and a referendum
for public approval.

<HEADLINE> Indian Paper Industry Faces Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Cheaper imports, high input
costs and sluggishness in domestic market hit the Indian paper
industry hard, local newspaper The Observer of Business and
Politics said here today.
</P>
<P>
Paper imports have witnessed a phenomenal rise during the last
three years due to cuts in import duties. "Import duty was cut
from 65 percent to 45 percent within a span of three months in
1993-94. Subsequently, it was sliced to 40 percent in March 1995
and then to 20 percent in May 1995," said K. G. Gopal Krishnan,
chairman of Indian Paper Maker Association.
</P>
<P>
India imported 200,000 tons of paper in 1996-97, 82 percent
more than the 110,000 tons in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to high energy costs, reduced availability of raw
materials has resulted in lower production and high input costs of
the paper industry.
</P>
<P>
In view of the future domestic demand for paper, most industry
observers say there is a need for a comprehensive action plan to
revive the industry.

<HEADLINE> Chinese VCD Player Producers Join Warranty Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Fierce market competition and a
short product life cycle have encouraged Chinese video compact
disk (VCD) player manufacturers to find ways of upgrading their
products and bettering their services, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Last week, 12 VCD producers took the lead to join the
nationwide warranty network, which is a major initiative by the
Ministry of Electronics Industry (MEI) to improve after-sale
service for VCD players.
</P>
<P>
Starting in November, about 500 out of the 3,044 household
electrical appliance maintenance centers on the network are
offering free repair to holders of the 12 VCD player brands, which
occupy 86 percent of national VCD player market, within one
year after the purchase.
</P>
<P>
"It is good news for both buyers and producers," said Wu
Zhengzhe, deputy general manager of Guangdong Idall Electrical
Appliance Co Ltd. "It will help elevate the standard of the product
as well as the services."
</P>
<P>
Chinese factories produced 220,000 VCD players in 1995 and 2.24
million in 1996. Sales were 65,000 in 1995 and 2.69 million in
1996. And 1997's sales are expected to rise to 10 million VCD
players, said MEI experts.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the popularity of VCD players in China to the
national craze of karaoke beginning years ago, the moderate
prices of VCD players and the high density of TV sets among the
population.
</P>
<P>
Prices have kept dropping since the end of last year. A VCD
player costs more than 5,000 yuan (602 U.S. dollars) when they
first appeared in China but less than 2,000 yuan (241
U.S. dollars) at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
This summer, all the VCD player makers were involved in a fresh
price war when Idall cut its prices by 25-30 percent, which help
regulate the market by forcing a number of small firms into
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Both the government and manufacturers have agreed that the only
way to improve competitiveness in the long run is to expand
production. improve technology, quality and services.
</P>
<P>
Digital video disk (DVD) players have a higher definition and
larger capacity, but prices are at least more than double that of
VCD players. So, industrial insiders believe that VCD players can
hold onto the market for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
The expanded production lines will not be a waste when VCD
players are replaced by DVD players because they can also be used
to assemble DVD players.
</P>
<P>
Foreign brands, including Panasonic, Samsung and Philips, took
up 30 percent of the Chinese market last year.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Outlet for CIS Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Tianjin airport, 120
kilometers from Beijing, has become the largest trade outlet for
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the airport accommodated 2,700 charter flights between
China and nations of the former Soviet Union carrying 110,000 tons
of freight, an increase of 28 percent and 110 percent
respectively over 1995.
</P>
<P>
China-made commodities worth more than 10 million yuan (1.204
million U.S. dollars) were shipped to the CIS in 1996, accounting
for more than 70 percent of the total Chinese goods going to CIS.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Binhai International Airport began charter service
for the CIS in 1992 when the Civil Aviation Administration of China
transferred the task to Tianjin to alleviate Beijing's heavy air
traffic burden.
</P>
<P>
To date, about 30 CIS airlines have signed cargo transport
agreements with the airport.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the growing business, the Tianjin Branch of Air
China has invested 6 million yuan in expanding the parking areas
and building warehouses.
</P>
<P>
"Traders buying commodities in China will not only help China
increase export, but also boost local economies," said Jiang
Guodong, general manager of Air China Tianjin Branch.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Panama and the United
States will start Wednesday talks for the setting up of the
Anti-Drugs Multilateral Center (ADMC) at the riversides of the
Canal of Panama, according to the government sources.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the Transfer Commission for the Canal said the

Under the joint plan, the ADMC will be a civil institution,
with a military body in charge of operating technological
equipment to detect airplanes flying in the isthmus area.
</P>
<P>
Oppositionists have warned that the anti-drug center would be a
hidden attempt of the U.S. government to maintain a covered
military presence in Panama as a strategic zone, passing over the
Torrijos-Carter Treaties.
</P>
<P>
The accords, subscribed by former U.S. President James Carter
and Panama's Omar Torrijos in 1997, state U.S. has until December
31, 1999, to withdraw its last soldier and to return the Canal to
Panama.

round of talks is intended to reach an accord on the Anti-Drug
Center in the near future.

<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Beijing C&AMP;W Electronics Group
Co. Ltd (C&AMP;W) was set up earlier this month, aiming to become
an important base for electronics and information technology in
China, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Formerly known as Beijing Wire Communication Plant, the
company merged with a Beijing eletroplating plant and then got
goverment approval to establish the large corporate group.
</P>
<P>
Last year, C&AMP;W reported 2.7 billion yuan (325 million US
dollars) in sales, with its products ranging from
program-controled exchanges, computer dispatchers, to power supply
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The company also engages in the development and production of
wireless telecommunications products, and large screen reflecting
projection systems.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, C&AMP;W has successfully launched seven joint
ventures with Siemens of Germany, Ericsson of Sweden, Matsushita
of Japan, Unisys and NCR of the United States, Hong Kong's 3C and Asian
Electroplating Equipment Co, soliciting foreign funds of 80
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sales from these joint ventures amounted to 2.1 billion yuan
(253 million US dollars) in 1996, making up the lion's share of
the company's total.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian President Blames Parliament for Economic Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine President Leonid Kuchma
stormed the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet with a strongly-worded
criticism during his address to the third congress of the
Federation of Ukrainian Trade Unions on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the three-day congress,
Kuchma warned that one of the major dangers looming over the
country is the fact that politicians are neglecting important
economic issues. He reprimanded parliament for putting economic
issues on hold, thereby delaying practical solutions to economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
"Most issues are now being considered from the view of the
forthcoming parliamentary elections," Kuchma complained.
</P>
<P>
He told the congress that he was forced to veto the Law on
Pension Reforms because its implementation would require funds
greater than the state budget itself.
</P>
<P>
"Parliamentary adoption of the law was an attempt to present me
and the government as enemies of the people," the president
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma also blamed the parliament for the slow pace of economic
reform.
</P>
<P>
To achieve successes in macro-economic policies, he said: "We
have yet to rid ourselves of the political battle between the
president and the parliament."
</P>
<P>
But he said it is unfair to deny success in certain areas of
economic development. He mentioned the slowdown of production
decline, the low inflation rate and the stabilization of the
national currency.

PANAMA CITY, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Women in Panama have a
lengthy life averaging 75 years, the National Center

The study, conducted by the National Center for Women, showed
that Panama was one of the Latin American countries where women
enjoyed the longest life expectancy. It showed significant
differences between men and women in nutritional habits.
</P>
<P>
Men liked more fatty food and never dieted. Such habits might
cause a gradual deterioration in health, and premature death.
</P>
<P>
The report said:"In turn, women have a more practical view of
health and a more active lifestyle than men do."
</P>

The Labor Ministry said care of health was a fundamental factor
for living the high quality life enjoyed by Panamanian
women.

<HEADLINE> Russia Worries About U.S. Laser Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian foreign ministry
spokesman Gennady Tarasov today expressed his country's increasing
worry about a recent test by the United States in which a laser
beam was aimed at a satellite.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov told a press conference that the test might trigger
an arms race in the anti-satellite field.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military fired a powerful chemical laser at an Air
Force satellite last Friday in a test to measure the vulnerability
of American satellites to laser attack, the U.S. Defense
Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was believed to be the first laser test against a
satellite. The U.S. Army has already test fired lasers at missiles
and other objects.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Secretary, William Cohen, on October 2
approved a plan to use the Mid-Infra-Red Advanced Chemical Laser
(Miracl) to illuminate the orbiting satellite which had exceeded
its useful lifetime.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov said the U.S. laser-developing plan would become the
first step to further develop anti-satellite weapons.
</P>
<P>
Russia had to carefully study U.S. research on the
anti-satellite system, and take it into account when defining its
security strategy, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Pentagon has repeatedly said the U.S. laser tests
against satellites would not violate any treaties and were not an
attempt to build a satellite killer weapon.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress to Consider Extending Immigration Statute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Illegal immigrants may
receive a two-week reprieve that will allow them to pay a
1,000-U.S. dollar fine and remain in the United States while
they apply for legal residence.
</P>
<P>
House Republican leaders agreed Tuesday to seek extension of an
immigration statute that expires Thursday. They must decide by
Wednesday whether to include the provision in a stopgap spending
bill Congress must pass this week to keep government operations
running.
</P>
<P>
An earlier stopgap spending bill, which expires Thursday,
included an extension of the immigration provision that raised 214
million dollars for the country's immigration service last year.
</P>
<P>
Opponents contend the statute fosters illegal immigration and
improperly rewards people who broke the law by overstaying their
visas or entered the country illegally. They also say the measure
penalizes people who apply for visas overseas and often wait years
for permission to come here.
</P>
<P>
But supporters say the provision benefits only those already in
a position to secure their green card. It also pumps much-needed
revenue into the coffers of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
The statute does not apply to the nation's undocumented
population of more than five million. It is targeted at those who
are eligible for legal residence, either because they're already
in line for visas or are spouses or minor children of a
U.S. citizen. Parents of adult children who are U.S. citizens can
also apply.
</P>
<P>
The Senate has approved a permanent extension, but that
approval, which was not matched on the House side, is included in
an appropriations bill that has yet to be finalized.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration for
Industry and Commerce investigated and acted on 169,700 cases of
economic law violation in the first half of the year, reported
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The cases involved a total value of 3.4 billion yuan (409.63
million US dollars), a growth of 14 percent over the same period
last year, a report released by the administration stated
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 510 million yuan (61.44 million US dollars) was
confiscated from or levied in fines against the violators, an
increase of 4 percent, the report stated.
</P>
<P>
It said 7,363 of the cases were serious ones, with each case
resulting in more than 10,000 yuan (1,204 US dollar) in illegal
earnings.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the reported violations involved
individuals, private businesses and collectively owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of local statistics showed that one-third of the
cases in the first six months concerned piracy.
</P>
<P>
Together with local administrations for industry and commerce,
the State administration investigated 30,534 cases of making and
marketing counterfeit products in the first six months this

BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China has established a
national standard to ensure the safety and service quality of its
booming amusement park industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the standards which became effective on Oct. 1,
the purchase, repair and use of all facilities in the amusement
parks should meet state stipulations. A quality certificate issued

<HEADLINE> Prices of Ecuadoran Oil Go Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Prices of Ecuadoran oil in the
international markets rose to 14, 15 and 16 dollars per barrel over
the last two weeks, the state-owned company Petroecuador said
today.
</P>
<P>
Petroecuador said at a study the best price achieved was 16
dollars per barrel by September 30. Since then, the price has
located at 16.042 dollars.
</P>
<P>
That price was for the west coast of the United States, the
first exportation target for Ecuador's oil.
</P>
<P>
As to U.S. east coast, prices kept in 16 and 17 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadoran oil reached its highest price of the year on
October 6, when it hit 17.599 dollars per barrel of raw oil.
</P>
<P>
Petroecuador authorities are optimistic that surges will keep
for a long term, saying oil prices may not vary much for the
second half of the year due to an expected irregular demand from
developed countries.

<P>
XI'AN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province, an inland area
in northwest China, will invest 10 billion yuan in key
infrastructure projects through 2000.
</P>
<P>
Seven of every 100 residents in Shaanxi should have access to
telephones in the next three years, 2.5 times the 1995 figure. The
number of long-distance lines should rise to 80,000, 1.5 times
the 1995 figure, said Governor Cheng Andong.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to expand the existing airports at Hanzhong
and Yulin and open an air route from Xi'An to Beijing. The
province expects to handle 6 million passengers by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The province's rich coal resources will be used to fuel large
power plants in the Shenfu coal-field and to develop
hydro-electric resources on the Hanjiang and Yellow rivers.
</P>
<P>
The projects are expected to double the generating capacity of
Shaanxi by the year 2000, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
These projects should improve the investment climate in the
province and lead to major economic gains, Cheng said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Balance of Payments Deficit on Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' balance of
payments (BOP) deficit decreased anew to 1.2 billion U.S. dollars
as of end-September from a deficit of 1.7 billion dollars posted
as of end-August this year, a local newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The latest BOP deficit level was significantly better than the
revised deficit target of 2.5 billion dollars for the period, the
Business Daily said, citing data released by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months, the net international reserves (NIR)
level reached 8.8 billion dollars, much higher than the targeted
NIR of 7.5 billion dollars for the period.
</P>
<P>
Due to the current currency crisis plaguing the country, the
central bank completely reversed its BOP projection for the whole
1997 from a surplus of 2.9 billion dollars to a deficit of 2
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country's BOP deficit, which surged to a high of 2.4
billion dollars as of end-July, has been shrinking since August
due to a narrowing trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
The central bank hopes to further trim down the BOP deficit by
the end of this year as overseas Filipino workers send billions of
foreign exchange remittances home for the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
The NIR is the central bank's gross foreign exchange holdings
less its short-term foreign exchange liabilities.
</P>
<P>
The BOP, a system of accounts that covers a particular period
and records the flow of real resources between a country and the
rest of the world, is estimated based on a change in the NIR.

<HEADLINE> 6 killed in Costa Rica Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A Cessna plane crashed Monday
night in Costa Rica, killing all six people on board including
five Danish citizens, the civil air authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The five Danish were identified as Godan, Len and Ana

The accident occurred near the Platanar volcano, 80 kilometers
from San Jose`s airport, where the plane was about to land.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Private Capital Flows to Asia Expected to Rise: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Private capital flows to Asian
developing countries have surged in the past 10 years and such a
trend is expected to continue in the coming decade, according to a
report released by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) here today.
</P>
<P>
The report, "Trends in Private Capital Flows to Asian
Developing Countries," was presented to a two-day ADB Workshop on
Asian Economic Outlook, which will end here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The report said that net capital flows into the Asian
developing countries have surged since 1987, from 23 billion U.S.
dollars in that year to 150 billion dollars in 1996, and the surge
is due entirely to sharp increases in net private capital flows.
</P>
<P>
"In 1987, the level of both private and official flows (to the
Asian developing countries) stood at around 14 billion dollars,
but by 1996 private flows had reached 136 billion dollars, or 5.2
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) (of the Asian developing
countries) while official capital flows stagnated at roughly the
1986 level," it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the share of private flows to the Asian
developing countries has also increased, compared to that of other
developing sub-regions, from about 40 percent of the total in 1991
to 54 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid growth and changing composition of private capital
flows reflect the increasing financial integration of the Asian
developing countries with international markets," it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that there is every indication that financial
integration of the Asian developing countries is expected to
broaden and deepen over the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
"Gross private flows are expected to rise significantly, with
capital flowing not only from industrial countries to the Asian
developing countries, but, increasingly, among the Asian
developing countries themselves, and from the Asian developing
countries to industrial countries," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"In the short to medium term," it said," the Asian developing
countries, in aggregate, are likely to receive increased amounts
of net private flows and these flows will cover a wider spectrum
of countries."
</P>
<P>
The report said that new policy reforms by Asian countries, the
demographic shift underway in industrial countries and innovation
and technological change in the world, which will make
policy-induced barriers less effective, will promote private
capital flows to the Asian developing countries in the coming
decade.

<HEADLINE> North China May Have Mild Winter This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Following 11 years of warmer
winters, North China may experience another one in the months
ahead as the mercury has so far stood at higher temperatures than usual
this autumn, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, the mercury rose one to three degrees
Centigrade higher than it was during the corresponding period in
previous years in most parts of North and Northeast China's
provinces, a phenomenon rarely seen in autumn, weathermen said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Beijing's mercury reached 29.2 degrees Centigrade,
which was the highest recorded in the same period since 1940 and
uncommon for the city, which usually enjoys cool autumn days,
weathermen at the Beijing and the State meteorological
observatories confirmed yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Such highter temperatures are expected to end today, with the
invasion of a strong cold air front from West Siberia. The front
is expected to push the mercury down as much as 12 degrees
Centigrade throughout the north in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
This kind of sudden weather change is a reminder that the world
is experiencing the worst El Nino since the 1982-83 year,
weathermen said. El Nino is an unusual rise in sea surface
temperatures in the South Pacific that can often be blamed for
disasters such as floods and droughts in many areas.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to say whether such drastic weather changes in
China are directly related to the year's El Nino, which is
affecting the world's general air circulation at the moment," said
Zhao Zhenguo, director of the Department of Climate Prediction
under the Beijing-based State Climate Center.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Stocks rallied on Wall Street
today as last week's disappointing profit data were quickly
reversed by some strong reports from IBM, Microsoft, Citicorp and
Chase Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 139.00 to 8,060.44.
Combined with Monday's 74-point gain, that was more than enough to
wipe out last week's 200-point drop.
</P>
<P>
Broader indicators also repaired all or most of the remaining
damage from last week's downturn.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index jumped 27.09 to 1,712.54, led by
Microsoft, which rose 6 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by more than a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled a heavy 581.77
million shares, up sharply from Monday's sluggish pace.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 16.67 to 972.28,
slightly more than 10 points from record terrain; and the NYSE
composite index rose 7.93 to 510.19, just 4 points away from new
highs.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.08 to 458.93,
and the small-company dominated American Stock Exchange composite
index rose 5.78 to 712.36.
</P>
<P>
IBM, which reported a 6 percent increase in its third-quarter
profits, surged more than 7 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Dow also drew a boost from its financial services issues,
which rallied after some healthy third-quarter showings by
Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, and Wells Fargo.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: NATO Expansion Costs Over-estimated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Defense Secretary of State
William Cohen today told a congressional panel that the United
States may have over-estimated the costs of expanding the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"Based on what we know now, I believe that the NATO cost
estimates will be lower than those which you receive from us in
February," Cohen told a hearing by the Senate Appropriations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The hearing, at which Secretary of State also testified, was
designed to probe the costs to American taxpayers of admitting the
three new members next year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration in February estimated that the cost of
the alliance enlargement over the next ten years would be 27 to 35
billion U.S. dollars, of which the U.S. would have to pay 1.5
billion to two billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said NATO allies were working on new estimates in
preparation for a North Atlantic Council meeting in Brussels,
Belgium, in December and the new figures would be given to
Congress before a vote next year.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he said, the initial cost estimates were based
on taking in four new members, not three.
</P>
<P>
Albright offered a similar assurance, but she said "we will not
shortchange NATO's effectiveness" and that "the deciding factor
will be bang not buck."
</P>
<P>
The senators are concerned about the costs and have told the
administration it must first strike a cost-sharing deal with the
allies.
</P>
<P>
"The cost of enlargement must be balanced against the cost of
not enlarging. If we fail to seize this historic opportunity to
help integrate, consolidate and stabilize Central and Eastern
Europe, we may pay a much higher price later," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Hearing, the senators also expressed their
concern about the consequences of the expansion, for instance, it
may arouse threat from Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The debate is just beginning," Senator Patrick Leahy advised
the two Clinton administration officials. He said he was undecided
on whether to vote to approve adding the three countries.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member NATO leaders agreed to accept Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic as new members by 1999. The agreement needs to
be approved by a two-thirds majority of the Senate.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Credit for Ghana's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
approved a credit of some 35 million U.S. dollars equivalent to
Ghana's health sector program support project.
</P>
<P>
The project will improve the health and nutrition of Ghanaians,
particularly the poor, through a health reform program.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to improve access, quality and
efficiency of primary health service, strengthen and reorient
service delivery to support primary health services and develop a
program to train adequate numbers of new health teams.
</P>
<P>
It is also aimed to strengthen national support systems for
human resources, logistics and supplies, financial management and
health information, as well as promote private sector involvement
in the delivery of health services.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be channeled through the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary
lending arm for developing countries.

<HEADLINE> China to Buy U.S. Phosphate Fertilizer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 21 (Xinhua) --Chinese and American
fertilizer companies signed here today an agreement under which
China will buy another half a million metric tons of phosphate
fertilizer from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, valued more than 100 million US dollars, was
signed by Steve Hoffman, senior vice president of the Phosphate
Chemicals Export Association(Phosphate), and Shi Xiaoyan,
executive vice president of the China National Chemicals Import
and Export Corporation (Sinochem), on the third day of a
purchasing tour by a high-ranking Chinese trade and economic
cooperation delegation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Shi described the agreement
as another example of successful cooperation between the two
countries. She thanked her American partners for their efforts to
ensure the extension of the most-favored-nation status for China.
</P>
<P>
She told those present at the ceremony that China, the largest
importer of fertilizer in the world, buys some three million
metric tons of phosphate fertilizer, or 80 percent of its needs,
from the United States annually.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Hoffman said leading members in his association will
continue to strengthen friendly relationship with Sinochem not
only as a supplier but also as a partner in increasing the
productivity of China's growing agricultural community.
</P>
<P>
"We have been privileged to work with the people of Sinochem
for several years, seeking the possibility of launching a joint
venture to produce phosphate fertilizer in southern China," he
told Zeng Paiyan, the head of the Chinese delegation who attended
the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The fertilizer agreement is the second of the six contracts to
be signed this month between the Chinese delegation and U.S.
companies.
</P>
<P>
The first agreement was signed Monday between Atlantic
Richfield Corp. and the China National Offshore Oil Company. The
delegation left here this morning for New York.

<HEADLINE> MasterCard Pushes Secured Electronic Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The MasterCard International
announced today that it has made all the necessary preparation for
the secured global electronic commercialization, which is expected
to be conducted mainly on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of MasterCard's Electronic Commerce Advisory
Group here today, representatives of more than 30 MasterCard
member financial institutions from around the world introduced
their progress in the card-based electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
MasterCard, one of the leading credit card issuers in the
world, completed the first Secure Electronic Transaction (SET)
deal in Denmark in late 1996. It has completed or is currently
executing SET pilot programs worldwide to meet the demand for a
"reliable, safe and convenient way" to buy and sell on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
SET is a kind of software and protocol released in June by
major industry players, including Microsoft and IBM for Internet
commerce. It is believed to provide more secured means for online
participants in electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
"Today, electronic commerce is poised to go mainstream," said
Steve Mott, an executive of MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that European countries are taking the lead
in electronic bill payments. Consumers are using much fewer
checks than Americans.
</P>
<P>
But countries like Mexico and South Africa have also made big
strides in pushing electronic commerce over Internet, according
to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
MasterCard says it is now creating a global, commercially
viable network of merchants, financial institutions and
cardholders to promote the project. It also pays greater
attention to the Asian market.
</P>
<P>
China proved to be its second largest market except the U.S.,
according to Margaret O'Connor, an executive from the company's
International Communications Department. She said MasterCard entered
the Chinese market in 1986. There are now 15 million card holders
in China, who made transactions equivalent to 35 billion U.S.
dollars during the first half this year, she said.
</P>
<P>
MasterCard has 400 million credit and debit cards that are
accepted at more than 14 million merchant, cash and ATM
locations worldwide. In 1996, its gross U.S. dollar volume
generated exceeded 550 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company is also introducing other means of payment using
chip-embedded "Smart cards", which is said to be able to store 80
times more information than a card with a magnetic stripe.

<HEADLINE> German Opposition Party Sets Out Election Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Under the motto of "innovation and
"justice", Germany's main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD)
today set out an election agenda, pledging to bring about a "new
start" in Germany if it wins the general elections in September
next year.
</P>
<P>
Job creation, economic and social modernization and more social
justice would be the guidelines of a SPD government, said SPD
leader Oskar Lafontaine at a party congress today in the western
German city of Dortmund.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was the SPD which had the right remedy to
combat the record-high unemployment of Germany, which stood at
about 4.5 million at present.
</P>
<P>
If being elected next year, a SPD government would first of all
put forward an urgent job-creation program to help the hardest-hit
young people, Lafontaine said.
</P>
<P>
He also set a target to double Germany's investment in research
and education within five years.
</P>
<P>
After losing the last four elections to German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, the SPD is
now eager to come back to power next year.
</P>
<P>
However, the SPD has still to make a choice between two rival
chancellor candidates: Lafontaine and Lower Saxony state premier
Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who has been in office for 15 years, already announced
that he would seek an unprecedented fifth term.

<HEADLINE> Greece Condemns U.S. Official's Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday condemned U.S.
State Department spokesman James Rubin for his remarks regarding
the harassment by Turkish warplanes of the aircraft carrying Greek
Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos to and from Cyprus last week.
</P>
<P>
Rubin reportedly said Monday that the Greek minister's flight
to Cyprus for military exercises was "an overflight that violated
an agreed upon Moratorium".
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department said later Monday that Washington had
no confirmation of the incident from an independent source and the
information it had seen was particularly alarming.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas described Rubin's
statements as "unacceptable", saying that such statements ignored
or distorted true facts.
</P>
<P>
"It is not permissible for the existing facts and evidence to
be disregarded or hushed up for reasons of expediency," he added.
</P>
<P>
Reppas regarded the second statement by the U.S. State
Department as "an about-turn" which made amends for Rubin's
initial statements.
</P>
<P>
There were many who would perhaps like to exert pressure on
Greece regarding this matter, but the Greek government had no
intention of changing its orientation because of any kind of
pressure whatsoever, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tsohatzopoulos also criticized Rubin's statements,
saying that the credibility of the United States was diminished
with respect to its desire to take the lead in initiatives of
resolving the Cyprus problems and relations between Greece and
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Head of State Visits Gambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian head of state, General
Sani Abacha today paid a one-day official visit to Gambia, the
official News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said Abacha was received at the Banul airport by
Gambia President Yahya Jammeh. The two leaders then went straight
into talks.
</P>
<P>
A large delegation was accompanying Abacha on his visit,
including Nigeria's Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Gambia officials were quoted as saying that the two leaders
would talk on bilateral issues as well as the crisis in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
Abacha's visit to Gambia came a day before the expected talks
between the Sierra Leonean military regime and the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Conakry, capital of
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
As Abacha is the current chairman of the ECOWAS, Nigeria is
also playing a major role in the sub-regional effort to restore
the elected government of President Ahemd Tejan Kabbah, who was
overthrown in the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow's talk would be the second between Freetown and
ECOWAS. The first broke down in July after Major Johnny Kromah
announced that his regime is ready to quit before the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the ECOWAS has imposed sanctions on Freetown and
succeeded in convincing the United Nations to do the same.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urges Israel to Abide by Peace Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela today urged Israel to implement the agreements it signed
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who arrived here Monday evening for a three-day visit,
has held two round of talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on the Mideast peace process, African issues and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Middle East News Agency,
Mandela expressed his country's support for the Middle East peace
process, saying that all nations have the right to struggle for
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
"Peace will never come about unless the legitimate aspirations
of the Palestinians are realized, particularly those concerning
their right of self-determination," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Israel to respect the Oslo peace accords signed
four years ago and the land-for-peace formula as the basis for the
Mideast peace process, adding Africa supports the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that his current tour of north Africa, which also
covers Libya, Tunisia and Morocco, highlights talks on trade and
military cooperation, and the recent development of the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
During the apartheid rule that ended in 1994, South Africa
remained isolated from the Arab world and maintained strong links
with Arab's traditional rival Israel.

<HEADLINE> Leading U.S. Senator Views IRA as Terrorist Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army
(IRA) and its political ally, Sinn Fein, should be designated
terrorist organizations if the IRA breaks the current cease-fire
in Northern Ireland, a leading U.S. senator said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Jesse Helms, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, expressed "disappointment" over the State Department's
omission of the IRA from its list of foreign terrorist groups
published October 8.
</P>
<P>
The IRA had carried out 17 terrorist attacks in the past six
years alone, Helms said in a letter to President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In July, the IRA announced a cease-fire in its campaign to end
British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the majority Protestant
province with the overwhelming Roman Catholic Irish Republic to
the south.
</P>
<P>
Then the British government allowed the IRA's political wing
Sinn Fein to rejoin multiparty peace talks on the future of the
British province.
</P>
<P>
Helms indicated that the State Department still considers the
British capital to be a "medium-threat post" for U.S. diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a document issued by the U.S. Embassy in London, the
senator said that despite the IRA's cease-fire declaration, "the
danger of sustaining collateral damage or injury by being in the
vicinity of a bombing remains a risk."
</P>
<P>
"I hope, Mr. President, that you agree that any organization
that poses a threat to U.S. diplomats and citizens abroad is by
definition a terrorist organization," Helms said.
