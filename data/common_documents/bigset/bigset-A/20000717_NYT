EVERETT POWERS RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With time to kill, Carl Everett Sunday sampled a
pregame film, ``The Edge.'' The one in which Anthony Hopkins's
character, warring with a growling grizzly, spews the same
obscenities Everett fired at home plate umpire Ronald Kulpa
Saturday in the head-knocking tirade that put him on a fast track
to a probable suspension.
</P>
<P>
   But once he left the clubhouse, Everett kept his thoughts to
himself and showed with his bat and glove against the Montreal
Expos how much the Red Sox could miss their premier slugger if he
lands in baseball's penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   The newly tight-lipped Everett, who would speak publicly only
through a team spokesman, hit a two-run, sixth-inning homer to give
starter Tim Wakefield a 5-2 lead, which held up for Boston's third
victory in four games since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Everett also walked and scored in the second inning, doubled to
spur a run-scoring rally in the fourth, and raced to the warning
track in the third for a sliding, inning-ending catch that robbed
Geoff Blum of an extra-base hit and saved a run.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was Everett's 25th. But the chorus of boos he
received during introductions were a first. And he apparently was
pleased that his work in the field quieted the fallout from his
extracurricular outburst the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans here in Boston, they appreciate playing hard,'' he
said through a spokesman. ``That's all I do. I'm out there to cut
down runs as well as score runs. That's how the fans have responded
all year. They enjoy the way I play the game. I appreciate them as
much as they appreciate me.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett answered only one other question that he agreed to field
from reporters through the intermediary. Asked whether Saturday's
violent outburst had marred his concentration, he said,
``Obviously, I had no problems with my concentration,'' referring
to his homer, double, and two walks in four plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Wakefield (6-5) suffer a concentration deficiency, as he
unhinged Montreal hitters for seven innings with his knuckleball.
He scattered four hits and allowed only one earned run to win his
fourth consecutive start since his emergency entry into the
rotation last month.
</P>
<P>
   The only other Sox starter to win four straight this year is
Pedro Martinez, who was asked if Wakefield should be dubbed ``Pedro
Wakefield.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Martinez, a two-time Cy Young Award winner. ``Call
him Cy Wakefield.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Expo to overpower Wakefield was the gifted slugger,
Vladimir Guerrero, who sent a knuckleball towering over the Green
Monster in the third. It was the only earned run Wakefield yielded.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Wakefield faced few obstacles in ensuring the Expos
remained 0-for-Fenway. Montreal has not won in four tries here in
interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal scored its only other run after Nomar Garciaparra
fielded a two-out grounder by Terry Jones in the second inning and
made an errant throw that pulled Brian Daubach off first. Jones
stole second and scored on a single by catcher Lenny Webster, who
entered the game hitting .157 (.100 on the road).
</P>
<P>
   Before he left in the seventh, Wakefield struck out two and
retired 13 others on grounders.
</P>
<P>
   He fared better than Montreal's starter, righthander Mike
Johnson (4-4), who was called up from Triple A Ottawa in May to
fill Hideki Irabu's spot in the rotation after Irabu was sidelined
by knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Everett keyed a Red Sox rally in the second by drawing a one-out
walk. He scored from first on a Jason Varitek double down the
right-field line.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Daubach singled, moved to third on Everett's
line-drive double off the left-field scoreboard, and scored on Troy
O'Leary's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox took a 3-2 lead in the fifth without Everett's help.
Manny Alexander singled, took second on Darren Lewis's sacrifice
bunt, and scored on Morgan Burkhart's two-out single to right.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Everett again in the sixth. After Garciaparra reached
on a one-out walk, Everett sent Johnson's next pitch beyond the
Sox' bullpen for the 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl just went out there and played his game,'' Garciaparra
said. ``Whatever happened yesterday happened. He didn't come in
here and worry about it. He just went out and did the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett had no interaction with Kulpa, who was stationed at
third. And he had no beef with plate umpire Randy Marsh, who had
said before the game that he planned to warn Everett about staying
within the boundaries of the batter's box if Everett was ``too
extreme'' in his stance.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dispute over Everett straddling the line of the
batter's box that ignited his outburst Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the switch-hitting Everett, who batted righthanded Saturday,
batted from the other side against Johnson. His lefthanded stance
is markedly different and does not place his foot as far across the
line as his righthanded stance does.
</P>
<P>
   But even when he batted righthanded in his last at-bat, adopting
the same stance he used when he drew a warning from Kulpa, Everett
was not warned by Marsh.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams and Everett's teammates appeared pleased
that Everett's focus had returned to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a big game for us,'' said Williams, who was
particularly impressed by Everett's sliding, run-saving catch.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield expressed similar admiration. ``I'm not surprised,''
he said of Everett's post-tirade performance. ``He's a great
ballplayer, and the thing that happened yesterday is yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, though, Everett could learn how long he might not be
playing ball for the Red Sox.

FINE EFFORT SHOULDN'T QUIET CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY

<P>
   BOSTON _ A small percentage of the fans at Fenway Park booed
Carl Everett the first time his name was announced over the public
address system Sunday, but the reception for Everett got better as
the game played on. When he made a nice catch in center field to
end the top of the third, fans behind the dugout stood and cheered
as he came off the field. Then he ripped one off the wall in left.
Then he hit a 413-foot homer to right-center and it sounded like
Larry Bird had just been introduced. Another homer no doubt would
have produced a curtain call. Is there still time to name the New
Fenway ``Carl Everett Field''?
</P>
<P>
   It was a different scene 24 hours earlier when fans behind the
same dugout covered the ears of children and worried what might
happen next as a crazed Everett swore at his teammates, bashed
coolers, and tossed a bat.
</P>
<P>
   Everett will be suspended in the next couple of days. It's
inevitable because he clearly bumped, then head-butted umpire
Ronald Kulpa before turning his rage on those who were trying to
prevent him from possibly ending his career by doing something even
more stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it's apparent that the folks in charge at Friendly
Fenway will continue to let Everett do as he pleases as long as he
keeps producing like he has so far (.327, 25 homers, 71 RBIs).
Regarding Everett's occasional outbursts and penchant for
tardiness, manager Jimy Williams says, ``We'll handle it
in-house.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: The Sox are afraid of Jurassic Carl. He's a
wonderful talent, so just leave him alone and hope the next
explosion isn't directed at a teammate, umpire, or law officer.
</P>
<P>
   Williams clearly has no intention of getting into another George
Bell situation (when he managed in Toronto, Williams tried to
sanction Bell, but was not backed by the front office). And general
manager Dan Duquette isn't about to find fault with this
multitalent who's on board for three years, plus a club option for
a fourth, to the tune of $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the dugout before Sunday's 5-2 victory over the Expos,
Williams took a few questions regarding Saturday's episode, but
dismissed it as Everett ``just being competitive out there.'' Then
he said, ``Anything else about the game? Not about Everett.''
</P>
<P>
   Master of the obtuse, Williams is good at dodging things he
doesn't want to discuss. This is why we'll never know for sure if
Duquette walked into the manager's office after Friday night's game
and said, ``Play Izzy (Israel Alcantara) or we fire you.''
</P>
<P>
   But his being ``competitive'' is no explanation for what Everett
did Saturday. Pressed on the point, Williams said, ``I was talking
about when he was telling the ump where he wanted to stand. As for
after, we're basically all responsible for what we say and do.
Hopefully, things will work out.''
</P>
<P>
   And Everett's behavior in your own dugout was OK with you, Jimy?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out there with the umpire,'' he said. ``By the time I got
back he was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Duquette, no one from the club spoke with Everett
Saturday or early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy indicated he'll handle it in-house,'' said Duquette.
``The league will take action against Everett. Carl is a very
intense competitor and he's done an excelllent job so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he believes Everett has a problem managing his anger,
the GM twice issued non-answers. Duquette said he was aware the
outfielder had a volatile temper when he made the trade to acquire
Everett. He said he thought Red Sox fans would support Everett, but
admitted, ``I would hope this type of behavior would be a one-time
incident.''
</P>
<P>
   If Everett chooses to apologize to Bret Saberhagen, Tommy
Harper, Wendell Kim, Jose Offerman, and other teammates he
manhandled and swore at, that's certainly team business. We know he
apologized to Sox publicist Glenn Wilburn after verbally abusing
him in Chicago two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But doesn't Boston management _ ever proud of Friendly Fenway _
think Everett owes fans an apology for losing his cool, offending
paying customers with his obscenity-laced tirade, shaming the
organization on national television, and taking himself out of the
divisional race at a crucial juncture?
</P>
<P>
   We all have bad days. We all have tempers. Why won't the ball
club speak to Everett's post-bump tirade, which should have
embarrassed everyone associated with the organization? Sox CEO John
Harrington witnessed Saturday's eruption. Is anything OK if you can
hit a home run the next day?
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Everett went 2 for 2 with two walks, two RBIs, and two
runs scored. He opted not to speak to the media and had the PR
department release his comments regarding the ballgame: ``The fans
here in Boston, they appreciate that I play hard. That's all I ever
do. That's how they've responded all year. They appreciate the way
I play the game and I appreciate them as much as they appreciate
me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd talk about Saturday's events down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Good. Let's all leave him alone, watch him play, and hope it
doesn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Wow. Watch that homer go clear over the Red Sox bullpen! What a
shot! Oh, and there's Carl pointing to the heavens again! Yahoo!

WORD ON SUSPENSION COULD COME TUESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-EVERETT-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Hall of Famer Frank Robinson, the man in charge of
discipline for on-field infractions in major league baseball,
levied a five-game suspension on Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez May
3, he announced his decision on the third day after Martinez hit
Cleveland's Robbie Alomar with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   If he adheres to the same timetable, Robinson will have an
announcement Tuesday regarding Red Sox outfielder Carl Everett, who
twice bumped umpire Ronald Kulpa after his ejection Saturday and is
expected to receive a suspension at least as severe as the one
given Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he's not too hard on Carl,'' Martinez said Sunday,
``because that will make it harder on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dan Duquette implied the Sox would take no
additional action against Everett, who hit a home run and a double
and walked twice in Sunday's 5-2 win over Montreal. ``That will be
addressed in-house by Jimy Williams,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, meanwhile, said Sunday he had not spoken with Everett
about the incident. ``He was at the family cookout after
(Saturday's) game,'' Williams said. ``I didn't see a reason to talk
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams characterized Everett's behavior as ``just being a
competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said he had not spoken to major league officials
Sunday, but essentially conceded the team assumes Everett will be
suspended. Everett would not answer questions from reporters
Sunday, agreeing only to answer questions about the game relayed to
him by team publicist Kevin Shea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know from past experience that whenever there is physical
contact on the field, it usually results in a suspension for the
player or manager,'' Duquette said. ``I would expect we would hear
in the next couple of days, after they've had a chance to review
the tape and read the umpires' report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league is very specific. They do not sanction physical
contact and generally when there is physical contact, it results in
a suspension.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette was asked whether he believed there were anger or
behavioral issues that needed to be addressed by the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the league (i.e., the commissioner's office) will make
its position very clear,'' Duquette said. ``The Red Sox
organization does not condone behavior that results in physical
contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was disappointed that Everett would jeopardize his
availability to the team by his behavior, Duquette said: ``Carl is
a very intense competitor. He's done an excellent job for us so far
and I anticipate he'll be able to return and continue to be a
productive player for us. I would hope this behavior is a one-time
incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of a quirk in scheduling, the umpiring crew that worked
Saturday's game in Fenway Park was here again Sunday. Crew chief
Randy Marsh, who agreed to speak with reporters Sunday, said that
the umpires' report on the incident with Everett was faxed to the
commissioner's office and was in Robinson's hands by Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh stressed that contrary to the suspicions of Williams, no
one from the Mets had contacted the umpires before Saturday's game
asking them to make an issue of whether Everett was standing too
close to home plate. Rule 6:03 of the Official Rules of Baseball
stipulates: ``The batter's legal position shall be with both feet
within the batter's box.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Case Book of the Official Playing Rules Committee, which
is incorporated into the handbooks used by major league umpires, it
further states: ``Umpires are directed to keep the batter within
the box when he bats, particularly not to allow a hitter to stand
so close to the plate that he is out of the batter's box. No part
of the batter's foot is to be closer than 6 inches from the side of
home plate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard where they said this was a setup deal,'' Marsh
said, addressing Williams's allegations that ``it had to be the
opposing team who called the umpires.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one from the Mets said anything to us before the game,''
Marsh said. ``No one came to our dressing room and said anything
about him being outside the line. If anything, the person that came
to our dressing room and said something about somebody doing
something wrong was Jimy Williams the night before. The Mets never
came to me. No phone call, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that was generated the night before was when
(Mets pitcher Dennis) Cook hit (Everett). He'd complained that he
was standing inside.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marsh also contradicted the claim made by Mets catcher Mike
Piazza that he ``didn't say a thing'' to Kulpa when Everett came to
bat for the first time Saturday. Marsh said that after the first
pitch from Mike Hampton, Piazza raised the issue of where Everett
was standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, Piazza looked at the line and said, `C'mon, what's
the deal? The guy's inside,' '' Marsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh, who umpired his first major league game in 1981 and
became a regular member of the National League staff the following
year, said he could not recall ever dealing with a dispute about a
batter standing too close to home plate. Usually, issues about
whether a hitter is in the batter's box revolve around whether a
player's foot is outside the back line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unusual,'' Marsh said. ``Not many people could hit
like that. Obviously, Carl feels very comfortable in that position.
It's his right to get as close as he can, but there are parameters.
People always want to take things to an extreme. You've got to draw
the line somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsh was behind the plate Sunday, when the issue did not arise.
</P>
<P>
   Williams acknowledged after Sunday's game that he had gone to
the umpires' room before Friday's game with a baseball thrown by
Cook, to support his contention that Cook was raising the seams of
the ball with his thumbnail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy Williams asked us to check the ball,'' Marsh said,
explaining the umpires' actions in inspecting baseballs used by
Cook Friday night. ``We checked the ball. The times we checked the
ball, there was nothing wrong with the ball. But it was within the
parameters of our job, something we had to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, when we came to this (Everett's stance), they (Mets) were
trying to throw it back at them (Red Sox), obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice during Everett's at-bat Saturday, Kulpa marked a line with
his foot to indicate where Everett needed to stand. The first time,
Everett erased it with his own foot. The second time, he said
something to Kulpa that resulted in his ejection, and subsequently
he erupted in anger, twice making contact with the umpire, the
second time with a head-butt.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday's game, Williams suggested it was an open question
about who initiated the contact, even though television replays
seemed to leave no doubt that Everett was the aggressor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly looked to me like somebody bumped somebody there
yesterday _ the umpire bumped him or he certainly bumped the
umpire,'' Williams said. ``It depends how you want to look at it. I
guess it depends which body was going forward, which body might
have been going backwards. If, in fact, there was any role-playing
or play-acting there, I don't know. The umpire (Kulpa) went back.''
</P>
<P>
   In their report, Marsh said, Kulpa alleged that Everett made
contact with him twice. Marsh denied that Kulpa was ``acting'' when
he was hit in the face the second time by Everett, causing his head
to snap back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a mark on his forehead,'' Marsh said. ``We did have him
check it after the game. We had them put some ice on it after the
game. He definitely was poked pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett did not leave the field for nearly four minutes after
his ejection. Sox base coaches Tommy Harper and Wendell Kim, along
with players Jose Offerman and Troy O'Leary, struggled to restrain
Everett, who yelled at Offerman, then was seen speaking sharply to
teammate Bret Saberhagen in the dugout before narrowly missing him
in the face with a baseball bat he flung onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh said he did not fear for Kulpa's safety while Everett was
raging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the Boston organization had everything under
control,'' Marsh said. ``The Boston coaches were trying to keep
everything under control. They were doing their best to get Carl to
go ahead and get off the field. They were doing everything they
possibly could. I think (Kulpa's safety) was something to be aware
of, but I think the Boston organization handled it.''

VAN DE VELDE HASN'T LOST GRIP 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-VAN DE VELDE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With every decision and every swing of the golf club, the
heartwarming summer tale was sent spiraling, from comical to
ghastly to unthinkable. The Frenchman with the infectious charm had
taken us to the edge of wonder at last summer's British Open, but
with one hand on the Claret Jug, he stood in something called the
Barry Burn, his pant legs rolled to his knees, his golf ball
immersed in water.
</P>
<P>
   The joy ride was about to end in a horrific crash and Jean Van
de Velde couldn't stop it. Surely, he was going to be scarred
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, you jest, because in
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde's world, the sun was out the day after that debacle
at Carnoustie had cost him a piece of history. He was in Mont de
Marsan, his birthplace in the south of France, and childhood
friends were at the cafe table. They all knew about the triple
bogey, the playoff loss, and the dizzying set of golf swings that
had made Van de Velde an easy target of ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   But they also knew something else _ that Van de Velde was
stronger than all those who did not have to swing the clubs that
fateful Sunday, people who only had to hide behind microphones and
notebooks and not tackle the impossible monster that was
Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had all my friends around and it was huge. It was big,''
said Van de Velde. ``I was very tired, very drained. I was very
happy, but very disappointed not to have won it.''
</P>
<P>
   The critics, Van de Velde knew, were having a field day, but
c'est la vie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones who are going to be supportive to you are the ones
who are close to you,'' he said. ``They're the ones who are there
for the bad times, which are the ones that count. The good times
don't count, you know. What about when things are going bad? Who's
around?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jean Van de Velde walked out of the shadows of anonymity and
into golf folklore last July. At 33, he had been a professional on
the European PGA Tour since 1988 and only golf fans of strong
convictions knew of this charming gentleman who had had limited
success. There was the victory in the Roma Masters in 1993, a
splattering of top 10 finishes, and some respectable rankings in
the Order of Merit, but for the most part, observers had to check
the media guide when his name topped the leaderboard through 54
holes of the 128th British Open at Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
   The media guide told us very little about Van de Velde. His
handling of the disastrous closing hole told us everything.
</P>
<P>
   To the so-called golf experts in the TV towers and print media,
Van de Velde was a fool for losing a three-shot lead on the 72d
hole. But to tens of thousands of fans, Van de Velde became a
person around whom they could rally. In a style that was Arnold
Palmer-like, Van de Velde had refused to play safe, and people
liked that. What's more, he had screwed up like they all had. Even
more, he was willing to talk about it and take full blame, all the
while showing great dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde apologized that Sunday afternoon in the Scottish
dusk and he's been doing so ever since. He blew it, yes. He felt
badly, yes. He took full responsibility, yes. He did not blame his
caddie, no.
</P>
<P>
   On countless occasions, Van de Velde has been told how well he
has handled things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, what can you do, man? I still finished second. I was tied
after 72 holes and lost in a four-hole playoff. Why should I be
ashamed of anything? People can say, `Ah, he blew three shots,' but
they should look at it from the other angle and say, `He did well
to be three ahead of everybody.' That's reality.''
</P>
<P>
   When he walked to the 18th tee in the early evening of July 18
last year, Van de Velde was 3-over par for the tournament, 3 over
on his round. Native son Paul Lawrie had birdied the 18th hours
earlier to close out the best round of the competition, a 4-under
67, and was in the clubhouse at 6-over 290.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Lawrie concerned himself about finishing second, because
Van de Velde _ who had vaulted to the lead on the strength of 68-70
in the middle rounds _ could afford a double bogey and still
prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Up in front, Van de Velde watched Justin Leonard dump his second
shot into the Barry Burn. Minutes earlier, Van de Velde's playing
partner, Australian Craig Parry, had three-putted the 17th.
</P>
<P>
   ``A crazy golf tournament,'' said Davis Love, who posted just
one subpar round, a 69 on Sunday, yet finished in a tie for
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   For 71 holes it had been crazy, with the cut falling at 12 over
and just 11 subpar rounds.
</P>
<P>
   On the 72d, it passed crazy and went over the top to absurd.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the anniversary of that 18th hole approaches, Van de Velde
has had countless opportunities to offer his regrets, but he has
not done so. That's because he has none. He played the hole the way
he felt it should have been played, though perhaps, in looking
back, he could have gone another route with his third shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you do?'' he said. ``It's something that happened.
Out of a hundred times it would probably happen once and that was
the one. Unfortunately.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnoustie's 18th hole, said Van de Velde, was a monster. ``You
cross the burn three times. It's 480 yards and there's
out-of-bounds 5 yards left of the green and the green is something
like 15 feet wide. It's as tough as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   A drive well right, then a 2-iron that went even farther right
and rattled off the bleachers, bouncing backward into an impossible
lie in the hay. His third shot was chunked into the burn, so he
took a drop, and knocked his fifth shot in the bunker. No. 6 found
the green, and No. 7 was a 6-foot putt that pushed him into a
three-way playoff.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sequence of shots that will be remembered forever, but
what should not be overlooked is this: The men who were there are
supportive of Van de Velde. The execution, they concede, was not
effective, but the strategy should not be criticized.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting driver? Listen to Parry: ``What no one really knew is
that the wind had turned and we went into it on our tee shots. So
we had to hit driver. I hit driver, too. It was late at night, it
was cold and starting to rain a little bit. You couldn't hit
2-iron.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting 2-iron toward the green on his second shot? A surprise,
said Parry. ``However, he cleared the burn by 15 yards. That wasn't
the problem. He got unlucky when it (bounced off the grandstands
and) went back into the long rough. He would have been better off
had it gone into the water hazard. Then he could have taken a drop,
chipped it on, and won the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said, ``It's hard when you're sitting there 200 yards
with a perfect lie, you're leading the golf tournament, plenty of
room around the green to miss it. I don't think there's a player on
tour that would have pulled out a wedge or 9-iron (and played it
safe).''
</P>
<P>
   Love agrees. ``If he gets a good bounce, or if it bounces
forward, he wins the golf tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a near-impossible third shot, Van de Velde brought
the madness to a more incomprehensible level by challenging the
heather in an attempt to muscle a shot onto the green. Instead, he
hit it fat, deposited it into the Barry Burn, then removed his
socks and shoes and went in there after it.
</P>
<P>
   For several minutes, Van de Velde stood in the water, hands on
his hips, pondering his options. The crowd buzzed, almost fighting
back laughter, and players milled around trying to figure out what
in the name of Old Tom Morris was unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard was behind the 18th green. ``Disappointment was setting
in,'' for his double bogey at the 18th had left him at 290, tied
with Lawrie. ``But at the same time, I was trying to get ready for
a playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Parry watched Van de Velde standing in the water. Most of his
thoughts were blurred because ``I was pretty disappointed myself. I
three-putted 17 from nowhere and made a triple at the 12th, as
well. I thought that I threw it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the bridge leading toward the 18th green, Parry
looked toward the comical scene in the burn. ``Half the ball was
showing, so he could have played it,'' he said, though as Van de
Velde mulled over his choices, the ball sank. The Frenchman's
decision was made for him _ he would take a drop.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a few minutes for Van de Velde to dry his feet and
put his socks and shoes back on, so Parry turned to his playing
partner and said, ``Do you want to play your shot?'' Van de Velde
declined. ``He told me to play and I holed out (from the bunker to
complete a 73-291),'' said Parry. ``I said, `Follow me in the
hole,' '' and Parry turned to walk away. Yes, he said, it hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't believe it. We wanted to get out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde did follow Parry into the hole, but not until he
had followed him into the bunker with his fifth shot. His
triple-bogey 7 completed a round of 77 and in the buzz of the
stunning collapse it was easy to lose sight of the fact Van de
Velde still had a chance to win. He had, after all, drained a
pressure-packed 6-footer to finish at 290, tied with Lawrie and
Leonard, but given the misfortune that had just unfolded, it was
not hard to predict Van de Velde's playoff fate _ he needed 18
strokes to play four holes (as did Leonard), which lost to Lawrie's
15.
</P>
<P>
   As Lawrie accepted the Claret Jug and a nation's embrace _ he
was the first Scotsman to win the British Open since Sandy Lyle 14
years earlier _ the spotlight tracked not the man who had won, but
the man who had lost.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbish, said Leonard. ``There are a lot of holes we all could
have played differently and played better, but that didn't happen.
He was doing what he thought was right at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the sales pitch: ``Jean Van de Velde has always
preferred Bordeaux wines to Scottish water.''
</P>
<P>
   Vintage Van de Velde, who has a passion for wine (he was born an
hour from Bordeaux) and is the namesake for a wine from that
region. They promote the wine thusly: ``Made in his image, with
character and panache, frankness and generosity.''
</P>
<P>
   The description is perfect. Thanks to the $289,025 he earned for
finishing in a tie for second at Carnoustie, Van de Velde was able
to secure his playing privileges on both the European and American
PGA tours in 2000. He chose America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have enjoyed it a lot. It's discovering new courses and
meeting new people,'' said Van de Velde, who has had small success.
He finished second in Tucson, posted a top 20 at the Masters, but
is just 84th on the money list ($353,458). That, however, doesn't
come close to explaining why he is a gallery favorite _ and a media
darling.
</P>
<P>
   The famous picture of him standing in the burn, pant legs rolled
up? ``I've signed hundreds of them . . . thousands,'' said Van de
Velde. His wit and European charm were the star attractions in a
30-minute infomercial for Never Compromise, the putter he uses.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Van de Velde, over dinner late last summer with some
friends, joked, ``You know, I could probably have done better with
just my putter.'' Sitting at the table was a Never Compromise
official, and immediately an idea was born. A few weeks before
Christmas, Van de Velde returned to Carnoustie and filmed the
infomercial over an 18th hole that was covered in December frost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were freezing our hands and feet off and other parts of our
body as well,'' said Van de Velde, who used a putter with 6 degrees
of loft, a stronger shaft, and extra glue on the head as he played
the hole three times. First he made a 9, then an 8, then a 6, the
score that would have sealed a victory a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that his shot would have ended up in pretty good shape
had those bleachers not been constructed near the green, Van de
Velde grinned and quipped: ``You think I should sue the R&AMP;A?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he imagined himself in a similar position at this
year's British Open at St. Andrews, Van de Velde started to laugh.
The closing hole at St. Andrews is a relatively tame 357-yarder
whose protection comes in the form of a big swale _ the Valley of
Sin _ up near the green. The only water is a short distance off the
tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is for sure,'' said Van de Velde. ``If I hit it in
the water off the tee, I'll take my pants off this time to go hit
it.''
</P>
<P>
   More laughter, more handshakes, more smiles. Another interview
is over, but before Van de Velde moves 15 feet there is a new
reporter with an old topic. Did he have a minute? Van de Velde said
yes, then was asked just how it is he's been able to cope with the
memory of Carnoustie's 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, we're always ready to take the good times, but
we have to be ready to take the bad ones, too,'' he said. ``Around
the corner, they're going to be here and you have to be ready to
take the hammer shot when it comes. If not, the game's going to get
at you.''

THIRD TIME CHARM FOR JONES IN LONG JUMP 
</HEADLINE>
 OLYMPIC TRIALS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ As she prepared for her third and final
qualifying jump Sunday, Marion Jones clenched her teeth and closed
her eyes. She shook out her arms, brushed the hair out of her face,
and exhaled as if about to dive off a very high board into a very
deep pool. A pool someone had forgotten to fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the blink of an eye, it was like, OK, I have one more,''
said Jones, recounting her emotions when she turned around at the
end of her second jump, a long one, to see a red flag, signaling
her second foul on two attempts. ``If I don't get into this, this
dream will be over.''
</P>
<P>
   If she fouled again, she would be eliminated from the long jump
competition at the US Olympic Track and Field Trials, and her
historic chase of five gold medals in Sydney would be over. If she
jumped too early, she would lose valuable distance and maybe miss
the cut anyway, with the top eight of 12 jumpers moving into the
final round.
</P>
<P>
   But the fear lasted only an instant. After turning to see the
dreaded red flag, she kept turning. There in the stands were her
coach, Trevor Graham, and husband, shot putter C.J. Hunter. ``They
were just pumped up, because they knew if I got a legal one, it
would go far. When I saw they believed in me, there was no problem;
I was ready to jump.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it sudden death, but for Jones it was sudden life. Trying
to control her formidable speed even while she employed it, she
chopped her last steps, hit the board, and jumped. No flag. Mark:
22 feet 1 3/4 inches. Place: Fourth. Dreams of five: Still alive.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the afternoon, in the final, Jones would unleash a
jump of 23- 1/2, to win the competition and check off another event
_ after Saturday's 100-meter victory _ on her Olympic to-do list.
Joining her on the team will be Dawn Burrell (22-10 1/2) and Shana
Williams (22-6 1/2). Absent will be Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who
trudged her way into fourth place in the preliminaries, her best
effort 21-10 3/4, but completed only one jump after that, finishing
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have loved to have Jackie on this team,'' said Jones.
``She still is, in our opinion, the greatest ever. Nothing will
ever take away from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Joyner-Kersee's fifth jump, the 38-year-old felt
something in her left hamstring and passed on the attempt. On her
sixth try, she pulled the plug halfway down the runway, an
anticlimactic end to a surprising comeback try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never be disappointed, because I've been on four
Olympic teams,'' she said. ``This was a long shot. I thought maybe
I could put it together. (The top three) deserve to go, and I
deserve to go back home.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Jones, Saturday's event got the blame for her early
trouble Sunday. Coming off the final of the 100 meters, she said,
``I was running pretty fast, so I think my speed picked up. So I
had problems adjusting to that on my first two jumps. I thought I
was jumping pretty well, and that even if I wasn't on the board I'd
still make it to the final. And that's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness, said Joyner-Kersee, who laughed when asked if
the afternoon's outcome reflected a symbolic passing of the torch.
``For me, this was it,'' she said, spent. ``There's nothing
symbolic about it. To me, it would be a great loss if the greatest
long jumper was not at the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Jones's last-chance jumps after the two fouls, she and
Joyner-Kersee chatted. Her heir apparent, she reported, didn't seem
concerned, and Joyner-Kersee was impressed. ``If you're going to be
the best in the world, you can't worry about what's happening or
what you have to do to execute. She knew she was going to get that
jump.''

BELICHICK SETS TOUGH TONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It was 8:30 in the morning, on the dot. The
Patriots were already in their seats and new coach Bill Belichick
stood in a crowded and silent room and began to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Pete Carroll,'' said one player, ``guys would still be
talking even after he'd come in. With Bill, he walks in and
everyone shuts up and pays attention. It reminds me of college a
little bit, where the players didn't say anything when the coach
was about to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious,'' said defensive back Tebucky Jones. ``He's a very
serious coach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vacation's over,'' said linebacker Tedy Bruschi. ``It's time
to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Belichick is inheriting an 8-8 team that went 2-6 in the
second half of last season, there's a lot of bad karma to smooth
over. By the end of the Carroll era there was backbiting and
general chaos in the locker room. The self-policing ways of Carroll
didn't work, and when he tried to be tougher, that didn't work,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has made it clear since walking away from the New York
Jets that he is in charge. The message has gotten to the players,
who begin two-a-days Monday after reporting Sunday and taking their
conditioning tests and physicals.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said the four points he emphasized to the team are the
ones he'll continue to emphasize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main things I'll ask of them, and be pretty firm on, are
that they be on time, that they be attentive, be in condition, and
give 100 percent effort,'' he said. ``If they do those things, it
will run pretty smoothly, and if they don't, it's very difficult to
manage a group this size when we don't have that type of
cooperation and conformity.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach said everyone was on time except for one unnamed
player and rookie running back J.R. Redmond, who has not signed a
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond will not be able to participate in training camp for a
while as he recovers from an inflamed tendon in his groin. But the
Patriots had not had a holdout since Robert Kraft took ownership of
the team in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The players, who seem to relish the new direction, want to put
last season behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's behind us,'' said offensive lineman Max Lane.
``It's you guys who keep it in front of us. It's not even in our
minds right now. We've erased it. It's all about trying to get
better and get ready for the scrimmage against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all business, but playing football is fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has ``brought a lot of structure and discipline,''
said lineman Todd Rucci, who will miss some of training camp after
undergoing arthroscopic surgery recently. ``He got things on the
right page right away. We had a great offseason and it's been a lot
of fun around here. Everyone is real excited. You just want to play
under the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rucci would not go so far as to say the old regime wasn't fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to have fun when you're losing,'' he said. ``You get
a bad taste in your mouth. We haven't won any games yet. He put a
big challenge to the guys on offseason workouts. It's been fun
taking on a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Belichick, his team will start training camp
with numerous injuries, especially on the offensive line. Top draft
pick Adrian Klemm likely will miss most of camp following knee
surgery, ditto Rucci, and newly acquired guard Lance Scott will
miss the early weeks recovering from knee problems. This will give
Derrick Fletcher, Greg Robinson-Randall, and Ed Ellis more playing
time early in the exhibition season. Redmond, who likely will be
the primary running back, will also be behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everyone comes to camp with their own personal
expectations and team expectations, but there's going to have to be
a significant price we're going to have to pay to get those things
done,'' said Belichick. ``There's a lot of blood, sweat, and tears
ahead. That's what the players need to focus on. The dessert comes
later on.''
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious, too, that players will have tighter lips. The
players saw firsthand that Ben Coates spoke out last season and is
now a free agent. Players refused to discuss the simplest details
of their injuries Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to start pretty quickly here in the next day or
two,'' said Belichick. ``For a coach, it's like standing on a
treadmill. It's going faster than you want it to. There was a time
when training camp was graduated. Now, with two weeks before your
first preseason game . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will scrimmage the Giants at the University of
Massachusetts July 27 and play San Francisco in the Hall of Fame
Game July 31 in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to understand as a team it's a tough division, a
tough schedule, a new system, and there's a heavy price that needs
to be paid,'' said Belichick. ``That's what they need to respond
to. If we do that, we'll be all right. If we're not going to pay
the price in the environment we're in, then we'll run into trouble.
We'll have to make personal sacrifices for the team to be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Ted Johnson believes the change is already reaping
benefits. He said he's familiar with the defense Belichick wants to
run and that he expects it'll be a combination of a 4-3 and a 3-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't put the pads on yet, but we've been addressed by
the coach and he set the tone and he's set a pretty tough tone from
the start,'' Johnson said. ``He's businesslike. I like change. I
like experiencing new ideas. He brings a fresh approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Belichick will be challenged. All coaches are. How he
responds to those challenges by players, such as when he sent
J'Juan Cherry packing, also will set a tone.

WESSELS FEASTS ON KNIPPSCHILD 
</HEADLINE>
 OF FAME CHAMPIONSHIPS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ A Dutch treat at the Casino didn't mean Peter
Wessels had to share the money. No, the $49,500 first prize was all
his because the husky young man from the Netherlands stood as
perhaps the stingiest champion in the annals of the last surviving
grass-court tennis tournament in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never gave me a chance,'' sighed German Jens Knippschild,
who was beaten, 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, Sunday in the final of the Hall of
Fame Championships.
</P>
<P>
   That was more dinner money than Wessels, a 6-foot-4-inch
22-year-old, ever had seen, and he promised to take his father,
Gert, out for large lobsters. Gert never had watched the kid play
outside their country, and so he was most pleased to laze and look
amid 3,605 sunbathing customers while his bashing son served
spotlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner probably tasted pretty good because No. 133 Wessels
entered Newport very hungry, never having won a tournament in 26
previous starts or even participated in a final. Same for No. 150
Knippschild in 47 tries. This was a final for the famished, and it
went to Wessels _ the only Dutchman to win at the Casino _ because
he was such a tightfisted server. With phenomenal 80 percent
first-serving, garnished with 10 aces, he permitted Knippschild to
gnaw on zero break points.
</P>
<P>
   ``On grass, how can you do anything when a guy puts in so many
first serves?'' asked the German. Not that he was overly generous.
Knippschild let Wessels look at one breaker, and Wessels snatched
it with a return to go up, 2-0, in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, it was a tournament for have-nots. Neither player
was seeded. Favorites long have been jinxed at the Casino. Only in
1976, the first year for the tourney on the ATP Tour, did the top
seed go all the way: Vijay Amritraj of India. This year's top guy,
Chris Woodruff, the defending champion, vanished in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling,'' said Wessels. ``I didn't sleep at all
last night. You know, your first final. It's a big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as big as his serve. Wessels, who is from a fishing village
called Elburg, was the biggest fish in Narragansett Bay, for a day
anyway. He and Knippschild had company in that the doubles final
was also filled with unseeded guys.
</P>
<P>
   It went to Israelis Jonathan Erlich and Harel Levy over the
Anglo-American entry of Kyle Spencer and Mike Sprengelmeyer, 7-6
(7-2), 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   They were the first Israelis to win a doubles title outside of
their homeland (only the second ever, following Shahar Perkiss and
Gilad Bloom, who won Tel Aviv in 1987).
</P>
<P>
   Informed of that, Levy said, ``Maybe it's a good omen. We stay
on the road to play Davis Cup against Bulgaria this weekend at
Sofia.''

ARMSTRONG IS ON GRAND TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
 DE FRANCE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COURCHEVEL, France _ A few days ago, Italian rider Marco Pantani
and American Lance Armstrong finished the Tour de France's stage to
Mont Ventoux side by side. As they crossed the finish line,
Armstrong seemed to let Pantani scoot ahead of him, and while both
racers were given the ``same time,'' the Italian notched the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, it looked like he was handed the win by the
American, who held a comfortable 10-minute lead over him after
almost two weeks of racing and could afford to finish second.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani was determined to erase those accounts, though. So
Sunday, he bolted in front of Armstrong and finished almost a
minute ahead of him. It wasn't much, but it was enough for Pantani
to prove he didn't need anyone's help to score a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more satisfying to finish alone,'' Pantani said.
``There's a different taste of victory when you leave everyone
behind, the taste of triumph. I wanted to win it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   To Armstrong, it didn't really matter. He gained time on the
rider in second place, and wore the overall leader's yellow jersey
for the sixth straight day.
</P>
<P>
   He did acknowledge he felt in good form as he and the 140 other
riders covered the 108-mile course that went up and down two
mountains in the Alps before finishing at this ski resort. The
temperature hovered around 40 degrees amid snow-capped mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, personally, I felt better today than yesterday, but it was
a tough stage,'' said Armstrong. ``Yesterday most riders were on
the bike almost nine hours and today had three hard climbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the race looked like a repeat of the past few
stages, with the yellow-jerseyed rider staying in the middle of the
pack while a few racers whose lead would do nothing to affect the
overall standings went ahead.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the final climb, the pack of 25 riders was more
than 4 minutes behind the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Then the race got interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani broke away from the group, and a few others followed,
but it was Armstrong who would catch up with Pantani and trade the
lead for the first part of the ride up the mountain. The thousands
of fans who lined the narrow mountain road waved flags and cheered
wildly as they watched the winner of last year's Tour battle the
winner of 1998. It was the man in yellow vs. the 5-foot-6-inch
Italian.
</P>
<P>
   But with fewer than eight miles to go, Pantani shook off
Armstrong for good to catch up to the leaders and eventually pass
them. Some comic relief entered the race when two cyclists _ one in
a yellow jersey _ jumped onto the course, but they were quickly
laughed at and shooed off.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani's win was a kind of revenge for printed reports that he
was angry at Armstrong for appearing to give him the win the other
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Armstrong told me to speed up, I think he was trying to
provoke me,'' Pantani had reportedly said. ``If Armstrong thinks
it's over, he's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was more gracious after the win Sunday, when he said, ``I
hold Armstrong in great esteem, and I'm not saying that to flatter
him, that's my way. Armstrong is very strong, but today I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   German rider Jan Ullrich, who had been in second place, lost
time in the overall standings after finishing more than 3 minutes
behind Pantani. Ullrich is still in second place overall, but is
now 7:26 in back of Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   To put the last week of racing in perspective, Armstrong won
last year's Tour by almost that same margin _ 7:21 _ over Swiss
rider Alex Zulle.
</P>
<P>
   But the American won't yet commit to a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a week to go in the race, and I refuse to say
I've won the race until I arrive in Paris,'' Armstrong said. ``I
can't see sitting here and telling you that; it wouldn't be fair or
respectful to the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously smelling a victory for his team, postmaster general
Bill Henderson arrives Monday to travel the last week of the Tour
and cheer on Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Hamilton of Marblehead, Mass., moved up to 30th place
overall and is now the highest-ranking American after Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year-old boy died Sunday from injuries sustained after he
was hit by a publicity vehicle while watching the Tour last week.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle hit the boy Friday, swerving along the shoulder of
the road to make room for a passing car as fans lined the route to
watch cyclists heading to Draguignan in the race's 13th stage.

STORY OF BLIND RUNNER JUST STARTING TO UNFOLD 
</HEADLINE>
 TRIALS-RUNYAN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Before June 8, the day she hurt her hip
during a training run when she stepped aside to avoid a bicycling
child, Marla Runyan had been tapped as a Story, capital S. Legally
blind since the age of 9, Runyan burst onto the international scene
last summer when, in just her eighth race ever at the distance, she
finished 10th at 1,500 meters at the World Championships in
Seville.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to run for five weeks after the injury, which eventually
crept down toward her left knee, Runyan just days ago thought about
pulling out of the trials. The Story seemed near an end. But
Sunday, after getting physical therapy right up until race time,
there she was on the victory stand after finishing third (4:06.44)
to Regina Jacobs (4:01.01) and Suzy Favor Hamilton (4:01.81) in the
much-awaited women's 1,500. Although she becomes the first legally
blind athlete to compete in the Olympic Games, that is not how she
sees herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really think much about my vision,'' said Runyan,
``and I don't think my competitors think about it, either. I'm
definitely an athlete. I think my vision is just kind of a
circumstance that happened. I never said to myself I want to be the
first legally blind Olympian, I just said I want to be on an
Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   A converted heptathlete who finished 10th in the 1996 trials,
this will be Runyan's first Olympic team; it's the fourth for
Jacobs and third for Favor Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``My strategy basically was third,'' said Runyan, citing concern
that her bad leg wouldn't hold up with an effort too strenuous. ``I
said Regina and Suzy can just go do whatever they want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Favor Hamilton and Jacobs began in the rear but had moved up to
second and third by 900 meters, with Runyan sixth and conveniently
right behind Shayne Culpepper, the woman she considered her likely
rival for the third spot. That way, the vision she does have
allowed her to see where Culpepper was at all times. Just before
the bell, Favor Hamilton and Jacobs, running stride for stride,
caught early front-runner Collette Liss, as Runyan and Culpepper
made their moves. Running a last 400 meters of 57.6 seconds, Jacobs
began to pull away from Favor Hamilton in the backstretch, even as
Runyan, with about 250 meters to go, did the same to Culpepper in
the vital race for third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping some of my instincts from last year would kick
in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan, 31, now living in Eugene, Ore., suffers from macular
degeneration, a condition that allows her some fuzzy peripheral
vision at 20/300 around a blacked-out center. As a Paralympian, she
won four gold medals before turning to the heptathlon, which she
left after 1996 in favor of the 800. After an injury-plaqued 1997
and 1998, she turned to the 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her reluctance to be labeled, Runyan acknowledges the
impact she has had. ``I can't even tell you the letters I've gotten
from so many parents and children and teenagers who have the same
condition I have or similar, and so it makes me feel really good
that it's affecting people in a positive way.''

MANY ACTS OF COURAGE AT TRIALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO - No one was risking life or limb in the name of his
country Sunday at the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials. The only
casualties to speak of on the third day of competition at Cal State
Sacramento's Hornet Stadium were a few Olympic dreams, hardly the
worst of losses in the grand scheme of things.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, we don't believe it's belittling the word to say that
courage was the catchword of the day. Like the red-white-and-blue
bunting ringing the stands, it was displayed all around the track.
</P>
<P>
   The women's long jump finals gave us Jackie Joyner-Kersee, a
four-time Olympian, to immerge from a warm cocoon of immortality to
flit like a butterfly over the sand pit a few more times.
</P>
<P>
   What a simple act of courage it was, risking failure after so
many years of unqualified success. Joyner-Kersee, 38, was two years
removed from her last competition and only four months into a
difficult comeback when she stood on the runway for her final
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   All she needed was a leap that she used to be able to summon
while half-asleep to earn a berth to Sydney. Joyner-Kersee was here
because America's top jumpers hadn't been exceeding the distances
she used to routinely cover, and she didn't want to spend the rest
of her life wondering, ``What if I had been out there jumping?''
</P>
<P>
   In two days of jumping, Joyner-Kersee saved herself decades of
regret. She finished sixth, then made it clear she was headed right
back to her rocking chair. The competitor was disappointed in the
result, but the person was content knowing she at least had tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought maybe I could put it together but it wasn't there,''
Joyner-Kersee said. ``That was it.''
</P>
<P>
   She was half-right. It was all over but the second-guessing by
people who would have preferred that Joyner-Kersee remain a picture
in their mind, an image of excellence frozen in time.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been the easy thing; to rest on her laurels.
Instead, Joyner-Kersee gave us a crash course in personal growth,
teaching us by example that it's not in trying that we fail but in
failing to try.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Jones got it. Joyner-Kersee's sixth-place finish
``doesn't take anything away from Jackie,'' Jones said after
showing her own mettle in winning the long jump. ``She's still in
my mind the greatest ever. Nothing will ever take away from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen. We're not surprised Jones could dig it. After all, it
takes courage to declare to the world one's intention to accomplish
something no other track and field star has ever done.
</P>
<P>
   The easy thing would have been for Jones to keep quiet about her
goal of winning five gold medals at the Sydney Olympics. Few people
would have put themselves out on a limb like that, knowing a smug
world would be watching intently to see if the branch gives way.
</P>
<P>
   Jones stayed out on a limb even when the branch started swaying.
It takes fortitude to keep hanging on. The easy thing for Jones
would have been to leave the long jump for others after struggling
with the event throughout most of the winter and the spring.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple act of courage Jones showed Sunday when she
sprinted down the runway and summoned a fair jump after fouling on
her first two attempts. With that leap she staved off elimination
and with her fifth jump she surpassed 23 feet for the first time
this year, effectively ending the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's dream of winning five Olympic events remains alive
because she kept trying when others were suggesting she'd be better
off failing to try.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Marla Runyan has never placed limitations on herself.
She doesn't see herself as special, even though every time she
steps on the track it is a small act of courage.
</P>
<P>
   That she was running Sunday despite tender tendons in her left
leg is the least of her handicaps. Runyan, 31, was legally blind
since the age of 9 because of a degenerative retina condition.
</P>
<P>
   She has only slight peripheral vision, making her third-place
finish in the 1,500 meters a vision of lionheartedness. All you
need to know about Runyan is that when she said, ``I keep think
that the next treatment is going to be the miracle cure,'' she was
talking about her injured tendons, not her ruined retinas.
</P>
<P>
   Her blindness, you see, she takes in stride. By holding off
Shayne Culpepper down the stretch for the last Olympic berth,
Runyan became the first legally blind athlete to make a U.S.
Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very awesome,'' she said of her place in history. ``I
never really think as much about my vision as the media does. I
just think the person I am, I'm definitely an athlete. My vision is
just a circumstance that happened to me. I never looked at it as a
barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   The last of her eyesight didn't keep Runyan from becoming a
winner. That's what happens when you let courage be your guide.

TRYING TO RIGHT REVOLUTION

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Mauricio Wright is at a loss to explain the
demise of the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   They were hoping for a home crowd boost Saturday against the
MetroStars after five games on the road without a victory.
</P>
<P>
   The boost never came as New York-New Jersey blanked New England,
2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bit different to try to go out and win, with the goal
that we have to play differently, so we had to push a bit more,''
said Wright, a defender. ``I can't explain what's going on with the
team. Everything is bad for us right now . . . we miss on our
chances and everything becomes difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is 50-50, they take the ball, we take the ball, and
they didn't get too many chances,'' Wright said about the
MetroStars. ``We had so many chances and we missed. We have to
concentrate on the game and getting better while their team has
been getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution outshot the MetroStars, 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of working hard in practice for everybody,''
said Wright. ``We have to play like a real team. At one point, we
were winning, now we have to start doing that again.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing the Revolution can do about the past, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to try not to make the same mistakes we've been
making,'' Wright said. ``We're right in the middle of the season
now. We have games coming up that are quite important. We have to
try to make things better. Getting goals has been difficult. We
have to get our confidence back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we play well in the front, sometimes we play well in
the back. Now we have to make sure we do both situations at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright has now played seven games with the Revolution and has
one goal since being traded from San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do my best, I feel good,'' Wright said. ``I play 100 percent
every single time I'm on the field. I try to do my best. Sometimes
I make a mistake; we all do. I'm human.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing the same way that I did in San Jose. I don't have
time to change. I try to play the way the coach wants me to.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has been. ``He's a class act; he's cool,'' coach Fernando
Clavijo said. ``He's always working hard in the back and he adapts
well, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And Wright always tries to be a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to be a good partner,'' Wright said. ``I think I'm a
nice guy. I try to show my experience in the back to the young
players like Rusty Pierce and the others. And at the same time, I
try to take every practice seriously. I work hard throughout the
week so that it feels better when I get into a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Wright has to lead the Revolution to a series of wins.

 CHANGE TAKES HOLD AT EXCITEATHOME  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ExciteAtHome, the world's largest provider of
high-speed Internet cable service, has been going through a wave of
changes.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chief executive, George Bell, just took over in
January and became chairman in May, when Tom Jermoluk left to
become a venture capitalist; a wave of other executives has been
replaced; AT&AMP;T signed pacts with other shareholders to take control
of the company; and after reporting an operating profit for the
first time, ExciteAtHome recently announced it will scrap
short-term profits in favor of expanding its customer base.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle recently sat down with Bell to talk about the
changes at the Redwood City, Calif., company.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Chronicle: You recently mentioned that you want to focus on
expansion. But this is a time when other companies are retrenching
and focusing on profits to make Wall Street happy. What's the
thinking?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bell: Our market conditions are much different than the majority of
companies. We have exclusive contracts (with our cable partners)
through the year 2002. We have extended contracts through the year
2008. We have a regulatory environment where the forced-access
issue has diminished in scope and scale. AOL bought a cable
company. In sum, the market conditions that we face over the next
two years are enviable and may never come again. We would be
irresponsible by not adopting a growth strategy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Chronicle: Are you thinking of just cable?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bell: No. We come to life as a company with cable contracts. But
that's not where our mission terminates. We have added DSL (digital
subscriber line). We will look at any other viable technologies.
Our goals are 3 million customers by this year, 6 million by the
end of next year and 10 million by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Chronicle: You said recently that in terms of the Excite
portal, you want to focus on adding broadband features. Is this a
change?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bell: Yes. Because we have the privilege of setting the start page
for a national broadband service. Most people leave the Excite
start page as the default page on their browser. However, nobody at
other portal companies has that privilege until 2002. Of course, we
want to focus on the features and applications that we think are
going to be particularly valuable to broadband users. But the vast
majority of people still take our service as a narrowband service;
we don't want to walk away from narrowband.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Chronicle: How do you plan to serve both?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bell: Take BlueMountain.com, by far the largest provider of
electronic greeting cards in the world. What is it in broadband
that is different? The ability to attach audio and video to the
card. If I send you a Christmas card, I can attach ``Jingle
Bells.'' If I send you a Valentines' Day card, I can send you a
video clip or voice clip. These are all things that
BlueMountain.com can do, which wouldn't be altogether appealing for
narrowband customers because of the constraints of the pipe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Chronicle: As you think more about broadband, are you less
concerned if Yahoo and Lycos grow faster in narrowband?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bell: I don't think we can be all things to all users. My answer is
predicated on the assumption that as the PC is to the '80s, and the
Internet is to the '90s, broadband is to the first decade of the
21st century. This is the broadband decade.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Chronicle: When do you plan to launch your broadband version of
the Excite portal?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bell: Before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Chronicle: You recently announced a wireless portal. How does
that fit into your strategy?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bell: Our principal interest in wireless is the personalized
distribution of content and, specifically, notification
technologies. We don't think the microbrowser is the place where
you are going to want to digest a lot of text or reconfigure your
stock portfolio. You are going to do that on your PC. But wireless
offers a level of convenience. You can use alerts that say: Tell me
when my stocks go up or down by 5 percent. Tell me whether my bid
on eBay has been a success. So, wireless is part of a larger effort
to try to get the most number of people to personalize their
content.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Chronicle: As you undergo this growth strategy, you've had a
lot of executives leave the company and made a lot of management
changes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bell: You say a lot of executives have left.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think you should make a presumption that when people
leave a company they have all _ 100 percent _ chosen to leave.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Chronicle: One analyst pointed out that when a new CEO takes
over, he usually tries to build his own team.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bell: Some of that is going on. I'm not going to be specific. I'm
not going to say this guy is leaving, and this guy was fired. But I
think it is an important distinction for you to make. I get to say
what makes me comfortable as a manager in terms of the type of team
that makes me comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Chronicle: Will there be more management changes?
</P>
<P>
   I am under a very large-scale effort to upgrade the quality of
management. I feel very comfortable with the recruiting pitch. I
can look you in the eye and say, ``This is the company we are going
to build.'' Six months ago I could not have said that. Who controls
the company? What happens past 2002? What about regulatory issues?
Who really runs the company? T.J. (Jermoluk) or George? Or AT&AMP;T?
These were all questions that were unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Chronicle: You mentioned the stock market. The stock has been
down lately.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bell: One of the things that a depressed stock price does is it
gives you more courage to make the right moves for the business.
The problem is that you've got a very choppy Nasdaq as a backdrop
to all this. I don't know that the clarity investors are looking
for is around profitability. It is: Do you have a business? Amazon
is not profitable, has never been. But nobody is saying it's a bad
business. They are just saying that the risk profile is a big one.
No one is saying that our business _ which by the way will leave us
with a half-billion dollars in revenue from our subscription
business alone _ is a bad business. It's just unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Chronicle: I imagine the reason that churn is so low is that
people like high-speed access and often don't have an alternative.
Do you worry about problems _ long hold times for customer service
and slowdowns in some neighborhoods _ as people have more choice?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bell: Yes, I worry about that a lot. Word-of-mouth will overtake
the value of our marketing campaign. We have 7 percent penetration
in markets we serve. In many markets, we're at 20 percent or 25
percent. This is not a backwater, techie phenomenon. This is
getting to be a mainstream phenomenon. I don't care how funny your
commercials or how palatable your economic offers are. If it
stinks, it stinks.
</P>
<P>
   The old saw is that a $100 million marketing campaign for a
movie is ruined overnight by a bad review. So, we are investing in
our network. We are adding very aggressively in the whole customer
service area. We are adding tools so customer service
representatives can say: ``Oh, you are calling us from Muncie, Ind.
We know your e-mail is slow. It should be slow for three hours. We
have technicians working on it. Call us again if it's not fixed in
three hours.'' Right now, our customer support people have to say:
``Describe the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Chronicle: Let me ask you about slowdowns. You had some
problems with people abusing the network. How big is the problem?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bell: DSL is a shared network just like cable. The sharing occurs
at the central office. Please don't have the illusion that one is
shared and one is not. I think one of the things that frosts me
about the Pac Bell (ad) campaign is that there is an implication
that somehow they are not shared. That is not true. All networks
are shared networks. Second, can we fix it? Absolutely. Some people
are sending (large amounts of) MP3s out of their home, for
instance. The solution is you go to those users and say, ``We have
a product for you. But it's not $40. It's a business product.'' The
fix is easy, but unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Chronicle: Pac Bell claims it has more subscribers in the San
Francisco Bay Area, even though it was later to market high-speed
Net service.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bell: We have just begun to light up S.F.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Chronicle: Exactly. You still don't have any service in Oakland
or San Jose at all. Wouldn't it make sense to start offering DSL in
those areas now, since it will take years to offer cable service in
every neighborhood?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bell: We are happy to employ DSL. But it's AT&AMP;T's decision, not
ours. It's also not my impression that (Pac Bell) is doing that
well. Their TV commercials suck.

 TECH 21: MUCH TO APPRECIATE AT SEMICON WEST SHOW  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Back in the late 1980s, I lived in San Mateo,
Calif., near the Bay Meadows racetrack and the adjoining
fairgrounds. Most of the year, the modest expo center there would
be occupied by down-home shows featuring distinctly nontech
products like dolls, guns and costume jewelry. (Just recently the
site hosted a rubber-stamp festival.)
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, though, something called Semicon West would appear
on the marquee. It obviously had something to do with computers,
but I never knew quite what. I hadn't heard of most of the
companies exhibiting, nor even the products and technologies they
were showing _ and I never paid a lot of attention.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Semicon West has left the fairgrounds far behind and
has become the Bay Area's biggest trade show, filling both the
Moscone Center in San Francisco and the McEnery Convention Center
in San Jose, Calif. And I now know what it is: the annual reunion
of SEMI, or Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International,
the trade association of the companies that provide the ingredients
and machinery out of which chips are made.
</P>
<P>
   I also now understand that it's a very big deal, and not just
because of the havoc it wrought on downtown parking and traffic
last week. I've come to appreciate how much the whole high-tech
universe depends on these mostly obscure companies. Without their
ability to turn scientific discoveries into workable production
systems, Moore's Law on increasing semiconductor power would have
hit a brick wall long ago, and the forward march of computing and
communications would have slowed to a crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I understand most of what they do _ I may be a geek by
some standards, but when it comes to on-bonder curing, diode-pumped
lasers and PECVD (plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, I
finally figured out), I'm as much in the dark as you probably are.
</P>
<P>
   That, I suppose, is why most of the news coverage out of the
show, including my own, focused on the industry's impending
transition from 200- to 300-millimeter silicon wafers. It's not the
only change sweeping the field, nor is it the most challenging
technically.
</P>
<P>
   But explaining the benefits of switching from salad plates to
dinner plates _ you get 2.5 times as many chips per serving _ is a
heck of a lot easier than communicating the merits of nanometer
geometries, not to mention low-k dielectrics and dual-damascene
copper interconnects.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, though _ I won't try to redress the balance here,
except to say that those last three innovations are shaping up as
critical factors enabling the Intels, IBMs and AMDs of the world to
keep making their processors smaller, faster and more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   INSPECTOR GADGETS: Some other trends, however, are easier to get
your head around, even if you know nothing about semiconductors per
se. One I noticed is a growing emphasis on integrating testing and
measurement throughout the production process, instead of just at
the end of the line or at a few critical junctures. Considering
that a modern 300mm fab will cost an estimated $2.5 billion to
build and equip, it makes more sense to spend extra for instruments
that detect defects on the fly than to keep working on damaged
goods.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds like good news for KLA-Tencor, the San Jose company
that dominates the market for ``process control and yield
management solutions'' for the semiconductor industry. But the
increased importance of these elements also seems certain to
attract more competition to the field, not the least from the titan
of the whole semiconductor-equipment industry, Applied Materials,
also of San Jose (market cap: more than $71 billion). Applied is
already building more test capabilities directly into its
production machines, and the trend is bound to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   (As an aside, I can only assume that today's ``metrology'' tools
are more effective than those considered state-of-the-art in the
machine shops I worked in a quarter-century ago. My first job as a
machinist, heaven help me, was making parts for ``people sniffers''
for fighter-bombers _ devices designed to trigger the automatic
release of bombs when the plane flew over a campfire in the jungle
or desert.
</P>
<P>
   The parts were made of alloys that expanded or contracted,
depending on the temperature. For better or worse it was almost
impossible to machine them to the tolerances required with the
equipment we had. But I soon learned how to get my output past the
government inspector and his fancy tools: Savvy co-workers taught
me just how long to leave each part on a shelf above a radiator, or
else on a cold window sill, to bring it into spec.)
</P>
<P>
   SMIFs and FOUPs: Another trend related to the increasing value _
and delicacy _ of in-process wafers is the growing role of
automated material-handling systems _ not just the robots that load
individual wafers in and out of production tools, but also the
overhead networks that transfer and track them from station to
station.
</P>
<P>
   These systems are anything but toys, but if you ever enjoyed
model trains, as a kid or as a parent, you'd get a kick out of
watching them. Like the railroads, they have their own lingo, too:
The sealed, ultra-clean boxes in which wafers are now transported
are known as SMIFs, for Standard Mechanical InterFace; equivalent
cases for the new 300mm wafers are called FOUPs, for front-opening
unified pods.
</P>
<P>
   Existing fabs, of course, are already highly automated, but
workers still sometimes have to pick up sealed cassettes full of
wafers and carry them by hand to another bay. I saw that happening
at an Intel fab I had the pleasure of touring not long ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the move to 300mm, however, wafers become both heavier and
more valuable. A FOUP-ful would easily exceed federal weight limits
for unassisted lifting and, in late stages of production, it could
be worth as much as $5 million, according to Fremont, Calif.'s
Asyst Technologies, the leader in the field. At that price, no one
wants to run the risk of a pod-carrying worker tripping over his or
her bunny shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Automated materials handling also has an important benefit: If
wafers never get outside production bays, SMIFs and FOUPs, and the
air within those ``minienvironments'' can be kept in line with the
increasingly stringent cleanliness standards semiconductor
production requires, chipmakers don't have to keep the surrounding
cleanroom quite so clean _ they still need advanced filtration
systems, but they can live with a few more particles per billion.
</P>
<P>
   And since building and running a high-class cleanroom is a major
part of the cost of a modern fab, even a modest relaxation of
requirements translates into significant savings.
</P>
<P>
   Asyst, which saw revenues more than double in fiscal 2000
(admittedly, relative to a disastrous 1999), should continue to
benefit from the automation trend. But as in the test and
measurement field, a growing business attracts competitors. Last
week, for example, I saw an impressive demonstration of intelligent
machine controllers developed by Berkeley Process Controls, a
privately held Richmond, Calif., company that supplies such
products to Boeing, among others, and now seeks to move into the
semiconductor-equipment market.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, what I found most striking about Semicon West is how
diversified and competitive the industry remains, even after
decades of development. Even Applied Materials doesn't offer
complete production systems _ its execs were boasting last week
that their lineup encompasses 75 percent of the hundreds of
processes involved in building semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the 1,777 companies that exhibited at the show are
all much smaller; most of them specialize in only one or a few
types of equipment. They've met the needs of the chip industry _
and enabled it to accomplish the wonders it has _ not by
consolidating into a handful of highly integrated behemoth, but by
maintaining an ecology where hundreds of smaller organisms have
thrived by adapting to their own narrow niches _ and by cooperating
around open standards.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that the next time someone tries to justify a monopoly
as essential to technical progress.
</P>
<P>
   BEING FOLLOWED? An insidious threat to privacy that I _ like
most users, I'm sure _ wasn't previously aware of has surfaced in
recent weeks, thanks mainly to the efforts of the well-known
programmer and security sleuth, Richard Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is embodied in a mechanism called a ``Web bug.''
Smith explains how they work on his ``Web Bug FAQ'' page
( &LR; www.tiac.net/users/smiths/privacy/wbfaq.htm &LR; ); Cnet also has a
good story on the subject at
 &LR; news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-200-2247960.html?tagst.ne.1002.tgif.ni. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Web bugs'' are also known as ``invisible GIFs'' because in
some theoretical sense they're Web graphics, but they're only one
pixel in size and therefore effectively invisible. Linked to each
such bug is code that can report your every move on the Web to the
site that planted it.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sites using this new device, according to Smith, are
Quicken.com, FedEx.com and, predictably, the detestable
DoubleClick. Freevibe.com, an anti-drug site created by the White
House Office of National Drug Control Policy, also used them until
last month, when a presidential edict barred them from all federal
sites. (Curiously, President Clinton apparently didn't order the
site to get rid of its ``summer romance board,'' which still
invites visitors to ``tell us about your crush.'')
</P>
<P>
   Such bugs can also be embedded in e-mail messages to determine
who's read the message and perhaps to connect it to a previously
deposited cookie. Companies known to have used this approach,
according to Smith, are Barnes and Noble, eToys and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to detect these little beasts _ today's
cookie-blocker utilities don't detect them _ but Smith has created
a page that, with help from AltaVista, identifies Web pages that
carry them. Unfortunately, there's apparently nothing we can do to
destroy them, but disabling cookies limits the damage they can do,
according to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   One more good argument, at least in my book, for strict privacy
legislation.

 BIOTECH PRICES FALL WITH GAIN IN HIGH TECH  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Biotech stocks tumbled late last week as a wave
of profit-taking and a renewed infatuation with Internet stocks
ended a six-week run that had brought biotech shares near their
record highs in March.
</P>
<P>
   Since the biotech retreat began Wednesday, the American Stock
Exchange biotech index, a basket of 17 large companies, has dropped
7.3 percent to close at 685.28.
</P>
<P>
   Even factoring in last week's reversal, however, this key
biotech stock index is still up 69 percent from its April 17 low of
405. Since June 1, the biotech index has registered a gain of 38
percent, outperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which rose 25 percent
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the Nasdaq's recent gains came during the last three
days, and analysts said it's no accident that biotech stock indexes
slumped at the same time the Nasdaq was jumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong Yahoo earnings started to revive interest in
Internet stocks and money started to move that way, probably at the
expense of biotech,'' said Steve Burrill, of Burrill &AMP; Co., the
biotech investment firm in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter in
Berkeley, called last week's decline in biotech shares a ``much
needed pause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The stocks couldn't continue going up as fast as they had
been,'' said McCamant, who thinks biotech will recover and continue
growing, albeit much more slowly than June's blistering pace.
</P>
<P>
   One of the factors that had fueled biotech's summer run was an
increasing flow of money into biotech mutual funds, as small
investors tried to catch some of the gains being registered by
biotech indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Adler, president of AMG Services, a firm that tracks mutual
fund money flows, said that during the past three weeks, investors
poured more than $680 million into biotech mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Last week alone, biotech mutual funds attracted $353 million in
new funds, compared with the $388 million that flowed into
technology mutual funds. Although high tech drew more money, Adler
said the amount flowing into biotech was remarkable given that
high-tech funds are four times the size of the biotech mutual fund
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Whether investors now shun biotech, or take last week's retreat
as a buying opportunity, could be heavily influenced by Genentech
Inc.'s earnings report due out before the stock market opens today.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate the South San Francisco, Calif., biotech giant
will report earnings of between 27 cents and 32 cents a share
today, with the average falling at 29 cents. A good showing by
Genentech would boost the likelihood of a quick bounce for biotech,
while a disappointment could spark a sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech shares rose $7.56 Friday, a gain of 5 percent, to
close at $161.50, bucking the negative trend that caused more than
half of all biotech stocks to lose ground. Chiron Corp. of
Emeryville, Calif., also defied the downturn, gaining 31 cents to
close at $52.69.
</P>
<P>
   Gilead Sciences of Foster City, Calif., and Incyte Genomics of
Palo Alto, Calif., weren't so lucky. Shares in Gilead, which has a
flu drug on the market and is in late-stage clinical trials with an
AIDS treatment, lost $1.56 to close at $80.63. Stock in Incyte, one
of several firms selling gene databases, slipped $2.38 to end the
day at $91.13.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Dietz, a biotech specialist with Pacific Growth Equities, a
San Francisco investment bank, said biotech stocks are likely to
seesaw for the rest of the summer, a traditionally slow season for
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But come fall, when scientific conferences give biotech firms a
chance to talk about their newest experimental drugs, he predicts
biotech stocks will heat up again, as happened last year at the
same time.

 BIOSCOPE: COURTESY MATTERS IN BUG KILLING  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If someone offered to do a $250,000 job for
free, and to get it done in a day instead of several months, how
long would it take you to accept the offer?
</P>
<P>
   Well, if you're the United States government, and the job
happens to be the genetic analysis of the bacterium threatening
California's vineyards, the answer isn't so simple because
accepting the free offer could mean offending a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, I reported that state and federal officials
would collaborate with Brazilian scientists to sequence the genome
of the bacterium that causes Pierce's disease, a fly-borne
bacterial infection that clogs the plumbing of wine plants, causing
vines to wither and die.
</P>
<P>
   That deal looked like a winner at the time, because the
Brazilian scientists recently finished unraveling the genome of a
related bacterium that infects citrus crops in their country.
</P>
<P>
   But after learning that it might take the Brazilians several
months to complete the project, some wine industry executives
started looking for a faster way to get the data _ courtesy of the
Joint Genome Institute, a Department of Energy facility in Walnut
Creek, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   JGI is one of the five public labs that recently finished
sequencing the human genome. The facility is a gene-reading
factory, crammed with hundreds of instruments that now sit somewhat
idle, given that the big push on the human genome work is over.
</P>
<P>
   When the Energy Department scientists heard about the wine-bug
project through the scientific grapevine, they volunteered to do
the genetic analysis of the Pierce's disease bug, overnight and for
free.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be less than a day's work for us,'' said JGI deputy
director Trevor Hawkins, who was astonished to discover that
American authorities, led by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
were reluctant to accept the offer for fear of offending the
Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials took a diplomatic tone Friday when asked how they
planned to assuage Brazilian pride, without dismissing what seems
like an unbeatable offer closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are exploring the situation and trying to see how different
people can help out in understanding the disease,'' said USDA
spokeswoman Susan McAvoy.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian authorities did not respond to an e-mail requesting
comment.
</P>
<P>
   PROLEUKIN POSTSCRIPT: Last week I reported how stock in Chiron
Corp. rose after publication of a scientific article describing how
Chiron's Proleukin drug, which was originally approved to fight
certain cancers, seems to help AIDS patients by giving their immune
systems a boost.
</P>
<P>
   The day my story appeared I got a call from Kelly, a San
Francisco man with AIDS who got himself enrolled in an experimental
program to receive Proleukin as a supplement to his other AIDS
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   I knew Kelly from a story I wrote last year, when he was trying
to get Blue Shield to cover his Proleukin treatments. The insurance
company refused to pay for what is still an experimental therapy.
But Kelly was pleased to report that he had circumvented that
roadblock by enrolling in a clinical trial program in which Chiron
footed the $5,000 cost for a year's worth of Proleukin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to giving me an update on his situation _ ``I'm
still here,'' he said cheerily _ Kelly passed on this intelligence
about Proleukin's treatment regimen and side effects.
</P>
<P>
   He takes the drug through self-injection, over a period of five
days, and each time he gets flu and cold symptoms _ headaches,
chills, etc. _ which he controls with pain relievers and other
remedies. These symptoms clear up after a few days. Kelly isn't
sure if his symptoms are typical of other patients in the trial. In
any event, doctors reduced his Proleukin dosage to lessen the
fluish effects.
</P>
<P>
   On the upside, the booster shots seem to be paying off. Kelly
e-mailed me records of his T-cell count. Doctors use blood tests to
count these disease-fighting cells, and gauge how far AIDS has gone
in attacking the immune system. The higher the T-cell count, the
healthier the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Before Kelly began the Proleukin treatments, his T-cell counts
were hovering under 170, toward the worrisome end of the spectrum
though not immediately life-threatening. Since beginning his
Proleukin shots a year ago, Kelly's T-cell count has risen
steadily, and now stands around 345.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's seems to be working for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly couldn't resist a jab at Blue Shield, pointing out that
the cost of the year's treatment is less than what it would cost
for a couple of days in the hospital, where he might have landed
had his T-cell count stayed at the lower levels.
</P>
<P>
   A Blue Shield spokesman noted that when Kelly's request for
payment was denied, outside medical experts advised the insurance
company that the immune system connection was unproven. Since then,
no other AIDS patient has asked Blue Shield to cover the cost of
Proleukin booster shots, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD FIGHT: The Senate seems poised to approve a bill that would
prevent states and municipalities from enacting food labeling
requirements that did not conform to federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, S. 1155, has more than 30 co-sponsors,
including Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. It would stop
states from requiring manufacturers to label genetically modified
foods.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of genetically engineered foods hope the Senate will
bring the bill to a floor vote and, if it passes, fold it into a
Senate-House conference committee, which could make it law.
Opponents of genetically engineered foods are concerned that
passage of this federal act would thwart their efforts to get
states like California to impose labeling requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Cohen, senior staff attorney for the Center for Science
in the Public Interest, said a vote on the measure could come at
any time.
</P>
<P>
   On a related front, opponents of genetically engineered foods
are still waiting for federal District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly
to rule on a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration's process for regulating genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mendelson, an attorney with the Center for Food Safety, one
of the groups that brought the case, said it was a year ago last
week that final arguments were submitted. If successful, the
challenge could overturn the current regulatory process.
</P>
<P>
   BIOTECH PORK: A few weeks ago I reported that the biotech
industry was seeking three tax breaks from the California
Legislature. In the horse-trading that produced the final state
budget, the industry got two of the favors it had sought _ a boost
in the state's R&AMP;D tax credit from 12 to 15 percent, and an
increase in the amount of time firms can carry forward losses until
they are profitable and therefore need the deductions.

   The R&AMP;D credit really meant more to Silicon Valley than to
biotech, but the carry-forward provision was particularly important
to biotech firms, which can run in the red for a decade. The old
law allowed five- to eight-year carry-forwards, and biotech
interests were pleased that a bill carried by Assemblyman Ted
Lempert, D-San Carlos, extended that to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The third tax break sought by biotech didn't make it into this
year's budget. The vast majority of biotech firms lose money and so
tax breaks are meaningless. The red-ink firms would like to trade
certain tax breaks with the few biotech firms that do have earnings
_ and tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators were reluctant to embrace such a novel concept last
year, but lobbyists are nothing if not patient, and biotech
promoters will doubtless return to Sacramento next year in hopes of
convincing lawmakers that the state's biotech firms need and
deserve this additional break.

   BLOOD READ: Alert Chronicle readers found a hole in my article
last week about a new technology that inactivates viruses and
bacteria in blood that is donated for transfusions. (``Pathogens
Glued Shut,'' July 10).
</P>
<P>
   The technology uses chemicals that seek out and bind to nucleic
acids _ the scientific name for the active molecules in DNA and
RNA.
</P>
<P>
   I avoid unfamiliar scientific terms wherever possible, so
instead of referring to nucleic acids, I described how the
technology worked on DNA, which is a double-strand molecule,
resembling a twisted ladder. The chemicals lock the two halves of
DNA together, preventing it from replicating and stopping the
infection.
</P>
<P>
   But, as several puzzled readers pointed out, some viruses are
made of RNA, a single-strand nucleic acid. So how could this
chemical process lock them up?
</P>
<P>
   As I should have explained last week, these blood-cleansing
chemicals handcuff RNA in a similar way. When RNA is between
replication cycles, it curls up like a garden hose. The chemicals
in the blood-cleaning process trap RNA in this curled state. Since
RNA has to uncurl to replicate, the process kills the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Writing is the art of simplification. In this case, however, I
oversimplified, as several readers _ including Gerry Hill, Patricia
Hamm, Marshall Dinowitz and Mina Davenport _ e-mailed me to point
out.

 ORACLE TAKES SOME HITS  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Oracle Corp., the mammoth
database-softwaremaker, isn't exactly in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   But after a string of unusual announcements and some catch-up
maneuvers by a couple of competitors, some wonder whether the
Redwood Shores, Calif., firm is as invincible as it seemed a few
short months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The chief concern among those who follow Oracle is the loss of
its steady-at-the-helm president and chief operating officer, Ray
Lane. Late last month, Lane resigned after the company's flamboyant
chief executive Larry Ellison _ who has taken a more active role in
Oracle's day-to-day operations over the past year _ took over most
of Lane's remaining duties.
</P>
<P>
   Though most expected Lane's eventual departure, the move shocked
Wall Street and sent the company's stock down almost 10 percent in
the two days after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before Lane's abrupt resignation, Ellison confirmed
the company had hired investigators to look into groups with
potential ties to Microsoft, highlighting the high-stakes game
between the world's two most powerful software companies.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more.
</P>
<P>
   Though Oracle's fourth-quarter earnings surged 76 percent and
handily beat analysts' expectations, growth in its flagship
business _ database software _ didn't. Pair that with some new and
improved products from rivals, and some analysts question whether
Oracle is faltering just as Ellison is promising to boot Microsoft
from the No. 1 softwaremaker spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put it all together, there's a lot of tarnish on a
previously shiny software company,'' said Joshua Greenbaum, an
analyst at Berkeley, Calif.'s Enterprise Applications Consulting.
``In no way is Oracle dead, but it's not as pristine as it was two
months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Oracle insists that the furor over Lane's departure and the
``Dumpster diving'' are overblown. It also says Ellison warned
analysts that the company would no longer offer steep discounts
late in the quarter, a policy that hurt fourth-quarter database
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had an incredible run for the past 18 months, and it's
easy to take potshots at a company that's been on such a great
ride,'' said Oracle spokeswoman Jennifer Glass.
</P>
<P>
   However, some analysts suspect there may be more than backlash _
and the spring correction in the tech sector _ behind the recent
dip in the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   For one, many saw Lane as Oracle's compass. Whereas Ellison is
the dreamer who can afford to be ``the gadfly, the fighter pilot,''
according to Greenbaum, many credit Lane with lending the company
professionalism and establishing relationships with big customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ray and Larry show worked well because there was a yin and
yang relationship there,'' Greenbaum said. ``Ellison is a
visionary; he's everything you want at the top of the company. But
he's not necessarily the person you want to have doing the
day-to-day operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that's exactly what Oracle needs as it tries to
tailor its software to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has changed, and the company's entire focus has shifted
into areas where Larry is reasonably the expert,'' said Bob
Austrian, an analyst at Bank of America. ``A year ago that wasn't
true. But today, Oracle is about vision and e-business software and
less about operations and services. Oracle is on a roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lane's departure will leave a void, said SG Cowen analyst
Andrew Brosseau.
</P>
<P>
   Lane ``understood industry dynamics well and was effective at
closing big deals,'' he said. ``That's probably more than anything
where they're going to miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   Now more than ever, it appears, the company needs Lane's
attention to detail and ability to execute on Ellison's often-brash
promises.
</P>
<P>
   Database software, the workhorse programs that corporations use
to collect and track hoards of data, has been Oracle's mainstay.
And in the past year, the segment has served Oracle extremely well
as more and more Internet-connected companies like Amazon.com look
to store information on sales and inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Oracle took it a step further, proclaiming _ loudly _
that its ``e-business suite'' of applications that automate
financial, human resources and other tasks would let any company
take advantage of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Investors listened and Oracle's stock price soared fourfold
since late last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's follow-through time. In May _ almost seven months late
_ the company released 11i, a suite of business applications that
sits on top of a company's database software.
</P>
<P>
   While the suite is an ``OK starting point, there are a variety
of pieces that they don't have yet,'' said David Yockelson, an
analyst at the Meta Group in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Although Oracle has been promising to be a one-stop shop for
e-business needs, Yockelson said the company falls short of that.
``Oracle's been saying it has everything for a long time _ and
they're not the only company that does that. But there is a
pattern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle's stock is still up dramatically, compared with a year
ago, but it has fallen about 12 percent since earnings were
released June 20. Oracle stock closed Friday at $76.13, up 38
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that may stem from some of Oracle's competitors, who are
often quick to seize on, and publicize, any apparent chink in the
company's armor.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasanton, Calif.'s PeopleSoft last week announced PeopleSoft
8, what it calls the first ``pure'' Internet-based software for
managing customer service, manufacturing, accounting and other
operations. Though Oracle touts its business applications' roots in
the Internet, PeopleSoft officials and analysts say bits of Oracle
code still reside on the desktops of the employees using the
software.
</P>
<P>
   But Terilyn Palanca, a Giga Information Group analyst who worked
at Oracle in the late 1980s and early 1990s, says Oracle should be
less worried about PeopleSoft and more concerned about IBM Corp.'s
threat to its bread and butter. The Armonk, N.Y., firm has made a
major investment in database development. In addition, IBM's DB2
software can cost half of what an Oracle database costs, and the
company has a warmer, fuzzier relationship with customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a sweet time in the market for Oracle. Will
it last forever, who knows?'' Palanca said. ``If I were Larry and I
had this behemoth IBM sitting behind me, I'd be scared to death.''

MALONE, JOHNSON DESERVE THE BLAME

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers have more questions than
Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   They have plenty of millionaires, thank you, but they have no
ready answers for any of the queries lying at their cleats. The
middle of July finds them not sinking in the National League West
as much as floating, bobbing on the surface and getting nowhere
fast. They could use a lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   The longest winning streak of the season has been six games, and
that was two months ago. Since June 22, they are 8-13 and have seen
San Francisco zip by them in the division and the Angels take two
of three from them in the first post-All-Star series.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want perspective on the Dodgers' status, align
their record (46-44) alongside those of the financially-deprived
Expos (43-45) and Marlins (46-45). That sound you hear is your head
shaking in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult question facing the Dodgers may be, ``Where
does one start fixing things?'' It may be preferable from a fan's
perspective to start on the field, but Gary Sheffield and friends
have a lot less to do with the situation than one would think.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Malone and Davey Johnson are the fellows who put this team
together after Fox needed only six months to torch 41 years of
tradition and goodwill. As much as one may like reminding the
Foxies of this, it's been two years, more than enough time to chart
a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   The one blazed by the general manager and manager has gotten the
Dodgers nowhere. People inside the franchise know it and sides are
being taken, although a handful are bright enough to distance
themselves from both wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Daly, who casts the biggest shadow as the club's new CEO,
took a side this week when he said Malone's job was safe. It took
Johnson less than two days to start a campaign for his own job by
intimating he's being prepped as the fall guy.
</P>
<P>
   Daly has restored a lot of the team's credibility after becoming
a minority owner and being named CEO, but keeping Malone around
would test it. Malone hasn't made a single good move since becoming
GM in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Want a list?
</P>
<P>
   1. Publicly said he would deliver Felipe Alou as manager and
didn't, leading the Foxies to select Johnson even though he wasn't
Malone's second choice.
</P>
<P>
   2. Signed Devon White to a three-year contract even though the
outfielder would be 36 in 1999. White hit .268 last season and has
been injured most of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   3. Signed a 34-year-old pitcher, Kevin Brown, to a seven-year,
$105 million deal. Not only did it break the previous free-agent
ceiling, but it was $15 million more than the next best deal on the
table. Brown's a stud, but for how long?
</P>
<P>
   4. Traded a Gold Glove catcher, Charles Johnson (.302, 20 homers
in 2000) to the Mets for a catcher, Todd Hundley, coming off elbow
surgery. Hundley hit .207 last year, and while he's hitting .316
with 17 home runs in 2000, he's been ailing the last two months and
has thrown out only seven of 49 base stealers.
</P>
<P>
   5. Signed Carlos Perez, who had shoulder surgery in 1996 and one
winning season in his career, to a $15 million, three-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   6. Traded Dave Mlicki and Mel Rojas to Detroit for Robinson
Checo in a financially-motivated deal.
</P>
<P>
   7. Traded Raul Mondesi for Shawn Green in a deal suggested and
bartered by the agent for both players. Mondy's having a fine year
on a team (Toronto) in playoff contention. Green has played well
but he hasn't magically changed the standings.
</P>
<P>
   8. Traded a starting pitcher, Ismael Valdes, and the team's
second baseman and leadoff hitter, Eric Young, for a setup man,
Terry Adams, in another financially-motivated trade.
</P>
<P>
   In summation, he's been used by two agents, traded two starting
pitchers, signed two free agents in their late 30s to multiyear
deals, and retained and obtained two players with medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   It's just my opinion, but I don't keep Malone around waiting for
the ninth wonder of his world. The aggregate of all of these deals
has backed the team in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the eight highest-paid players on the team were
obtained or signed under Malone's watch, the only exception being
Sheffield, who renegotiated his deal after he was obtained in the
Mike Piazza deal. The only player on this list who was part of the
team at the start of the 1998 season is Eric Karros.
</P>
<P>
   The aggregate payroll of Brown, Sheffield, Green and Karros is
$45 million a year, and the years on their contracts make them
untradeable. Hundley, Jeff Shaw, Perez and White make another $20
million per year, and their age or ailments make them untradeable.
</P>
<P>
   This is why young players like Darren Dreifort and Adrian Beltre
are the only ones ever mentioned in trade talks, because they're
the only players other teams want or can afford.
</P>
<P>
   It's also why four rookies are on the roster (Eric Gagne, Alex
Cora, Matt Herges, Paul LoDuca), and why four non-roster players
(Mike Fetters, Chad Kreuter, Kevin Elster, Geronimo Berroa) made
the team, and why journeymen like F.P. Santangelo, Jim Leyritz and
Gregg Olson are still employed.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the Dodgers' roster hasn't looked this bad since
the years between the Koufax-Drysdale and the Lopes-Garvey-Cey
eras.
</P>
<P>
   All this shouldn't be viewed as tacit support for Johnson. The
manager certainly deserves some consideration for being dealt a bad
hand, and his visit to a hospital Sunday to check out an irregular
heartbeat is surely job-related.
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't lived up to his reputation as a can-do manager. He
played his own role in Raul Mondesi's departure, supported the
Hundley trade because he was desperate for a left-handed hitter,
vexed a few pitchers on the team with some of his decisions, and
didn't make Orel Hershiser feel at home in his bid to keep pitching
at 41.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers say they want to be a player in the Alex Rodriguez
sweepstakes, but is there room for another $15 million-plus salary
at the top of roster on a team that's already out balance? Plus, do
they really need another middle-of-the-order hitter?
</P>
<P>
   Worse, what if Rodriguez announces he doesn't want to play for
the Dodgers because he's not sure the team can win? Now there's a
$64,000 question I don't want answered.

CLINTON BREAKS NEWS BLACKOUT TO VOICE OPTIMISM ON MIDEAST TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to update top of story with remarks by Clinton; story is now
an added starter on The New York Times front page)  By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ President Clinton violated a White House news
blackout at the Camp David summit meeting on Sunday night when he
told the New York Daily News that he was ``more optimistic'' about
reaching an agreement than when the talks opened six days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the comments after he was informed of the
opportunity to call the Daily News and answer questions about
allegations in a book that his wife Hillary made anti-Semitic
remarks more than two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, P.J. Crowley, said that after talking
about Mrs. Clinton, the president answered two questions about the
Middle East summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I`m more optimistic than I was when they got there,'' the
president said. ``We might make it. I don't know. God, it's hard.
It's like nothing I've ever dealt with, all the negotiations with
the Irish, all the stuff I've done with the Palestinians before,
and with the Israelis, the Balkans at Dayton.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, the president said: ``What's
really troubling is they know if they make a peace agreement, half
of their constitutients will have to be angry at them for a while.
But I would be totally misleading if I said I had an inkling that a
deal is at hand. That's just not true. But we're slogging.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was going on his scheduled trip to Japan on
Wednesday, Clinton replied: ``I hope so. I'm going to do my best to
finish here.''
</P>
<P>
   As the scheduled departure for that trip begins to crowd in on
the Camp David summit talks, the stream of chatter by Israelis and
Palestinians on the outside who say they know what is going on
inside rose steadily on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And what they say _ some of it gloomy, some of it upbeat, and
all of it calculated to influence opinion back home in the Middle
East _ is that it is still too early to tell whether there will be
an agreement at all or, if there is one, what kind of agreement it
will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it is impossible to know where it is heading,'' said
an official who has spoken to participants by telephone. ``That's
the good news.''
</P>
<P>
   A common assumption was that it would not be clear until
Tuesday, the eve of Clinton's scheduled departure for Japan,
whether the talks are ``going in the right direction or not,'' the
official added.
</P>
<P>
   Only then would the White House decide whether the talks were
ripe enough to warrant keeping Clinton at Camp David and sending
Vice President Al Gore to the meeting in Okinawa of the leaders of
the world's major industrial nations. Clinton is scheduled to leave
on Wednesday to join other leaders there and meet the Russian
president, Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been saying since the opening of the summit
meeting that Clinton would go to Okinawa. But in the lead-up to
Camp David, and in private, Clinton administration officials have
said that, for the president, the Okinawa trip was not necessarily
written in stone.
</P>
<P>
   One reason it is still premature to assess whether there will be
any kind of accord is that, so far, there has been no real test of
wills, according to those who have spoken to participants. Arafat
and Barak have not yet been through a major blowup on the substance
of the issues, the officials said. Those issues are the most
nettlesome separating the two sides, including borders, water
rights, the fate of Palestinian refugees and what to do about
Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim as their
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Only if a ``big crisis'' occurred _ a threat to walk out, a
defiant refusal to compromise on an issue _ could it be known
whether there was going to be a breakdown or a breakthrough, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently there was what one official called a ``small crisis''
involving Arafat when he was presented with some proposals on
resolving the status of Jerusalem. The Palestinians let it be known
that Arafat threatened to leave because the proposals, apparently
presented by the Americans, were too close to the Israeli public
position.
</P>
<P>
   But one Palestinian official said the flare-up appeared to be
tactical. If he is to compromise, Arafat, who has insisted for
decades that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a Palestinian
state, could not afford to stay hidden at Camp David and then
emerge having deviated significantly from his stance, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, where tens of thousands of demonstrators marched in
Rabin Square in Tel Aviv against proposals that would allow some
settlements to remain inside a Palestinian state, there was a flow
of gloomy talk.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister, David Levy, who refused to come to the
summit meeting with Barak, said the gaps between the parties
remained as wide as ever. The justice minister, Yossi Beilin, who
tends to be less harsh in his judgments, told Israeli radio, ``It
is hard at this point to give some kind of impression of optimism
more than yesterday, or the day before yesterday, because there has
been no breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, the mayor, Ehud Olmert, held a meeting at City
Hall to express concern about the future of the city. Eli Yishair,
the leader of the Shas Party, which quit Barak's government just
before the prime minister's departure for Camp David, told the
gathering: ``The president of the United States has to understand
that here, the people of Israel are mostly united. Most of the
people are against dividing Jerusalem. Most of the people are for a
united Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   A Cabinet minister, Haim Ramon, again spoke out about Jerusalem
on Sunday, sending a warning that concessions on the city were
impossible and that, as he has often stated, the future status of
Jerusalem should be decided at another time.
</P>
<P>
   And in keeping with this fairly stern line from the home front,
Israel radio reported that the Israeli delegation at Camp David
believed that Palestinian officials were spreading upbeat
interpretations about the talks in order to avoid blame for a
breakdown.

KREUTER CONSIDERS SUING CHICAGO FAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chad Kreuter's eight-game suspension is over, but
the Dodgers catcher isn't ready to forgive and forget in regards to
the May 16 incident at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter said Sunday he is considering filing a lawsuit against
the Chicago man who allegedly struck him in the head and took his
cap, which ignited a brawl with fans in the stands and led to mass
suspensions and fines for Dodgers players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter, who has not retained a lawyer or discussed the matter
with agent Scott Boras, said he would sue the man to recover the
cost of the team's fines. Kreuter received the stiffest punishment,
a $5,000 fine and an eight-game suspension, which ended Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will definitely seek him out and make sure that he is held
accountable,'' Kreuter said. ``He should be responsible for each
and every fine that was leveled on myself and my teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gone into hiding, but he will resurface, and when we find
him, he'll find himself in a lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   He's back: Teammates cowered and covered their faces in mock
fear as Mark Grudzielanek grinned sheepishly and walked to his
locker in the Dodgers' clubhouse Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, who had missed the previous six games with a
mysterious viral infection, pinch hit in the seventh inning and
struck out. He said he might be able to return to the starting
lineup today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a (heck) of a week,'' Grudzielanek said. ``I really
felt like jumping out of a window for a while there.''
</P>
<P>
   The illness came at an unfortunate time for Grudzielanek, who
had rebounded from a slow offensive start to lift his batting
average over .300 at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Cora has been a capable defensive replacement at second
base, but the Dodgers miss Grudzielanek's bat at the second spot in
the batting order.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek has been more concerned about being able to eat
solid foods, which he finally accomplished Friday. He estimated a
loss of 8-10 pounds because of the illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it was kind of scary, because I'd never experienced
anything like that before,'' Grudzielanek said. ``The doctors
didn't know what it was, so I was afraid it might be serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was 90 years old. I couldn't even get out of
bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Late scratch: F.P. Santangelo, scheduled to start in center
field, was removed from the lineup because of a contusion on his
left hand, which he suffered Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Cora was moved to the leadoff spot and Todd Hollandsworth
started in center field. Santangelo pinch hit in the eighth inning
Sunday and grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Todd Hundley (fractured thumb) took batting
practice Sunday and might return to the starting lineup today. ...
A baseball rarity occurred Sunday, when catchers Paul LoDuca and
Jason Kendall both batted in the No.2 spot in their teams' batting
order. ... Center fielder Devon White, on the disabled list since
May 5 with a partial tear in his left rotator cuff, participated in
a special batting practice session with Dodgers coach Rick Dempsey
before the game and could be activated later this week. ...
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Gregg Olson, sidelined since mid-April with a strained
right forearm, walked one and struck out one in a scoreless inning
for Triple-A Albuquerque on Saturday night. ... Starting pitcher
Carlos Perez began his five-game suspension Sunday for the Wrigley
Field incident. The Dodgers are expected to recall Mike Judd from
Albuquerque to start Tuesday's game.

DODGERS' JOHNSON HOSPITALIZED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers' tumultuous season took another
dramatic turn Sunday morning when manager Davey Johnson was
hospitalized due to dizziness caused by an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 57, remains at Centinela Hospital in Inglewood, where
doctors await test results to determine the cause of his
accelerated heart rate.
</P>
<P>
   Team physician Dr. Michael F. Mellman stressed that Johnson did
not have a heart attack and ``is safe, and not in any danger,'' but
could not offer a timetable for Johnson's return. Bench coach Jim
Tracy will manage the team on an interim basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I recall, Davey went through a similar situation four or
five years ago,'' said Mellman, who could not recall the specifics
of Johnson's medical history. ``We'll know a lot more in the next
day or two, but until then I can't comment on his recovery time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellman said he received a phone call Sunday morning from
Johnson, who complained of discomfort in his chest. On Mellman's
advice, Johnson's wife, Susan, drove him from their La Canada
Flintridge home to a hospital in Verdugo Hills at approximately 9
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's future with the Dodgers, who are just two games over
.500 after Sunday's victory over Pittsburgh, has been questioned
recently, leading to talk Sunday about whether rumors about his
status may have contributed to Johnson's health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I talked to him, a few days ago, he was down,''
Dodgers general managing partner and CEO Bob Daly said. ``He thinks
the team should be doing a lot better too. We're all feeling
pressure over this.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our manager, and we need him desperately. This is not
like losing a pitcher for a day. We need our leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy, who last managed in 1994 with Montreal's Triple-A team in
Ottawa, held two closed-door meetings with his players before
Sunday's game as the Dodgers attempted to maintain some sense of
normalcy amid the confusion and concern for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of shocked,'' reliever Jeff Shaw said. ``But from
what I understand, this might be something that just flared up on
him and it's not all that serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's still scary, because he had to go to the hospital.
Any time you have to go to the hospital, you know it's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have been through this sort of thing before,
although not many of the current players were around in 1996 when
then-manager Tom Lasorda suffered a heart attack and subsequently
retired to take a front-office job.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Dodgers have already dealt with a bizarre brawl with
Wrigley Field fans in May, in additional to various player
injuries, but several team members talked about gaining a sense of
perspective from Johnson's health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all very concerned about Davey and his condition,'' said
bullpen coach Rick Dempsey, one of Johnson's closest friends in the
organization. ``As much as he tries to tell us that (the team's
struggles) doesn't bother him, it does. It bothers all of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the game a long time, probably longer than
anybody here, and I've never seen a manager better than him. I
learn something new from him every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers remained hopeful that Johnson's absence could serve
as a rallying point for a team in search of some type of spark.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game, in which the Dodgers rallied with a five-run
eighth inning, was a first step in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we can pick up the slack and start playing the way
we're capable of playing,'' Dempsey said.

DODGERS STAGE INSPIRED RALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It took the Dodgers eight innings to craft their
get-well gift to manager Davey Johnson, but the finished product
was quite a thing to behold.
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson in the hospital, undergoing tests for an irregular
heartbeat, the Dodgers rallied for six runs in the eighth and beat
the Pittsburgh Pirates 7-3 in front of 34,116 Sunday night at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal,'' said right fielder Shawn Green, who singled and
scored in the eighth, ``is to get on a hot streak and make things a
lot more pleasant for Davey, and for us too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers achieved their goal, at least temporarily, and
avoided falling to .500 for the first time since early April, but
they needed some late heroics to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dodgers trailing 3-1, catcher Paul LoDuca led off the
eighth with a walk, moved to second on a wild pitch and to third on
Green's single, and scored on Gary Sheffield's single to left.
</P>
<P>
   That opened the flood gates, and the Dodgers hammered Pittsburgh
reliever Jeff Williams (2-2), who entered the game in relief of
Jason Christiansen after Green's single but couldn't record an out.
</P>
<P>
   The big hit came when Todd Hollandsworth singled to right with
the bases loaded, and Williams was finally pulled when Kevin Elster
followed with a run-scoring single. Chris Peters got the next two
outs but gave up the final run on a RBI single by LoDuca.
</P>
<P>
   The genesis of the rally, however, may have come an inning
earlier. Pittsburgh starter Jimmy Anderson allowed just two hits
through six innings but gave up an unearned run and allowed four
baserunners in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Dodgers interim manager Jim Tracy sent up Mark
Grudzielanek as a pinch hitter. Grudzielanek, who had missed the
previous six games with a viral infection, was still weak, but his
.303 batting average no doubt convinced Pittsburgh manager Gene
Lamont to make a pitching change.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek struck out, but the Dodgers fared much better
against the Pirates' weak bullpen than they did against Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Anderson) threw a great game,'' Green said, ``so it was great
to come back and score (six) in the eighth. That gave us a big
boost.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy, normally the Dodgers' bench coach, also made a gutsy
decision in the sixth when he stuck with starter Eric Gagne. Wil
Cordero led off the inning with a home run to give Pittsburgh a 3-0
lead, and the Pirates loaded the bases with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   With Anderson at the plate, Tracy stayed with Gagne, who came
back from a 3-1 count and induced a ground ball to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that other than the eighth, that was the key to the
game,'' Tracy said. ``He wound up getting the strikeout and keeping
it at 3-0. A walk or a base hit might have taken the wind out of
our sails.''
</P>
<P>
   Gagne allowed six hits and three runs in six innings, but Matt
Herges, Terry Adams (4-3) and Mike Fetters each pitched a scoreless
inning of relief to help set up and preserve the rally.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, all of the thoughts centered on Johnson, whose
condition will be better determined today when team physicians
examine the results of the manager's tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davey is a very special person to me,'' Sheffield said. ``He's
like a father figure. He showed me a lot of respect from the
beginning, and I show him a lot of respect in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard about him being rushed to the hospital ... I had
to pull over and say a little prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can turn this thing around, win some ballgames and make him
feel a lot better.''

A FOOT NOTE TO RAUDMAN'S WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A broken left foot isn't conducive to an auto
racer staying comfortable on a road course with constant braking
required.
</P>
<P>
   Ask NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series veteran Craig Raudman,
who broke his foot in an April 29 NASCAR Winston West accident at
Fontana's California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The crash kept the 38-year-old Bakersfield resident out of his
car for almost all of the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Raudman, bum foot and all, handled a brutal L.A. Street Race
course to win Sunday's Southwest Series event at Exposition Park.
</P>
<P>
   After undergoing extensive physical therapy, Raudman ran half of
last month's Southwest race at Sears Point before excruciating pain
forced him to vacate the driver's seat in favor of his brother
Chris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard. I don't want to see anybody driving my race car.
It's really frustrating to have a hurt foot. I just can't believe
what it does to you,'' said Raudman, whose win Sunday was the
eighth of his Southwest tour career.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring his injuries healed, Raudman overcame a one-mile
course that took its toll on the field. Starting fourth, he slipped
past Eric Holmes during a lap 76 yellow-flag dash to the
start-finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Points leader Matt Crafton straddled the rear bumper of
Raudman's Chevrolet Monte Carlo but couldn't make a pass over the
final eight of 125 total laps. Raudman's margin of victory was two
seconds over Crafton.
</P>
<P>
   Raudman's reward for surviving a track that brought out 11
caution flags for 49 laps was a Southwest Series-record-winning
purse of $18,175.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fun because you can drive these tracks so hard,'' said
Raudman, one of the tour's top road course performers. ``I enjoy
the shifting and the hard braking and the turning.''
</P>
<P>
   Others didn't have such a positive review of the one-mile track
that circles the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven of 36 cars finished on the lead lap and 20 completed
the race. Agua Dulce's Bob Lyon, despite brake problems and a
collision with Jeff Hill on pit row, limped home in 13th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the track was really poor. There's just some
constraints with tightness and curves. Unless you want to tear down
part of the Coliseum and the Sports Arena ... you're not going to
change that,'' Lyon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show was just doomed. I think NASCAR fans ... deserve a
better show.''
</P>
<P>
   Pole sitter Greg Pursley of Newhall led the first 31 laps and
had a strong car but like many of the participants was a victim of
bad breaks. Pursley scraped the wall in turn four of lap 91, pitted
but came back to place 11th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even pushing it yet. I mean we had a fast car,'' said
Pursley, who has yet to win here despite starting on the pole the
past three years. ``I was trying to save it.''
</P>
<P>
   Saugus' Sean Woodside, fourth in points, had similar rear-axle
trouble that forced him to take a provisional starting spot
Saturday. He finished 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland Hills' Nick Joanides came in 10th, Quartz Hill's Frank
Maronski Jr. 15th and Frazier Park's MK Kanke 21st.
</P>
<P>
   In other L.A. Street Race events:
</P>
<P>
   Ultra Wheels Spec Trucks: Vince Little of Clovis passed points
leader Mike David of Modesto on lap 15 to post his fifth win of the
season in a 29-lap non-points race. Santa Clarita's Steve McCord
was seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Race Series: Harry Rady of La Jolla won the 36-lap race.
Steve Cross of Hidden Hills finished second.
</P>
<P>
   North-South Pro Trucks: Ron Swartzbaugh of Vista took the
checkered flag in the 28-lap race win his second consecutive L.A.
Street Race.
</P>
<P>
   Cobra Cup Series: Dan Luckow of Tarzana finished second to
Dennis Olthoff of North Carolina. Jay Parille of Sherman Oaks was
11th in an 11-lap race.

SWIMMING FAVORITES TAKE CHARGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Life in the pool returned to normal Sunday for the
final day of the Janet Evans Invitational. No upstart teens upset
any world-record holders.
</P>
<P>
   Just the world-class swimmers taking care of business in this,
the last major meet before the U.S. Olympic Trials.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Krayzelburg of USC, the world-record holder in the 100-
meter backstroke, won easily and set a meet record in 54.60
seconds, breaking his two-year mark.
</P>
<P>
   And Jenny Thompson of Stanford, who hasn't lost a national or
international 100-meter butterfly race since 1997, continued her
streak by setting a meet record during qualifying, then winning the
event in a slightly slower time.
</P>
<P>
   It was Krayzelburg who made big news on Friday when he lost the
200 backstroke - another event in which he holds the world record -
to 16-year-old Aaron Peirsol.
</P>
<P>
   Peirsol was entered in the 100 on Sunday, but he never was a
factor. Krayzelburg got off to a strong start and won going away in
a time one second off his world record.
</P>
<P>
   Peirsol broke badly and finished sixth in 56.78.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are entitled to one bad swim,'' Krayzelburg said.
``I'm still where I need to be. I'm really happy with this time.
Obviously, I was a bit down on Friday, but you have to put a race
like that behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding two world records has put pressure on Krayzelburg. He
knows it but can't do much about it, since he knows swimmers are
judged by what they do in the Olympics. Krayzelburg never has swam
in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't win two gold medals as an individual, my career
will be very disappointing,'' he said. ``I got a shot in a relay,
so if I don't win three gold medals, I'll be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's 100 butterfly streak dates to the 1997 Summer
Nationals, although she doesn't know how many meets that covers.
</P>
<P>
   What she knows is she broke her year-old meet record when she
qualified in 58.37 seconds. Later, she won the event in 58.48.
</P>
<P>
   She thought she could have finished under 58 seconds had she not
taken in a mouthful of water as she approached the finish.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she has no complaints. She set an American record on
Friday in the 100 freestyle, finished a close second to Dara Torres
in the 50 freestyle and set a meet record in the 100 butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there was that fourth-place finish in the 200 freestyle, but
that's her off event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meet was really good for me mentally,'' Thompson said. ``I
think it's a great springboard for what will happen at trials.''
</P>

   Another swimmer excited about the trials is Cal's Staciana
Stitts, who won the 100 butterfly in 1:09.49, just .33 slower than
her personal best; and in finishing fifth in the 200 individual
medley, she swam a personal-best 2:19.15.

   In other events, Westlake graduate Jason Weber, now swimming at
Brown and representing Conejo-Simi Aquatics, finished fourth in the
100 backstroke bonus final. He was the top qualifier for the bonus
final after swimming 59.70, but he slowed to 59.83 in the final.

SUMMER LEAGUE IS TRAINING GROUND FOR REFEREES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ ``TWEET''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Nakasone raises her hand. She takes a look at the two
players on the ground in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``White four-zero,'' says Nakasone who has put both hands on her
waste to signal a blocking foul.
</P>
<P>
   While the players on the floor are looking to improve, Nakasone,
a WNBA and NCAA official from Costa Mesa, is at the Summer Pro
League working on her officiating game. She's one of 27 referees
attending a 13 day officiating camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to learn a little bit more about the game and to
better my skills,'' said Nakasone, who has been a referee for six
years, and is an NCAA and WNBA referee.
</P>
<P>
   Referees in the camp at the Pyramid range from NCAA, CBA and
WNBA levels. Aside from becoming better, most of the referees are
hoping to impress and move into the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   That's not easy. There are only 60 NBA referee jobs and a
handful are filled each year. Camps, like the one at the Pyramid,
provide a major opportunity for upcoming referees to give an
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do is bring out candidates who are in our program for
training,'' said Lee Jones, supervisor of officials for the NBA.
``They can only get better from coming to our camp. They are trying
to come up to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Those in the camp go through class in the morning and work the
games at the summer league. Up in a corner of the Pyramid, current
NBA officials watch the game with one official critiquing the play
as it happens.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the officials watch the tape to see how they can
improve.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of things Jones, who was an official for 25
years, looks at to evaluate an official: physical fitness, running
ability up and down the court, and presentation on the court. He
said that making good calls also fits into the evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have college officials who are trying to get into the
league,'' said Lee Jones, supervisor of officials for the NBA. ``We
want to see if they fit in with our program.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakasone played basketball at Cypress Junior College and then
entered into officiating. She began at the high school level and
then progressed up to the NCAA and to the WNBA this season.
</P>
<P>
   While officials like Jones are watching, her goal each game is
not to be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope to apply the rules in a fair manner,'' Nakasone said,
``so both teams have a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Officiating is) a challenge because no game is the same. It's
a challenge in management skills.''
</P>
<P>
   NOT KOBE OR MAGIC
</P>
<P>
   There were rumors that Kobe Bryant and/or Magic Johnson would
show up for the game between Bryant's Olimpia Milano and Johnson's
team on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case and most of the fans emptied the Pyramid
before the game reached halftime. Magic's team won 101-90.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHTOWER
</P>
<P>
   Cory Hightower finished with a team-high 20 points against the
Clippers Sunday. Hightower, who entered the NBA out of junior
college, scored many of his points late in the game but continued
to impress offensively.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers lost to the Clippers 105-91.
</P>
<P>
   ROOKS WITH CLIPPERS
</P>
<P>
   Sean Rooks, acquired on draft day by the Clippers for Eric
Murdock, played in his first game with the team. Rooks was playing
out some of the summer rust and finished with six points and eight
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean brings eight or nine years experience to a very young
team,'' said Clipper coach Dennis Johnson. ``That is going to bring
maturity. He is going to say things that a coach might not be able
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of a coach, there is still no word on the Clipper
coaching vacancy.

Land &HT;    BC-HOTSPOT-AZR(a) 
 &HT;    DEVELOPERS COVET EAST VALLEY HOT SPOT(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By CHRIS FISCUS(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 45,000-plus acres are so far east they aren't even shown on
some aerial maps of the Phoenix area. Yet the desert land east of
Maricopa County on the road to Globe is already on the radar
screens of developers.
</P>
<P>
   The huge chunk with views of the Superstitions and room for tens
of thousands of homes may become the next East Valley housing hot
spot. When developed, it could consume more land than Washington,
D.C. One real estate analyst suggests the remote area about 35
miles southeast of downtown Phoenix could eventually resemble
sprawling residential communities such as Desert Ridge in northeast
Phoenix or Anthem along Interstate 17 in north Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   And all this at a time when much of the development in the
Phoenix area seems headed to the north and northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blank canvas just waiting to be painted,'' said Stanley
Paul Cook, who monitors Arizona real estate for Landiscor Aerial
Information. ``It's the next logical leap in the development
cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Land Department, which owns the site, agrees. It
hasn't decided when to sell off most of the land, but interested
developers already call. And one has taken the first bite.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson International has applied with the state to purchase
about 1,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Developers, analysts and the Land Department said the area is
attractive because it's close to freeways and to major East Valley
employers. It's also near a large shopping mall, Superstition
Springs Center, and has mountain views. And the land likely will be
cheaper because it is so far out.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said some of it could be developed within five years.
</P>
<P>
   The land is east of the Pinal County line and south of U.S. 60
as it curves toward Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson International plans to buy about 1,080 acres roughly
bounded by Baseline and Guadalupe roads, Ironwood Drive and
Tomahawk Road.
</P>
<P>
   Though much of the Phoenix area's growth will go to north of
Phoenix and northwest of Phoenix, builders also will continue to go
farther and farther east.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our members are looking beyond Maricopa County,'' said
Connie Wilhelm, president of the Home Builders Association of
Central Arizona, which includes the Phoenix area. ``It's a logical
progression.''
</P>
<P>
   As the development continues, she said, much of it will be on
lands like the 45,000 acres in the far East Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, our future for development is state trust land.''

 &HT;    NEW LAW REQUIRES TEACHERS' PRINTS(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By LORI BAKER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of Arizona teachers and administrators will have to
submit their fingerprints for criminal checks before renewing their
state certificates under a new law that takes effect Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new law will create a safer environment for children,''
said Craig Emanuel, chief investigator for the state Board of
Education's certification division. ``I've surveyed all 50 states
and few have such a tough requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   The new law, which will affect about 45,000 Arizona educators,
requires anyone who applies for a new certificate or who is
renewing one to be fingerprinted. Those files will be kept in a
computer so the state Department of Public Safety can be alerted if
an educator is arrested for any of a number of specific offenses.
DPS will then notify the state Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has required fingerprinting of school employees since
1990, but those who already had certificates were exempt. In
addition, DPS only began keeping fingerprints in computer files
since August and those files include no one who already had a
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of different offenses would prevent an applicant from
holding a fingerprint clearance card, including incest, child
abuse, aggravated assault, driving under the influence, domestic
violence, writing a bad check, shoplifting and forgery. In some
cases, the applicant can appeal to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an obligation to find out if there is anything out
there that we don't already know about,'' said Panfilo Contreras,
executive director of the Arizona School Boards Association.
``School districts will have to use some judgment about whether the
offenses will affect the performance of the individuals to do their
job.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes about a month for the national criminal check to be
completed so educators are encouraged to apply for certificate
renewal a few months before it expires.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another new law that took effect earlier this year
providing reciprocity for teacher applicants from 19 states that
have local and national fingerprint checks like Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call the certification division of the
Arizona State Board of Education at (602) 542-4367.

Libraries &HT;    BC-LIBRARY-AZR(a) 
 &HT;    LIBRARIES BEGINNING TO JOIN COMPUTER REVOLUTION(a)

<P>
   Facing declines in circulation and tough competition from the
Internet, libraries throughout the Valley are turning to new ways
to attract users.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, the bastions of books are using computer age
techniques. Some have begun offering electronic books. Others offer
the use of free computers and Internet access. The Phoenix Central
Library is even planning to give teens a rockin' computer center,
with loud music if they want.
</P>
<P>
   At some libraries, people just aren't checking out as many books
as they used to. In Tempe, where circulation fell 7 percent in the
past year, Director Teri Metros concedes she's a bit concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're still checking out a million items a year. We're
just in a time of great transition. You can get depressed or
excited about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa and Scottsdale libraries also reported circulation declines
of 2 or 3 percent over the past year. Circulation at Phoenix
libraries has increased. It has also risen at Chandler and
Glendale, but directors attribute that in part to new branches and
the growth of their cities.
</P>
<P>
   But while people are checking out fewer books, they're
definitely checking more into library computers. Almost 600,000
Mesa residents logged on at their libraries over the past year, an
rise of 300-plus percent.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Clements, a Kentucky amateur photographer vacationing in
Mesa, is one of several who stopped in at the Main Library in Mesa
last week to check e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a bunch of free e-mail sites on the Internet,'' he
said. He added that not all libraries offer access and you have to
shop around.
</P>
<P>
   Erma Salas of Mesa has used public computers to do genealogical
research.
</P>
<P>
   She also represents other common library computer users -
parents who take their kids, so everyone gets to use a computer.
Her son, David, 14, checked out winners of the National Academic
League, in which he participated at Carson Junior High, on one
computer. His sister, Evonne, 12, sat at another, checking details
of the (beginitalic)Survivors (enditalic)TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Moore, 65, of Mesa, has a home computer but prefers to
use the library's for e-mail because ``I'm so unsure about issues
of privacy and safety.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking three two-hour computer classes at the library, she
was venturing out on her own, researching a medical problem {ndash}
another common use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Rodeane Widom, Glendale Library director, said books can no
longer keep up with the Internet in some areas, especially in
medicine, legal advice and business(beginitalic).
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic) Magazine articles are generally available on
computer databases for five to a dozen years back.
</P>
<P>
   Circulation of children's books remain strong, and adults are
still flocking to libraries and joining waiting lists for fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand for print is still out there. We can't begin to
supply the number of bestsellers,'' Mesa Library Director Pat
Hansel said.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic) (enditalic) If electronic books take off,
libraries could see their fiction circulation go down. too. But
some libraries are going there anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe and Scottsdale libraries are offering card-holders access
to NetLibrary, a service offering about 1,500 non-fiction books.
When card-holders ``check out'' an electronic book, they don't
download it to their computer but get access to it for a day or
longer instead.
</P>
<P>
   Widom said Glendale libraries passed up e-books for now because
of the expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bestsellers are usually the things people want to read on and
off and they want to curl up with. That's not conducive to
e-books,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mesa Libraries soon plan to offer some Rocket E-Books,
which are about the size of a regular paperback book. Each one can
hold about half a dozen books, and there's a growing number of
fiction titles available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real readable,'' said Hansel, who has been testing one.
``I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the advantages is that you can read {hellip} with the
lights off if you're in bed with someone who wants the lights off.
And there's a lot more titles available than there were just six
months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Williams, 25, a network analyst assistant at the Mesa
Library, was enthusiastic about the Rocket E-Book he tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see that as it gets cheaper, it could be used in
schools. Instead of carrying {hellip}five or six textbooks, you
would just carry one.''
</P>
<P>
   As libraries give people more reasons to use computers, some
librarians wonder what where it will all lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more people get personal computers and get savvy, perhaps
we'll get less traffic. I certainly hope that's not true,'' said
Rosemary Nelson, administrator of the Central Phoenix Library.
</P>
<P>
   But Widom said, ``I don't think libraries will be out of work
for a long time because people need help with research. {hellip} A
lot of students don't have the patience we do. It's helpful to have
someone walk you through it instead of working on your own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Libraries will stay, but they will change.''

   The members of your expedition are tired, sore, grumpy, itchy,

Disney dwarfs? Heading back to campus on the last afternoon of
spring break? Or just midway through your annual family theme park
hajj? If you answered hajj, it's time for a teaching moment! This
handy site, Amusement Park Physics, reminds us that amusement park
thrills are about more than the mere conversion of credit card
limit to credit card debt. A roller coaster, for example, is all
about the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy. Wheeee!
Bumper cars and carousels also get the slide rule treatment here,

   You fill stadiums for big soccer games.
</P>
<P>
   You're the toast of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   At America West Arena on Monday, you'll stage the second WNBA
All-Star Game, a celebration of acceptance that nonetheless
struggled to fill even $10 seats.
</P>
<P>
   You've come halfway, baby.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three decades after Congress enacted Title IX and threw
the weight of law behind gender equity for amateur female athletes,
that's the official assessment of the Women's Sports Foundation, or
WSF.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're halfway'' to equity, said Donna Lopiano, executive
director of the WSF, founded by Billie Jean King in 1974 to seek
justice for women bucking the male-dominated American jockocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say halfway isn't a long way.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the year before Title IX mandated that no American
``shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any
educational program or activity receiving federal financial
assistance,'' fewer than 300,000 girls played high school sports.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, according to foundation statistics, the total was 2.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Participation in intercollegiate athletics, also regulated under
Title IX, has grown at a slower pace, but nonetheless gains have
been substantial, especially in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, athletic scholarships for women totaled less
than $100,000 nationally, according to the WSF. Currently, the
total tops $180million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the WSF's advocacy hotline averages three to four calls a
day from sports-program participants who suspect inequities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day there's a new unbelievable,'' said Lopiano.
</P>
<P>
   A classic example, close to home: Desert Vista High School
opened a few years ago in Phoenix with a sparkling baseball field
for boys but not a single softball field for girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's resistance - I think it's (lack of)
knowledge,'' said Sister Lynn Winsor, athletic director and coach
at Xavier College Prep in Phoenix. ``You go up to someone and say,
`You've got a wonderful boys' baseball facility with concrete
dugouts. And the girls are sitting on three little park benches.'
It's not that they don't want to - it's that they don't think of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Winsor, an Xavier coach and administrator for 26 years, serves
on a committee of the Arizona Interscholastic Association that
evaluates state schools for gender equity. It's not enforcement,
exactly, but rather positive reinforcement - the committee hands
out an annual prize to schools that have made the most progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look around Arizona, I think we're one of the better
states,'' said Winsor, who's also served as an officer for a
national coaches association. ``We've come a long way, especially
compared to some of the Southern states. They really have some
issues to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of change. I'm impressed by what's happening.
Sometimes change is painful, but it's for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, or
OCR, is charged with enforcing Title IX. This summer, several
Valley high schools are upgrading facilities to comply, and an OCR
spokesman said there are no open complaints in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Desert Vista softball situation wasn't resolved until a
player's father threatened a Title IX complaint. Title IX scholars
dub it the ``Mad Dad'' phenomenon - fathers who played sports as
kids who now insist on equal opportunity for their daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has definitely been a father-led movement,'' said
Lopiano. ``It's not a women's initiative at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lopiano said, the women's movement did not initially
embrace sports as a battlefront.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sport was originally how we trained men for war,'' Lopiano
said. ``They didn't think it was a healthy thing for women at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Dad was there right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, the first generation of mothers to enjoy Title
IX-decreed equality are coaching their young daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thought Dad was rabid, wait until Mom gets into it,''
she said. ``You don't want to ever see your children discriminated
against.''
</P>
<P>
   College scholarships, which drive participation at lower levels,
are viewed as crucial to the continued march toward sports equity.
Title IX requires that women be awarded scholarship dollars
proportional to their participation in a school's athletic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Another index by which schools are measured is whether the
percentage of female athletes matches the percentage of female
undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   That test has proved somewhat vexing to sports administrators at
Northern Arizona University, where female enrollment has grown from
52percent to 56 percent in the past few years. In the 1998-99
school year, 48.5 percent of NAU's student athletes were women, up
from 36 percent in the 1996-97 school year.
</P>
<P>
   One way NAU achieved its gains is a rallying point for
gender-equity critics, who point out that Title IX has been most
painful to participants in minor sports for men. To meet equity
mandates, many colleges have eliminated teams.
</P>
<P>
   Attributing the cut to Title IX, Northern Arizona University,
which had recently added soccer and golf teams for women, last year
dropped men's swimming and diving. More than 50 Division I colleges
have killed wrestling programs in the past two decades. Gymnastics,
tennis {ndash} even baseball {ndash} have been threatened or axed
at colleges around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, fiscally you have to say, We can't add another
female sports if the dollars aren't there,''' said Steve Holton,
NAU's athletic director. ``The only way to stay in compliance with
the federally mandated law is to eliminate men's sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Title IX's inception, various male-sports coaches'
associations have mounted organized opposition, and repeated
efforts have been made to exempt football from equity formulas.
According to the Women's Sports Foundation Gender Equity Report
Card for 1997, women gained a net increase of 1,658 National
Collegiate Athletic Association programs since 1978. During the
same years, total men's programs also increased, by 74. However,
schools in the NCAA's Divisions I-A and I-AA, the largest
universities that tend to have the largest athletic programs,
showed a decrease in the number of men's sports programs, a net
loss of 152.
</P>
<P>
   According to the WSF, the explosive growth in female
participation in high school sports during the past couple of
decades didn't dim growth for boys programs. In 1971, 3.6million
boys played high school sports. In 1998, 3.7million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Title IX, I really can't see the sharing of resources
that was required to really give women the opportunity to play,''
said Lopiano. ``It has been a tooth-and-nail fight every step of
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The WSF estimates that 80percent of America's college and
universities are not yet in full compliance with Title IX, though a
recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll indicates that more than
three-fourths of the sample supported the drive to equity - even if
it means further cuts in men's programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that the general public gets it,'' Lopiano
said. ``The problem is not the general public. It's the
decisionmakers holding the purse strings of sports, a small group
of dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   David F. Salter, author of 1997's (beginitalic)Crashing the Old
Boys' Network: Tragedies and Triumphs of Girls and Women in
Sports(enditalic), said that the 1996 Summer Olympics, where
several American women teams won gold medals, was a watershed
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really look at the Atlanta Olympics as the culmination of
the first 20 years of the Title IX effort,'' he said. ``From there,
the growth and quality of females athletic programs has improved
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   But Salter warned: ``I'm afraid that men and women, fathers and
mothers will get the impression that because we have the WNBA on
television, because we have the World Cup soccer team getting a lot
of publicity, that we've overcome these Title IX challenges, and
the momentum slows or stops.''

<P>
   You fill stadiums for big soccer games.
</P>
<P>
   You're the toast of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   At America West Arena on Monday, you'll stage the second WNBA
All-Star Game, a celebration of acceptance that nonetheless
struggled to fill even $10 seats.
</P>
<P>
   You've come halfway, baby.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three decades after Congress enacted Title IX and threw
the weight of law behind gender equity for amateur female athletes,
that's the official assessment of the Women's Sports Foundation, or
WSF.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're halfway'' to equity, said Donna Lopiano, executive
director of the WSF, founded by Billie Jean King in 1974 to seek
justice for women bucking the male-dominated American jockocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say halfway isn't a long way.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the year before Title IX mandated that no American
``shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any
educational program or activity receiving federal financial
assistance,'' fewer than 300,000 girls played high school sports.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, according to foundation statistics, the total was 2.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Participation in intercollegiate athletics, also regulated under
Title IX, has grown at a slower pace, but nonetheless gains have
been substantial, especially in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, athletic scholarships for women totaled less
than $100,000 nationally, according to the WSF. Currently, the
total tops $180million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the WSF's advocacy hotline averages three to four calls a
day from sports-program participants who suspect inequities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day there's a new unbelievable,'' said Lopiano.
</P>
<P>
   A classic example, close to home: Desert Vista High School
opened a few years ago in Phoenix with a sparkling baseball field
for boys but not a single softball field for girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's resistance - I think it's (lack of)
knowledge,'' said Sister Lynn Winsor, athletic director and coach
at Xavier College Prep in Phoenix. ``You go up to someone and say,
`You've got a wonderful boys' baseball facility with concrete
dugouts. And the girls are sitting on three little park benches.'
It's not that they don't want to - it's that they don't think of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Winsor, an Xavier coach and administrator for 26 years, serves
on a committee of the Arizona Interscholastic Association that
evaluates state schools for gender equity. It's not enforcement,
exactly, but rather positive reinforcement - the committee hands
out an annual prize to schools that have made the most progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look around Arizona, I think we're one of the better
states,'' said Winsor, who's also served as an officer for a
national coaches association. ``We've come a long way, especially
compared to some of the Southern states. They really have some
issues to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of change. I'm impressed by what's happening.
Sometimes change is painful, but it's for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, or
OCR, is charged with enforcing Title IX. This summer, several
Valley high schools are upgrading facilities to comply, and an OCR
spokesman said there are no open complaints in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Desert Vista softball situation wasn't resolved until a
player's father threatened a Title IX complaint. Title IX scholars
dub it the ``Mad Dad'' phenomenon - fathers who played sports as
kids who now insist on equal opportunity for their daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has definitely been a father-led movement,'' said
Lopiano. ``It's not a women's initiative at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lopiano said, the women's movement did not initially
embrace sports as a battlefront.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sport was originally how we trained men for war,'' Lopiano
said. ``They didn't think it was a healthy thing for women at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Dad was there right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, the first generation of mothers to enjoy Title
IX-decreed equality are coaching their young daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thought Dad was rabid, wait until Mom gets into it,''
she said. ``You don't want to ever see your children discriminated
against.''
</P>
<P>
   College scholarships, which drive participation at lower levels,
are viewed as crucial to the continued march toward sports equity.
Title IX requires that women be awarded scholarship dollars
proportional to their participation in a school's athletic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Another index by which schools are measured is whether the
percentage of female athletes matches the percentage of female
undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   That test has proved somewhat vexing to sports administrators at
Northern Arizona University, where female enrollment has grown from
52percent to 56 percent in the past few years. In the 1998-99
school year, 48.5 percent of NAU's student athletes were women, up
from 36 percent in the 1996-97 school year.
</P>
<P>
   One way NAU achieved its gains is a rallying point for
gender-equity critics, who point out that Title IX has been most
painful to participants in minor sports for men. To meet equity
mandates, many colleges have eliminated teams.
</P>
<P>
   Attributing the cut to Title IX, Northern Arizona University,
which had recently added soccer and golf teams for women, last year
dropped men's swimming and diving. More than 50 Division I colleges
have killed wrestling programs in the past two decades. Gymnastics,
tennis {ndash} even baseball {ndash} have been threatened or axed
at colleges around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, fiscally you have to say, We can't add another
female sports if the dollars aren't there,''' said Steve Holton,
NAU's athletic director. ``The only way to stay in compliance with
the federally mandated law is to eliminate men's sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Title IX's inception, various male-sports coaches'
associations have mounted organized opposition, and repeated
efforts have been made to exempt football from equity formulas.
According to the Women's Sports Foundation Gender Equity Report
Card for 1997, women gained a net increase of 1,658 National
Collegiate Athletic Association programs since 1978. During the
same years, total men's programs also increased, by 74. However,
schools in the NCAA's Divisions I-A and I-AA, the largest
universities that tend to have the largest athletic programs,
showed a decrease in the number of men's sports programs, a net
loss of 152.
</P>
<P>
   According to the WSF, the explosive growth in female
participation in high school sports during the past couple of
decades didn't dim growth for boys programs. In 1971, 3.6million
boys played high school sports. In 1998, 3.7million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Title IX, I really can't see the sharing of resources
that was required to really give women the opportunity to play,''
said Lopiano. ``It has been a tooth-and-nail fight every step of
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The WSF estimates that 80percent of America's college and
universities are not yet in full compliance with Title IX, though a
recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll indicates that more than
three-fourths of the sample supported the drive to equity - even if
it means further cuts in men's programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that the general public gets it,'' Lopiano
said. ``The problem is not the general public. It's the
decisionmakers holding the purse strings of sports, a small group
of dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   David F. Salter, author of 1997's (beginitalic)Crashing the Old
Boys' Network: Tragedies and Triumphs of Girls and Women in
Sports(enditalic), said that the 1996 Summer Olympics, where
several American women teams won gold medals, was a watershed
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really look at the Atlanta Olympics as the culmination of
the first 20 years of the Title IX effort,'' he said. ``From there,
the growth and quality of females athletic programs has improved
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   But Salter warned: ``I'm afraid that men and women, fathers and
mothers will get the impression that because we have the WNBA on
television, because we have the World Cup soccer team getting a lot
of publicity, that we've overcome these Title IX challenges, and
the momentum slows or stops.''

</P>
<P>
   ``THE SOUL OF A CHEF''
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Ruhlman
</P>
<P>
   (Viking, $26.95)
</P>
<P>
   That pizza from Uncle Sam's looked mighty good to us after we
finished reading about the pressure and politics behind the making
of great food. In the first part of this book, Ruhlman, who wrote
on the same subject in (beginitalic)The Making of a
Chef(enditalic), investigates the grueling certified master chef
exam at the Culinary Institute of America (where one participant
was berated for his ``knife skills'' after a slice of duck terrine
turned up wider at one end than at the other). Part two moves to
the kitchen of the personable Michael Symon of Cleveland's Lola
Bistro and part three to California's French Laundry, opened by
Thomas Keller (who had no formal culinary training) in 1994 and
three years later called ``the most exciting restaurant in
America'' by Ruth Reichl of the (beginitalic)New York
Times(enditalic). The Keller chapters are the best, showing both
the chef's severe perfectionism and the relentless stress under
which he and his staff create extraordinary meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE UNWANTED GAZE''
</P>
<P>
   By Jeffrey Rosen
</P>
<P>
   (Random House, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Rosen, legal affairs editor of the (beginitalic)New
Republic(enditalic), takes a disturbing look at the legal and
social changes that ``have undermined our ability to control how
much information about ourselves is communicated to others.'' If
that sounds harmless, consider this: E-mail, even deleted, is
really a permanent record that can be retrieved by employers or
prosecutors at any future time. Kenneth Starr was able to confront
Monica Lewinsky with love letters written on her computer but never
sent to Bill Clinton, and later he was able to subpoena receipts of
Lewinsky's book purchases for 1995. Rosen also offers the
controversial suggestion that Clinton's alleged actions with Paula
Jones in that infamous Little Rock, Ark., hotel room did not
constitute sexual harassment but an invasion of her privacy. He
makes a complex subject fascinating by showing us how vulnerable we
all are. His message: Pay attention. It could happen to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``WERE YOU ALWAYS AN ITALIAN?''
</P>
<P>
   By Maria Laurino
</P>
<P>
   (Norton, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   When Mario Cuomo graduated from law school and tied for first
place in his class, the dean suggested that he change his name in
order to get a job on Wall Street. ``Can you imagine me as Mark
Conrad?'' Cuomo asked Laurino, and then he posed the question that
became her book's title, establishing between them a bond of ethnic
ambivalence. Yes, she once wanted to change her name to Laurin, to
free her of her Italian identity. And, no, she could not imagine
him as Mark Conrad. A warning: This is no warm and fuzzy book of
Italian jokes and anecdotes, with some references to
(beginitalic)The Godfather (enditalic)thrown in for good measure.
With intelligence and honesty, Laurino discusses her family, her
self-image, the contradictory effects of her ethnicity (she winces
at books and documentaries on ``the Italian-American experience,''
yet is quick to romanticize her own history) and the fierce ties
that hold her to a heritage she does not completely understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``A GATHERING OF SPIES''
</P>
<P>
   By John Altman
</P>
<P>
   (Putnam, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the reference to Cary Grant and Carole Lombard on the
first page, but this book has the feel of one of those great old
movies about World War II. If you were to compare it to another
novel, it would be Ken Follett's (beginitalic)Eye of the
Needle(enditalic). Unlike Follett's Henry Faber, however, Altman's
spy is a woman. Katarina Heinrich has murdered a friend, assumed
her identity and married her employer, plodding Princeton scientist
Richard Carter. In true old-movie tradition, Richard is invited to
work on the bomb project at Los Alamos, N.M., and his stunned wife
goes along, planning her next move on behalf of Germany. Meanwhile,
British authorities recruit aging professor Harry Winterbotham to
spy for them, and Harry sees an opportunity to rescue his Jewish
wife, who was caught in Poland during Hitler's invasion. Are you
taking notes? Good, because there's more. It's all easy,
old-fashioned fun. Just bring the popcorn.

<TEXT>
<P>
   One rainy night in Anchorage, Alaska, anthropologist Nancy Yaw
Davis had an ``aha!'' moment.
</P>
<P>
   She began to make a connection between the Zuni people of the
Southwest and a caravan of Buddhist monks who, she believes,
migrated in the 14th century from Japan to the west coast of what
is now the American continent.
</P>
<P>
   Her theory, 40 years in the making, could shake up the field of
anthropology, which she says has become a bit stodgy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the scientific establishment has dismissed her notion,
but she says with an impish grin, ``I've got them nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis discussed her just-published book recently
</P>
<P>
   at Changing Hands Bookstore in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Since that rainy Alaskan night in 1960, Davis has been gathering
bits and pieces of information on her theory while teaching,
raising a family and now running an Anchorage consulting firm
involved in research, writing and applied anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of what became an obsession were planted when she was
a graduate student reading (beginitalic)The Mind of East Asia
(enditalic)by Lily Abegg. When she came across a chart detailing
the Chinese system of yin and yang, she found it remarkably similar
to a chart on Zuni religion she had prepared for a class three
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The similarity blew me out of the water,'' Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   By the next year, that discovery had led her on a path to her
master's thesis comparing the Zuni and Japanese languages,
including a long list of nearly common words. Her anthropology
professor at the University of Chicago was not impressed. He read
one paragraph of the paper and tossed it aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to Alaska and do something respectable,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional dogma rejected any notion that Native American
languages might have connections with other languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devastated,'' Davis says, remembering feeling foolish
that she had worked so hard on a paper that would go unread.
</P>
<P>
   Crushed, she took the professor's advice. She returned to
Anchorage, began teaching at Alaska Methodist University, married
William Davis in 1962, bore three children and earned a doctorate
from the University of Washington in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of a Japanese-Zuni connection continued to haunt
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't stop,'' she says. ``It's a theory with 1,000
ideas.{hellip} I knew I was onto something hot that would be
accepted someday.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years, she pieced together those 1,000 ideas,
reading every Zuni article published, logging every nugget of
information. On Oct. 18, 1994 - Alaska Day - she began to write her
book.
</P>
<P>
   Here is her theory: Around the 11th or 12th centuries, ``all
hell was breaking loose'' in the social structure of Japan, and the
island nation was plagued by repeated natural disasters, including
a series of earthquakes. Davis believes Japanese sailors began to
leave the country in successive waves.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last of these waves of migration set sail around
1350, Davis believes, led by a group of Buddhist monks in search of
(beginitalic)Itiwanna, (enditalic)the center of the universe. Davis
surmises that favorable currents landed the monks in what is now
California.
</P>
<P>
   As the pilgrims moved eastward, they attracted Native Americans
drawn to the notion of (beginitalic)Itiwanna(enditalic). Disparate
clans united in a kind of search for Oz with trails eastward as
their Yellow Brick Road.
</P>
<P>
   In an area of what is now west-central New Mexico and
east-central Arizona, just south of Chaco Canyon, they believed
they had found their Emerald City
((beginitalic)Itiwanna(enditalic)), Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   Chaco Canyon was the subject of a recent public television
documentary narrated by Robert Redford, which
</P>
<P>
   examined the grand and vast settlement built by ancient people.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers in the Zuni territory, Davis says, were an amalgam of
Japanese, Anasazi and A:shiwi (EDITORS: CORRECT SPELLING) - the
name the Zuni give themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence she has collected to support her theory includes
language, religion and crafts with roots in Japanese tradition but
distinctive from other Native American cultures. She has found
biological links through blood type, tooth shape, skull
configuration and a kidney ailment prominent in both the Zuni and
the Japanese. Both cultures had a mythology that embraced images of
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Far-fetched?
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists believe so, holding to the traditional idea that
Native Americans are descended from people who migrated over land
from Siberia 12,000 years ago, traveling across the Bering Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Others have postulated theories of trans-Pacific contact between
people overseas and Native Americans without much credibility, says
Keith Kintigh, professor of anthropology at Arizona State
University. Kintigh, who specializes in Zuni and upper Little
Colorado archaeology, is mentioned in (beginitalic)The Zuni
Enigma(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of ink spilled over these theories, and it
hasn't gotten us very far,'' Kintigh says. ``These arguments are
hard to evaluate.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not comment specifically on Davis' book, since he has
not read it but says that out of 100 theories that seem to ``upset
the apple cart'' of anthropology, only one pans out.
</P>
<P>
   If true, Davis' theory would be ``a major change in the way we
think of these things,'' he says. ``I'm kind of skeptical.''

<P>
   One rainy night in Anchorage, Alaska, anthropologist Nancy Yaw
Davis had an ``aha!'' moment.
</P>
<P>
   She began to make a connection between the Zuni people of the
Southwest and a caravan of Buddhist monks who, she believes,
migrated in the 14th century from Japan to the west coast of what
is now the American continent.
</P>
<P>
   Her theory, 40 years in the making, could shake up the field of
anthropology, which she says has become a bit stodgy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the scientific establishment has dismissed her notion,
but she says with an impish grin, ``I've got them nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis discussed her just-published book recently
</P>
<P>
   at Changing Hands Bookstore in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Since that rainy Alaskan night in 1960, Davis has been gathering
bits and pieces of information on her theory while teaching,
raising a family and now running an Anchorage consulting firm
involved in research, writing and applied anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of what became an obsession were planted when she was
a graduate student reading (beginitalic)The Mind of East Asia
(enditalic)by Lily Abegg. When she came across a chart detailing
the Chinese system of yin and yang, she found it remarkably similar
to a chart on Zuni religion she had prepared for a class three
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The similarity blew me out of the water,'' Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   By the next year, that discovery had led her on a path to her
master's thesis comparing the Zuni and Japanese languages,
including a long list of nearly common words. Her anthropology
professor at the University of Chicago was not impressed. He read
one paragraph of the paper and tossed it aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to Alaska and do something respectable,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional dogma rejected any notion that Native American
languages might have connections with other languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devastated,'' Davis says, remembering feeling foolish
that she had worked so hard on a paper that would go unread.
</P>
<P>
   Crushed, she took the professor's advice. She returned to
Anchorage, began teaching at Alaska Methodist University, married
William Davis in 1962, bore three children and earned a doctorate
from the University of Washington in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of a Japanese-Zuni connection continued to haunt
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't stop,'' she says. ``It's a theory with 1,000
ideas.{hellip} I knew I was onto something hot that would be
accepted someday.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years, she pieced together those 1,000 ideas,
reading every Zuni article published, logging every nugget of
information. On Oct. 18, 1994 - Alaska Day - she began to write her
book.
</P>
<P>
   Here is her theory: Around the 11th or 12th centuries, ``all
hell was breaking loose'' in the social structure of Japan, and the
island nation was plagued by repeated natural disasters, including
a series of earthquakes. Davis believes Japanese sailors began to
leave the country in successive waves.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last of these waves of migration set sail around
1350, Davis believes, led by a group of Buddhist monks in search of
(beginitalic)Itiwanna, (enditalic)the center of the universe. Davis
surmises that favorable currents landed the monks in what is now
California.
</P>
<P>
   As the pilgrims moved eastward, they attracted Native Americans
drawn to the notion of (beginitalic)Itiwanna(enditalic). Disparate
clans united in a kind of search for Oz with trails eastward as
their Yellow Brick Road.
</P>
<P>
   In an area of what is now west-central New Mexico and
east-central Arizona, just south of Chaco Canyon, they believed
they had found their Emerald City
((beginitalic)Itiwanna(enditalic)), Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   Chaco Canyon was the subject of a recent public television
documentary narrated by Robert Redford, which
</P>
<P>
   examined the grand and vast settlement built by ancient people.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers in the Zuni territory, Davis says, were an amalgam of
Japanese, Anasazi and A:shiwi (EDITORS: CORRECT SPELLING) - the
name the Zuni give themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence she has collected to support her theory includes
language, religion and crafts with roots in Japanese tradition but
distinctive from other Native American cultures. She has found
biological links through blood type, tooth shape, skull
configuration and a kidney ailment prominent in both the Zuni and
the Japanese. Both cultures had a mythology that embraced images of
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Far-fetched?
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists believe so, holding to the traditional idea that
Native Americans are descended from people who migrated over land
from Siberia 12,000 years ago, traveling across the Bering Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Others have postulated theories of trans-Pacific contact between
people overseas and Native Americans without much credibility, says
Keith Kintigh, professor of anthropology at Arizona State
University. Kintigh, who specializes in Zuni and upper Little
Colorado archaeology, is mentioned in (beginitalic)The Zuni
Enigma(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of ink spilled over these theories, and it
hasn't gotten us very far,'' Kintigh says. ``These arguments are
hard to evaluate.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not comment specifically on Davis' book, since he has
not read it but says that out of 100 theories that seem to ``upset
the apple cart'' of anthropology, only one pans out.
</P>
<P>
   If true, Davis' theory would be ``a major change in the way we
think of these things,'' he says. ``I'm kind of skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the scientific community has so far dismissed her work
and snubbed her requests to present her findings at professional
conferences, Davis is undaunted. If nothing else, she says, her
book could spark a discussion of her ideas and blow the dust off
the field of anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the challenge, to open up the discussion,'' she says.
``If I'm wrong, prove that I'm wrong.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BONE BY BONE &LR;  By Peter Matthiessen. (Vintage International,
$14.) The last of three novels about the life and times of Edgar J.
Watson _ cane planter, entrepreneur and mass murderer _ recounts
his conquest of Florida's Gulf Coast, an obsession with echoes in
the imperialistic impulses of a growing America. ``This is a work
of genuine dignity,'' Sven Birkerts wrote in The New York Times
Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CLONE AGE: Adventures in the New World of Reproductive
Technology &LR;  By Lori B. Andrews (Owl/Holt, $15.) A lawyer traces her
career as an expert in the legal and moral aspects of assisted
reproduction from the birth of the first test-tube baby in 1978 to
the threshold of the clone age. ``Hers is a fine and readable
book,'' John R.G. Turner wrote last year. ``She has a wonderful dry
sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TURN OF THE CENTURY &LR;  By Kurt Andersen. (Delta, $14.95.) This
sprawling comedy of millennial manners revolves around a nomadic
power couple _ a hypersuccessful Silicon Alley CEO and a struggling
television producer _ at play in the infotainment economy of New
York. Andersen ``wins back terrain for the novel that has been
ceded to new media, demonstrating that the novel is as alive and as
nimble as its high-tech competitors,'' Po Bronson wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A CLEARING IN THE DISTANCE: Frederick Law Olmsted and America
in the 19th Century &LR;  By Witold Rybczynski. (Touchstone/Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $15.) The suburban visionary who designed New York's
Central Park and other monuments of green is portrayed as a humble
man with little formal training who believed in the restorative
power of landscape for ordinary citizens. Last year the reviewer
Suzannah Lessard called this an ``excellent biography'' that is
``thorough and respectful, yet easeful in a way that is reminiscent
of Olmsted himself.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TOUGH, TOUGH TOYS FOR TOUGH, TOUGH BOYS &LR;  By Will Self. (Grove,
$12.) The killing of a fly imagined as blood sport. A Londoner who
finds a giant rock of crack cocaine under his house. These
outlandish stories both amuse and horrify as they render everyday
reality plastic and absurd. Last year the reviewer Jonathan Lethem
admired Self's ``vibrantly caustic prose and his anarchic and
florid satirical premises.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BYRON: Child of Passion, Fool of Fame &LR;  By Benita Eisler.
(Vintage, $18.) According to this biography, the poet was both an
arrogant English patrician and a prodigious libertine whose
devotion to sexual freedom got him into a world of trouble. ``The
seesawing moods and volatile allegiances of Byron ... are reported
with sensitive understanding,'' Claude Rawson said in 1999. The
book ``astutely identifies links between Byron's defiance of
prevailing moral codes and his political radicalism.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE REAL WILD WEST: The 101 Ranch and the Creation of the
American West &LR;  By Michael Wallis. (St. Martin's Griffin, $21.95.)
The 101 Ranch, a vast private spread founded after the Civil War
that once covered nearly 110,000 acres in northeastern Oklahoma,
helped to shape popular perceptions of the American frontier for
many years. Wallis ``is the first writer to tie together the 101
Ranch's many stories,'' Allen Barra wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE EARTH SHALL WEEP: A History of Native America &LR;  By James
Wilson (Grove, $16) is not so much a survey of Indian cultures as
it is a study of the calamitous impact of white conquest on
indigenous societies and a dissection of the many myths generated
by the conquerors. Last year the reviewer Richard E. Nicholls
called this a ``carefully researched and wide-ranging narrative.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MEMENTO MORI &LR;  By Muriel Spark. (New Directions, $11.95.) In
this mystery set in 1950s London, a group of elderly friends (with
more than a few skeletons in their closets) is tormented by an
anonymous telephone caller who informs each of them, ``Remember you
must die.'' ``Spark's trim, unloitering narrative reveals a fairly
complete gamut of human seaminess,'' Robert Phelps wrote in The New
York Times Book Review in 1959. The result is ``a daffily hilarious
book, even though it is pervasively concerned with the importance
of Death and Judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RUN CATCH KISS &LR;  By Amy Sohn. (Scribner, $12.) Ariel Steiner,
the precocious young heroine of this first novel, is a sex
columnist for a New York newspaper who kicks up a citywide scandal
when it's discovered she's been making up colorful material for her
column. ``It's hard not to be entertained by the hapless but
indomitable Ariel'' and her misadventures, Matthew Flamm wrote in
1999.

 &HT;    FLOOD OF NEW CITIZENS COULD INFLUENCE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE
 &HT;    800&AMP;add. With IMMIGRANT-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (p)
politics categories for release Sunday, July 23.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Millions of recently naturalized immigrants are
eligible to vote for president for the first time in the November
elections, and some analysts predict they could be a deciding
factor in key electoral states.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), in another
burst of election-year activity, created 466,221 new citizens in
the first six months of this fiscal year and expects that number to
grow to about 900,000 by October
</P>
<P>
   That would bring the number of new citizens to nearly 4 million
since 1996. They are concentrated in large states such as Texas,
Florida, California, New York and Illinois, which provide the bulk
of the electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that these new voters are being actively
courted by Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigrants can definitely make an impact,'' said Don
Nakanishi, director of the Asian American Studies Center at the
University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Because the new citizens tend to vote Democratic, some
Republicans are suspicious that the number of naturalizations is
reaching another peak during an election year.
</P>
<P>
   After 1996, when the number of new citizens doubled over the
previous year to more than 1 million, Republicans lodged complaints
that led to a still-unreleased Justice Department study of an INS
program called Citizenship USA, which was credited for the sharp
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans charged that the Clinton administration had
created the program to naturalize as many immigrants as possible
for the 1996 election. In its haste, the critics said, the INS
naturalized nearly 6,000 immigrants with criminal histories.
</P>
<P>
   This year's peak is no coincidence, said Allen Kay, spokesman
for Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House immigration
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given their history of having used naturalization for their
own political advantage, it does raise the question whether they
are doing the same thing this time,'' Kay said.
</P>
<P>
   Kay said INS last year started delaying the processing of
requests for other services. ``They have noticeably shifted their
efforts away into the naturalization process,'' he said. ``Why
favor one group of immigrants over other groups?''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Komis, an INS spokeswoman, said these claims are
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bipartisan Congress supported us in this effort (Citizenship
USA). We succeeded, but we found that our service structure had
weaknesses and we began the restructuring process'' to ensure the
ineligible residents do not become citizens, Komis said.
</P>
<P>
   Komis also said that while additional funding from Congress has
been allocated to three major INS programs with significant
backlogs _ naturalization, renewal of legal residence and
adjustment of status _ resources for dealing with other
applications have not been reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Desipio, acting director of the Latino Studies program at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, agrees that the GOP
suspicions might be misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost don't think (INS) is organized enough to do this,''
Desipio said. In addition, he noted, ``INS put the resources for
Citizenship USA in Miami also, where (new citizens) would become
Republican.'' Researchers see other reasons for the citizenship
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Many applications were sparked by the introduction of tough laws
limiting government benefits for illegal and legal immigrants, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican, drew the hostility
of many immigrants with his backing of tough immigration laws,
including Proposition 187, a ballot initiative approved in 1994 to
deny deny public health, education and welfare benefits to illegal
immigrants and their children.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the Republican-controlled Congress approved
tougher deportation laws and restrictions on welfare benefits for
immigrants who were not naturalized.
</P>
<P>
   INS said another factor was the large pool of immigrants who
became U.S. residents in the late 1980s. Because of legal waiting
periods to apply for citizenship, this group generated a flood of
naturalization petitions just as the INS was slowing down the
process to avoid the kind of errors that allowed criminals to
become citizens.
</P>
<P>
   A backlog built up, which the INS has been addressing by
reducing the processing time. Officials said they hope the lag will
fall to six months by October.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidential hopefuls have been working especially hard to
attract Hispanics, which make up about 30 percent of the new
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   A recent TV ad in Spanish features Bush's nephew, George P.
Bush, saying that his uncle believes in opportunities for
Hispanics. The 23-year-old Bush is the son of Gov. Jeb Bush of
Florida and his wife, Columba, a native of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking this month to the National Council of La Raza, the
leading Hispanic political advocacy organization, Bush said he
would spend $500 million to reduce the time it takes to process
immigrants' applications.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his own speech to La Raza, said he plans to support
affirmative action, improve health care insurance and create a
diverse cabinet. He said he would do something about the high death
rates of undocumented Mexicans who die trying to cross border with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some immigrant advocates believe naturalized voters will lash
back at anti-immigrant sentiments, which are often associated with
Republican policies.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of the Hispanics registered to vote in
California are new citizens, according to a study conducted in
February of this year by the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute, a
research group for Hispanic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The memory is still there, and it shows in the registration
votes,'' said Harry Pachon, president of the Rivera institute.
</P>
<P>
   The study shows 70 percent of Hispanics are registered Democrats
and 17 percent are Republicans. But the study also shows that Bush
draws more support from Hispanics in California than any other
Republican, said Pachon.
</P>
<P>
   However, a large portion of naturalized citizens are not
strongly aligned with one political party, Nakanishi said. As they
become acculturated to U.S. politics, their vote can go in any
direction, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, immigrants' votes are influenced by ethnicity and the
states they live in.
</P>
<P>
   Americans tend to vote Republican. The Asian vote is also
divided, with Vietnamese favoring Republicans, Filipinos and
Japanese favoring Democrats, and Chinese Americans divided between
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Naturalized immigrants' ``votes cannot be taken so lightly, and
candidates have to reach out to them,'' Nakanishi said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new voters are more passionate about issues
affecting immigrants, they seek the same things from government as
the U.S.-born generations, Desipio said _ health care, education,
public safety and other basic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies show naturalized Asian immigrants are more likely
to vote than U.S.-born second-generation immigrants, Nakanishi
said. But Hispanic immigrants historically go to the polls even
less often than the voting-age public at large, fewer than half of
whom turned out in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant advocacy groups attend citizenship oath ceremonies to
register new citizens to vote, and visit immigrant communities to
encourage turnout. But political analysts say candidates do not
make a serious effort to recruit immigrants as they become new
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to see is more Latinos showing up at the polls,
and that takes grass-roots campaigns. Neither candidate is doing
that,'' Desipio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there isn't outreach in the year 2000, it is likely (new
voters) will be lost for future elections,'' Desipio said.

VAN DE VELDE HASN'T LOST GRIP 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With every decision and every swing of the golf club, the
heartwarming summer tale was sent spiraling, from comical to
ghastly to unthinkable. The Frenchman with the infectious charm had
taken us to the edge of wonder at last summer's British Open, but
with one hand on the Claret Jug, he stood in something called the
Barry Burn, his pant legs rolled to his knees, his golf ball
immersed in water.
</P>
<P>
   The joy ride was about to end in a horrific crash and Jean Van
de Velde couldn't stop it. Surely, he was going to be scarred
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, you jest, because in &UR;  &LR; Van de Velde's world, the sun was
out the day after that debacle at Carnoustie had cost him a piece
of history. He was in Mont de Marsan, his birthplace in the south
of France, and childhood friends were at the cafe table. They all
knew about the triple bogey, the playoff loss, and the dizzying set
of golf swings that had made Van de Velde an easy target of
ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   But they also knew something else _ that Van de Velde was
stronger than all those who did not have to swing the clubs that
fateful Sunday, people who only had to hide behind microphones and
notebooks and not tackle the impossible monster that was
Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had all my friends around and it was huge. It was big,''
said Van de Velde. ``I was very tired, very drained. I was very
happy, but very disappointed not to have won it.''
</P>
<P>
   The critics, Van de Velde knew, were having a field day, but
c'est la vie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones who are going to be supportive to you are the ones
who are close to you,'' he said. ``They're the ones who are there
for the bad times, which are the ones that count. The good times
don't count, you know. What about when things are going bad? Who's
around?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jean Van de Velde walked out of the shadows of anonymity and
into golf folklore last July. At 33, he had been a professional on
the European PGA Tour since 1988 and only golf fans of strong
convictions knew of this charming gentleman who had had limited
success. There was the victory in the Roma Masters in 1993, a
splattering of top 10 finishes, and some respectable rankings in
the Order of Merit, but for the most part, observers had to check
the media guide when his name topped the leaderboard through 54
holes of the 128th British Open at Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
   The media guide told us very little about Van de Velde. His
handling of the disastrous closing hole told us everything.
</P>
<P>
   To the so-called golf experts in the TV towers and print media,
Van de Velde was a fool for losing a three-shot lead on the 72d
hole. But to tens of thousands of fans, Van de Velde became a
person around whom they could rally. In a style that was Arnold
Palmer-like, Van de Velde had refused to play safe, and people
liked that. What's more, he had screwed up like they all had. Even
more, he was willing to talk about it and take full blame, all the
while showing great dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde apologized that Sunday afternoon in the Scottish
dusk and he's been doing so ever since. He blew it, yes. He felt
badly, yes. He took full responsibility, yes. He did not blame his
caddie, no.
</P>
<P>
   On countless occasions, Van de Velde has been told how well he
has handled things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, what can you do, man? I still finished second. I was tied
after 72 holes and lost in a four-hole playoff. Why should I be
ashamed of anything? People can say, `Ah, he blew three shots,' but
they should look at it from the other angle and say, `He did well
to be three ahead of everybody.' That's reality.''
</P>
<P>
   When he walked to the 18th tee in the early evening of July 18
last year, Van de Velde was 3-over par for the tournament, 3 over
on his round. Native son Paul Lawrie had birdied the 18th hours
earlier to close out the best round of the competition, a 4-under
67, and was in the clubhouse at 6-over 290.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Lawrie concerned himself about finishing second, because
Van de Velde _ who had vaulted to the lead on the strength of 68-70
in the middle rounds _ could afford a double bogey and still
prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Up in front, Van de Velde watched Justin Leonard dump his second
shot into the Barry Burn. Minutes earlier, Van de Velde's playing
partner, Australian Craig Parry, had three-putted the 17th.
</P>
<P>
   ``A crazy golf tournament,'' said Davis Love, who posted just
one subpar round, a 69 on Sunday, yet finished in a tie for
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   For 71 holes it had been crazy, with the cut falling at 12 over
and just 11 subpar rounds.
</P>
<P>
   On the 72d, it passed crazy and went over the top to absurd.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the anniversary of that 18th hole approaches, Van de Velde
has had countless opportunities to offer his regrets, but he has
not done so. That's because he has none. He played the hole the way
he felt it should have been played, though perhaps, in looking
back, he could have gone another route with his third shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you do?'' he said. ``It's something that happened.
Out of a hundred times it would probably happen once and that was
the one. Unfortunately.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnoustie's 18th hole, said Van de Velde, was a monster. ``You
cross the burn three times. It's 480 yards and there's
out-of-bounds 5 yards left of the green and the green is something
like 15 feet wide. It's as tough as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A drive well right, then a 2-iron that went even farther right
and rattled off the bleachers, bouncing backward into an impossible
lie in the hay. His third shot was chunked into the burn, so he
took a drop, and knocked his fifth shot in the bunker. No. 6 found
the green, and No. 7 was a 6-foot putt that pushed him into a
three-way playoff.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a sequence of shots that will be remembered forever, but
what should not be overlooked is this: The men who were there are
supportive of Van de Velde. The execution, they concede, was not
effective, but the strategy should not be criticized.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting driver? Listen to Parry: ``What no one really knew is
that the wind had turned and we went into it on our tee shots. So
we had to hit driver. I hit driver, too. It was late at night, it
was cold and starting to rain a little bit. You couldn't hit
2-iron.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting 2-iron toward the green on his second shot? A surprise,
said Parry. ``However, he cleared the burn by 15 yards. That wasn't
the problem. He got unlucky when it (bounced off the grandstands
and) went back into the long rough. He would have been better off
had it gone into the water hazard. Then he could have taken a drop,
chipped it on, and won the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said, ``It's hard when you're sitting there 200 yards
with a perfect lie, you're leading the golf tournament, plenty of
room around the green to miss it. I don't think there's a player on
tour that would have pulled out a wedge or 9-iron (and played it
safe).''
</P>
<P>
   Love agrees. ``If he gets a good bounce, or if it bounces
forward, he wins the golf tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a near-impossible third shot, Van de Velde brought
the madness to a more incomprehensible level by challenging the
heather in an attempt to muscle a shot onto the green. Instead, he
hit it fat, deposited it into the Barry Burn, then removed his
socks and shoes and went in there after it.
</P>
<P>
   For several minutes, Van de Velde stood in the water, hands on
his hips, pondering his options. The crowd buzzed, almost fighting
back laughter, and players milled around trying to figure out what
in the name of Old Tom Morris was unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard was behind the 18th green. ``Disappointment was setting
in,'' for his double bogey at the 18th had left him at 290, tied
with Lawrie. ``But at the same time, I was trying to get ready for
a playoff.''

 UNDATED: ... a playoff.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parry watched Van de Velde standing in the water. Most of his
thoughts were blurred because ``I was pretty disappointed myself. I
three-putted 17 from nowhere and made a triple at the 12th, as
well. I thought that I threw it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the bridge leading toward the 18th green, Parry
looked toward the comical scene in the burn. ``Half the ball was
showing, so he could have played it,'' he said, though as Van de
Velde mulled over his choices, the ball sank. The Frenchman's
decision was made for him _ he would take a drop.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a few minutes for Van de Velde to dry his feet and
put his socks and shoes back on, so Parry turned to his playing
partner and said, ``Do you want to play your shot?'' Van de Velde
declined. ``He told me to play and I holed out (from the bunker to
complete a 73-291),'' said Parry. ``I said, `Follow me in the
hole,' '' and Parry turned to walk away. Yes, he said, it hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't believe it. We wanted to get out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde did follow Parry into the hole, but not until he
had followed him into the bunker with his fifth shot. His
triple-bogey 7 completed a round of 77 and in the buzz of the
stunning collapse it was easy to lose sight of the fact Van de
Velde still had a chance to win. He had, after all, drained a
pressure-packed 6-footer to finish at 290, tied with Lawrie and
Leonard, but given the misfortune that had just unfolded, it was
not hard to predict Van de Velde's playoff fate _ he needed 18
strokes to play four holes (as did Leonard), which lost to Lawrie's
15.
</P>
<P>
   As Lawrie accepted the Claret Jug and a nation's embrace _ he
was the first Scotsman to win the British Open since Sandy Lyle 14
years earlier _ the spotlight tracked not the man who had won, but
the man who had lost.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbish, said Leonard. ``There are a lot of holes we all could
have played differently and played better, but that didn't happen.
He was doing what he thought was right at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the sales pitch: ``Jean Van de Velde has always
preferred Bordeaux wines to Scottish water.''
</P>
<P>
   Vintage Van de Velde, who has a passion for wine (he was born an
hour from Bordeaux) and is the namesake for a wine from that
region. They promote the wine thusly: ``Made in his image, with
character and panache, frankness and generosity.''
</P>
<P>
   The description is perfect. Thanks to the $289,025 he earned for
finishing in a tie for second at Carnoustie, Van de Velde was able
to secure his playing privileges on both the European and American
PGA tours in 2000. He chose America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have enjoyed it a lot. It's discovering new courses and
meeting new people,'' said Van de Velde, who has had small success.
He finished second in Tucson, posted a top 20 at the Masters, but
is just 84th on the money list ($353,458). That, however, doesn't
come close to explaining why he is a gallery favorite _ and a media
darling.
</P>
<P>
   The famous picture of him standing in the burn, pant legs rolled
up? ``I've signed hundreds of them . . . thousands,'' said Van de
Velde. His wit and European charm were the star attractions in a
30-minute infomercial for Never Compromise, the putter he uses.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Van de Velde, over dinner late last summer with some
friends, joked, ``You know, I could probably have done better with
just my putter.'' Sitting at the table was a Never Compromise
official, and immediately an idea was born. A few weeks before
Christmas, Van de Velde returned to Carnoustie and filmed the
infomercial over an 18th hole that was covered in December frost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were freezing our hands and feet off and other parts of our
body as well,'' said Van de Velde, who used a putter with 6 degrees
of loft, a stronger shaft, and extra glue on the head as he played
the hole three times. First he made a 9, then an 8, then a 6, the
score that would have sealed a victory a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that his shot would have ended up in pretty good shape
had those bleachers not been constructed near the green, Van de
Velde grinned and quipped: ``You think I should sue the R&AMP;A?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he imagined himself in a similar position at this
year's British Open at St. Andrews, Van de Velde started to laugh.
The closing hole at St. Andrews is a relatively tame 357-yarder
whose protection comes in the form of a big swale _ the Valley of
Sin _ up near the green. The only water is a short distance off the
tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is for sure,'' said Van de Velde. ``If I hit it in
the water off the tee, I'll take my pants off this time to go hit
it.''
</P>
<P>
   More laughter, more handshakes, more smiles. Another interview
is over, but before Van de Velde moves 15 feet there is a new
reporter with an old topic. Did he have a minute? Van de Velde said
yes, then was asked just how it is he's been able to cope with the
memory of Carnoustie's 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, we're always ready to take the good times, but
we have to be ready to take the bad ones, too,'' he said. ``Around
the corner, they're going to be here and you have to be ready to
take the hammer shot when it comes. If not, the game's going to get
at you.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Ads in airliners just don't fly
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a move afoot to plaster ads on the overhead luggage bins
in airliners and it's hard to imagine that carriers that have
degraded air travel into flying steerage will pass up a new
opportunity to turn a buck.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is mulling the idea, and
Advent AirAds says only one small line, Vanguard, has committed so
far, but just you wait. If the FCC goes along, it won't be long
before the major airlines cite -- with reluctance, they will say --
competitive pressures as forcing them into the placard racket.
</P>
<P>
   The ads would complete the process of making airliners
distinguishable only by their altitude from buses.
</P>
<P>
   And would add to the process by which advertisers are contriving
to get in your face every waking moment of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when communities took pride in their municipal
facilities. The auditorium, arena or theater wore either its
community's name or memorialized admired figures of its civic
adventure. Now we have stadia whose monikers are auctioned to
corporate vainglory, without any thought to local relevance, their
identities as fungible as the deracinated teams that play in them.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine the loss to history if the Roman Coliseum had come
down to us as, instead, Mueller's Pasta Bowl. Or the Parisians had
built, not Notre Dame but Peugeot Tumbrils Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   This is actually, really true: the leading mayoral candidate in
Atlanta wants the city to can the sentimentality and let the
highest commercial bidder brand the city's airport, currently
Hartsfield International, named for the visionary mayor who made
Atlanta the hub-de-la-hub of air travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Budweiser International Airport. Please take the
Dulcolax moving sidewalks to the Philip Morris, AOL, Fuji Film and
Pepsi concourses.''
</P>
<P>
   Public TV and radio used to offer sanctuary from incessant
commercial drumming, but their discreet credit lines for
public-spirited supporters have metamorphosed, like one of those
out-of-control bugs in a horror movie, into de facto commercials
different from the networks' only by being, as yet, a shade more
mannerly.
</P>
<P>
   In some cities, advertisers are paying private motorists to
paste ads on their cars. Expect the practice to spread.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian space rocket recently went up bearing the new logo for
Pizza Hut. (The logo was being launched. Get it?)
</P>
<P>
   Movie theaters hit you for tickets, charge you Pentagon prices
for soft drinks and popcorn and then make you sit through
commercials before you even get to the previews _ which are, of
course, more commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion of airliners into advertising tubes would, I
suppose, add only a small abuse, but why stop there? Couldn't the
stewardesses, between the safety and drink-cart drills, read
commercials over the P.A.?
</P>

not.

IT'S FAST BECOMING A MIX-AND-MATCH WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LISA GUTIERREZ  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grown-ups wrinkled their noses when H.J. Heinz Co. unveiled its
green ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   Green ketchup?
</P>
<P>
   Some things are meant to be green, and ketchup isn't one of
them, you say. Green is the color of grass.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. Someday, thanks to gene-tinkering scientists at The
Scotts Co., you might carpet your lawn with red grass, according to
recent reports.
</P>
<P>
   While you ponder these color swaps, kick back with some blue
M&AMP;Ms, fire up your strawberry hued iMac and order blue potatoes for
your garden from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a color revolution,'' says Margaret Walch, director of
the Color Association of the United States in New York, a leader in
color research and marketing. ``The question is why not? And the
answer becomes _ of course! _ why not?''
</P>
<P>
   As in the case of green ketchup, ``We have not seen this
deviating from the norm very often,'' says noted color guru and
forecaster Leatrice Eiseman of Eiseman and Associates in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen some of it in the last few years, the blue M&AMP;Ms,
which flew in the face of `you never eat blue food.' And blue corn
chips. And the whole iMac thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people are open to experimentation. There's less dogma
attached to color _ `you never do this, you never do that.' People
are open to using more color now.''
</P>
<P>
   Spinning the color wheel, however, can be as risky as Russian
roulette. ``Color sells ... if you select the right color.
Otherwise, it's called inventory,'' Eiseman told an audience at the
International Housewares Show in Chicago earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking with color tradition has already resulted in macho NHL
and NFL players wearing teal logos, Minute Maid orange juice in
black cartons and Volkswagens the color of milky pea soup. News
from the national gardening front reveals near-black sunflowers
growing in test gardens and black pansies coming to your
neighborhood garden center. At the Chicago housewares show, the
Sharp company introduced fruit-colored Half Pint microwaves.
</P>
<P>
   In case you hadn't noticed, take a walk through the supermarket
or retail store with fresh eyes, as we did on a recent visit to
Target. Notice teal rubber ice trays, fluorescent green feather
dusters, purple flyswatters, wildflower-pink trash bags. Blue
Jell-O.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Raid Roach and Ant spray, with its country fresh
fragrance, comes in a pretty pink can. In the office-supply aisle,
no-nonsense staplers come in frog green and baby blue.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of our purchase decisions are based on color,
says Eiseman, author of a new book, Colors for Your Every Mood:
Discover Your True Decorating Colors. ``There are always going to
be other things that get involved, not the least of which is the
quality and value and the price. But color is an emotional
reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the impact of color, banks and insurance companies
have long used blue logos because blue implies dependability and
reliability. Capitol Federal Savings is one high-profile example of
the color's use in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman of the board John C. Dicus says that in the late 1950s,
when officials were planning a new Capitol Federal main office in
Topeka, the bank's late chairman Henry Bubb was inspired by blue
mosaic tile he and Dicus saw on an office building in Dallas. The
color struck Bubb as friendly, yet connoting strength.
</P>
<P>
   That's why blue was chosen for the company's logo and even its
buildings. In 1995 the company emphasized the point by adopting the
motto ``True Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain associations that go with certain colors
largely based on imprints on the human mind,'' Eiseman says. ``Blue
is dependable because it's the color of the sky and water. Even if
it's a dull day, we know that behind it is a blue sky, which makes
blue even more symbolic.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue, still America's favorite color, is the color of the
moment, says Eiseman, who told housewares makers that ``you almost
can't go wrong if there is something blue, but especially as we
transition into the new century.'' She predicts turquoise will be a
strong color for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, color experts coach companies to stay away
from certain pairings. Take soap. ``If you wanted to get the idea
across instantly that it's going to soften your skin, you can't use
colors that are so blatantly bright that they come across as too
powerful, too astringent,'' Eiseman says.
</P>
<P>
   Theories of color psychology hold that people build strong
emotional attachments to colors. But some of us haven't had time to
build those ties. Much of the color explosion under way plays to a
younger crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Blue applesauce and dorm-sized microwave ovens as purple as
grapes are targeted at consumers not old enough to remember
black-and-white TV, who don't have baby boomer hangups about
avocado green, who crave cell phones in candy colors. Nokia was the
first to offer colored cell phones in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer Inc. co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs predicts
``What's your favorite color?'' will become one of the most
important questions for personal computer buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Before Apple's fruit-colored iMacs were introduced last year,
computers were kind of deadly and serious, Walch says. ``Then all
of a sudden, they (Apple) realized that young people were eating
these flavors. Why not see them, too?''
</P>
<P>
   Playing with the color of real food, however, is tricky, as
director Alfred Hitchcock discovered. A story from the Color
Association tells how he once served steaks at a dinner party but
made the mistake of lighting the room with blue light. The
grayish-blue, diseased-looking meat sickened his guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone put a glass of royal blue milk in front of you,
most people would be so turned off that you wouldn't drink it,''
Eiseman says.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently ketchup is no such sacred cow. Kelly Stitt, brand
manager for Heinz Ketchup in Pittsburgh, admits adults in the
company were taken aback when grade-school children in test groups
from coast to coast said they wanted their ketchup in colors.
``When you say `colored ketchup' to kids, they don't even flinch,''
Stitt says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids live in a world of color. Everything is bright, bold
color. And I think Heinz just jumped on this to say kids are our
No. 1 fans. Let's give them what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the kids wanted ketchup in green and one other
color: blue.
</P>
<P>
   History has shown that color is a successful attention-getter in
the marketplace, especially when used unconventionally. It works so
well for Apple that the company, not wanting to tip its hand to
competitors, is tight-lipped about which iMac color is most
popular.
</P>
<P>
   At Chicago housewares show, Eiseman illustrated the power of
color marketing by noting that, until around 1917, pink _
considered a strong color because it's derived from red _ was the
color for baby boys. The more serene baby blue was for girls.
</P>
<P>
   Then a prominent American retailer decided to attract attention
by reversing the colors. The rest is ... well, you know the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the marketplace it's a great ploy,'' Eiseman says. ``If we
see things that are used in a bizarre, unexpected way, it must
capture our attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Catching our eye, though, is not the same as confusing us. We
recognize Coca-Cola in its red cans and Tide in its bright orange
boxes and bottles. Companies tweak so-called ``recall images'' with
care. Clinique, for instance, chose orange packaging for its new
perfume, Happy, but didn't mess with its signature serene green in
its other products.
</P>
<P>
   IBM was successful in modifying its ``male, corporate royal blue
to a pretty periwinkle,'' Eiseman says. Kodak nicely warmed up its
recognizable yellow. ``But they've both done it within
parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Walch and Eiseman are skeptical of green ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hesitant because it's a classic,'' Walch says. ``It's
going against nature. Personally, yes, I might buy green ketchup as
a whim, and that would be it. It seems too much like a trumped-up
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, it's very well-suited to children. They picked the
prime nasty color to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stitt at Heinz says to stay tuned for another ketchup color down
the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think other people will jump on the bandwagon once they see
big market leaders doing this,'' Eiseman says. ``What could happen
though is, once everybody gets into the act, it won't be unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you'll have people go back to the good ol' red ketchup.''

 &HT;    Solution providers are everywhere
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I am not a mere newspaper columnist. I
provide newspaper column solutions.
</P>
<P>
   One must keep up with the times. Everybody who is anybody.com is
a provider of solutions in these days.
</P>
<P>
   People who used to work for the phone company now provide
communications solutions. People who two years ago built network
machinery now provide networking solutions.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why this happened. Maybe it's the kind phrase made
up by people who refuse to see difficulties when there are only
opportunities. Who see the glass as half-full, not half-empty. Who
make lemonade when life hands them lemons. Who accept challenges
where others only see problems.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the self-deluded.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, this is particularly true of high-tech
companies. The kind that supply Internet solutions, Windows-based
software solutions and data-management solutions.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to sound like the Noun Police, but none of these
phrases makes it past the Daddy-what-do-you-do-at-work test. To
pass, one should be able to imagine oneself repeating the job
description to a kid. For example: ``Daddy, what do you do at
work?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Ashley, I provide high-touch, staff-actualizing business
solutions for real-time modern workplace enhancement.''
</P>
<P>
   Most solution providers fail the Daddy-what-do-you-do-at-work
test miserably. Most fail the straight-face test, too, but that's
another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Get used to these sort of job descriptions:
</P>
<P>
   Gardener: I provide landscaping solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Cab driver: I provide personal transportation solutions. (But,
of course, any auto mechanic might tell you the same thing.)
</P>
<P>
   Editor: I provide prose-related rehabilitative solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Soldier: I provide anti-personnel solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Garbage collector: I provide on-site mobile waste-management
solutions
</P>
<P>
   Short-order Cook: I provide personal caloric solutions on a
just-in-time basis.
</P>
<P>
   Hit Man: I provide potential federal witness solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we'd finally start paying teachers more if they provided
learning solutions instead of teaching things to noisy little kids.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this kind of corporate happy-speak so infectious?
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, people used the word ``engineer'' to embellish
job descriptions. We read of sanitation engineers, smiled
knowingly, and wished they wouldn't bang around the metal garbage
cans. Now everyone provides solutions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more pervasive ways language is debased is when
people are handed a vocabulary that forces them to say things they
don't really believe. Language that drafts the user into the sales
force. But there's a level of happy talk that makes people unhappy.
Or at least cynical. Solution-providing comes very close to that.

 &HT;    And justice for none
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Paul Thompson is a pig farmer on a piece of
land three miles west of Stuart, Fla. He and his wife moved there
in 1957. Over the years he's raised and sold hogs, all the time
picking up side jobs to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   He's been a carpenter, a commercial fisherman, and a sheriff's
deputy. He says for folks who weren't born rich, it's just what
they do to survive.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '80s, Farmer Thompson heard somewhere that the music
he was playing for his own pleasure was good for the animals too,
so he hung a couple of speakers in the pig pen and began serenading
the livestock with the local country music radio station, from 8:30
in the morning until 5:30 in the afternoon. Ever heard the
expression, ``Happy as a pig in the sunshine''? This was a textbook
case.
</P>
<P>
   But then, in the mid-1990s, a developer moved in and built a
golf course right next door to the pig farm. Pretty soon the land
tycoon was complaining about music noise and pig stink. Said it
discouraged the sale of home sites and ``annoyed'' club members.
</P>
<P>
   Well, la-di-da.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing you know, the developer tried to buy out the farmer,
but offers of money apparently haven't spoken loudly enough to
Thompson to get him off the land he's occupied for 43 years, and
that before the entrepreneurs moved in, was out in the middle of
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   I say it's tough pig poo for the city boys. Farmer Thompson was
there first.
</P>
<P>
   Next, we have the case of some folks living under the approach
to Toledo Express Airport's east-west runway. They weren't there
first, but guess what! They're getting new windows and central air
conditioning _ compliments of the Port Authority (translate that to
``taxpayers'') _ anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because airplanes are noisy.
</P>
<P>
   No fooling? It took them this long to figure that out?
</P>
<P>
   An acquaintance of mine is one of the homeowners who will be
sharing the windfall. I asked her the obvious question: Was the
airport there when you bought the house? She said it was. And did
you know you were setting up housekeeping at the end of the main
runway? She did.
</P>
<P>
   So why, I wanted to know, if you object to airplane noise, did
you buy that house?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she explained, ``we didn't expect the airport to be
busy. We didn't know an air freight company was going to move in
and fly a bunch of airplanes in and out all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, really. And why not? Isn't that what airports are for? Does
it make sense to you that the Port Authority is going to pave a few
miles of runway and then tell the airlines they can't use them?
That they can't take off and land there because the noise is
upsetting the folks who've gone and built houses where there
shouldn't have been any?
</P>
<P>
   The airport was there first, just like Farmer Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, I have this gut feeling that once again, injustice
shall triumph. Farmer Thompson and his pigs will be pushed around
by the big boys, mercilessly, until he has to move or lose it all.
That's how these things turn out because money talks.
</P>
<P>
   And as for the airport? My answer to the complainers would be:
Tough stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But wait and see. By the time the ambulance chasers get through
with it, the airport is going to be responsible for slow drains,
school violence, and hens not laying within a 10-mile radius of the
east-west runway.
</P>
<P>
   Makes no sense to me - you figure it out.

 &HT;    Edit and create your own professional quality
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you have a camcorder, chances are you've got
dozens of old tapes gathering dust. Most of the stuff on the tapes
is worthless, but you don't throw the tapes away because of the one
or two treasured scenes mixed in with the dreck.
</P>
<P>
   A digital video editing machine can help you cull the scenes you
want from those you don't want.
</P>
<P>
   Draco Systems Inc. of Boulder, Colo., has made video editing
equipment for professionals in the past, but now it's offering a
line of editors designed for the home market. The Casablanca Avio
LT sells for $1,495 and is for the novice; the Casablanca Avio ST
has a few more sophisticated features and sells for $1,795.
</P>
<P>
   Both units work without a computer. To create an edited video,
the user connects the Avio to a camcorder or other video source.
The Avio records the sound and pictures in digital form on an
internal hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Once the footage is on the hard drive, the person doing the
editing picks the scenes he wishes to save and arranges them in
order on a ``storyboard.'' From there, the editor can add special
effects, background music, titles, transitions between scenes and
other features to give the final video a professional feel.
</P>
<P>
   The Avio ST has a 20-gigabyte hard drive and can store up to 12
hours of video at VHS quality.
</P>
<P>
   Draco says Avio video editors are being shipped, and the first
stores in the area scheduled to stock them are the Alamo
Electronics stores in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the video editors, visit www.draco.com
and click on the Avio link.

<P>
   Why Sony continues to devalue their own video game library by
releasing so many like-minded games is beyond comprehension. Take,
for example, Speed Punks ($40; www.playstation.com; for the
PlayStation), yet another pip-squeak fantasy car game stuffed with
chortling fathead characters racing around in karts across
repetitive little speedways while scooping up various vehicle
power-ups and ``special'' one-timer weaponry. All that said, Speed
Punks is a fine game, puffy with memorable elementary-school-brat
characters each with distinct personalities. The graphics are as
good as they get on the aging console, yet since no one broke the
mold after Nintendo's landmark Mario Kart, Sony copycats such as
this do nothing to stand out. They merely continue the deluge of
overabundant redundancy on the consumer. Crash Team Racing, Motor
Toon Grand Prix, Chocobo Racing, Circuit Breakers, the list goes
on. Pick one, not all.
</P>
<P>
   Nightmare Creatures 2 ($45; www.konami.com; for the Dreamcast)
seems much too busy with dark slapstick humor and inflated graphic
violence to actually contain solid gameplay or treacherous
adventure. Instead, this game relies on a near-brainless controller
interface _ run, jump, block, attack _ and aggressively repetitive
mutant-zombie hacking. It lacks the depth of fierce adventure found
in the Legacy of Kain and Tomb Raider games. In fact, the game
encourages so much arbitrary bashing of crates and cupboards, which
may or may not contain something useful _ let alone even react to a
hearty ax swing _ that the unremitting dismemberment of freak-show
wannabes becomes a bother. To add insult to inanity, puzzle-solving
elements are about as tricky as a Hullian maze for lobotomized
rats. An adventure game so decidedly brazen and violent that they
forgot to add the adventure.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing more heroic than a bunch of space-age troopers
surmounting improbable odds and saving the solar system, and
Starlancer ($40; www.microsoft.com; for the PC) allows gamers to
play out precisely that scenario. While the thrust of combat calls
for interaction with artificial-intelligence team members, there's
more fun to be had in prima donna maneuvering and flat out,
lone-berserker rampaging. Created by Austin's Digital Anvil and
published by Microsoft, Starlancer's intelligent level design with
branching mission parameters offers a lot of repeat playability,
inadvertently more so considering the difficulty, the finicky
objectives and lack of mid-mission save points. The sheer fluidity
of play comes via a well-designed, intuitive interface that makes
Starlancer a must-have for the sci-fi epic heroism of it all.

 &HT;    Net2Phone knows Jack
 &HT;    By Staff Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Net2Phone, Inc., a company focused on
voice-enabling the Internet, is giving people something to talk
about. Using the new Yap Jack ($160, www.yapgear.com), you can make
Internet phone calls without a PC. Although access to an Internet
service provider is necessary, configuring the sleek black box
takes less than 15 minutes and voice-prompted instructions are
idiot-proof. If anything, the Yap Jack is too easy to use, making
chatting long distance at low rates irresistible. Time-outs in
conversation are occasional reminders that the Yap Jack doesn't
rely on conventional phone lines, but the loss in quality is more
than regained by low costs, like nickel-per-minute calls to Tokyo,
or calls for mere pennies in the United States. The Yap Jack
practically guarantees you won't shut up about the savings.

   DVD, JAMES BOND DVD
</P>
<P>
   The best part about seeing a James Bond movie like ``Moonraker''
($35; www.mgm.com/dvd) on DVD is the widescreen presentation. After
all, the 007 films are always delightfully stuffed with
over-the-top action, tremendous stunts and stunning special
effects, but those ornery ``formatted for your TV'' VHS versions
hack a full third of the movie off the sides (think rectangular peg
in a square hole). Without widescreen, viewers are robbed of the
grandness of scope and details lingering at the edge of the screen.
MGM's latest James Bond push includes every incarnation of the Ian
Fleming hero digitally mastered and available separately or as part
of collector's sets (''Moonraker'' is also part of the James Bond
007 Collection Volume 2; $150). A small bonus with this DVD is the
ability to select individual characters, events or
gadgetry-in-action and zip directly to the relevant highlight
scene. Also included is a dated but informative making-of
``Moonraker'' documentary and several other DVD-ophile extras.
</P>
<P>
   BARBECUER'S DECK HAND
</P>
<P>
   Does your grill drool grease or sputter sparks? At one time or
another most grills become the source of a deck-top mess. Instead
of pressure washing wood or stone after every cookout, why not buy
a bib for the barbie? The ``Original'' Grill Pad ($25 to $40
depending on size; www.diversitech.com) is little more than a pad
of thick, felt-like material coated in colored concrete. But it's
big enough (30-by-42-inch rectangles or 30-inch rounds) to protect
the deck and can be cleaned off with a shot from the garden hose.

 &HT;    Great for Tigers in training
 &HT;    By Staff Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   It's well-known that golf prodigy Tiger Woods started playing
the game when he was just knee-high to a grasshopper. But while an
early introduction to a millionaire's motor skills does have its
merits, there probably aren't a whole lot of parents fond of the
idea of arming their toddler with nasty dimpled projectiles and
dangerous shafts of iron. Fortunately, Fisher Price's Grow to Pro
Golf ($15; www.fisher-pice.com) is made up of durable but mostly
harmless plastic parts. More importantly, this exceptionally
affordable ``golf training center'' is a bona fide,
enthusiastically tested and well-received hit _ according to my
little aspiring Nike endorser, anyway. The colorful ``bag'' not
only holds a light pair of clubs (an ambidextrous putter and
wedge), it also holds five oversized, underweight, pretend golf
balls and dispenses them, one at a time, by means of spring-loaded
cantilever gizmo, positioning each one on an appropriately sized
tee. The whole thing just exudes grip it and rip it without the
need to yell ``fore'' every time one does so. At this point,
there's a whole lot of hockey being played with our Grow to Pro
Golf set . . . but, hey, it's a start.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   It's a guilty secret of many: all those business cards collected
at the last trade show end up in the trash bin. Or worse, all that
pertinent business falls into that hopeless pile of ``things to
file'' near the Rolodex. You can change all that with simple yet
ingenuous ShowOffs ($10 for 50; www.magzone.com), little fridge

Fortunately, there's the Targa DEFCON 1 Notebook Security Alarm
($50; www.targus.com), a combination of stalwart cable, touchy
motion sensor and 110-decibel alarm that easily attaches to one's
laptop computer or carrying case. Not that the compact computers of
continual commuters should ever be left unguarded, but that brief
respite at the coffee bar or the airport lounge can now include
more peace of mind with this skullduggery deterrent.

 &HT;    Feed shows growth needn't be fast
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos' mantra, ``Get big
fast,'' isn't the only way to succeed online.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes going slow and waiting for the right opportunity will
get you to the pot of gold at the end of the Web rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's not as glamorous or headline-grabbing, but the
results are the same, and in the end that's what matters. Take the
story of Feed Magazine (www.feedmag.com). Feed is a small
publication of ideas and commentary that has run since its
inception in 1995 with a staff of fewer than 10 people, the
generosity of angel investors and a lot of elbow grease. The
magazine watched the huge success of Salon and considered going for
broke, but founders Steven Johnson and Stefanie Syman decided they
didn't want to go broke and they couldn't possibly grow to
Salon-size without changing the entire focus of their publication.
</P>
<P>
   So they stuck it out for five years, and last week, Feed
announced a partnership with fellow online cult-classic
publications Suck.com and Alt.Culture. The new company, called
Automatic Media, will provide its partner sites with capital,
infrastructure, traffic, and distribution, while at the same time
allowing each site to retain editorial independence.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos Ventures has a 25 per cent stake in the new company. It's
nice, in these chilly economic times, to see venture companies
investing in content sites that have proven they can go the
distance on very little money and very little sleep. Perhaps no
site deserves a helping hand more than Feed.
</P>
<P>
   Feed Magazine was a Web site on a budget long before it was
fashionable or even necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy has always been to keep the company kind of
small, sometimes by default and sometimes by conscious strategy,''
Johnson says from his New York office. ``Right now I'm sitting in a
chair I think has had people sitting in it since the Eisenhower
administration,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Feed was one of the first online journals of ideas and
community. Long before Salon was even a gleam in David Talbot's
eye, Feed was churning out unexpected articles on everything from
political interviews on the BBC World Service to essays on
alternative musicians selling out to TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Feed has always flown under the radar, while Salon and Slate
nabbed the big name scribes and the big budgets. Johnson estimates
that keeping Feed up and running over the past five years has cost
about $2 million. ``We can put things up online that made it look
like there were more people here than we actually have,'' Johnson
says.
</P>
<P>
   While Feed was humming along on a shoestring budget, Joey Anuff
and Carl Steadman were running Suck.com (www.suck.com) with
practiaclly no money at all. Back in 1995, Anuff and Steadman
published their anonymous one-page rants against new media players
of all persuasions. The site was a must-read for Internet
professionals, pundits and onlookers. Everyone wondered who was
behind Suck until Nov. 24, 1995, when Suck announced it had sold
the venture to HotWired, now part of Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1995 Steadman (who now writes a column for trade
magazine The Industry Standard) and Anuff understood the value of
joining up with a media company like HotWired. As they wrote in
their 1995 ``sell out'' column, going corporate sure beats hustling
venture capitalists at every cocktail party in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Steadman and Anuff knew what they had to do, but Feed chose to
hold out. Johnson thought about making Feed bigger, but he and
Syman knew their audience would never reach the vast mainstream
readership of Salon, so they started looking at viable options _
including perhaps being part of a network that would give Feed more
exposure without altering the site's presentation or content.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson laughs at the idea that a new cash infusion from Lycos
and other investors means Feed has gone corporate. ``The day-to-day
pressure of being in an indie environment will go off our
shoulders,'' he says. ``We'll have much more support, an ad sales
staff and an HR guy and things a real company should have. So we
can go back to thinking creatively, which we haven't been able to
do because we've been so focused on the business side. ``
</P>
<P>
   It may be too soon to tell, but it looks as if Feed will be OK.
After five years, they've made the leap from start-up to a
bona-fide Internet company. ``Get big fast,'' is one way to go, but
perhaps being true to yourself and making careful decisions about
the future of your company is a good plan, too.

 &HT;    On a car trip, try CDs, Game Boy, preparedness
 &HT;    By Jennifer Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We are about to go on vacation. At least that's the
plan, but I have miles of chores to do before I leave.
</P>
<P>
   We are driving, so are there are necessary supplies I must pick
up.
</P>
<P>
   There's the supply of batteries I need to lay in for Game Boys,
CD players and night lights. Any parent who has driven long
distances with children knows the value of these portable
entertainment units.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime over the past year, my children acquired their own
personal music tastes and have begun to object vigorously to the
steady diet of oldies but goodies I have fed them musically most of
their lives. Their taste elicits one quarter appreciation, one
quarter horror and one half inability to distinguish one song from
another on my part.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the driver, I retain control of the car radio, hence
the value of CD players. Ten hours of Britney Spears, Smashmouth,
Santana (who I like but less so after the 17th time), Jock Jams,
etc. is more than any adult over 29 can stand.
</P>
<P>
   Since we will be completing our summer reading on this trip, the
night lights come in handy when at dusk, the backseat chorus begins
to sing, ``I can't see.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly evolving highly individual tastes have led to me to
decide it would be a good idea if each boy had his own bag. That
way one brother's extensive Pokemon card collection and
paraphernalia won't hog all the space from the other's baseball
card collection (thank you All-Star Game for reviving interest in
it just before we leave!). So I printed packing lists for the other
items that might come in handy such as underwear, socks, shorts,
swim trunks and toiletries.
</P>
<P>
   We're meeting family. Two months ago, my sister mailed me
directions. Two months spent preparing for vacation was not in the
top 10 on my to-do list. Now it is, but the directions have
mysteriously disappeared. I have the utmost confidence they will
reappear. In the meantime, I used the Internet to print new ones. I
also used the Internet to find out what attractions are nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone going on this trip has a different notion as to what
constitutes a vacation. I know from experience that my own view of
doing nothing more taxing than reading and eating will be outvoted,
so I may as well find out what is potentially ahead.
</P>
<P>
   While I was on the Internet, I decided to search for tips on
traveling with kids. At www.about.com, I clicked on Travel with
Kids, which led to a site that suggested playing charades during
vacation as a way to enjoy quiet evenings. I have actually never
played it, so I read with interest an article on how to play at
www.family.com that provided tips for playing with kids. The
article suggested using movie title when playing with kids. I can't
wait to try pantomiming ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' and ``Dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel with Kids has several pages of suggestions on making long
car trips bearable. I found two lists of car games, some familiar
like ``Twenty Questions'' and a few new ones like ``Geography,''
where one person names a place, say Philadelphia, and the next
person must name a place that begins with the last letter, in this
case A, so Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the help I've gotten from technology in preparing
for this trip, I'm really looking forward to being unplugged when
we finally get there.

 &HT;    Zoom in on a digital deal
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   I've stayed away from digital cameras as they've been introduced
because only the most expensive ones seemed to offer decent
resolution and features comparable to 35 mm cameras. Now, with
megapixel cameras (those capable of producing high-quality images
suitable for printing) dropping in price to about $500 or lower,
there's been no better time to invest in one. The camera I chose to
buy, the Fujifilm MX-2900 ($799; www.fujifilm.com), offers
resolution up to 2.3 million pixels, a 3x optical and 2.5x digital
zoom, and a sharp viewscreen for previewing, editing and deleting
pictures. Amazon.com and some online auction sites have featured
this camera for about $550 in a fully loaded package that,
including an external flash and a USB SmartMedia card reader, which
reads the included eight-megabyte disk and speeds up transfers to
your PC or Mac) in one fully-loaded package. The quality of images
is exceptional, and the features such aslike red-eye reduction make
its a good deal for enthusiasts and amateurs alike.

   PLAY ALL DAY _ IT'S ERGONOMIC
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant gaming peripheral befuddled only by a few flimsy
components and a lack of buttons, VR Standard's Air Stik 2000 ($90;
www.vrstandard.com) is an innovative joystick simply for its
duality function. Mounted to a sturdy, weighted base, the Air Stik
sits firmly at one's workstation and offers an ergonomic grip with
intuitive access to a trigger, five buttons (two mirrored to each
side for ambidextrous access), a ``throttle'' slider and an
eight-way hat switch. The Air Stik's most abiding feature, however,
is its innate ability to pop off its sturdy rocker and convert to a
free-form, motion-sensing pistol grip utilizing tilt detection
technology first borrowed from the automobile industry and used in
similar fashion in the FreeStyle Pro. Unlike Microsoft's
aforementioned controller, the Air Stik operates as a one-handed
device and offers comfortable, intuitive play for many flying and
driving games. Unfortunately, the unit could really use still more
buttons to be a truly effective flight stick, and the buttons that
are there have that tell-tale ``clack'' of cost-effective
production value.

 &HT;    Scan article with OCR
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I'm trying to learn how to scan a newspaper or magazine article,
store it on a disk, then retrieve it at a future date and be able
to read the information scanned. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   _ Theresa Snipe, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Sue: For folks who don't have a scanner, check
computers.cnet.com for which one to buy and where. There actually
are scanners for $80 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: There are lots of options. Let's look at one approach.
Many scanners come packaged with OCR software. File ``OCR'' away in
your mental dictionary of acronyms. It stands for optical character
recognition. Basically, it translates text. It helps the scanner
``look'' at a document or a newspaper or magazine article,
recognize letters and words and then translate them into a usable,
editable electronic computer file.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Keep in mind that OCR software will not recognize every
character, so you can expect to make text tidy-ups and tweaks.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If OCR software didn't come bundled with your scanner,
check the Net. Go to computershopper.zdnet.com and search for OCR
software. You'll see all kinds of software packages, with pricing
from several vendors. Costs run the gamut. The mother of all OCR
programs for Mac or PC is OmniPage Pro. The full package can be
pricey, ranging from $440 to $499.95. A lighter version of Omnipage
already is wrapped into many scanner purchases out there. If you're
brave and can't resist liquidation sales, go to
dirtcheapsoftware.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: TextBridge Pro is another option. We've seen it as low as
50 bucks and as high as $89.99, depending on where you shop and
whether it's for Mac or PC. Take time to look for good deals. At
bargainbins.com we found OCR software as low as $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Or, imported into many word processors. Be aware, because
it's a picture of the article, the type may not be easy to read.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You also have space considerations. Where do you store what
you scan? Do you have enough room to store them on the hard drive
of your computer? Other storage possibilities include floppy disks,
ZIP or Jaz cartridges, or CDs. What you choose depends on the
hardware you have. It's your call.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It's important that we mention copyright infringements
here. It's not an infringement for an article to be scanned and
stored on a disk for future use if that use is entirely personal,
noncommercial and nonprofit. It is a copyright infringement,
however, if the scanned article, or parts of it, are republished
for non-personal, commercial uses.

 &HT;    Pesky codes inspire love or indifference
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once more, and for the last time if I can manage it,
the subject is codes.
</P>
<P>
   For the reader who just stumbled over this column, we have been
embroiled in a firefight involving WordPerfect adherents who insist
they couldn't live without that program's ``Reveal Codes'' feature,
and my argument on behalf of those who don't want any codes
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   This has been, for the most part, an entirely pointless
argument, because my stance against codes was largely a sham for
the sake of injecting a little humor into the proceedings. That
effort having been lost on most readers, who now regard me as a
lumpish know-nothing trying to deprive them of their codes, I'll be
more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, one learns what one needs to learn. Being a Word
user, if I wanted to do any fancy formatting I would learn to use
the program's style sheets. But I don't want to do any fancy
formatting, so I will forgo using the style sheets.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, I do most of my writing these days in
WordPad. That shows you how much formatting I need.
</P>
<P>
   Things like the style sheets and the reveal codes feature are
there for those who need them. Those who don't need them needn't
bother with them.
</P>
<P>
   This, essentially, is what led to the demise of the relatively
low-powered word processors. They didn't have these advanced, often
relatively difficult-to-use features, but people discovered that
really wasn't an advantage. If it turned out the user wanted some
big-time formatting, it wasn't there. With the heavy hitters, they
could be used as simple word processors until it came time for the
heavy armament.
</P>
<P>
   In the plethora of e-mail that rolled in, there was an
interesting note from Steven Pair, who described himself as a
computer scientist involved in an effort to make codes accessible
to all of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that you should not have to learn codes and most
people won't want to. I also don't want to,'' he wrote. ``But those
codes enable you to accomplish some additional, more complex task,
that you are otherwise unable to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, to accomplish these tasks, you are forced to
learn a new language, a language of codes, rather than point, click
and type. It's a more difficult language and it follows an entirely
different set of rules than the usual language used by word
processors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is needed is a language that enables you to accomplish
even the most complex tasks with a single consistent language. Not
only should this language be used with word processors, but most
other software as well. This language should not be text (or code)
based, but rather it should be entirely visual, entirely point and
click. With this language, you can work at a very basic level, or
if you desire, dive deeper, doing more complex things, all without
having to learn a new set of rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the basic goal of a project currently being funded by
Walt Disney Imagineering. They are combining the concepts of
operating systems, computer languages, and databases into a clean
and consistent environment. This 'environment' runs in a Web
browser, as an operating system (on just about any hardware), or on
top of any traditional operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This system is called Squeak.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course. I can't wait. But in the meantime, as several readers
so astutely noted, the world's best word processor is the one you
know how to use.

 &HT;    Revealing Web site lets some of Victoria's corporate secrets
slip
 &HT;    By Sharyn Wizda
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We had no idea wearing all black was this
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``All professional attire must be predominantly (95 percent)
black,'' intones the six-page Victoria's Secret dress code.
``Predominantly black means no bold checks, houndstooth or wide
stripes. Outfits trimmed in another color are acceptable as long as
95 percent of the outfit is black.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out the lingerie purveyors are just as concerned with what
some folks are wearing out in public as getting you to buy Second
Skin Satin underwear. In addition to the ``all black, all the
time'' credo, the company's rules for its sales staff include
instructions on tattoos (none should be visible), jewelry (no more
than two earrings per ear and two rings per hand, as long as those
rings are not on the thumb) and nail length ( 3/4 inch from the
base of the cuticle). All this is courtesy of thesmokinggun.com, a
Web site archive of court and other official documents, which
recently posted the code.
</P>
<P>
   Following the code helps convey the message of a ``sophisticated
and classic look,'' one in keeping with the ``high standards'' of
Victoria's Secret, the company explains. (That's in the dress code,
by the way _ a spokeswoman declined comment.) Lest anyone dare
question the style strictures, VS also points out, ``The Victoria's
Secret Dress Code is a reflection of our culture and our client's
expectations, rather than your own personal taste.''
</P>
<P>
   And, just in case you're still thinking about piping up, the
code includes a Q&AMP;A with breezy but firm exchanges like:
</P>
<P>
   ``Q: What if I don't have the money to refurbish my whole
wardrobe?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A: The beauty of wearing black is that you can buy separates
and mix and match them frequently, allowing your clothing budget to
go a lot further.''
</P>
<P>
   You can read the whole thing at www.thesmokinggun.com/
archive/victorias2.html. Better get there fast, though. The site
(which got the document from a employee whose renegade spirit
apparently couldn't be controlled) has already received an angry
letter from Victoria's Secret lawyers demanding the ``internal''
company document be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Guess they're not kidding about that ``secret'' part.

   Sony's Speed Punks is nothing new but fun all the same By Staff
Reportsc. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Why Sony continues to devalue their own video game library by
releasing so many like-minded games is beyond comprehension. Take,
for example, Speed Punks ($40; www.playstation.com; for the
PlayStation), yet another pip-squeak fantasy car game stuffed with
chortling fathead characters racing around in karts across
repetitive little speedways while scooping up various vehicle
power-ups and ``special'' one-timer weaponry. All that said, Speed
Punks is a fine game, puffy with memorable elementary-school-brat
characters each with distinct personalities. The graphics are as
good as they get on the aging console, yet since no one broke the
mold after Nintendo's landmark Mario Kart, Sony copycats such as
this do nothing to stand out. They merely continue the deluge of
overabundant redundancy on the consumer. Crash Team Racing, Motor
Toon Grand Prix, Chocobo Racing, Circuit Breakers, the list goes
on. Pick one, not all.
</P>
<P>
   Nightmare Creatures 2 ($45; www.konami.com; for the Dreamcast)
seems much too busy with dark slapstick humor and inflated graphic
violence to actually contain solid gameplay or treacherous
adventure. Instead, this game relies on a near-brainless controller
interface _ run, jump, block, attack _ and aggressively repetitive
mutant-zombie hacking. It lacks the depth of fierce adventure found
in the Legacy of Kain and Tomb Raider games. In fact, the game
encourages so much arbitrary bashing of crates and cupboards, which
may or may not contain something useful _ let alone even react to a
hearty ax swing _ that the unremitting dismemberment of freak-show
wannabes becomes a bother. To add insult to inanity, puzzle-solving
elements are about as tricky as a Hullian maze for lobotomized
rats. An adventure game so decidedly brazen and violent that they
forgot to add the adventure.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing more heroic than a bunch of space-age troopers
surmounting improbable odds and saving the solar system, and
Starlancer ($40; www.microsoft.com; for the PC) allows gamers to
play out precisely that scenario. While the thrust of combat calls
for interaction with artificial-intelligence team members, there's
more fun to be had in prima donna maneuvering and flat out,
lone-berserker rampaging. Created by Austin's Digital Anvil and
published by Microsoft, Starlancer's intelligent level design with
branching mission parameters offers a lot of repeat playability,
inadvertently more so considering the difficulty, the finicky
objectives and lack of mid-mission save points. The sheer fluidity
of play comes via a well-designed, intuitive interface that makes
Starlancer a must-have for the sci-fi epic heroism of it all.

 &HT;    Net2Phone knows Jack
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Net2Phone, Inc., a company focused on
voice-enabling the Internet, is giving people something to talk
about. Using the new Yap Jack ($160, www.yapgear.com), you can make
Internet phone calls without a PC. Although access to an Internet
service provider is necessary, configuring the sleek black box
takes less than 15 minutes and voice-prompted instructions are
idiot-proof. If anything, the Yap Jack is too easy to use, making
chatting long distance at low rates irresistible. Time-outs in
conversation are occasional reminders that the Yap Jack doesn't
rely on conventional phone lines, but the loss in quality is more
than regained by low costs, like nickel-per-minute calls to Tokyo,
or calls for mere pennies in the United States. The Yap Jack
practically guarantees you won't shut up about the savings.

   DVD, JAMES BOND DVD
</P>
<P>
   The best part about seeing a James Bond movie like ``Moonraker''
($35; www.mgm.com/dvd) on DVD is the widescreen presentation. After
all, the 007 films are always delightfully stuffed with
over-the-top action, tremendous stunts and stunning special
effects, but those ornery ``formatted for your TV'' VHS versions
hack a full third of the movie off the sides (think rectangular peg
in a square hole). Without widescreen, viewers are robbed of the
grandness of scope and details lingering at the edge of the screen.
MGM's latest James Bond push includes every incarnation of the Ian
Fleming hero digitally mastered and available separately or as part
of collector's sets (''Moonraker'' is also part of the James Bond
007 Collection Volume 2; $150). A small bonus with this DVD is the
ability to select individual characters, events or
gadgetry-in-action and zip directly to the relevant highlight
scene. Also included is a dated but informative making-of
``Moonraker'' documentary and several other DVD-ophile extras.
</P>
<P>
   BARBECUER'S DECK HAND
</P>
<P>
   Does your grill drool grease or sputter sparks? At one time or
another most grills become the source of a deck-top mess. Instead
of pressure washing wood or stone after every cookout, why not buy
a bib for the barbie? The ``Original'' Grill Pad ($25 to $40
depending on size; www.diversitech.com) is little more than a pad
of thick, felt-like material coated in colored concrete. But it's
big enough (30-by-42-inch rectangles or 30-inch rounds) to protect
the deck and can be cleaned off with a shot from the garden hose.

Fortunately, there's the Targa DEFCON 1 Notebook Security Alarm
($50; www.targus.com), a combination of stalwart cable, touchy
motion sensor and 110-decibel alarm that easily attaches to one's
laptop computer or carrying case. Not that the compact computers of
continual commuters should ever be left unguarded, but that brief
respite at the coffee bar or the airport lounge can now include
more peace of mind with this skullduggery deterrent.

 &HT;    Feed shows growth needn't be fast
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos' mantra, ``Get big
fast,'' isn't the only way to succeed online.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes going slow and waiting for the right opportunity will
get you to the pot of gold at the end of the Web rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's not as glamorous or headline-grabbing, but the
results are the same, and in the end that's what matters. Take the
story of Feed Magazine (www.feedmag.com). Feed is a small
publication of ideas and commentary that has run since its
inception in 1995 with a staff of fewer than 10 people, the
generosity of angel investors and a lot of elbow grease. The
magazine watched the huge success of Salon and considered going for
broke, but founders Steven Johnson and Stefanie Syman decided they
didn't want to go broke and they couldn't possibly grow to
Salon-size without changing the entire focus of their publication.
</P>
<P>
   So they stuck it out for five years, and last week, Feed
announced a partnership with fellow online cult-classic
publications Suck.com and Alt.Culture. The new company, called
Automatic Media, will provide its partner sites with capital,
infrastructure, traffic, and distribution, while at the same time
allowing each site to retain editorial independence.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos Ventures has a 25 per cent stake in the new company. It's
nice, in these chilly economic times, to see venture companies
investing in content sites that have proven they can go the
distance on very little money and very little sleep. Perhaps no
site deserves a helping hand more than Feed.
</P>
<P>
   Feed Magazine was a Web site on a budget long before it was
fashionable or even necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy has always been to keep the company kind of
small, sometimes by default and sometimes by conscious strategy,''
Johnson says from his New York office. ``Right now I'm sitting in a
chair I think has had people sitting in it since the Eisenhower
administration,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Feed was one of the first online journals of ideas and
community. Long before Salon was even a gleam in David Talbot's
eye, Feed was churning out unexpected articles on everything from
political interviews on the BBC World Service to essays on
alternative musicians selling out to TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Feed has always flown under the radar, while Salon and Slate
nabbed the big name scribes and the big budgets. Johnson estimates
that keeping Feed up and running over the past five years has cost
about $2 million. ``We can put things up online that made it look
like there were more people here than we actually have,'' Johnson
says.
</P>
<P>
   While Feed was humming along on a shoestring budget, Joey Anuff
and Carl Steadman were running Suck.com (www.suck.com) with
practiaclly no money at all. Back in 1995, Anuff and Steadman
published their anonymous one-page rants against new media players
of all persuasions. The site was a must-read for Internet
professionals, pundits and onlookers. Everyone wondered who was
behind Suck until Nov. 24, 1995, when Suck announced it had sold
the venture to HotWired, now part of Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1995 Steadman (who now writes a column for trade
magazine The Industry Standard) and Anuff understood the value of
joining up with a media company like HotWired. As they wrote in
their 1995 ``sell out'' column, going corporate sure beats hustling
venture capitalists at every cocktail party in Silicon Valley.

   Steadman and Anuff knew what they had to do, but Feed chose to
hold out. Johnson thought about making Feed bigger, but he and
Syman knew their audience would never reach the vast mainstream
readership of Salon, so they started looking at viable options _
including perhaps being part of a network that would give Feed more
exposure without altering the site's presentation or content.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson laughs at the idea that a new cash infusion from Lycos
and other investors means Feed has gone corporate. ``The day-to-day
pressure of being in an indie environment will go off our
shoulders,'' he says. ``We'll have much more support, an ad sales
staff and an HR guy and things a real company should have. So we
can go back to thinking creatively, which we haven't been able to
do because we've been so focused on the business side. ``
</P>
<P>
   It may be too soon to tell, but it looks as if Feed will be OK.
After five years, they've made the leap from start-up to a
bona-fide Internet company. ``Get big fast,'' is one way to go, but
perhaps being true to yourself and making careful decisions about
the future of your company is a good plan, too.

 &HT;    On a car trip, try CDs, Game Boy, preparedness
 &HT;    By Jennifer Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We are about to go on vacation. At least that's the
plan, but I have miles of chores to do before I leave.
</P>
<P>
   We are driving, so are there are necessary supplies I must pick
up.
</P>
<P>
   There's the supply of batteries I need to lay in for Game Boys,
CD players and night lights. Any parent who has driven long
distances with children knows the value of these portable
entertainment units.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime over the past year, my children acquired their own
personal music tastes and have begun to object vigorously to the
steady diet of oldies but goodies I have fed them musically most of
their lives. Their taste elicits one quarter appreciation, one
quarter horror and one half inability to distinguish one song from
another on my part.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the driver, I retain control of the car radio, hence
the value of CD players. Ten hours of Britney Spears, Smashmouth,
Santana (who I like but less so after the 17th time), Jock Jams,
etc. is more than any adult over 29 can stand.
</P>
<P>
   Since we will be completing our summer reading on this trip, the
night lights come in handy when at dusk, the backseat chorus begins
to sing, ``I can't see.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly evolving highly individual tastes have led to me to
decide it would be a good idea if each boy had his own bag. That
way one brother's extensive Pokemon card collection and
paraphernalia won't hog all the space from the other's baseball
card collection (thank you All-Star Game for reviving interest in
it just before we leave!). So I printed packing lists for the other
items that might come in handy such as underwear, socks, shorts,
swim trunks and toiletries.
</P>
<P>
   We're meeting family. Two months ago, my sister mailed me
directions. Two months spent preparing for vacation was not in the
top 10 on my to-do list. Now it is, but the directions have
mysteriously disappeared. I have the utmost confidence they will
reappear. In the meantime, I used the Internet to print new ones. I
also used the Internet to find out what attractions are nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone going on this trip has a different notion as to what
constitutes a vacation. I know from experience that my own view of
doing nothing more taxing than reading and eating will be outvoted,
so I may as well find out what is potentially ahead.
</P>
<P>
   While I was on the Internet, I decided to search for tips on
traveling with kids. At www.about.com, I clicked on Travel with
Kids, which led to a site that suggested playing charades during
vacation as a way to enjoy quiet evenings. I have actually never
played it, so I read with interest an article on how to play at
www.family.com that provided tips for playing with kids. The
article suggested using movie title when playing with kids. I can't
wait to try pantomiming ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' and ``Dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel with Kids has several pages of suggestions on making long
car trips bearable. I found two lists of car games, some familiar
like ``Twenty Questions'' and a few new ones like ``Geography,''
where one person names a place, say Philadelphia, and the next
person must name a place that begins with the last letter, in this
case A, so Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the help I've gotten from technology in preparing
for this trip, I'm really looking forward to being unplugged when
we finally get there.

 &HT;    Great for Tigers in training
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   It's well-known that golf prodigy Tiger Woods started playing
the game when he was just knee-high to a grasshopper. But while an
early introduction to a millionaire's motor skills does have its
merits, there probably aren't a whole lot of parents fond of the
idea of arming their toddler with nasty dimpled projectiles and
dangerous shafts of iron. Fortunately, Fisher Price's Grow to Pro
Golf ($15; www.fisher-pice.com) is made up of durable but mostly
harmless plastic parts. More importantly, this exceptionally
affordable ``golf training center'' is a bona fide,
enthusiastically tested and well-received hit _ according to my
little aspiring Nike endorser, anyway. The colorful ``bag'' not
only holds a light pair of clubs (an ambidextrous putter and
wedge), it also holds five oversized, underweight, pretend golf
balls and dispenses them, one at a time, by means of spring-loaded
cantilever gizmo, positioning each one on an appropriately sized
tee. The whole thing just exudes grip it and rip it without the
need to yell ``fore'' every time one does so. At this point,
there's a whole lot of hockey being played with our Grow to Pro
Golf set . . . but, hey, it's a start.

 &HT;    Zoom in on a digital deal
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   I've stayed away from digital cameras as they've been introduced
because only the most expensive ones seemed to offer decent
resolution and features comparable to 35 mm cameras. Now, with
megapixel cameras (those capable of producing high-quality images
suitable for printing) dropping in price to about $500 or lower,
there's been no better time to invest in one. The camera I chose to
buy, the Fujifilm MX-2900 ($799; www.fujifilm.com), offers
resolution up to 2.3 million pixels, a 3x optical and 2.5x digital
zoom, and a sharp viewscreen for previewing, editing and deleting
pictures. Amazon.com and some online auction sites have featured
this camera for about $550 in a fully loaded package that,
including an external flash and a USB SmartMedia card reader, which
reads the included eight-megabyte disk and speeds up transfers to
your PC or Mac) in one fully-loaded package. The quality of images
is exceptional, and the features such aslike red-eye reduction make
its a good deal for enthusiasts and amateurs alike.

   PLAY ALL DAY _ IT'S ERGONOMIC
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant gaming peripheral befuddled only by a few flimsy
components and a lack of buttons, VR Standard's Air Stik 2000 ($90;
www.vrstandard.com) is an innovative joystick simply for its
duality function. Mounted to a sturdy, weighted base, the Air Stik
sits firmly at one's workstation and offers an ergonomic grip with
intuitive access to a trigger, five buttons (two mirrored to each
side for ambidextrous access), a ``throttle'' slider and an
eight-way hat switch. The Air Stik's most abiding feature, however,
is its innate ability to pop off its sturdy rocker and convert to a
free-form, motion-sensing pistol grip utilizing tilt detection
technology first borrowed from the automobile industry and used in
similar fashion in the FreeStyle Pro. Unlike Microsoft's
aforementioned controller, the Air Stik operates as a one-handed
device and offers comfortable, intuitive play for many flying and
driving games. Unfortunately, the unit could really use still more
buttons to be a truly effective flight stick, and the buttons that
are there have that tell-tale ``clack'' of cost-effective
production value.

 &HT;    Pesky codes inspire love or indifference
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once more, and for the last time if I can manage it,
the subject is codes.
</P>
<P>
   For the reader who just stumbled over this column, we have been
embroiled in a firefight involving WordPerfect adherents who insist
they couldn't live without that program's ``Reveal Codes'' feature,
and my argument on behalf of those who don't want any codes
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   This has been, for the most part, an entirely pointless
argument, because my stance against codes was largely a sham for
the sake of injecting a little humor into the proceedings. That
effort having been lost on most readers, who now regard me as a
lumpish know-nothing trying to deprive them of their codes, I'll be
more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, one learns what one needs to learn. Being a Word
user, if I wanted to do any fancy formatting I would learn to use
the program's style sheets. But I don't want to do any fancy
formatting, so I will forgo using the style sheets.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, I do most of my writing these days in
WordPad. That shows you how much formatting I need.
</P>
<P>
   Things like the style sheets and the reveal codes feature are
there for those who need them. Those who don't need them needn't
bother with them.
</P>
<P>
   This, essentially, is what led to the demise of the relatively
low-powered word processors. They didn't have these advanced, often
relatively difficult-to-use features, but people discovered that
really wasn't an advantage. If it turned out the user wanted some
big-time formatting, it wasn't there. With the heavy hitters, they
could be used as simple word processors until it came time for the
heavy armament.
</P>
<P>
   In the plethora of e-mail that rolled in, there was an
interesting note from Steven Pair, who described himself as a
computer scientist involved in an effort to make codes accessible
to all of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that you should not have to learn codes and most
people won't want to. I also don't want to,'' he wrote. ``But those
codes enable you to accomplish some additional, more complex task,
that you are otherwise unable to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, to accomplish these tasks, you are forced to
learn a new language, a language of codes, rather than point, click
and type. It's a more difficult language and it follows an entirely
different set of rules than the usual language used by word
processors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is needed is a language that enables you to accomplish
even the most complex tasks with a single consistent language. Not
only should this language be used with word processors, but most
other software as well. This language should not be text (or code)
based, but rather it should be entirely visual, entirely point and
click. With this language, you can work at a very basic level, or
if you desire, dive deeper, doing more complex things, all without
having to learn a new set of rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the basic goal of a project currently being funded by
Walt Disney Imagineering. They are combining the concepts of
operating systems, computer languages, and databases into a clean
and consistent environment. This 'environment' runs in a Web
browser, as an operating system (on just about any hardware), or on
top of any traditional operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This system is called Squeak.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course. I can't wait. But in the meantime, as several readers
so astutely noted, the world's best word processor is the one you
know how to use.

 &HT;    Scan article with OCR
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I'm trying to learn how to scan a newspaper or magazine article,
store it on a disk, then retrieve it at a future date and be able
to read the information scanned. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   _ Theresa Snipe, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Sue: For folks who don't have a scanner, check
computers.cnet.com for which one to buy and where. There actually
are scanners for $80 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: There are lots of options. Let's look at one approach.
Many scanners come packaged with OCR software. File ``OCR'' away in
your mental dictionary of acronyms. It stands for optical character
recognition. Basically, it translates text. It helps the scanner
``look'' at a document or a newspaper or magazine article,
recognize letters and words and then translate them into a usable,
editable electronic computer file.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Keep in mind that OCR software will not recognize every
character, so you can expect to make text tidy-ups and tweaks.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If OCR software didn't come bundled with your scanner,
check the Net. Go to computershopper.zdnet.com and search for OCR
software. You'll see all kinds of software packages, with pricing
from several vendors. Costs run the gamut. The mother of all OCR
programs for Mac or PC is OmniPage Pro. The full package can be
pricey, ranging from $440 to $499.95. A lighter version of Omnipage
already is wrapped into many scanner purchases out there. If you're
brave and can't resist liquidation sales, go to
dirtcheapsoftware.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: TextBridge Pro is another option. We've seen it as low as
50 bucks and as high as $89.99, depending on where you shop and
whether it's for Mac or PC. Take time to look for good deals. At
bargainbins.com we found OCR software as low as $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Or, say you don't want to go the editable-text route with
OCR software. You may want to just use the bare-bones scanner
software to save articles as a non-editable PICT file, which is
basically a snapshot. It can then be imported into many word
processors. Be aware, because it's a picture of the article, the
type may not be easy to read.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You also have space considerations. Where do you store what
you scan? Do you have enough room to store them on the hard drive
of your computer? Other storage possibilities include floppy disks,
ZIP or Jaz cartridges, or CDs. What you choose depends on the
hardware you have. It's your call.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It's important that we mention copyright infringements
here. It's not an infringement for an article to be scanned and
stored on a disk for future use if that use is entirely personal,
noncommercial and nonprofit. It is a copyright infringement,
however, if the scanned article, or parts of it, are republished
for non-personal, commercial uses.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd write for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Edit and create your own professional quality
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you have a camcorder, chances are you've got
dozens of old tapes gathering dust. Most of the stuff on the tapes
is worthless, but you don't throw the tapes away because of the one
or two treasured scenes mixed in with the dreck.
</P>
<P>
   A digital video editing machine can help you cull the scenes you
want from those you don't want.
</P>
<P>
   Draco Systems Inc. of Boulder, Colo., has made video editing
equipment for professionals in the past, but now it's offering a
line of editors designed for the home market. The Casablanca Avio
LT sells for $1,495 and is for the novice; the Casablanca Avio ST
has a few more sophisticated features and sells for $1,795.
</P>
<P>
   Both units work without a computer. To create an edited video,
the user connects the Avio to a camcorder or other video source.
The Avio records the sound and pictures in digital form on an
internal hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Once the footage is on the hard drive, the person doing the
editing picks the scenes he wishes to save and arranges them in
order on a ``storyboard.'' From there, the editor can add special
effects, background music, titles, transitions between scenes and
other features to give the final video a professional feel.
</P>
<P>
   The Avio ST has a 20-gigabyte hard drive and can store up to 12
hours of video at VHS quality.
</P>
<P>
   Draco says Avio video editors are being shipped, and the first
stores in the area scheduled to stock them are the Alamo
Electronics stores in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the video editors, visit www.draco.com
and click on the Avio link.

 &HT;    Revealing Web site lets some of Victoria's corporate secrets
slip
 &HT;    By Sharyn Wizda
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We had no idea wearing all black was this
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``All professional attire must be predominantly (95 percent)
black,'' intones the six-page Victoria's Secret dress code.
``Predominantly black means no bold checks, houndstooth or wide
stripes. Outfits trimmed in another color are acceptable as long as
95 percent of the outfit is black.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out the lingerie purveyors are just as concerned with what
some folks are wearing out in public as getting you to buy Second
Skin Satin underwear. In addition to the ``all black, all the
time'' credo, the company's rules for its sales staff include
instructions on tattoos (none should be visible), jewelry (no more
than two earrings per ear and two rings per hand, as long as those
rings are not on the thumb) and nail length ( 3/4 inch from the
base of the cuticle). All this is courtesy of thesmokinggun.com, a
Web site archive of court and other official documents, which
recently posted the code.
</P>
<P>
   Following the code helps convey the message of a ``sophisticated
and classic look,'' one in keeping with the ``high standards'' of
Victoria's Secret, the company explains. (That's in the dress code,
by the way _ a spokeswoman declined comment.) Lest anyone dare
question the style strictures, VS also points out, ``The Victoria's
Secret Dress Code is a reflection of our culture and our client's
expectations, rather than your own personal taste.''
</P>
<P>
   And, just in case you're still thinking about piping up, the
code includes a Q&AMP;A with breezy but firm exchanges like:
</P>
<P>
   ``Q: What if I don't have the money to refurbish my whole
wardrobe?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A: The beauty of wearing black is that you can buy separates
and mix and match them frequently, allowing your clothing budget to
go a lot further.''
</P>
<P>
   You can read the whole thing at www.thesmokinggun.com/
archive/victorias2.html. Better get there fast, though. The site
(which got the document from a employee whose renegade spirit
apparentlympany document be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Guess they're not kidding about that ``secret'' part.

   Q: We wanted to buy a few stocks for our grandson's graduation.
We'd like him to enjoy watching the movement of the values, but
buying individual stocks has proved difficult. Can you help us?

<P>
   A: Lucky grandson. It is possible (albeit expensive) to purchase
one share of several stocks, but do you want to?
</P>
<P>
   Each purchase (one share or 10) involves a fee. For small
amounts (say, $500-$1,000), a mutual fund may be the best way to
go, advises personal asset manager Michael Kentor. The risk is
minimal, and your grandson may follow the fund's individual stocks.
You pay for one investment transaction rather than several. Brokers
should be willing to accommodate whatever you decide, notes
full-service discount broker James Kaighin. Q: I'm the CEO of a
small software company that builds a system used by foster agencies
to track children. I read that Danny DeVito and his wife, Rhea
Perlman, are interested in children's issues. He might be
interested in working with us. How do I contact him or his manager?

 &HT;    Why don't the TV bigwigs see the flaws we do?
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Here we go again. . . . The nation's TV critics
are heading off to cool (relatively speaking) and breezy Southern
California to stay in a luxury hotel, hobnob with stars and assess
the new fall season.
</P>
<P>
   Tough job? Oh, please. The hard part is plowing through 20 hours
of preview tapes, which I did last weekend. The rest is a romp.
Well, a seven-day-week, 12-hour-day romp that includes reporting
and writing, but which is certainly better than paving streets in
Texas right now.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my colleagues in the Television Critics Association are
already grumbling that this is the worst batch of pilots they've
seen in years. No fast-paced brainy dramas such as ``The West
Wing,'' no painfully realistic yet deeply fulfilling dramas such as
``Once and Again,'' and no sitcoms that rise above annoyingly
sophomoric.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't find the pilots quite that depressing. I laughed at two
sitcoms (Bette Midler's ``The Bette Show'' and Christine Baranski's
``Welcome to New York''). And I hold out hope for a few dramas,
including NBC's soft-focus, comedy-drama ``Ed,'' CBS's
philosophical medical drama ``Gideon's Crossing'' (starring Andre
Braugher), Fox's quick-moving ``$treet,'' about the roller-coaster
lives of young Wall Street professionals, and Fox's scary anthology
``Night Visions.''
</P>
<P>
   As the ball gets rolling in Pasadena, here are some of the
burning questions we will pose to the assembled stars, creators and
network executives, along with a few queries we not only won't ask
but won't listen to if someone else asks:
</P>
<P>
   Why is Fox determined to be the X Network? The fall schedule
boasts six series that are scary, futuristic or somehow infused
with science fiction. That's not counting the animated
``Futurama.'' Fox started out as a niche network targeting urban
teen and twenty somethings. It has evolved into a haven for
conspiracy theorists and wackos. Not that some of the sci-fi shows
aren't good, because a few are. We wonder, however, why Fox is
branding itself creepy.
</P>
<P>
   We definitely do not want to know why Calista Flockhart, Lara
Flynn Boyle and Portia de Rossi disappear when they turn sideways.
We're sick of the weight questions from rude reporters and the
whiny answers from the paper-thin stars. (``I'm just scrawny,''
Boyle said recently on ``Entertainment Tonight.'') I might ask
David E. Kelley if he's worried that de Rossi's exposed rotator
cuff might alarm some viewers, but that's as far as I'll go.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Couric and Matt Lauer will meet with critics to tout
``Today's'' forthcoming expansion to three hours. Why in the world
do they want to lengthen a show that most people watch for only 15
minutes? Did NBC insist on bloating the show because it's NBC's
biggest money machine? Is there research indicating millions of
people are hanging around an extra hour in the morning with nothing
to do? Gotta know.
</P>
<P>
   No actors, no matter how boring they are in an interview, should
ever be asked why they took a role. If there's any reason beyond
the obvious (the need to work and receive a paycheck), we don't
care. Every role is interesting, challenging or against the grain.
Always. So don't ask, don't tell.
</P>
<P>
   With David Janssen setting the gold standard in the original
series and Harrison Ford doing a bang-up job in the movie, what's
left for Tim Daly to do with CBS's remake of ``The Fugitive?'' The
pilot is impressive, but Daly pales compared with those who went
before. And it's hard to imagine what new ground can be broken with
the concept, but I'll ask.
</P>
<P>
   I will not ask anyone at NBC why they yanked the plug on
``Freaks and Geeks'' so quickly. The real answer is, they have no
taste. But nobody will say that, so why bother? Ditto ABC and
``Sports Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Are network execs worried the bottom will fall out of the drama
trend and leave everybody bankrupt? It's a known fact that hourlong
dramas don't sell as well as sitcoms in syndication. They cost
millions more to produce and die in the ratings when they're
repeated. This fall, like last fall, there are more new dramas than
comedies, and that seems risky to the point of foolish from a
business standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Do you care that just about nobody is paying attention to the
content ratings (the little alphabet-soup box that precedes each
network broadcast) or using the V-chip that the ratings are
intended to trigger? I sort of care, but those questions are best
asked of parents, especially the ones who complain all the time
about the evil effect TV has on their children, not TV executives
camped out in Pasadena. They definitely don't care.
</P>
<P>
   What about that prime-time animation trend? Where did it go? The
big animation hit last season was supposed to be ``God, the Devil
and Bob,'' but it was scrapped after a couple of episodes. Several
other animated series were in the works last spring but are nowhere
to be found now. An invisible trend? Whassup with that?
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing we want to know is when the networks
are going to wise up and stop showing so many reruns during the TV
season. Ratings continue to fall, reruns continue to rise. Is there
a connection there, guys? Huh?

immunologists, especially for infants, whose immune systems need
exposure to help them develop a defense against germs. (Toner,

   BRAIN-RESEARCH _ Two University of Texas researchers and some
colleagues from Stanford believe they have made some advancements
in brain research, using MRIs so finely tuned that they can watch
oxygen cells travel within the brain. This, in turn, allows the
scientists to see how specific regions of the brain control
specific actions. And it may ultimately allow doctors to do a
better job of treating brain disorders. (Roser, Austin

   GERMS-TOOCLEAN _ Americans have a nasty habit: too much
cleanliness. We're obsessed with it. And young mothers are the
worst offenders. We disinfect the kitchen counters countless times
a day; we spray Lysol in the bathroom until the fumes are
overpowering. Too much is not a good thing, according to leading
immunologists, especially for infants, whose immune systems need
exposure to help them develop a defense against germs. (Toner,

   JUNCTION, Texas _ When the bad blood between the aging Cardwell
brothers ended in gunfire at the old family ranch outside of town,
some of their relatives were surprised that only one shot was
fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be like the O.K. Corral, a battle royal,''
recalled one relative.
</P>
<P>
   When the last argument was over on May 5, 1997, Bill Cardwell,
80, lay in the dirt with a hole through his chest. His younger
brother Cody, stood nearby, holding a deer rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that trouble old Bill and I been having? Well, it's
over,'' Cody said when he called the Kimble County Sheriff's
Department, asking for help.
</P>
<P>
   Cody, now 79, said he shot in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   In August he will go on trial in nearby Sonora, charged with
killing his brother. Also pending is a wrongful death suit filed in
civil court against Cody by Bill's three adult sons.
</P>
<P>
   Few facts about the shooting are in dispute, and there is not
much mystery either about the fraternal animosity that led up to it
or the family suffering it has caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the oldest story in history, going back to Genesis. Cain
killed Abel. Brother killing brother. It's very unfortunate, but
that's all I can say,'' said District Attorney Ori White, whose
office will prosecute Cody.
</P>
<P>
   The killing has bitterly divided the Cardwells, one of the
pioneer families in this town of 3,000 people 100 northwest of San
Antonio. Just a year before the shooting, 75 Cardwells attended the
family reunion in Junction.
</P>
<P>
   Some Cardwells believe Cody shot in self-defense. Others do not.
</P>
<P>
   Few believe the family can ever be made whole again, and most
who talked about the shooting asked that their names not be used in
print.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Cody were the eldest surviving sons of the legendary
one-armed family patriarch, O.W. ``Dad'' Cardwell, who settled in
Kimble County in 1910. Cardwell and his wife Mildred reared 11
children on a 10,000-acre ranch that straddles the Kimble and
Sutton County line.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the theme of many of Cody's public complaints
was his problems with older brother Bill. Sheriff's deputies were
called to the ranch to settle disputes.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the two had been partners in a cattle-raising
enterprise on the family ranch, and Cody thought Bill had cheated
him. He went so far as to sue over the issue, but after an audit
that showed otherwise, the suit was dropped just months before the
fatal shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they were ever the best of friends, over
girlfriends or ranching or anything else. They had a difference of
opinion about everything,'' said Ruth Cherry, 77, younger sister of
the brothers and one of three surviving siblings.
</P>
<P>
   And, like others, she thought the dispute would more likely end
with Bill standing and Cody on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought it was going to be the other way around. I
think they threatened each other all their lives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Cardwells, however, said the conflict has been
exaggerated, that it was not a sibling rivalry of biblical
dimensions. The brothers often worked side by side without
squabbling and looked out for each other, too, said one in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are people in town that would love to turn this
into an old Western,'' she said. ``But Cody was angry. He wanted a
confrontation. He'd made a lot of accusations that weren't true. It
was a time of sickness, and things just got out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever earlier differences they had, the relationship got
worse in the early 1990s when Cody returned in poor health to the
old family ranch. He had been diagnosed with cancer and was also
told by the doctor to quit smoking, which made him even edgier.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the Cardwell Ranch after decades living away, Cody moved
into a house that faced Bill's across 200 yards of open ground.
Years earlier, the spread had been divided among the five children
who wanted land instead of money.
</P>
<P>
   The problems were aggravated because Bill regularly drove right
past Cody's house over an easement in order to tend to cattle on
another section of the ranch owned by a sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this flashpoint, as Bill was passing through the gate
by Cody's house, that the fatal shooting occurred three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The only eyewitness was Cody's wife Millie, who saw the argument
unfold through a living-room window. Both she and Cody have since
sold their property and moved to a ranch near Menard.
</P>
<P>
   Strangers now live there, and Bill's son, Odie, occupies his
father's house.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial approaches, the lawyers say everything hinges on
the issue of self-defense. Although Bill was known to regularly
carry firearms, he was unarmed when he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a bizarre, old-timey case. Cody Cardwell is 79
going on 80, and we're charging him with killing his older brother
Bill,'' said Mike Brown, the assistant district attorney who will
try the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill didn't have a weapon on him, other than a pair of pliers,
and you're not going to find a rancher out here without something
on him. I don't believe the self-defense issue and I don't think a
jury will either.''
</P>
<P>
   Cody's lawyer, however, called it a ``classic self-defense
case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one weapon. Bill was carrying some fencing tools, he
had one on his belt, and he had drawn that to hit Cody,'' said
Preston Douglass Jr. of Kerrville. ``Bill wouldn't leave. Bill
wouldn't back off.''
</P>
<P>
   Odie Cardwell, Bill's son, said he spoke to his father the night
before he died. As usual, the conversation turned to family
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `How are things with Cody?' and he said, `It's not any
better. He's blabbing all over town about everything I've stolen
from him. He needs to shut up,''' Odie recalled his father saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Dad, when you go to Thelma's place, go around. Don't
go by Cody's. And he said, `Son, that's easy for you to say,' and I
guess it was.''

 (ART ADV: Photos of solar-powered outdoor equipment are available
on Newscom or by calling William Gonzalez at 212-499-3355.) 
 By RICH TAYLOR 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clear sunlight contains 1,000 watts of power per square meter at
sea level. That's enough to give you a healthy tan in a few minutes
or a third-degree burn in a few hours. It's also enough to power
everything on Earth 1,500 times over if we could just figure out a
way to harness all the free, nonstop solar energy that bathes the
globe every day.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in a very real sense everything on Earth is already
solar-powered _ we just release that power in different ways.
Burning long-buried hydrocarbons to get at stored solar energy, as
we've been doing, isn't particularly efficient. But other ways to
use solar energy are available. There's a whole campsite worth of
clever outdoor gear that runs directly on sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this solar equipment depends on photovoltaic cells first
developed at Bell Laboratories in 1954. A PV cell consists of a
nonconductor _ often a silicon wafer similar to those used for
computer chips _ coated on one side with exotic metal atoms that
produce a surplus of electrons when exposed to sunlight. The other
side of the PV cell is coated with atoms deficient in electrons.
Run a wire from each side to an electrical device, expose the
positive side to sunlight, and you have an electron flow capable of
useful work.
</P>
<P>
   But not much of it. Current PV cells are only 10 percent to 15
percent efficient, so most solar-powered camping gear is small
stuff that requires less than 1 amp to operate. On the other hand,
virtually anything with a microchip fits into this category _ a
handheld GPS, cellphone, radio or a laptop computer. You name it. A
PV cell is the perfect power supply.
</P>
<P>
   A standard 10-watt PV flat-panel module is 9.5 by 18 inches,
weighs 17 ounces and produces 0.6 amp at 16.5 volts. At $12 per
watt, it's about three times as costly as the huge solar panels
designed to fit on your roof. But you can't carry rooftop PVs in
your backpack.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of PV-powered devices were tested, including a couple
of radios, camp lights, flashlights and even a power supply
specifically engineered to run a laptop computer. Most of the items
that have built-in PV cells feature alternate sources of power.
Why? Well, on rainy days, your radio stops. Therefore, most small
solar-powered equipment also includes a battery pack and a
hand-cranked dynamo to provide backup power.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect use for PV cells is recharging batteries on a boat
or RV that isn't used a lot. One compact PV panel is enough to
maintain a trickle charge on a battery that's already charged up,
or to replace the charge bled off by a small bilge pump. Thanks to
their simple construction and the fact that they're designed to be
out in the sun all day, PV cells should last forever _ literally _
lying quietly on your RV's dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   One popular solar gizmo is the Wattz-In-A-Box. A 21- by 23- by
9-inch travel case holds a 10-watt PV panel and 150-watt AC
inverter. These, in turn, are used to recharge a 12-volt DC power
supply. The box includes a built-in flashlight, gooseneck reading
lamp and cigarette lighter outlet, among other nifty features.
</P>
<P>
   Other solar devices use sunlight directly, without having to
convert it to electricity first. Hang a black plastic bag filled
with water in the sun for an hour or two, and you get a supply of
hot water perfect for showering on a beachfront or boat deck.
</P>
<P>
   This is the principle behind the two solar showers tested for
this article. One was the Super Solar Shower, a 5-gallon black
plastic bag you can hang from a tree branch or halyard. It is
fitted with a shower head on a plastic hose. The Solar Air Power
Shower was equipped with a foot pump that is supposed to pressurize
the 7-gallon water bag. We preferred the Super Solar Shower, as
gravity proved more dependable and easier to use than foot power,
particularly when the pressure ran out while trying to rinse off
soap.
</P>
<P>
   Two different solar ovens were also tested. Both work by
collecting sunlight and concentrating it in one spot. The Solar
Cooker is nothing but a sheet of foam to which reflective foil has
been laminated. Slide Tab A into Slot B and it turns into a
self-supporting oven capable of heating to 300 degrees. When you're
finished cooking, the whole thing neatly folds into a flat,
flexible and virtually weightless package that easily fits in a
backpack.
</P>
<P>
   More elaborate is the Sun Oven, a 21-pound wood, metal,
fiberglass and glass box that unfolds to form a solar oven with
interior dimensions of 14 by 14 by 9 inches. By carefully adjusting
the polished reflectors, the built-in thermometer climbed up to 400
degrees. That's hot enough to roast a chicken or even bake a cake.
</P>
<P>
   The favorite solar product of all is the Acqua Cone, an
emergency water maker/purifier that's devilishly clever. It
consists of an inflatable plastic ring, a clear plastic cone
supported by four rods and a black circular wick that floats inside
the ring.
</P>
<P>
   The wick laps up water, which is turned into pure water vapor by
sunlight streaming through the cone. The hot water vapor condenses
on the cooler cone, leaving any impurities in the wick. Eventually,
pure water runs down the sides of the cone and collects in a trough
on top of the inflated ring. A plastic tube drains the trough to
provide you with a pint or more of safe water per day, and it
tastes only faintly of plastic. Who cares? It could literally save
your life.
</P>
<P>
   As more people take to the outdoors and insist on carrying
conveniences with them, the market for solar-powered gear is sure
to grow. PV cells become more efficient with each new generation of
technology, which already makes these products economically
feasible. You also gain genuine satisfaction from getting power for
free, out of thin air, like magic. No wonder some people worship
the sun.

   EUROPE SPY REPORT
</P>
<P>
   2004 MERCEDES-BENZ E-CLASS: Obviously highly disguised, this is
the next generation E-Class wagon. A lowered hood houses a new
series of engines, and the revised bodywork sits on a longer
wheelbase, with less overhang and a similar overall length compared
to the current generation. The headlamp treatment is highly
disguised as well, but we're betting on tiny projector-beam
headlamps. Look for a raft of high-tech features like credit-card
entry and keyless ignition, voice recognition and radar-controlled
gap-maintaining cruise control and automatic braking.
</P>
<P>
   2002 PORSCHE SUV: Finally, the long-rumored Porsche SUV has been
captured in an advanced state of development. We know it's the
Porsche rather than the companion Volkswagen version from the shape
of the headlamps _ obviously related to the ones on the 911 and
Boxster. The fat tires and alloy wheels imply that this vehicle is
intended as an autobahn burner, rather than as a true off-road
stump-jumper. Expect innovative drivetrain engineering to achieve
Porsche-class ride and handling when this sees the light of day
late next year.
</P>
<P>
   2002 MERCEDES-BENZ MAYBACH: Cobbled together from S600 bodywork,
this test mule is the Mercedes-Benz Maybach hyperluxury sedan.
Somewhere in excess of $200,000 will get you into one sometime late
in 2002. A long and a longer-wheelbase version is planned, and
powerplants will be turbocharged or supercharged (or both) versions
of the 5.8 liter V12 used in the current S600.
</P>
<P>
   2001 PORSCHE GT3: Last year, Porsche produced a limited number
of GT3 road cars. All were sold immediately. Duh. And if these cars
were legal to bring into the United States, Porsche probably could
have sold twice as many. So, the powers that be in Stuttgart have
wisely decided to make a second crop. Unlike the 911 Turbo, the GT3
is rear-wheel-drive. The variable-deployable rear wing and front
airdam/headlamp treatment hint at the styling direction expected of
the new 911 Carrera due next year. Lighter than the 911 Turbo by an
unspecified amount, the GT3's 380 horsepower is sufficient to
propel it 0-to-100 kph (0-to-62 mph) in 4.8 seconds with a top
speed of 187 mph. It purportedly was the first production vehicle
ever to break the 8-minute barrier at Germany's Nurburgring
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   2000 KIA SPECTRA: This relative upstart carmaker from Korea is
trying to buck the trend and common wisdom with its latest model,
Spectra. The car offers the flexibility of a hatchback but its
packaged with all the allure of a four-door sedan. Spectra is based
on the chassis that Kia uses for its Sephia line. But essential
differences show up in a number of areas, including exterior
styling. Two models are offered, the $10,795 GS and the $12,995
GSX. Both have a 1.8 liter, DOHC, 125-horsepower Four and the
choice of either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic. If
you want a different Spectra, Kia has the Spectra K, which boasts
engine and suspension modifications to appeal to the growing market
of Asian-car hot rodders. Perhaps the most striking feature of the
Spectra K is the paint, which changes hues under different light
and viewing angles. Prices for the Spectra K are to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   2000 AUDI TT ROADSTER: When you drive a TT, people come up to
you to to talk about it. That's been true since the tidy little
coupe was introduced a year ago. And it's even more true with the
introduction of the Roadster. Designed in parallel with the Coupe,
rather than engineered onto the Coupe's platform ex post facto, the
ragtop chassis is devoid of any evidence of cowl shake. The
convertible top can be had in manual or power-operated style. Along
with the Roadster's introduction, Audi has more power for the TT: a
225-horsepower version of the current engine. This powerplant rates
a six-speed gearbox, and quattro all-wheel drive is standard. The
225-horsepower Roadsters also get the power top. One interesting
feature is the glass windbreak divider that rises from behind the
seats at the touch of a button. A notable option is the dusky
orange baseball-leather interior treatment, complete with
hand-stitched baseball-glove lacing around the seatbacks.
</P>
<P>
   2000 SAAB 9-5 AERO WAGON: Through solid marketing and even more
solid products, Saab's sales have continued to grow. Now they'll
grow just a wee bit more thanks to another new and niche model: the
9-5 Aero Wagon. Besides the body cladding that gives this station
wagon that ``aero'' look, it packs the same 2.3-liter turbocharged
Four that's in Saab's pocket rocket, the 9-3 Viggen. Thanks to the
car's sophisticated engine controls, the small turbo is rated at
230 horsepower and, with a manual gearbox, 258 ft.-lb. of torque.
Other benefits of the drivetrain include altitude compensation so
the engine can perform as well at 10,000 feet as it can at sea
level. And after driving around much of New Mexico, we can say that
it performs just fine, thank you. Unfortunately, Saab intends to
sell only 750 of these wunderwagons for this model year. This is
also the first European nameplate to be equipped with OnStar.

 (ART ADV: A graphic on changing an oil filter and O-ring is

212-499-3355.)
 By MIKE ALLEN 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LORD OF THE RINGS
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently replaced my oil filter. Within a couple of miles,
the filter started to leak. I just barely made it home with any oil
in the engine. I walked down to the gas station, and paid list
price for another oil filter and oil. This time I really cranked
the new filter on _ about 112 turns after the gasket touched
instead of the three-quarter turn the instructions on the side of
the filter called for. Sure enough, the filter leaked again within
a couple of miles. I ducked into a 10-minute oil change place, and
paid to have the oil and filter changed by professionals. But what
do they know that I don't? How hard can it be to change a filter?
Now it doesn't leak _ except for the oil still dripping on my
driveway from the bottom of my car.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adler Dempsey, Perth Amboy, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm only guessing, of course, but I'll bet the original oil
filter you took off at the first change left its gasket attached to
the bottom of the filter-mounting boss on the engine. This
square-section O-ring is supposed to stay with the filter as it's
removed. This does not always happen. If the old O-ring stays stuck
to the engine, the new O-ring won't be properly supported when the
filter is replaced. And as soon as the engine warms up, it will
squirm out of the way, and you're oiling down the street. Whenever
you remove an oil filter, be sure to check that the old O-ring is
in place. If not, reach in to the filter mount, and pick it off
with your fingers or a screwdriver. In any case, it's good practice
to thoroughly clean the filter-mounting boss and lightly coat the
new O-ring with clean oil before installing the new filter.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a 1999 Mustang GT. All of the plastic panels on the
car, including the bumpers, ground effects rocker panels and the
air vents behind the doors, are painted black. Unfortunately, there
are several shades of black, ranging from a true black to a
brownish tint. I've been to two different dealers. The Ford rep at
the first said that's the way it is because they are painted by
different suppliers, and offered no remedy. The body shop manager
at a second dealer said all the '99s are coming through this way
and offered to repaint the panels. He wouldn't guarantee they would
match, however. Before I have someone start painting, what's the
correct fix?
</P>
<P>
   _ John Davidson, Suwanee, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: This mismatch is generally more of a problem on body-colored
panels rather than on black ones. The problem is that steel panels
are given a different kind of prep and often a different type of
paint than the different types of plastic. You've got urethanes,
sheet-molding compound and any of several thermosetting plastics to
match. Because they take the paint differently, and require a
different chemistry for adhesion, they may not match precisely. A
sharp painter can improve your color match considerably.
</P>
<P>
   MISSING
</P>
<P>
   Q: My 1986 Bronco lost its heat a couple of months ago. My
husband added antifreeze, and it was fine for a short time. But
soon after, it happened again. He's added coolant five times so
far. There's no leak we can find. Someone suggested that it's
leaking into the oil, but we can't find any in the oil. Where is it
going?
</P>
<P>
   _ Jane Gulka, Saskatchewan
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I wouldn't be so sure it's not going into the oil. If
you drive the truck long enough to boil off all the liquid coolant
in the oil pan, you might not see it on the dipstick. An oil
analysis would find traces of the coolant's additive package.
Otherwise, your leak may be in a lot of places. Check for seepage
at the water pump weep hole, the intake manifold, the perimeter of
the head gaskets and all of the hoses and the heater core. It may
be nothing more than a radiator pressure cap that's not holding
pressure, allowing the coolant to escape as vapor. You may find it
necessary to enlist the aid of a mechanic with a black-light leak
detection kit to find any leakage.
</P>
<P>
   WATER OR NOT
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently noticed a puddle of what appeared to be water on
the ground under my Lumina. It smells and tastes like water,
anyway. What could be leaking? The leak comes from near some steel
lines under the a/c compressor and behind the oil pan. The cooling
system is working normally. I haven't used my air conditioning in
months, so it's probably not from the evaporator pan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rob Olsen via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: It's water from the evaporator pan. It's draining from the
evaporator pan's drain tube, and running along something under the
car to where you see it dripping. Even if you haven't used your a/c
for a while, your a/c compressor runs when the system is set to
Defrost.
</P>
<P>
   NIGHTY-NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've noticed that you warn against using ether starting
fluid, but you've never said why.
</P>
<P>
   _ Earl Kennedy, Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   A: I personally have seen two engines destroyed while using
ether to start them. The first engine caught on fire. The other
broke a connecting rod, punching a hole in the side of the block
and nearly hitting me in the chest with shrapnel. Good enough?

   NONSURGICAL TREATMENT FOR ARTHRITIS PAIN
</P>
<P>
   Some 2 million people could benefit from a new treatment for
rheumatoid arthritis. Called Boron Neutron Capture Synovectomy, it
removes the synovial membrane that surrounds and lubricates joints,
without the side effects of surgery or injections of radioactive
isotopes, the currently favored treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The arthritic joint is injected with a boron-rich compound, then
exposed to a beam of neutrons. The boron absorbs some of the
neutrons, forming a radioactive substance that quickly decays.
Radiation from this decay kills the synovium, and then vanishes as
soon as the neutron beam is turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Initial results with arthritic rabbits are encouraging, says
Jacquelyn Yanch, a professor of nuclear engineering at MIT. Human
tests are still a few years away.
</P>
<P>
   EARLIER SOLAR ALERTS
</P>
<P>
   When the weather on the sun gets stormy, blasts of solar wind
can disrupt communications on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Michelson Doppler Imager on the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory, researchers can track millions of points on the
surface of the sun. A computer program looks at changes in rhythmic
motions and traces these anomalies to the unseen eruptions that
caused them, in effect creating a ``window'' through the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by Solar Physics Research of Tucson, Ariz., and
Northwest Research Associates of Boulder, Colo., the technique
gives 10 days of warning.
</P>
<P>
   SOLAR PUSH FOR ELECTRIC BIKES
</P>
<P>
   Adding an electric drive to a bicycle makes hill climbing
easier, until you forget to plug in the charger, when it becomes
dead weight. Energy Enterprise's solution to forgetfulness comes in
the form of a solar panel that attaches above the rear wheel and
provides a trickle charge as long as the sun keeps shining.
Initially, the Newport, Wales, company plans to sell Solar Drives
to bike rental concessions.
</P>
<P>
   DATING THE START OF LIFE
</P>
<P>
   A new look at old rocks from the moon reveals a surprising
correlation between meteoroid impacts and major biological events
on Earth, say researchers at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   After dating minute glass beads thrown out by impacts over the
millennia, researchers concluded that the earliest known evidence
of life on Earth coincides with the tapering off of the first peak
of bombardment of the moon by large comets and asteroids.
Presumably they also struck Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe life began on Earth many times, but the meteors only
stopped wiping it out about 3 billion years ago,'' says Paul R.
Renne, of the Berkeley Geochronology Center.
</P>
<P>
   CAMERAS REPLACE IN-ROAD SENSORS
</P>
<P>
   A waterproof camera with built-in weather-monitoring gear could
replace traffic-counting and temperature sensors now buried in
roads.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by Com One (www.com1.fr) of Cestas, France, the
Videomodem communicates with a control center via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to introduce its cameras to road departments
in the United States later this year. The Videomodem can be
equipped with fog sensors and can collect air pollution data.
</P>
<P>
   THEORY SUPPORTS EUROPA LIFE
</P>
<P>
   Scientific support is growing for the theory that primitive
aquatic life exists beneath ice-covered Europa, one of Jupiter's 16
moons.
</P>
<P>
   A new theory proposed by Christopher Chyba of Stanford
University proposes that the energy needed to create essential
biological fuels could originate from the billions of charged
particles that constantly rain down on Europa from neighboring
Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll know in the next 10 years if there's an ocean,'' says
Chyba. ``If there is, Europa will be the site of a series of new
space missions.''

   SING AROUND THE SOLAR-POWERED CAMPSITE
</P>
<P>
   SOLAR-GADGETS-POPMECH _ Clear sunlight contains 1,000 watts of
power per square meter at sea level. That's enough to power
everything on Earth 1,500 times over if we could just figure out a
way to harness all the free, nonstop solar energy that bathes the
globe every day. Of course, in a very real sense everything on
Earth is already solar-powered _ we just release that power in
different ways. Burning long-buried hydrocarbons to get at stored
solar energy, as we've been doing, isn't particularly efficient.
But other ways to use solar energy are available. There's a whole
campsite worth of clever outdoor gear that runs directly on
sunlight. By Rich Taylor.

 MAKING TIME FOR SIMPLE PLEASURES By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carol's favorite luxury is a bath. She treats her baths with
reverence, surrounding the tub with candles, steaming up the place
with exotic potions. Now that her two sons are just about raised
she has time to indulge herself.
</P>
<P>
   One particularly stressful day she told a friend she was craving
a bath but had already partaken that morning. The wise friend
responded, ``Carol, where is it written that a woman can't have
more than one bath a day?''
</P>
<P>
   That was all the absolution she needed for a second plunge. Now
whenever she has a simple longing momentarily checked by the
nagging finger saying ``selfish, selfish,'' she invokes the
no-bath-limit rule.
</P>
<P>
   This is one person's indulgence. Another's might be to climb on
their big old lawn mower and ride around the field, letting the
motor's drone knock out all detouring thoughts. Screening your
calls and taking a book to the front steps with a pitcher of tea is
one way to treat yourself. Or trying on shoes for an hour with no
intent to buy. Sitting with a 6-year-old in a wading pool. Going to
a ball game on a workday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Charitable acts you do for yourself are easy to dream up but
tough to rationalize. We suffer moral blame when we put ourselves
first. How can we snuggle deep in the hammock when the window trim
needs painting? Can I enjoy kayaking knowing the refrigerator needs
cleaning?
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's get some work done, barks the inner voice. Time to
take care of business, fix the world, do something for others. It
is not enough to spend your morning watering the cucumbers and
staring into space when you could be making a real contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why people have dogs, for the excuse to walk
outside under the stars and whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Leisure-time experts say Americans have forgotten how to relax
and enjoy themselves. If you're doing nothing you're sick or
slacking. The person with the most nervous tics wins. Being good at
multi-tasking is a proud trait.
</P>
<P>
   But have you noticed? Some people are more impressed that you
spent your holiday weekend sleeping in and reading old magazines
than that you called the office three times.
</P>
<P>
   Lately I've been looking for people who know how to treat
themselves. The ones who book a monthly massage, eat ice cream when
the mood strikes, buy themselves flowers even if no one else is
there to see them.
</P>
<P>
   There are relative degrees of indulgence. One woman used to
hoard her airline dividends for a free plane ticket back in
economy. Now she uses them to upgrade herself into business class
so she can stretch her legs. Like the woman in the shampoo
commercial, she says, ``I'm worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Treating yourself is a learned behavior and most of us are out
of practice. How many people do you know who eat more often at
their desk than in the park?
</P>
<P>
   A longtime career woman had to go into therapy to figure out how
to be good to herself. Now as soon as she launches a new work
project she schedules a day at a spa for the end of it. If the
spa's taken she packs a book and a bottle of wine and goes alone to
a motel with an ocean view.
</P>
<P>
   You start to appreciate a person who knows how to reward
himself, like Jack, a guy who'll occasionally slip from his desk in
the middle of the afternoon, make some mention of a client
appointment and go see a movie. He comes back refreshed and ready
to work an extra couple of hours, being an ethical hooky player.
</P>
<P>
   For some people it's pulling off the road to watch a hawk in
flight instead of doing 30 minutes on the stairmaster. Taking a nap
before firing up the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   A stolen moment _ with, for and by yourself. No apologies.
</P>
<P>
   What's yours?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Taxation could use a different emphasis
 &HT;    For release July 17, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a wonderful time we live in: the president is proposing all
sorts of giveaway programs, the presidential wannabes proffer plans
designed to save us all sorts of money and the folks on Capitol
Hill keep creating new legislation designed to return some of the
huge financial largess of this nation back to the people.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is that few of us have seen any of it, or ever hope to.
</P>
<P>
   There are the traditional, partisan-based battles over things
such as whether the elimination of estate taxes will help the
little shopkeeper as much as it will the wealthy class, and other
tax-cutting ideas of that ilk.
</P>
<P>
   So often, the argument perseveres that if things are good for
business, then they are good for the little guy who works for
business. Wasn't that Ronald Reagan's ``trickle down'' theory?
Wasn't that also called ``voodoo economics'' by none other than
George Bush?
</P>
<P>
   Make it good for the guy on the top and the guy below will do
well, too. Make it bad and the guy below suffers as well. Example:
Slam it to Big Tobacco but, wait, won't the little tobacco farmers
get hurt if Big Tobacco bites the dust?
</P>
<P>
   Recall, please, Jimmy Carter's war on the two-martini lunch a
quarter-century ago. Jimmy didn't mind business writing off some of
its pleasureful excesses as legitimate expenses but he felt it had
gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   As America suffered double-digit inflation, and the little guy
was reeling, Carter picked on those who were not, those who were
living it up and writing it off. He got nowhere. Among the
responses to his assault on figurative two-martini lunches was that
waiters and waitresses would make less money if those extravagant
lunches were eliminated from the write-off column. It scared hell
out of underpaid waiters and waitresses and his two-martini lunch
war had no allies.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the extravagance of business deductions has
magnified. There is no greater example than the Super Bowl, where
corporate jets fly to the game site, outlandish parties are held
and thousands of dollars paid for tickets to a football game _ all
to appear as deductions at tax times.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball and football stadiums, basketball and hockey arenas are
being constructed specifically to facilitate and lure luxury suite
and box customers, almost exclusively companies that spend hundreds
of thousands of dollars for them and then write them off as
legitimate business expenses, although little legitimate business
ever takes place in them. Much of the time, in fact, the luxury
suite is empty.
</P>
<P>
   Those millions of dollars being poured into political campaigns
by companies and their executives also are being written off at tax
time as a legitimate means of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the cost of burying your mother and father, or your
husband or wife, is not given any consideration as a tax deduction.
Or is the cost of prescription medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Someday the politicians will get serious about taxation and
correct the imperfections of the tax codes. That day is not yet
here. Primary attention continues to be given to the business
aspect of taxation and not enough to the average person who, in
recent decades, even has suffered the loss of being able to deduct
interest

interest paid on a car loan or department store account.
</P>
<P>
   We need someone to stress a ``trickle up'' philosophy, one that
recognizes that if it is good for the lower economic strata of the
nation, then by putting something in their pocketbooks, they might
go out and buy more and better things and make it better for
business that way.
</P>
<P>
   Estate taxes are about people with more than $600,000 to leave
behind. Burying your mother costs about $5,000 -- whether or not
you have it. And the interest on paying for it is not deductible.

&HT;     BUSH'S GUIDING PHILOSOPHY ON POVERTY MAY FACE PITFALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush believes social
salvation can be found in the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   When voters hear Bush on the campaign trail talking about
``compassionate conservatism,'' Bush often means increasing tax
credits so more people and corporations can deduct charitable
contributions, so more religiously inspired groups can receive
government assistance.
</P>
<P>
   God and taxes are the central tenets of the Republican
presidential hopeful's guiding philosophy. It is a new paradigm,
his campaign says, for dealing with issues such as poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to next week's Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia, Bush has turned once again to his earliest and most
potent campaign theme. But what is ``compassionate conservatism''?
And how would Bush, if he becomes president, try to change the way
America treats the poor?
</P>
<P>
   In symbol, compassionate conservatism has come to mean a
concerted effort to appeal to minority groups, such as Bush's
speech to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People last week. Bush is almost never seen on stage without an
African-American or Hispanic child nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Compassionate conservative has also come to mean Bush talking
about the environment, proposing limited government spending on
social programs and health care changes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Democratic Vice President Al Gore and Bush have spoken
in unison about the need to involve organizations, particularly
churches, with government to help the poor. Bush has spoken
frequently about marshaling the ``armies of compassion,'' just as
his father, former President George Bush, spoke about a ``thousand
points of light.''
</P>
<P>
   But religious organizations are, during this political season,
cautious about becoming ``shining anecdotes'' or political slogans,
said the Rev. Jim Wallis, the author and founder of Call to
Renewal, a network of religious church working on poverty and
social problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush and Gore want to be partners with faith-based
organizations, then we're saying you've got to put poor families
and poor kids on the political agenda,'' he said. ``We just don't
see that. If they do that, then we can talk about solving the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative commentator Arianna Huffington, who is working with
Wallis on poverty issues and is co-founder, with Bush adviser
Marvin Olasky, of the Center for Effective Compassion, said Bush's
compassionate conservative model does not put enough emphasis on
healthy government funding for effective programs.
</P>
<P>
   She said the private sector is much more interested in giving
money to fashionable museums or universities, rather than to
homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to just say, `I'm unleashing the armies of
compassion' without the government backing,'' Huffington said.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches, Bush has described compassionate conservatism like
this: ``This will not be the failed compassion of towering, distant
bureaucracies. . . . It will be government that both knows its
limits and shows its heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, much of his plan is tax credits and other
government incentives to encourage charitable donations,
particularly to religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Expand the ``charitable choice'' section of the 1996 federal
welfare overhaul to allow more government investment in religious
groups.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allow people who do not itemize their taxes to deduct
charitable expenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Permit individuals older than 59 to contribute to retirement
savings to charities, without having to pay income tax on the
amount withdrawn from individual retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Another plan would raise the cap on corporate charitable
deductions from 10 percent to 15 percent of a company's taxable
income, and provide lawsuit protection for corporate donations of
equipment or facilities to charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just slogan,'' Olasky said in an interview.
``There is a gritty reality there. There is meat on these bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush watchers and critics are wary of the overwhelming
emphasis on tax reform to solve social problems. They have heard
the same argument before from Republican candidates, and tax cuts
almost always seem to benefit the wealthy, they contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time we heard a politician talk about this, it was
called `trickle-down economics,''' said the Rev. Herman Foster,
president of the NAACP Texas Hill Country chapter. ``We heard that
in the Reagan-Bush administration, but it just didn't trickle
down.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore and Bush have encouraged religious organizations to
become more involved in social reconstruction, Bush believes there
should be more active collaboration between government and
churches.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's philosophy relies to a great extent on churches,
synagogues and mosques working to solve social problems. The
government comes in as a last resort to handle the bigger problems,
or to assist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tell them they have to check their religious commitment
at the door, then you are discouraging a lot of people from coming
through the door, and that's not going to help poor people,'' said
Olasky, a University of Texas journalism professor and senior
fellow at the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and
Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Erasing the traditional line between religious groups and
government bothers civil libertarians and traditional liberal
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Public Justice was troubled because the religious
groups, despite receiving public funding, are still allowed to
discriminate based on religious beliefs, and libertarians simply
don't like any government involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get the foot in the door with church or
religious-based activities it lends itself to be a very dangerous
thing,'' said Andrew Bernstein, a philosophy professor at Pace
University in New York who has criticized Bush's version of
compassionate conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The notion of compassionate conservatism also raises questions
about whether churches have the capacity or the will to tackle the
country's enormous social problems and whether taxpayer dollars
should be used to support these religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are talking about faith-based organizations may
have unrealistic expectations about what they are expected to do,''
said Eugene R. Tempel, executive director of Center on Philanthropy
at Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some groups have already stepped back and said, `Wait a
minute, we're a church, we're not a social-service organization.'
Faith-based organizations also should not think that stepping
forward and accepting government money won't affect their work,
because it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Olasky said he did not know whether churches had the capacity to
respond, but that did not matter as much as the need to look at
poverty and social ills in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen over the past few years that there is a lot more
capacity than a decade ago,'' Olasky said. ``We don't know. The
reason we don't know is we've tried the top-down version, where we
go to Washington first if there is a problem. It seems to me that
we should go to Washington as a last call, not the first call.''

 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The contempt trial of Charles Bakaly III is something of a
curiosity in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In a town where leaks flow like a powerful torrent down every
avenue, the prosecution of a spokesman based on an innocuous
disclosure seems almost comically misplaced. Nevertheless, Bakaly,
who was the spokesman for the independent counsel Kenneth Starr,
faces a criminal conviction for denying that he was the source for
a New York Times reporter in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For defense attorneys, the prosecution of a government lawyer
would have been welcome if it were for leaking information that
could not legally be made public. Government lawyers routinely leak
facts from grand-jury proceedings and commit other ethical
violations with no response from most federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   But Bakaly is not in the dock on such a charge _ he is accused
of criminal contempt under a rule that punishes false statements
that delay or obstruct a court. The statements and the delay,
however, came after a legal error of the court itself, which
misinterpreted a federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to initiate an inquiry into confidential
communications raised serious concerns for lawyers who handle
high-profile cases. The decision to pursue a criminal case against
Bakaly only magnifies those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly's problem began with a Times article citing unnamed
``associates'' in the Office of the Independent Counsel in
explaining options for the investigation. The article said that the
office was still considering indicting the president, and that his
impeachment would not affect the ultimate decision of whether to
prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   These options had been widely discussed by various legal
commentators. And it was already well known that, as the article
also said, some on Starr's staff favored prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a typical grand-jury case, in which a target's identity
is confidential, the independent counsel's investigation was aimed
quite publicly at the president. The preference by some lawyers in
Starr's office for prosecution is hardly surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was not the content of the article, in short, but
its timing. It appeared at a critical stage in the impeachment of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For most judges, the article would have justified no more than a
tongue-lashing in chambers. But in a critical error, Chief Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson decided the article contained secret
grand-jury information _ though nothing in it remotely resembled
such information.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted a prosecution under the federal grand-jury law, which
could have brought a lengthy prison sentence. The Court of Appeals
disagreed, however, and found that the article did not contain any
secret grand-jury information.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson then proceeded to fashion a criminal-contempt
violation against Bakaly, a charge that gives her enormous
discretion and allows her to sit in judgment without a jury. Bakaly
was now charged with lying to the court in denying that he was a
source of the information and then having his office file false
papers denying that it was the origin of the information. Bakaly
insists that he truthfully denied releasing ``nonpublic''
information and admitted he had spoken with the reporter.
</P>
<P>
   More is at stake here than the future of an accused leaker with
a penchant for mismatched outfits.
</P>
<P>
   Most judges are uncomfortable with statements in the press about
pending cases and would like lawyers to keep monastic silence.
Lawyers, however, need to defend their clients both in court and in
public. All parties, even the government, are allowed to speak to
reporters so long as their comments do not influence or prejudice a
case or release information under seal.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson says she will convict Bakaly if the government can
show that his statements ``required the court to hold two
in-chambers conferences with outside counsel'' or imposed
unnecessary work or costs _ hardly grievous injuries.
</P>
<P>
   None of this completely exonerates Bakaly, who should have been
more forthcoming at the outset of the inquiry. Moreover, the use of
leaks by all sides in the Clinton crisis was itself a scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In a city of habitual leakers, however, the prosecution of
Bakaly offers no more justice than a random execution for
collective guilt.

 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The artist Gary Larson published a ``Far Side'' cartoon a few
years ago under the heading ``Optimistic Parents.''
</P>
<P>
   A boy with a glazed expression sits clutching the joystick as he
plays a video game, his parents watching from the doorway. A
thought-bubble above their heads depicts the newspaper want ads
years later, with column after column seeking applicants for
high-paying jobs requiring a minimum of 30,000 hours of video-game
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. Even in our increasingly computerized world,
dexterity with a video joystick is of virtually no value to
employers, and the endless hours spent acquiring it divert children
from developing skills that really matter, such as writing clearly.
</P>
<P>
   To learn to write, it helps to do a lot of reading. Many parents
feared that the compellingly realistic images of video games
threatened to eliminate reading from the American childhood
experience.
</P>
<P>
   False alarm. Parents across the land have been thrilled to see
their children curled up with the 734-page fourth installment of
the ``Harry Potter'' series. With an initial print run of 3.8
million copies and millions more on the way, our children will
spend more time reading this summer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   How did author J.K. Rowling manage to use ink on a printed page
to defeat the pull of modern electronic wizardry?
</P>
<P>
   Critics may be divided on the literary merits, but young readers
really like these books. There have always been good books,
however, and quality alone cannot explain the most dazzlingly
successful book launch in history.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the phenomenon, we must look to the special
properties that make markets for popular culture so different from
the markets described in economics textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   In textbook accounts, the attractiveness of any given product
depends on its style, quality and other specific attributes. But
when books, movies, sporting events and television programs are
being sold, the choices made by other buyers also matter a great
deal.
</P>
<P>
   After all, an important element of reading a book or seeing a
movie is the ability to discuss the experience with friends.
Indeed, once the popularity of a cultural experience reaches a
certain threshold, failure to consume it may entail significant
social costs.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, this past winter, many people simply could not
participate in office conversations on Mondays if they had failed
to watch ``The Sopranos'' the night before. Current sales levels
suggest that children who haven't read the latest Potter novel may
pay a similar social price.
</P>
<P>
   Markets for popular cultural offerings differ in a second way
from ordinary markets, in which the more one consumes of something,
the less one is willing to pay to obtain more of it. Even a hungry
person, for example, generally would pay less for a second sandwich
than for the first. This is the law of diminishing marginal
utility.
</P>
<P>
   In many markets for popular culture, the actual pattern is the
reverse. Early fans of ``Saturday Night Live'' will recall, for
instance, that although the first of John Belushi's Samurai skits
was hilarious, it had nothing like the impact of later episodes, in
which Belushi's mere appearance in his Samurai outfit summoned
howls of laughter. Similarly, for many young readers, the more
Potter novels they read, the keener their desire to read another.
</P>
<P>
   Self-reinforcing processes like these give rise to
winner-take-all markets, in which small differences between
contestants often produce enormous differences in economic reward.
In such markets, only a small handful from the initial multitude of
contestants end up as big winners, and the question of who those
winners will be is often decided by differences that may seem
insignificant at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Winner-take-all markets often encourage furious jockeying for
position among contestants. Other authors, perhaps a wastefully
large number, will rush to imitate Rowling's success.
</P>
<P>
   Most of their efforts may prove fruitless, yet we must be
grateful for the explosively self-reinforcing processes that
characterize this particular market. Without them, no book could
hope to compete with the more spectacular media that vie for our
children's attention.
</P>

University in Ithaca, N.Y.)

 By RICHARD NORTON SMITH  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An unconventional convention? That's what planners of the coming
GOP coronation in Philadelphia are promising, with no stem-winding
keynoter and no interminable roll call of the states to ratify the
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Survivor Republicanism, with Pat Robertson, Alan
Keyes and most of the party's congressional leadership voted off
the island of prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Some rules, however, are inviolable. Sentiment is to national
party conventions what cleavage is to the Academy Awards. Anyone
watching the Philadelphia proceedings will be reminded most
emphatically that today's GOP is the party of Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Just as surely, no convention orator will identify himself as a
Rockefeller Republican. To party loyalists, now as a generation
ago, the term is an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, however, one should pay less attention to what
politicians say than to what they do. Among the most prominent
convention speakers will be Colin Powell, whose frank avowal of his
Rockefeller sympathies earned him instant denunciation from the
gatekeepers of Republican orthodoxy while doing nothing to diminish
his near-universal voter appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the spotlight will be a host of successful governors
such as George Pataki, Tommy Thompson, John Engler and
vice-presidential prospect Tom Ridge. Though Reaganesque in their
preference for low taxes, free trade and less federal regulation,
these highly popular figures emulate Rockefeller's ambitious
approach to problem-solving at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush himself has earned high marks for reforming
education and juvenile justice in Texas. His recent appearance
before the NAACP was clearly intended to broaden his appeal to
swing voters. For months now, the presumptive Republican nominee
has been rolling out a series of proposals addressing Social
Security, health care and other areas all but ceded to the
Democrats in the past.
</P>
<P>
   That few voters can describe these initiatives in detail hardly
matters. Their cumulative effect is to strengthen Bush's claim to
be a different kind of Republican.
</P>
<P>
   How far we have come since 1981, when President Reagan asserted
in his first inaugural: ``Government is not the solution to our
problem _ government is the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a claim unlikely to be repeated before delegates in
Philadelphia, or by the Bush campaign between now and Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   But then George W. Bush has profited handsomely not only from
his father's mistakes, but also from Bill Clinton's successes. Just
as Reagan bequeathed to his successors a broad consensus
challenging half a century of ``Washington Knows Best,'' so
Clinton, cushioned by prosperity, has been able to nudge the center
of political gravity several degrees to the left.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the State may have been buried, but the states thrive
as laboratories of policy innovation. Ironically, the very success
of Reaganism's devolution of power from Washington has placed a
premium on activist government _ at the grass roots.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller predicted as much, warning in a 1964 speech at
Harvard that the federal government would inevitably move to fill
any vacuum left by the states' abdication of social
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   For Reagan, government was an unwelcome camel, forever trying to
get its nose under the tent and into taxpayers' pockets. For
Rockefeller, government was one more weapon in an overstocked
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Given enough money, brains and good will, he argued, there was
no problem beyond solving. The United States could triumph in the
Cold War. The Republican Party could regain the majority status it
had known under the first Roosevelt and surrendered under the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Rockefeller's fiscal creativity, and a parallel
government made possible by quasi-public state agencies and the
miraculous power of bonds, New York's polluted waters could be
purified, its slums cleared, trains to Long Island made to run more
or less on time and Albany transformed from an eyesore into an
international showcase.
</P>
<P>
   In his sunny optimism, Reagan, the proverbial Big Tent
Republican, had more in common with his ideological opposite than
with his allies in the grimly sectarian right, for whom it was
always Midnight in America.
</P>
<P>
   A classic get-the-job-done pragmatist, Rockefeller took much of
his liberal coloration from his New York surroundings. For his
part, Reagan the revolutionary rarely forgot George Will's maxim:
``The American people are conservative. What they want to conserve
is the New Deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in 1964, with California polls showing him trailing Barry
Goldwater, with his fundraising a joke and the candidate himself
displaying an impolitic enthusiasm for racially integrated housing,
Rockefeller's campaign manager, Stu Spencer, urged his boss to tap
the Eastern Establishment, that fabled nexus of money, influence
and condescension that for 30 years had repeatedly frustrated party
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at it, buddy,'' Rockefeller said. ``I'm all
that's left.''
</P>
<P>
   The Establishment may be history, but the Republicans could do
worse than rehabilitate a visionary politician whose favorite
adjectives were ``bold,'' ``imaginative'' and ``exciting.'' A party
disdainful of yesterday's labels, friendly to innovation and eager
to blend entrepreneurship with compassion is not your father's GOP.
</P>
<P>
   You may not hear this proclaimed from the podium in
Philadelphia, but Nelson Rockefeller's ghost must be smiling.
</P>
<P>
   (Richard Norton Smith, a historian and past director of four
presidential libraries, is writing a biography of Nelson
Rockefeller.) &LR;

 By KAREN ARMSTRONG  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most difficult issue that Ehud Barak and Yasir Arafat will
have to deal with is likely to be the future status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem has become so central to the interior landscape of
Jews, Christians and Muslims that politicians have a difficult time
engaging in a rational debate about rights and sovereignty. Even
those Israelis and Palestinians who have no religious beliefs
contend that Jerusalem is ``holy'' to them, so sacred to their
cultural and personal identity that it is beyond the normal
give-and-take of political negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could doubt Barak's commitment to peace, but he holds
fast to the claim that has acquired the force of a mantra in
Israeli politics: Jerusalem is the eternal and indivisible capital
of the State of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   This policy, however understandable, is not politically
expedient. There can be no lasting peace in the Middle East unless
there is a solution for Jerusalem that will satisfy not only the
Palestinians and the Arabs, but also the whole Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem has been sacred to Muslims ever since the Prophet
Muhammad began to preach in 610 A.D. Muslims have lived and
worshiped in Jerusalem as long as Anglo-Saxons have been in
Britain, and Jerusalem is the third-holiest city of Islam. Muslims
in the Arab countries, Iran, Pakistan, central and southeast Asia
and Africa may accept a compromise, but not total, permanent
Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Muslims are likely to become more intransigent. History
shows that Jerusalem has always become more important to a people
after they have lost it and after political catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   The city only became central to Judaism after its destruction by
King Nebuchadnezzar in 586 B.C., the deportation of the Jews to
Babylon and the subsequent building of the Second Temple after
their return. But the new cult of Jerusalem became exclusive,
forbidding access to the temple not only to gentiles, but even to
Israelites who had not been exiled.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, after the Muslims lost Jerusalem to the Crusaders in
1099, the holy city became more crucial to Muslims than ever
before. When Saladin took Jerusalem from the Crusaders in 1187, the
city became far more aggressively Islamic and more wary of other
faiths.
</P>
<P>
   The situation today is particularly explosive, because there is
a clash between two peoples who have either lost or may be in the
process of losing Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Jews have returned to rule the holy city after an exile of
nearly 2,000 years. After the Holocaust, Jerusalem has become even
more sacred to Jewish identity. Many see Jewish Yerushalayim
arising phoenix-like from the ashes of Auschwitz. Jews are,
therefore, in the first flush of their reunion with the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinians see Jerusalem, now surrounded by the towering
new Jewish neighborhoods, as a symbol of their own beleaguered
identity. Their exile has only just begun _ as they watch their
holy city slipping daily from their grasp, Palestinians feel a
renewed passion for Al Quds, ``the Holy.''
</P>
<P>
   This clash is exacerbated by the fact that, rightly or wrongly,
the Muslim world feels humiliated by the West, with the loss of
Jerusalem an intolerable symbol.
</P>
<P>
   After the Six Day War of 1967, the Arab-Israeli conflict was
complicated by the emergence of a new religious Zionism and a
Muslim fundamentalism that have no time for the cautious pragmatism
of security politics.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot but recall the last Middle East summit held at Camp
David, attended by President Anwar Sadat, who would be murdered in
1981 partly because he signed a peace treaty with Israel. The
assassinations of Sadat and Yitzhak Rabin, both killed by fellow
countrymen who were religious fundamentalists, remind us of the
violence and terror that is often the result of giving politics a
sacred, absolute dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Yet neither Sadat nor Rabin had to deal with anything as
potentially dangerous as the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Once an issue like Jerusalem is elevated beyond the reach of
compromise, the most extreme and immoral actions become not only
possible but ``holy'' to a disaffected minority. Great courage will
be needed to cut through the prevailing rhetoric _ but without it,
irrational mythology will prevail over sober rationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Israel began as a defiantly secular state. It was made possible,
against great odds, by the inspired pragmatism of Zionist leaders,
who accepted anything they were offered, even if it fell lamentably
short of what was required, and did not allow themselves to be
boxed in by ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem has not always been the ``eternal and indivisible''
capital of Israel. Theodor Herzl, who made Zionism a political
force, deplored the ``musty deposits of 2,000 years of inhumanity,
intolerance and foulness,'' when he visited in 1898. His first
impulse was to tear the Old City down.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, during the discussion leading up to the partition of
Palestine by the United Nations, the Zionists first proposed that
they take the modern Western suburbs and cede the old city and East
Jerusalem to the Arabs. Then they agreed that Jerusalem would
become an international zone. The priority was the creation and
survival of the Jewish state, not an impracticable seizure of the
holy city of Zion.
</P>
<P>
   After the war between Israel and the Arabs in 1948, Israel
occupied West Jerusalem and agreed that Jordan should take the old
city and the eastern suburbs. It is only since 1967 that Israel has
claimed exclusive control of the whole city.
</P>
<P>
   Such exclusive policies do not work in Jerusalem. When the
Byzantine Christians gained control of the city in the fourth
century, they systematically dispossessed the pagan majority and
permanently banned Jews from Jerusalem. Their intolerant policies
alienated the local populace, and when Muslim armies invaded
Palestine in 634, Jews greeted them and gave practical help.
</P>
<P>
   When the Muslims captured Jerusalem in 638, they invited the
Jews to return to the holy city and left the Christian shrines and
residences undisturbed. Until the Crusades the city had a huge
Christian majority, and the three religions coexisted in relative
harmony. The Muslims exercised this policy not simply because the
Koran told them to respect the People of the Book, but also because
it made shrewd political sense.
</P>
<P>
   Pragmatic coexistence has worked better in Jerusalem than rigid
ideology. Is such a solution an impossible dream today?
</P>
<P>
   In 1871, the new kingdom of Italy appropriated the papal states
and confined Pius IX to the tiny city-state of the Vatican, where
he lived in high dudgeon as a self-proclaimed prisoner. Until 1937,
the popes refused to recognize the new Italy or to negotiate with
it. Today Rome is the capital of two sovereign states, which live
together in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be a model for a future Jerusalem?
</P>
<P>

City, Three Faiths'' (Knopf, 1996) and ``The Battle for God''
(Knopf, 2000).)

 By ANONYMOUS (A college admissions director) 
 c.2000 New York Times
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I went to a good college and had a great experience. It's not
the type of college that raises eyebrows at a party, nor does it
require the person I'm speaking with to mentally adjust his
perception of my intelligence. But I had a tremendous time, made
lifelong friends and grew to appreciate the world in different
ways. I recall very little stress related to the
college-applications process.
</P>
<P>
   My life today is quite different. I work as the director of
admissions at a school that does raise eyebrows. The students I
meet on a daily basis seem as intelligent as my friends did 20
years ago, only much more interested in attending a distinguished
institution (read: a school with marquee value). They want
everything I wanted, but at a place that will impress everyone.
</P>
<P>
   As I see it, three factors drive the quest to enroll at the most
selective schools: prestige, parents and fit _ in that order.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to make sweeping generalizations about the world of
college admissions. One of the major themes that I convey to
parents and students during college-information nights is that
admissions is not a fair process.
</P>
<P>
   I take solace _ as you should _ in the fact that my colleagues
tend to be thoughtful, caring people. We know that this process
deflates egos and strains family relationships. However, even, our
rejections can help steer a candidate to a sound choice, especially
if fit has been as important a consideration as prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I was standing in the reception area of the admissions
office observing families progressing through the ritual known as
the multistop college tour. I noted that there was little joy in
the room. During my 14 years in college admissions, I've seen this
dynamic change. What was once an exciting time for parents to
explore new horizons with their sons and daughters has become, for
many, an almost overwhelming endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, parents looked anxious and students seemed dazed _
perhaps because they believe, in the end, that colleges
(particularly the most competitive ones) are far too unpredictable,
fickle even, in the way they determine who makes the cut.
Frequently, I find the subtext of these visits is to clear up
rumors: Is it true the university really likes my high school? Are
there vacancies in your band that will influence your
deliberations? Are you hoping to build the classics program? These
steer much of the conversation associated with college admissions.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could give unqualified answers, but I can't. And herein
lies the frustration for all those weary parents. The objectives of
an institution are like a moving target. They can change almost
annually. One cannot adequately prepare to be a top candidate for a
brand-name college by cultivating a set of skills that meet today's
priorities; tomorrow's may be very different.
</P>
<P>
   So, amid all these shifting currents, what do those of us who
make these borderline decisions value most in a candidate?
</P>
<P>
   First of all, we want to see academic commitment and initiative,
a rigorous scholastic record and demonstrated excellence in
nonclassroom activities. As admissions officers shape a class, we
realize that a diversity of talents and interests creates a
stronger learning environment. Often, though, there's an abundance
of students with attention-grabbing attributes, forcing us to
choose among thousands of compelling candidates. We ultimately
arrive at conclusions that may be seen as capricious.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, I would argue that our choices are thoughtful
and deliberate. When the orchestra conductor tells us that the
brass section is dwindling, we look extra hard for trombonists and
tuba players. The prospect of having no orchestra is even more
alarming than admitting a student whose SAT scores are well below
our average.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, it's true: as we narrow our field of candidates, most
admissions officers will give extra consideration to
underrepresented minorities, athletes in whom the school has
already shown interest and children of alumni or others who have
the potential to donate handsomely to the institution one day. Do
these factors drive the decision? Absolutely not! However, they do
influence the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Consider an applicant who's able to fill a pivotal position on
the soccer team. A blue-chip athlete might well determine the
success of a sports program. The added value of a winning team
promotes school spirit and alumni pride, something both students
and parents weigh as they assess potential colleges.
</P>
<P>
   On a larger scale, at Division I institutions a successful
football season can generate enough revenue to support every other
athletic team. College admissions is about trade-offs. I must
consider issues affecting the entire campus and its viability when
admitting candidates whose greatest strengths may be nonacademic.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues also come into play in the case of legacy
candidates. Naturally, we all hope that our alma maters will be
responsive to our children during the admissions process. We value
the family traditions we have created. And if our children are
happy with their schools, we're more inclined to support annual
giving. The benefit of these gifts can stretch to include
sponsoring endowed chairs and improving physical facilities. Again,
the responsible admissions officer cannot lose sight of the big
picture.
</P>
<P>
   If this is not always good news for students, it can be just as
disappointing for their parents. We want what's best for our
children, but we also want to be proud of their accomplishments.
However, it's been my observation that overly ambitious parents can
sometimes turn what should be four of their child's best years into
something considerably less appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The Ivy League may make for great dinner party conversation, but
is it the best match for your child? Along those lines, parents
sometimes insist that their children take test-preparation courses,
or they hire independent counselors for them. I'm not a big fan of
either, though I understand parents usually arrange for such help
with the best of intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Similar motivations have prompted many families to consider
early-decision options. Some institutions say that students who
enroll this way are happier, but I've seen few facts to support
this claim. One advantage to enrolling students early is that it
allows an institution to lower its admissions rate, bolstering its
perception as a selective (and therefore more prestigious) school.
But as you review statistics about early admissions, keep in mind
that your child may change between the autumn of his senior year
and the following spring. What appears to be an ideal choice in
October could be viewed as less so come April.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, college selection is an imprecise, fallible
process. Last year's truth is this year's unsubstantiated
assumption. So I urge parents to think about what an institution
has to offer their son or daughter before they consider the
school's name. Help your child find value in himself and his
achievements. Most important, help him understand that if he does
not attend a school with a big name, he can still have a terrific
college experience. I did.

   If you can't get enough of the king of crustaceans, here's how
you can get your fill, regardless of where you live.

<P>
   BEST PICNIC
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Seafood Direct of Rockland, Maine, will overnight its
Lobster Dinner Special _ two one-and-a-half-pound lobsters, alive
and definitely kicking _ in a freezer-pack-lined cooler. Also
included: bibs, cooking how-tos, three pounds of steamer clams, a
plump shrimp cocktail, velvety lobster bisque and, for dessert,
chocolate truffles.
</P>
<P>
   Before cooking your lobsters (we prefer steaming), cover them
with a damp towel and store them in the bottom drawer of your
refrigerator _ not in the bathtub or on ice _ for no longer than 24
hours. And don't get too attached, warns ASD's Emanuel Angelos:
``They're ornery, cutthroat critters,'' no matter how sweet and
tender the end result. $131.75, shipping included; (800) 227-1116.
</P>
<P>
   CHEFS' BESTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Thomas Keller, French Laundry, Yountville, Calif.; (707)
944-2380: ``We do a wonderful butter-braised lobster; braising
prevents lobster from getting tough. I also like lobster steamed
and dipped in butter _ on the dock in Stonington, Maine, the
lobster source for the French Laundry.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Carole Peck, Good News Cafe, Woodbury, Conn.; (203) 266-4663;
``Our menu has a lobster baked macaroni that's so popular I can't
take it off the menu, even though it's a rich, wintry dish. It's
made with penne, Swiss chard, imported provolone, heavy cream and
chives, all laced with truffle oil.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jonathan Cartwright, The White Barn Inn, Kennebunkport, Maine;
(207) 967-2321: ``I like to do a steamed lobster on a bed of
homemade fettuccine, with a julienne of snow peas, carrots and
ginger. It's a very simple dish, but my Cognac and coral butter
sauce makes it deliciously less so.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Chris Freeman, The Wauwinet Inn, Nantucket,Mass.; (508)
228-0145: ``We serve lobster that's been removed from its shell and
sauteed in herb butter with lobster-caviar fettuccine, oyster
mushrooms and asparagus. We mix lobster roe into the pasta itself _
it turns the pasta red and lends it flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jasper White, Jasper's Summer Shack, Cambridge, Mass.; (617)
520-9500; ``I can't really say what my favorite way to make lobster
is _ there are so many good ways. But I do love lobster roll. It's
a humble dish, but that warm buttered roll with the cool salad on
the inside is a perfect taste experience. At Red's Eats, a little
place in Wiscasset, Maine, they give you almost a whole lobster in
each roll. That's hard to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   BEST BEACH READ
</P>
<P>
   Even if it weren't the only new book set on a fictional island
off the coast of Maine peopled by gruff lobstermen and a crew of
local eccentrics as lovable as anything out of Dickens'
imagination, it would still be our favorite. ``Stern Men''
(Houghton Mifflin; $24), Elizabeth Gilbert's engaging first novel,
features a smart-talking 18-year-old heroine who spends a memorable
summer searching for her place on this granite rock 20 miles out in
the hard, cold sea. To order this book or Jasper White's cookbook,
``50 Chowders,'' call Books Now at (800) 962-6651.
</P>
<P>
   LOBSTER FACTS
</P>
<P>
   According to the Maine Lobster Promotion Council, lobster
(Homarus americanus) has fewer calories than a comparable amount of
chicken. Lobster is also low in fat and cholesterol (if you don't
dip it in butter) and high in Omega-3 fatty acids, an important
nutrient.
</P>
<P>
   Lobsters must molt in order to grow. They shed their shells an
average of 20 times over a five-to-seven-year period before they
become adults. During the molting season, roughly July to October,
they have paper-thin shells and are called ``new shell lobsters.''
Many people consider them to be more tender than those with harder
shells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homarus americanus'' is found on the East Coast of North
America from Newfoundland to North Carolina. Other kinds of
lobsters are found throughout the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Piece by piece my body is being plundered by time. ``Wear and
tear in exchange for experience and wisdom'' is my mother's
reasoned thinking about the physical changes that accompany aging.
And while I accept this with relative ease, I dispute the equation
vigorously when it comes to teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed with good genes, many people I know smile at themselves
in their bathroom mirrors and see reflections of the same pebbly
whites that broke through their swollen 6-year-old gums five
decades before. They are like the teeth excavated by archaeologists
that bit and chewed long before the toothbrush was invented, teeth
so rich with detail they tell stories about culture right down to
what, once upon a time, constituted an evening's meal.
</P>
<P>
   These teeth _ eternity makers, I call them _ outlive their
owners by centuries. They are the kind of teeth I wish I had.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up before water was fluoridated, when floss was
considered esoteric and pain-free dentistry was oxymoronic. A candy
lover and a sloppy brusher, I spent lots of after-school time at
the dentist's office, inhaling the clove-scented air and getting my
teeth drilled. Those cavities, mini-mines of mercury-silver
amalgam, generated much income for my dentist, whose own smile
needed some serious attending to.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, I never cottoned to Dr. Levine and his fake
cheeriness. But I did grow to love Hannah, his dental assistant, a
rosy-cheeked woman who wore a stiff nurse's cap and rubber-soled
shoes that squeaked against the high-gloss floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll do better next checkup,'' she would say reassuringly as
she dabbed my welling eyes and let me grip her ringed fingers as
the dentist drilled. She inspired me to tell my junior high school
yearbook editor that my professional goal was to someday become an
oral hygienist.
</P>
<P>
   On the cusp of puberty, with barely any white enamel surface
left to fill, I moved to the next tier of dental care,
orthodonture.
</P>
<P>
   My buck-toothed smile, the result, I was told, of shameless
round-the-clock thumb sucking, would undergo six years of
restructuring. In the end I would chew more efficiently, and in the
bargain, gain a winning smile.
</P>
<P>
   My appointments for appliance adjustments were scheduled on
Fridays, after school, so that weekends often began with dull
throbbing pain and lots of aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   One particular November afternoon, everything seemed in its
place _ the gurgling fish tank, the ``Highlights'' magazines strewn
all over the floor and the wall hangings, artwork signed by the
orthodontist's wife. Instead of the usual Muzak, however, there was
talk, solemn and urgent.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Kennedy is dead; we repeat, President Kennedy is
dead,'' I heard. The receptionist sobbed and the phone rang and
rang unanswered. Death and dentistry became entwined, forever
cemented.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother's teeth were gone long before her death at 93.
She wore dentures, look-alikes of the souvenir wind-up chatterers I
had won at a carnival.
</P>
<P>
   Each night she soaked them in a glass of water perched atop her
night table, a sunken treasure of pink and pearls. Before sliding
them in each morning, she looked pinched and puckered, her tongue
like a lost horse searching for its corral. But she accepted her
toothless fate good-naturedly, rarely complaining about her diet of
easy-to-swallow, baby-food-like concoctions _ soups, custards and
overcooked pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Spring, with its holiday barbecues, presented the exception. It
was the time of year when she watched us enviously as we ate our
blackened meats to the bone and husks of corn on the cob bare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is God in those kernels,'' she would say, lingering over
spoonfuls of mashed potatoes, forcing us to think about the impact
and end of simple pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   My sister, a Bavarian pretzel eater, someone who goes for the
toothsome and crunchy, recently had a permanent molar removed
because of disease that had descended into her jawbone. This
ominous reminder has pushed to full-throttle my small-scale war on
plaque, gingivitis, tartar and other Madison Avenue-fueled teeth
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   I own a top-of-the-line electric toothbrush, a WaterPik and an
arsenal of toothpastes so varied, they crowd the shelves of my
sizable medicine cabinet. To stymie the periodontal disease that
has wreaked havoc on my ascending gumline, I undergo two extra
cleanings a year.
</P>
<P>
   And while I am loath to admit it, I floss in my rearview mirror
while waiting for traffic lights to turn green. It is my vain
attempt to keep a part of me going long after I am gone.
</P>

 By SUSAN COBURN 
 c.2000 Susan Coburn  
 FROM: The New York Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 World rights 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Victor Strecher, the associate director for cancer
prevention and control at the University of Michigan's
Comprehensive Cancer Center in Ann Arbor, is well aware of the
profound influence of the Internet on the practice of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huge numbers of my patients,'' he said, ``come in with stacks
of information from the Web and demand, `See, this is what I've
learned; now, what do you know?'''
</P>
<P>
   While Strecher said that he appreciated patients who assumed
responsibility for their own health, he noted, ``Anybody can put
anything out on the Web, and patients are inundating physicians
with all this information and expecting us to sort out the proven
from the suspected from the absolute dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a daunting task, particularly when an ever-greater number
of patients are asking time-pressed doctors to do it. Cyber
Dialogue Inc., a Manhattan Internet research firm, reported that as
of last month more than 40 million adults had used the Internet to
search for health information, an increase of 30 percent over last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said Dr. Donald Palmisano, a New Orleans surgeon
and a trustee of the American Medical Association, is that given
the uneven quality of data on the Web, do-it-yourself medical
research does not necessarily make a more informed patient. Nor
does lugging journal articles to a checkup create the ideal
beginning for a productive doctor-patient
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't bring in a telephone book to your doctor and expect
him to read it and examine you at the same time,'' Palmisano said.
``But you can use the Internet to become more knowledgeable about
your disease and facilitate a more focused discussion of treatment
options.''
</P>
<P>
   Gleaning the information you need from the seemingly boundless
Web is a matter of knowing how and where to find it. The challenge
is whittling down huge online databases into a manageable quantity
of relevant information that you can discuss with your doctor.
</P>
<P>
   First, familiarize yourself with the medical terminology for the
information you are seeking. An online search for ``cancer,'' for
example, will result in an unwieldy amount of data. Narrow your
search to ``Stage IIIB breast cancer'' and your search results will
be more focused. Also, do not hesitate to ask your doctor to
recommend reliable Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   To locate useful Internet sites on your own, head to a health
directory, ideally one sponsored by the government, an educational
institution or a well-respected medical institution. In contrast to
general-purpose Internet search engines, like AltaVista, which spew
out a list of thousands of Web sites in no particular order or
format, health directories organize your search results into
categories that can be reviewed quickly. While computerized search
engines sift through thousands of Web sites for a particular term,
health directories do most of the legwork by compiling and
organizing your search results into a logical format.
</P>
<P>
   Federal health directories, for example, offer a trove of
filtered information and data. A search on the Web site
Healthfinder (www.healthfinder.gov), for example, which is
sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services, generates
a manageable list of reliable government and nongovernment
publications, clearinghouses, databases and Web support groups on
hundreds of topics.
</P>
<P>
   You can use Healthfinder to develop a general understanding of a
diagnosis and treatment options, but watch out for some of the
site's quirks: a search for ``colon cancer,'' for example, yields
few results, while ``colorectal cancer'' locates much data.
</P>
<P>
   For intensive medical research, the directory for the National
Institutes of Health (www.nih.gov) provides free access to Medline,
a database of more than nine million references and abstracts.
Avoid information overload by limiting a Medline search to the last
two to five years, and by narrowing the search topic as much as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   But before visiting your doctor with intriguing Medline
references, double-check the relevance of your findings with
university medical centers and well-known clinics that use the
latest technology and treatments. The University of Pennsylvania
Cancer Center's OncoLink (www.oncolink.com) provides easily
understood information on all types of cancers. The Mayo Clinic's
Health Oasis (www.mayohealth.org) offers data and guidance on a
wide range of medical conditions (including cancer), fast-breaking
health news and interactive tools like Ask the Mayo Physician and
Ask the Dietician.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit organizations can be excellent sources of
disease-specific information. A general rule is to consult only
organizations that are recognizable and respected.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society (www.cancer.org) and the National
Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations (www.nabco.org), for
example, offer a wealth of information, a list of questions to ask
your doctor and news on evolving cancer treatment protocols from
the National Cancer Institute. But not all nonprofit organizations
are as altruistic: a surprising number of sites are created with a
specific bias (say, toward a particular pharmaceutical brand) or
marketing agenda _ another reason to stick with well-known names.
</P>
<P>
   Though the reliability of disease-specific ``listservs,'' or
Internet mailing lists, is variable, a good list can put you in
touch with a network of patients who may provide more information
about your problem than your doctor. One source worth checking is
the Association of Cancer Online Resources (www.acor.org). Gilles
Frydman, the husband of a breast cancer survivor, created the site
several years ago when he was helping his wife research the
disease. His network of mailing lists has grown to 150.
</P>
<P>
   Dot.com fever has produced a number of commercial ventures, many
with catchy mottos and eye-catching graphics. Most of these
commercial sites, however, include the same standard offerings,
including breaking medical news, medical encyclopedias, information
on clinical trials, chat groups and ask-an-expert services to
provide answers to your basic health needs.
</P>
<P>
   Financing for commercial sites generally comes from
advertisements, sponsorships and online stores. A growing number of
sites are offering additional services and products to boost
revenues, including insurance-claims processing (linking doctors
and health insurers) and customized Web sites for doctors,
pharmaceutical companies and health care organizations.
</P>
<P>
   MedicaLogic/Medscape is one of the most popular of the
commercial ventures. Registered users of its site for
professionals, Medscape (www.medscape.com), and its site for the
lay consumer, CBSHealthWatch (www.cbshealthwatch.com), together
numbered 2.2 million at the end of March. The editor in chief for
both sites is Dr. George Lundberg, a former editor of the Journal
of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Medscape.com is a favorite of doctors because of its specialized
medical information and next-day conference summaries.
CBSHealthWatch.com, a joint venture of MedicaLogic/Medscape and CBS
News, provides a layperson's account of health issues and an
assortment of personal-health-management features, like interactive
health diaries and a nutrition calculator.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest challenge in finding health information on
the Web is assessing what you get. The Internet remains an
unregulated medium with little standing in the way of charlatans
offering misguided information cloaked in scientific jargon.
</P>
<P>
   But though no Web site is perfect, the best ones share the same
distinguishing features. You should be able to easily spot who
manages the site and how it is financed. Look for clear
identification of the writers and editors; ideally, contributors
are affiliated with respectable and longstanding academic or
medical institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Online health industry leaders are taking steps to provide
consumers with guidelines to evaluate Web sites. One visible effort
is the Health on the Net Foundation, a Geneva nonprofit
organization focused on improving the quality of health
information. There is no guarantee that all the material on a site
with the HON logo is accurate, but those that display it have
agreed, in principle, to certain standards of conduct pertaining to
credentials, references, confidentiality, financing and advertising
policies.
</P>
<P>
   TIPS FOR SIFTING THROUGH HEALTH SITES
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips on making the most out of the health
information sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   PRIVACY: Steer clear of sites that ask for a lot of personal
information. If you need to register to access information, study
the site's privacy policy.
</P>
<P>
   DATES: Health information changes rapidly, particularly in
fields like cancer and heart disease, in which new research
findings abound. Reputable Web sites include a date for each posted
article.
</P>
<P>
   CREDIBILITY: The most clever quack sites are wrapped in cloaks
of scientific jargon. Look for peer-reviewed, published studies by
well-known academic centers or research institutions. Be wary of
personal testimonials.
</P>
<P>
   LINKS: Web sites usually have a policy on how they establish
links to other sites. Don't assume that links from a reputable site
will always lead to other reputable sites. If the link is
unfamiliar, use common sense in evaluating its information.
</P>
<P>
   SPONSORS: Running a Web site costs money. The source of funds
should be stated clearly. The best sites also clearly separate
advertisements, sponsorships and online stores from content.
</P>
<P>

Greenwich Time.)

   FINDING HEALTH INTERNET SITES YOU CAN TRUST
</P>
<P>
   MEDICINE-WEB-SITES-LIFEBEAT _ A Manhattan Internet research firm
recently reported that more than 40 million adults have used the
Internet to search for health information. However, given the
uneven quality of data on the Web, do-it-yourself medical research
does not necessarily make a more informed patient. Gleaning
accurate information on the Web is a matter of knowing how and
where to find it. By Susan Coburn.

   A COLLEGE ADMISSIONS DIRECTOR TELLS THE TRUTH ABOUT ``GETTING
IN''
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE-ADMISSIONS-LIFEBEAT _ According to the director of
admissions at a prestigious college who chooses to write
anonymously, there are three factors that propel candidates toward
the most selective schools: prestige, parents and fit _ in that
order. There are many well-qualified students, and ``admissions is
not a fair process.'' An institution's objectives ``are like a
moving target.'' They can change almost annually as admissions
directors strive to balance the incoming class and meet the
school's needs.

   DENTAL-HEALTH-LIFEBEAT _ The author, who ``grew up before water
was fluoridated, when floss was considered esoteric and pain-free
dentistry was oxymoronic,'' spent lots of after-school time with
her dentist and later, with her orthodontist. Now, she owns ``a
top-of-the-line electric toothbrush, a WaterPik and an arsenal of
toothpastes so varied, they crowd the shelves of my sizable
medicine cabinet.'' Knowing that a good set of choppers can survive
the owner, she says that this is her ``vain attempt to keep a part
of me going long after I am gone.'' By Annie Lubliner Lehman.

England to enjoy a fresh lobster. You can have one shipped to you.
Some well-known chefs discuss their favorite ways of preparing and

book about lobstering on the Maine coast and reveal a few facts
about ``the king of crustaceans.'' Compiled by Anthony Barzilay

   RACE-BIRACIAL-FAMILY-CENTERPIECE _ When I was a kid growing up
in Chicago, I used to do anything I could to put off going to bed.
One of my favorite delaying tactics was to engage my mother in a
discussion about the important questions of the day, questions my
friends and I had debated in the backyards of our neighborhood that
afternoon _ like who did God root for, the Cubs or the White Sox?
(The correct answer was, and still is, the White Sox.) Then one
night I remember asking my mother something I had been wondering
for a long time. ``Mom,'' I asked, ``What am I?'' ``You're my
darling Donny,'' she said. ``I know. But what else am I?'' ``You're
a precious little boy who someday will grow up to be a wonderful,
handsome man.'' ``What I mean is, you're white and Dad's black, so
what does that make me?'' By Don Terry. (6,000 words.)

   RACE-FORUM-CENTERPIECE _ In a forum held at The New York Times
on June 19, eight editors and reporters talked about working on the
paper's ``How Race Is Lived in America'' project. Specifically,
they were asked how their own attitudes about race were affected by
the experience. Their comments help to underscore how complicated
the issue of race remains. Moderated by Sam Roberts. (2,600 words;

   RACE-ENNUI-ESSAY-CENTERPIECE _ Race is no longer a biological
reality. Scientists have shown that there are more differences
within designated racial groups than between them. It's race
history that matters now; our culture, our politics, the way our
minds are formed and the oh-so-many tricks our psyches play. We

 By MARGO JEFFERSON  
 c.2000 Margo Jefferson  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago I found myself moderating a panel, all of whose
participants were people of color. I no longer remember the topic.
I do remember that each of us was supposed to make an introductory
statement, and that when we got to my Chinese-American friend, he
announced that he could talk about race but did not intend to.
``Race can be so boring,'' he said, and then sat back to see what
would happen next.
</P>
<P>
   Each face in the crowd looked stricken, outraged, relieved or
cautious. (The cautious ones kept glancing around to see which
expression would win out before they committed themselves). But I
was tickled. My friend wasn't asking any of us to ignore race; he
was trying his best to provoke a discussion that just might be
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Race is no longer a biological reality. Scientists have shown
that there are more differences within designated racial groups
than between them. It's race history that matters now; our culture,
our politics, the way our minds are formed and the oh-so-many
tricks our psyches play. We know that love, sex, friendship and
work don't take any one shape in our lives. Why do we coarsen and
simplify race so often? Why must we so often make it boring?
</P>
<P>
   To bore isn't simply to be dull and monotonous; it is to drive,
drill or close in relentlessly. When I was growing up it was a bore
to be praised over and over for acting like any other
upper-middle-class American. Speaking standardized English became
``You speak so beautifully'' or ``articulately.'' A father who was
a doctor and a mother who was a chic housewife could suddenly be a
cause of astonishment, delight or chilly disbelief, as in this
exchange from my elementary school years: The parent of a friend:
``And what does your father do?''
</P>
<P>
   Me: ``He's a pediatrician.''
</P>
<P>
   (Pause)
</P>
<P>
   Parent: ``A pediatrician? Are you sure you don't mean a
podiatrist?''
</P>
<P>
   I repeated this exchange to my mother and she explained the
subtext with chagrin and reluctance. I must be prepared for such
remarks, she said, but everyone wasn't so insecure or so
prejudiced. Did it affect all of my relations with schoolmates, not
least the child of this rude and doubting parent? No.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of thing came and went, like bad and good weather,
like a slap or a scolding followed by ease and good times. I used
to think it a luxury that the whites I knew didn't have to think so
much about race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consciously think about race'' is what I should have said, for
race was there, knocking around in the nether regions of their
minds, lurching to the surface in all kinds of ways. The part of a
person that must study race consciously from childhood on - race
etiquette, race facts and fictions, race terrors, delights and
grotesqueries - is studying a second language. Nowadays, everybody
seems to need one. And languages are best learned early in life.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't want to sound smug. This learning can overwhelm you
in all kinds of ways. Your ideas can get stale and repetitive. Your
vocabulary can get stunted. Your defenses can start to matter more
than the freedom to think and act as you please. And then there are
the scoldings and penalties when you make a mistake. How could you,
how dare you shame your own people by doing something that showed
them in a bad light? And how little it used to take for that light
to shine! At one point I developed an unsavory habit of tidying up
any public bathroom I'd been in lest the white person who came in
next thought me responsible for such slovenliness. ``You can get
away with this - I can't,'' I would think, in scorn and despair.
</P>
<P>
   What a dreary little compulsion. Boring in the deepest sense,
for we are wrong to think of boredom as a kind of civilized
weariness. To be in the grip of boredom is to be paralyzed, stuck
in a past that makes the present hopeless and the future pointless.
The storytellers and the audience keep changing, but the story
stays the same.
</P>
<P>
   It would bore me, for instance _ I would find it unbearable, in
fact _ to think that anyone reading this believes that the Race
Question takes up all my social and psychic time. Whole portions of
my life are spent acting, thinking and dreaming in ways that have
nothing to do with racial crisis; moving between white and black
culture with pleasure and a sense of entitlement. And I don't
always bother to call them ``black'' and ``white.''
</P>
<P>
   Race is permanently stored in my memory. (In America, if it's
not stored in your memory it's stored in your fantasies.) Sometimes
I summon it up and arrange it in all sorts of ways. Sometimes
circumstances demand a quite conventional narrative. And sometimes
race is there but not there, like those galaxies that are invisible
to the naked eye and can only be seen accurately when one turns the
most refined equipment on them with the greatest care.

   When I was a kid growing up in Chicago, I used to do anything I
could to put off going to bed. One of my favorite delaying tactics
was to engage my mother in a discussion about the important
questions of the day, questions my friends and I had debated in the
backyards of our neighborhood that afternoon _ like who did God
root for, the Cubs or the White Sox? (The correct answer was, and
still is, the White Sox.)
</P>
<P>
   Then one night I remember asking my mother something I had been
wondering for a long time. ``Mom,'' I asked, ``What am I?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're my darling Donny,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know. But what else am I?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a precious little boy who someday will grow up to be a
wonderful, handsome man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I mean is, you're white and Dad's black, so what does
that make me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I see,'' she said. ``Well, you're half-black and you're
half-white, so you're the best of both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I told my friends that I was neither black nor
white. ``I'm the best of both worlds,'' I announced proudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, you're crazy,'' one of the backyard boys said. ``You're
not even the best of your family. Your sister is. That girl is
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of my life, I've tried to believe my mother. Having
grown up in a family of blacks and whites, I'd long thought I saw
race more clearly than most people. I appreciated being able to get
close to both worlds, something few ever do. It was like having a
secret knowledge. And yet I've also known from an early age that
things were more complicated than my mother made them out to be.
Our country, from its very beginnings, has been obsessed with
determining who is white and who is black. Our history has been
shaped by that disheartening question. To be both black and white,
then, is to do nothing less than confound national consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   My mother denies it, but it has also sometimes confounded our
family. For as my mother was answering my bedtime question, my
brothers, David and Robert, her children from an earlier marriage,
were going to sleep in a house 15 miles away. My father was black.
David and Robert's was white. They lived with my grandmother in an
all-white neighborhood. I lived with my mother and my younger
sister, Diane, in Hyde Park, a mixed neighborhood on the South Side
of Chicago. We shared a loving parent, but we lived in separate
Americas. We have spent most of our lives trying to come together.
</P>
<P>
   My father, Bill Terry, was born in Covington, Ky., in 1921, the
grandson of slaves. In his youth, he was a professional boxer.
Later, he went to work as a bodyguard for the unions in Chicago,
cracking scab heads. He was one black man who was not at all shy
about standing up to authority. In his late 30's, he became an
actor. He was good at it, too. My mother told me years later that
when my father walked onto a stage to deliver his lines in ``The
Death of Bessie Smith,'' the audience gasped. ``He had presence,''
my mother said. ``Incredible presence.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a lifelong integrationist, but the nonviolent civil
rights movement was not for him. He could not understand how
protesters could allow themselves to be roughed up and spat on at
sit-ins and not defend themselves. Bill Terry didn't turn the other
cheek; he threw the other fist.
</P>
<P>
   My mother, Jeanne Katherine Ober, was born in 1918 and was
reared on a dairy farm outside the village of Greenwood, Ill. She
was sent to high school in Chicago and then, at 25, she returned
home to marry the son of a wealthy farmer. It was a rocky union:
her husband drank too much, and after eight years of marriage, my
mother left, taking her two sons to Chicago _ David was 8, Robert
was 2. There, she opened a nursery school and became involved in
civil rights work through her Unitarian church. Until then, she had
never personally known a black person.
</P>
<P>
   My parents met in 1956, at a party of racially mixed hipsters.
He was 35; she was 38. As my mother tells it, she had been eyeing
my father for much of the evening. He was the center of attention,
with his boxer's grace and a smile that could light up the darkest
corners of the room. Before long, my father asked my mother to
dance. At 6 feet 2 inches, he towered over her. Soon, my parents
were living together _ along with David and Robert _ in my mother's
four-bedroom Colonial in Evanston, a Chicago suburb. Ten months
after they met, I was born.
</P>
<P>
   I was 6 months old when my father decided he wanted to sell the
house and move to California. When my mother's mother heard about
the plan, she had a fit. My grandmother said the boys needed
stability and insisted they live with her and her second husband,
Gerhard Raven. My staying with Grandpa Raven was not an option. On
the day Grandpa Raven found out my mother was carrying a black
man's baby, he got uncharacteristically drunk. My grandmother told
him about the pregnancy at a restaurant because she felt that
perhaps if she explained it in a public place, he might not
explode. When they got home, Gerhard poured himself a drink and
took it outside to the front porch. He sat on the cement steps
muttering about the ``goddamn niggers.''
</P>
<P>
   When we left for California, the plan was for my parents to send
for my brothers once we got settled. But ``instead of getting
settled,'' my mother said, ``we got poor.'' We quickly ran out of
money. My father lost his landscaping job and stopped looking for
work. Less than a year after arriving in L.A., he hopped into our
car and disappeared without saying goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   My mother was desperate. She used her last few dollars to buy a
plane ticket to get the two of us back to Chicago, where she knew
my father was headed. We arrived around Christmas with nowhere to
go. My grandmother made it clear that we were not welcome at her
house. We spent the holiday sleeping in the home of a black friend
of my mother's. ``I was disowned,'' my mother said recently, when I
asked her about those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it because of me?'' I asked, sounding to myself like a
little boy again. ``Was it because I was black?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.'' my mother said. ``No, it had nothing to do with you. My
mother was mad at me for going through the money.''
</P>
<P>
   I was surprised at how relieved I felt. I wasn't sure that I
believed her, though I desperately wanted to. One of the nightmares
of race is that it's sometimes hard to distinguish between
cruelties _ hard to know what is racism and what is the simple
human infliction of pain.
</P>
<P>
   A white friend of my mother's from the civil rights movement
allowed us to move into his roach-infested tenement on the edge of
Hyde Park. A few weeks after we got settled, my father reappeared
and my parents reconciled. We were a family again _ except that my
brothers continued to live with my grandmother and Gerhard.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, in 1959, my parents had a daughter, Diane. I
remember how happy I was that we were all together. It was
especially great to have my father around. If I bugged him enough,
he would put down his paper and, like his hero, Paul Robeson, sing
``Ol' Man River'' for me. On hot summer evenings, when it seemed
the whole neighborhood was out, my father would scoop me up in his
arms and run with me through the warm evening air. I was home. My
dad was with me; it was heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde Park itself played a major role in my happiness. The
neighborhood, which is home to the University of Chicago, had been
integrated since the late 1940's, despite the early resistance of
the university. By the time I came along, having a black father and
a white mother was common in Hyde Park. In fact, there were so many
biracial children running around the neighborhood when I was a kid
that it was almost hip to be ``mixed,'' as we called ourselves
then. It was so hip that some people who weren't pretended that
they were. Sophia, for example, was white, but she told everyone
that her father, who was from the Soviet Union, was a ``black
Russian'' _ ``You know, like the drink,'' she said. Since she was
only trying to fit in, we forgave her her lies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the mixed kids in Hyde Park were pure-blooded mulattos,
so to speak. There were Bob, Michael, Rebecca, Cindy, the Twins and
many others. All of them had black fathers and white mothers. With
so many kids who looked like me and withso many parents who looked
like mine, it was easy to feel completely comfortable saying I was
simply half and half. My memory is one of togetherness.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that even in this utopia the power of race was
entirely absent from our lives. When I was a boy, my father would
perform a ritual. He'd plop his long brown arm down on a table top
and ask me if I could see the red tint in his skin. ``See there,''
he'd say. ``That's the Indian blood in me. You have it, too. All
the Terrys do. We're a quarter Cherokee.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd carefully inspect his arm, turning it over in the light, but
all I could ever see was the brown skin of a black man. I thought
it was a strange game. He did not look like an Indian. His skin was
brown. There was nothing red about him.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing red about me either. My complexion is the
color of sand. The texture of my hair is somewhere between kinky
and curly. I have my father's full lips, and my nose and thick
eyebrows come from my mother. When I look in the mirror, it is easy
for me to see Europe and Africa dancing across my face like lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Other people, however, aren't sure what they see. When they ask,
``What's your nationality?'' I often suspect that they really mean:
are you on our side or their side? Can we trust you, brother? Are
you dangerous, nigger? I'm not sure my answer can ever really
change the interaction. These questions, these loyalty oaths, have
followed me most of my life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, our world changed. My parents got into a vicious
argument. My father had been out carousing and my mother was fed up
with him drinking up what little money we had. In a flash, my
father had his big hands wrapped around my mother's throat,
squeezing as hard as he could, banging her head against the wall.
It sounded like a thunderstorm. I was terrified. I had heard my
father yell before, but he had never picked my mother up by her
throat and screamed into her face, ``Bitch!''
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea what to do, so I threw myself at his tree trunk of
a leg and tried to bite him. Whenever I think of that night, my
father transforms, in my child's memory, into one of those scary
talking trees in ``The Wizard of Oz.'' ``Daddy!'' I screamed.
``Please stop hurting Mama. Please, Daddy. Please.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not stop. I bit him again. He banged her head some
more. My cousin Junior, who was a grown man, but not nearly as
grown as my father, somehow persuaded him to stop, and my mother
slumped to the floor, holding her throat and looking almost as
scared as I was.
</P>
<P>
   In a few minutes, the police seemed to fill up the apartment
with their rough voices and the sound of their clubs slapping
against their leather gun belts and holsters. They yelled at my
father to turn around and to put his hands behind his back so they
could put the handcuffs on. I was confused. I didn't know what was
happening. After all, the only time I really saw my father with his
hands behind his back was when he brought me candy from the corner
store. He would make me guess which hand held the sweets. Then the
police took him down the stairs, and I remember being scared all
over again. I begged them not to take my father away, but they
never turned back.
</P>
<P>
   After that, my parents separated for good. My father moved to
New York City to pursue his acting career. My mother was left with
two children in a crumbling apartment. Sometimes my mother had to
choose between buying food for us or paying the utility bills.
Once, when the electricity was cut off, my sister and I snaked an
extension cord under our front door and plugged it into a socket in
the building's hall so we could have a lamp to do homework. We went
on public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The only salvation was that, bit by bit, we started to see my
grandmother and brothers again. Of course, we could only visit my
grandmother's yellow brick bungalow on the far North Side of
Chicago when Grandpa Raven was at work or out of town on one of his
fishing trips. Grandpa Raven had a bad heart. My grandmother was
afraid that the stress of seeing his stepdaughter and her black
children would kill him. So we made sneak visits.
</P>
<P>
   To me, my brothers seemed rich. There was a push-button
television console in the living room, a new Dodge in the garage
and a freezer stuffed with ice cream bars in the basement. My
grandmother, whom we called Nana, would also sneak my brothers down
to Hyde Park, reminding them, ``Don't tell Grandpa Raven.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Raven died when I was 8. His heart finally gave out. But
I can sleep easy that the sight of a black child in his family was
not what killed him. He died never having laid eyes on me. As far I
was concerned, Grandpa Raven was an unrepentant racist; to my
brothers, however, the man who took them fishing couldn't have been
a better surrogate grandfather. ``He was better than a father,''
David said. ``He was a great guy. He was not a man motivated by
prejudice.'' My brother even had an explanation for the drunken
rantings on the steps that day: ``Rather than blame Mother,'' he
said, ``he blamed 'the niggers.'''
</P>
<P>
   In my view, David is just as blinded by his love for Grandpa
Raven as I am by my hate. I tell myself that Gerhard is racist evil
incarnate. In my heart, though, I know there is more to it than
that. The truth is a child's truth: I had wanted Gerhard to be my
grandfather, too. After Gerhard's death, we visited my grandmother
every other weekend, making up for lost years. One night, I stayed
over at Nana's. When it came time for my bath, I hopped into the
tub, pretending to recreate the moon landing, which had just taken
place. I had one foot in when Nana called from the living room,
``Remember, Donny, just because your skin is darker doesn't mean I
can't see the dirt, so scrub hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Nana didn't mean to hurt my feelings, but she did. Yet I never
thought of her as prejudiced. She was an elderly white woman,
trying to make her way in a changing world. She never said
``nigger.'' She said ``Negro.'' She tried to treat everyone fairly.
She called me ``darling'' and ``honey bunch.'' She made sure there
were always plenty of big chocolate chips in the pantry. I loved
her dearly and she loved me. Without her, we would have sunk
completely into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Biracial though I was, my first real memory of being called
``nigger'' was the same cruel rite of passage it has been for black
children the country over. I was 7, and I was playing football with
a group of white kids in a suburb 25 long miles from Hyde Park. A
boy, about my age, saw me in a neighbor's yard and started jumping
up and down. He pointed at me excitedly as he chanted: ``Nigger.
Nigger. Nigger.''
</P>
<P>
   I was shocked. I wasn't a nigger. My mother was white. Couldn't
he see her standing there, a few feet away? He had heard me call
her mom at least a half-dozen times: ``Mom, I'm having too much
fun. Mom, please can we stay a little longer so I can play with my
new friends?'' Couldn't he tell I was only half-black? He could
have easily called me whitey, honky or cracker. Why didn't he do
that? I had just as much white blood in me as black. And even if I
was all black, why was he calling me names?
</P>
<P>
   I tried to go after the boy, but my mother pulled me back. Then
she did something that shocked me _ and filled me with joy. From 10
feet away, she threw a plastic cup at the kid, hitting him in the
head and sending him running down the street, calling for his
mother. A few years after the football game, I was walking down the
street with a white friend. A well-dressed member of the Nation of
Islam asked me if I wanted to buy a copy of Muhammad Speaks, the
group's newspaper. ``No thanks,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, brother, help your people out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   'Man, you just want to be with Europeans,'' the Muslim said
bitterly, pointing his paper at my friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is a European,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother, I'm sorry for you,'' the Muslim shot back.
</P>
<P>
   Other moments also made it clear that a mixed family seemed
foreign to the eyes of America. In the summer of 1972, when I was
15, my brother David, who collects old Packards, took me to
Nebraska to pick up a 1956 Patrician. I was excited _ it was my
first out-of-town trip with one of my brothers. At the car
owner'shouse, David introduced me to a white man in white shoes. He
leaned against a white picket fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my little brother, Donny,'' he said. The man and I
shook hands. Then he stared at me. I had a huge Afro; David's
straight brown hair was cut Young Republican short. The man winked
at David. ``You mean you work together?'' he asked. ``No,'' David
said. ``I mean this is my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I get what you're saying,'' the man said. ``The Bible says
we are all brothers under the skin. It's good to see people taking
the word of God to heart.'' What a fool, I thought to myself then.
Today I know: as a person of mixed race, it's the norm to have your
closest relationships questioned at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Until I went to college, racial difference stood out for me
precisely because it was the exception to the rule. In college, it
became a defining force in my life. It didn't start that way. In
1975, when I discovered Oberlin College, I was confident I had
found a place where I could be my mixed-race self. As a stop on the
underground railroad, Oberlin had a special reputation for
enlightened race relations. It was the school's brochure that sold
me, though. Featured prominently was a picture of two baseball
players conferring on the mound. One player was white with a long
ponytail, the other black with an Afro. It looked like home.
</P>
<P>
   But at the start of freshman year, I was startled to see a very
different picture. When I walked into the dining room, black
students were sitting together at a group of tables in the middle
of the room; white students were eating together at tables along
the windows. At football and basketball games, black fans usually
sat with blacks, whites with whites. The intramural sports teams
were rarely mixed.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, I tried to recreate Hyde Park at Oberlin. I hung
out with a mixed group of friends and my intramural teams always
included white guys and black guys _ and slow guys of every color.
I decided not to join the African Heritage dorm. But even on this
supposedly liberal campus, trying to live integrated was an uphill
battle.
</P>
<P>
   A black student asked me once, ``My man, where's the mail
room?''
</P>
<P>
   ``See that brother over there?'' I said, pointing across the
nearly empty room.
</P>
<P>
   ``What brother?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That one,'' I said. ``That blond dude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, that's no brother,'' he said. ``That's a white boy.
What's wrong with you?''
</P>
<P>
   What was wrong with me? I wasn't split in two _ the world was.
And yet I was the one expected to adjust. Being away from Hyde Park
was a shock to my racial system. I felt even more out of step with
most white students. For the first time, I was exposed to white
people who had not known black people as friends, neighbors or even
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   One night, I was visiting a white girl and her white roommate in
their dorm. The door was open and we were just talking. Another
black student was also there, flirting with the roommate. I was
just about to leave when a white girl walking down the hall passed
the open door and stuck her head in. She looked disgusted. ``What's
this,'' she asked, ``a soul-brother session?'' I was stunned. What
did race have to do with anything? We were just two guys rapping to
two girls and not getting anywhere. The girl I was visiting looked
embarrassed. I wasn't sure if she was embarrassed about her rude
neighbor _ or that her rude neighbor had ``caught'' a couple of
brothers in her room.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up, I embraced blackness _ as a shield and a cause. I signed
up for a course on black nationalism. The decision was one of the
most important developments of my life. Black studies saved me. It
gave me a sense of discovery both academically and personally.
Black studies helped me find an identity. As important, it helped
me for the first time to understand my father's anger. The more I
learned the more I began to realize the struggles a black person
born in 1921 had to go through just to survive. Once, after reading
about the brutality of the race riots following the First World
War, I had to walk around the library to cool off. That was my
father's welcome to life. I didn't want to run into any of my white
friends that afternoon. I didn't know what I might say to them.
</P>
<P>
   At last, I felt in touch with my rage that race, even at my
``progressive'' college, mattered so much; that I could not
completely be who I was, Don Terry, an integrated man, with a white
mother and a black father; that I would repeatedly be lumped in a
broad racial category _ black _ and treated like a caricature
instead of the complicated individual I knew myself to be. It was
exhausting and maddening, being constantly judged by people who
thought they knew so much about me solely because of the color of
my skin when in fact they knew nothing at all. I seemed to be the
only one to understand that the Don Terry who went to campus
rallies to protest the school's investments in South Africa could,
at the end of the day, relax to the Rolling Stones. Disgusted by
the world's refusal to see me as mixed and individual, I chose
``blackness.''
</P>
<P>
   My decision, I've come to believe, had as much to do with anger
as anything else. I started using the term ``white boy,'' something
I had never done in my life. It felt liberating at first, like
standing up to a bully. But I felt guilt when I went home to Hyde
Park and spent time with my family and old friends. I was afraid I
was becoming a racist.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon, I was driving my mother's tiny Volkswagen. She
was sitting in the passenger seat. One of my best friends, Danny
Gnatz, a white guy with hair down past his shoulders, was in back.
We were talking and laughing when a fat white man, driving a big
American car, suddenly cut in front of me. We nearly collided. I
slammed on the brakes, glared out the window and shouted, ``You
stupid white son of a bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as I said it, I felt like jumping out of the car and
running away in shame. At first, my mother and Danny pretended that
they had not heard. What was going on with me? What did race have
to do with it? ``I'm sorry, you guys,'' I said. ``That's OK,
Donny,'' my mother said, patting my arm. Danny slapped me on the
back of the head, signaling that everything was all right. But we
drove a long way in silence. The incident in the car caused me to
question my behavior, but not my identity. When I returned to
Oberlin, I enrolled in more black studies courses and became even
more involved in the anti-apartheid movement. I left Oberlin a
thoroughly black man.
</P>
<P>
   After college, I went into journalism, hoping to do good in the
world as my parents had tried to do. My first job was at The
Chicago Defender, a small and struggling but historically
significant black newspaper. I then went on to work for a number of
larger papers in the Midwest before coming to The New York Times in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   In just about every one of these jobs, my reputation was built
as much around my race as my journalism; I was the black man with a
big mouth, ready to get loud at the slightest racial slight _ the
brother with a boulder on his shoulder. An editor at The Chicago
Tribune, where I used to work, called me the most contentious young
reporter he'd ever met. Once, at The Times, as I was finishing a
crime piece, an editor came up to me and asked whether the arrested
man, whom the police had roughed up, had a criminal record. I put
it right back to him: how come you're not asking me if the cop has
a record of brutality complaints? In short, I was the one who could
always be counted on to ask the editors why our stories on welfare
seemed to focus on black people when more whites received public
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   And yet. And yet even as a ``black man,'' I remained confusing
to the world around me, including the black world. One weekend,
after I had joined The Times, I brought home a girlfriend _ a
talented black woman, a poet and fellow journalist. I took her to
meet my brother David. His young daughter, Julie, was wild that
afternoon, running around the house, jumping on the furniture and
singing ``Heartbreak Hotel'' over and over. Afterward my
girlfriend, rubbing her temples with both hands, told me, ``That
Julie is a white brat.'' I was startled by how much those words
hurt. Why couldn't Julie just be a brat? She was a little kid. I
used to shoot arrows down the hall of our apartment; my brother
Robert loved to run barefoot through the snow. In my family the
kids, black and white, are wild. Not long after that, my girlfriend
and I broke up. Julie may have been a brat, but not a white brat.
</P>
<P>
   I like to joke that my mother had four children, if you don't
count any of the men in her life. David is a successful
stockbroker. Robert is an artist and boat captain. My sister,
Diane, has spent the past 22 years battling schizophrenia. Diane
has a daughter, Wakara, who was reared mostly by my mother and me
and who graduated from Oberlin in May. When she accepted her
diploma, David was there, just as he has been been for every one of
her graduations _ and every one of mine. Still, though we are
adults now in a more enlightened time, race can appear like a
ghost, disrupting the life of our family. A few years ago, I was at
David's house. It was a cold Chicago night, yet inside, with flames
crackling, we felt wonderfully warm. David was mixing drinks.
Julie, then 12, announced to us that she had received an A on her
seventh-grade social studies assignment. ``Would you like to see my
project, Uncle Donny?'' she asked me.
</P>
<P>
   Using old photographs, Julie had laid out 100 years of the
family's history, culminating in the well-kept suburb where she and
her family now lived. She handed me the three-ring notebook. Under
a photograph of my mother on a pony, the caption read, ``This is a
picture of my Grandma Jeanne when she was 12 years old on the
family farm in Greenwood, Illinois.'' A few pages and decades later
the text reported: ``This is a picture of my Uncle Robert in the
'60s. As you can see, he was a hippie.'' There were pictures and
words about almost everyone in the family, including Julie's dog,
Buddy, and her cat, Clipper. There were pictures of everyone,
except for Aunt Diane, Cousin Wakara and Uncle Donny, the black
members of the family.
</P>
<P>
   I could not believe that we had been left out. Then I figured I
must have gone through the pictures too fast. Or maybe, I thought,
putting down my glass, it was the drink. So I went through the book
a second time, searching for our pictures, or at least a few words
about us. ``I'm not in this,'' I said, closing the book and handing
it back to Julie. ``What's up with that?'' There was only awkward
silence. Though I tried to let the incident go, I found myself one
day raising it with David's son, Noah, who had just returned from
the Navy. Noah listened to the story, and then told me one of his
own. He was showing his photo album to a black shipmate. When the
sailor turned to pictures of Wakara and me, Noah said: ``The guy
was happy. He patted me on the back. He said, 'We don't have to
worry about Noah. He's part black.'''
</P>
<P>
   My nephew paused. ``I told him I'm not part black,'' he said.
``It didn't matter to him. He was still happy.'' And so was I.
</P>
<P>
   My brother Robert lives in a small city in Washington State,
largely isolated from the rest of the family. It is clear, too,
that he has isolated himself from memories of our childhood. His
distance _ both geographic and emotional _ is understandable, for
he bears the wounds of an 8-year-old who was left behind by his
mother. When I asked Robert questions about the past, he repeatedly
said he did not remember and that I should ask David. But one
afternoon, as we drove through his town, he slowly began to open
up.
</P>
<P>
   Robert does not think he harbors any ill will toward black
people because of Bill Terry's role in dividing our family. But I'm
not so sure. ``You could say,'' Robert said, ``that a black person
came in and tore up the family.'' He didn't say, ``You could say
another man came in and ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could blame Bill for destroying the family,'' he went on,
negotiating the road's curves. ``But I don't think that has rubbed
off on me as being a racist. I don't think it's affected me in a
negative way. You can see it affecting someone like Grandpa Raven,
though,'' he continued. ``He had a little bit about him that was
kind of Aryan. People build up these barriers and it's hard for
them to climb over them.''
</P>
<P>
   We headed toward the town's waterfront, and the more Robert
talked, the more I worked to hide my anger and my hurt _ and to
remember his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother,'' he said, ``seemed to develop a propensity for black
men.''
</P>
<P>
   I simmered. What did it matter that Mom had black boyfriends?
She lived on the South Side of Chicago and was involved in the
civil rights movement. There were a lot of black men around. If she
had white boyfriends instead, would Robert say that she had
developed a propensity for white men? It began to rain and we
passed a couple of young Latino men standing on a corner. Robert
glanced at them and said his town wasn't the same anymore. More and
more people who looked like gang members seemed to be showing up,
many of them Latino. ``I get upset with the country changing so
much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus, I thought to myself. What the hell does that mean? If
Robert had been any other white man talking about the ``good ol'
days'' and the changing country, if I had been interviewing Robert
as a reporter on assignment, I would have been convinced I'd found
a racist. But even in the midst of my anger, I kept forcing myself
to try to believe that Robert was not a racist. He was my big
brother, a star athlete, the guy I wanted to impress when I was a
kid.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, I was willing to give him the benefit of the
doubt, something I realized I do not often do for most white
people. ``I don't think I'm a racist,'' Robert said, making me
think he had read my mind. ``But maybe I am. I hope not.''
</P>
<P>
   If Robert and I were struggling with race _ after all, in heavy
traffic, I occasionally mumble about bad-driving white boys _ his
8-year-old son, Henry, was not. One day, Robert, Henry and I drove
up to Vancouver, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   We spent a wonderful afternoon going to museums and eating fish
and chips. In the evening, we headed home, with Robert driving and
Henry and me sitting in the back. At the border, Robert pulled into
the line of cars waiting to go into the United States. From the
back seat, I could see the American border guard, a young black
man, wave several cars through with hardly a word. When it was our
turn, however, he walked slowly around our car, peering into the
windows. Something was suspicious about us. ``Where are you
going?'' he asked Robert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going home,'' Robert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's that in the back seat?'' the guard asked, pointing at
me. ``That's my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your brother?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Robert said. ``We're half brothers.'' I cringed at the
word ``half.'' The guard looked at me again. He was on the verge of
asking another question, when Henry leaned across my lap and,
poking his head out the window, said, ``He's my Uncle Donny and we
love him.'' The young American still looked suspicious, but he
stepped aside and waved us on our way home. Perhaps, I thought,
that's the best we can hope to do _ to insist upon our allegiance
to one another, our brotherhood across the divide _ and try to go
home.
</P>
<P>
   And my parents? My mother went back to college when she was in
her 40s and has been a schoolteacher ever since. At 82, she teaches
history and conflict resolution at an alternative school, Sullivan
House, on the South Side of Chicago. Not long ago, I tried to ask
her why she didn't bring David and Robert with us to California. It
was a gentle summer day and we were in a small Catholic cemetery
near her hometown. My mother sat in the grass next to her mother's
grave. She was hugging her knees to her chest. Her back was turned
to me. She was crying.
</P>
<P>
   We had been to the cemetery many times over the years, but I
could not remember my mother crying before. The tears were my
fault. I was asking her questions. The child in me wanted to know
what she was thinking when she left my brothers behind. Didn't she
see the harm it would do to us all? But all she answered was: ``I
was at my wits' end in those days. Everything was falling apart.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused. ``We had no money. I guess I just thought the boys
were living with Nana and Gerhard and they were better off.'' Leave
her be, I told myself, as I looked out over the graves of my
ancestors. What good can come from dredging up painful memories?
</P>
<P>
   My father died of cancer in 1998 in New York City at age 76. I
hadn't seen him for two years, though I had kept track of his
acting career, which included a role in ``Forrest Gump.'' A group
of my father's friends arranged a memorial to be held in his
apartment building _ though I finally could not bear to go to the
service, all those years late. My grief and anger over his
abandonment was still strong. A friend brought me a videotape of
the service.
</P>
<P>
   I was pleased to see a parade of mourners of all colors walk to
the front of the room and say kind things about my father. They
said he had stopped drinking, that he had found peace with God,
that he had become like a grandfather to some of the children in
the building. It was the kind of integrated gathering he had fought
for and loved. One speaker was a stylishly dressed white man in his
late 60s. He said he and my father had spent a lot of time talking
about my father's childhood. The man started choking up and walked
away.
</P>
<P>
   The man, it turned out, was a psychologist my father had started
seeing when he was 70. A few months after watching the tape, I
called him. We talked about the fact that Bill had fathered seven
children with four different women _ three white, one black. With
the obvious exception of my sister, I barely know any of them. ``He
was repeatedly touching on the issue of white women as if he were
trying to make rational in somebody else's eyes how he had lived
his life,'' the therapist said. ``He couldn't see it as accidental
that he had a succession of nonblack women in his life who gave
birth to his children.''
</P>
<P>
   The therapist said that my father wanted to have racially mixed
children in part to prove himself to his mother. As a boy he had
been passed from relative to relative and was never really sure of
who his father was. Bill also told the therapist that his mother
had been disappointed that his skin was a dark shade. By having
lighter, mixed-race children, he was saying, the therapist
concluded: ``'Look at these beautiful children I've produced.' It
was a search for approval.''
</P>
<P>
   I believe that chasing white women was more than that for my
father. It was about fighting back against pre-civil rights
America. One thing that my father liked about white women, he told
his therapist, was the fact that seeing them on his thick brown arm
drove white men crazy. It reminded me of something my father had
told me once: ``I took my wife anywhere I wanted to go. I'm a
man.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after my father died, I wandered through his apartment.
I ran my hands over his books, his saxophone and the photograph on
the wall of his hero, Paul Robeson, dressed as Othello. My father's
love for Robeson was one of the few uncomplicated joys we shared.
After my father died, all I wanted was that picture. I took the
picture down and hugged it. Then I peeked into my father's closet
and slipped on his too-big-for-me leather jacket, knotting the belt
tightly like a little boy playing Daddy. I took a series of deep
breaths and inhaled the aroma of his pipes, lifting them to my nose
from the carousel on the coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   Then, from under his bed, I pulled a small strongbox with a
broken lock. It was full of documents. One was a copy of my birth
certificate. I was surprised and touched that he had it. Then I
noticed what he had done to it. On lines 8 and 13 of the document,
the clerk's office for Cook County, Ill., had recorded that my
father was ``Negro'' and my mother ``Caucasian.'' My father,
however, had a different idea. Using dark blue ink, he had crossed
out the references to race on my birth certificate, leaving just
``father'' and ``mother.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, at least, he tried to give me a gift that could not be
fully realized in his life: the gift of family that transcends
divisions of race. On paper, it was that simple.

   SING AROUND THE SOLAR-POWERED CAMPSITE
</P>
<P>
   SOLAR-GADGETS-POPMECH _ Clear sunlight contains 1,000 watts of
power per square meter at sea level. That's enough to power
everything on Earth 1,500 times over if we could just figure out a
way to harness all the free, nonstop solar energy that bathes the
globe every day. Of course, in a very real sense everything on
Earth is already solar-powered _ we just release that power in
different ways. Burning long-buried hydrocarbons to get at stored
solar energy, as we've been doing, isn't particularly efficient.
But other ways to use solar energy are available. There's a whole
campsite worth of clever outdoor gear that runs directly on
sunlight. By Rich Taylor.

 By STAN GELLERS 
 (Color art is available.) 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Not since the days of Don Johnson's Armani jackets on ``Miami
Vice'' or Davy Crockett's coonskin cap way back when has anything
struck America's fancy like Regis Philbin's tonal shirt-and-tie
twosome.
 &HT;    Fashion pundits might complain that the dark shirt/satin tie
combo isn't new or chide that the look isn't all that classy, but
it certainly made Father's Day for many stores around the country.
Like it or not, Regis proved once again that the TV is arguably one
of the most potent influencers and image makers for the modern
American.
 &HT;    But it's the people behind the scenes who make it happen _ the
stylists who dress the TV actors on TV and know how their clothes
make the man, and the show.
 &HT;    These Los Angeles-based professionals know their way around
Rodeo Drive and Melrose Avenue as well as New York's Madison
Avenue. They can reel off the names of the hot designers and best
brands, but they're more interested in creating the appropriate
wardrobe that adds a real lifestyle dimension to a TV character.
And they're literally playing to an audience of millions.
 &HT;    Take Dorothy Cline-Metz, a 12-year veteran in this business who
has dressed her share of game-show hosts, like the anchors on
``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``The Price Is Right.'' She's currently
dressing Bob Goen on CBS's ``Entertainment Tonight'' and calls the
assignment ``a perfect marriage between the designer and the
talent.''
 &HT;    What is it like dressing an anchor who appears every weekday
evening at 7 o'clock? Cline-Metz admits, ``It's a challenge because
you have to project a look that has to keep the producer happy and
the anchor comfortable.''
 &HT;    She gives Goen ``an anchor look _ a white dress shirt with
three- and four-button dark suits and, occasionally, a
double-breasted. We get the clothes from manufacturers and stores.
I like Perry Ellis dress shirts and ties, Kenneth Cole and
Nautica.''
 &HT;    Adds the wardrobe whiz, ``I personally like having some fun,
like putting a print tie with a Regis dark shirt and do it with a
leather blazer, or a soft shirt-jacket with a more casual feel. I'm
not tied down to a suit, and using one depends on the person I'm
working with and his likes and dislikes.''
 &HT;    And for her take on the Regis phenomenon: ``I'm not surprised it
happened because the icons we see on TV set the fashion trends, and
people are influenced by the images they see. This certainly
affects my thinking.''
 &HT;    Catherine Wagner, a costume designer who has worked for
independent producers and dressed ``Beverly Hills 90210'' for the
past two seasons, is scheduled to turn her talents to ``Titans,''
already described as the 2000 version of the over-the-top nighttime
soap of the '80s.
 &HT;    She comments, ``The new show's about very wealthy people. And
it's not as formal as `Dynasty.' `Titans' is about young, hip
people.''
 &HT;    Discussing ``90210,'' she explains that a lot of situations
happen to be about people at work and this is her rule of thumb:
``The clothes show what they do. A Wall Street type would wear a
dark, expensive suit. I feel the clothing tells you something about
the man's career. A young guy? I'd put him in a suit for work and
for a date, an open-collar shirt and trousers. I hate jeans and I
think men really underdress.''
 &HT;    She brings up another situation: ``A professional athlete doing
a press conference would probably wear some exclusive designer ...
a very expensive sweater, sport shirt and slacks.''
 &HT;    Wagner says she gets her clothes from stores and mentions names
such as Hugo Boss, Banana Republic and Club Monaco. She says, ``I'd
like to go to the showrooms, but there aren't enough in L.A.''
 &HT;    Her comment on Regis: ``It almost sounds like he invented this
monochromatic look. It's been done for years. Why is it so
important? Well, he's dressed up and not wearing another polo shirt
and khakis. People aren't dressing up any longer just for the
novelty of it, and we also have to remember that women are probably
buying many of those dark shirts.''
 &HT;    Debra McGuire, who does ``Friends,'' the long-running hit series
on NBC, has the best of two worlds. She operates her own eponymous
women's store in Pacific Palisades, Calif., and recently designed a
line of Big &AMP; Tall men's wear that will be sold on the Internet
this fall.
 &HT;    Aside from ``Friends,'' she also did ``Jesse,'' ``Judging Amy,''
``Jack &AMP; Jill'' and ``Freaks and Geeks.'' She says, ``I love them
all.''
 &HT;    When asked whether her TV clothes have any impact on the way men
dress, she confesses, ``Frankly, I work in a little bubble. I don't
think about anything else than who the character is, what he's
doing, what's been written for him and what the clothes need to
support.''
 &HT;    But for an office that enforces shirt-and-tie dressing, she
likes a ``conservative, preppie Brooks Brothers suit, but the
clothes must have a great fit.''
 &HT;    For a creative career, she likes suits or sportswear that are
``postmodern with simple, clean lines. Monochromatic is always
good.
 &HT;    ``I find corporate casual and men wearing a sport shirt in
corporate settings very odd. I'm all for casual and comfort, but I
think men are taking it to the extreme. I love casual Friday, but I
also love men in suits who dress appropriately and in a
professional way. The problem is men who dress casually really
haven't a sense of style. They often look like buffoons. Get 20 of
them together and I can't handle the visual.''
 &HT;    But fixing her gaze on the club scene, she'd use ``comfortable
casual clothes _ not sloppy _ and more body-conscious. For hanging
out? Comfortable, athletic and unself-conscious. I call it sloppy
preppie'' Which sounds a lot like ``Friends.''
 &HT;    McGuire literally uses the world for her inspiration and it
comes from ``the streets of New York, Tokyo and London.'' She also
has a long list of favorite stores: Banana Republic, Polo, Agnes
b., Tommy Hilfiger, Planet Blue, American Rag and Hugo Boss.
Preferred labels include Zegna, Paul Smith, Polo Sport, Diesel, Ted
Baker and Prada _ and not necessarily in that order.
 &HT;    Finally, her spin on the Regis look: ``I loved it until he
started wearing it. But the show is seductive and people feel he
looks stylish.''
 &HT;    That's the power of TV.

 &HT;    
 DOLCE &AMP; GABBANA COSTUMING MARY J. BLIGE'S CONCERT TOUR  
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ Dolce &AMP; Gabbana is hitting the concert circuit
again, this year outfitting R&AMP;B superstar Mary J. Blige for her
48-city tour.
 &HT;    Blige is strutting stages nationwide in 15 glitzy looks
specifically created by Dolce &AMP; Gabbana for her summer tour.
 &HT;    ``The Mary Show,'' as it's billed, kicked off on June 10 in Los
Angeles at the Universal Amphitheater and continued at New York's
Radio City Music Hall the following week and will include a
performance at Mandalay in Las Vegas during the MAGIC show on Aug.
26.
 &HT;    ``There was an instant attraction between us and Mary J. because
we loved her music from the minute we heard it and she liked our
designs from the first time she wore them,'' Domenico Dolce and
Stefano Gabbana said.
 &HT;    That first time Blige wore their designs, according to the pair,
was in 1994, when they outfitted the singer in a head-to-toe
ocelot-printed chiffon tunic and matching pants for her debut
album. That ensemble appeared in The Metropolitan Museum of Art's
``Rock Style'' exhibit in December.
 &HT;    Dolce &AMP; Gabbana also provided specially designed wardrobes for
Whitney Houston during her 1999 tour, as well as for Madonna
several years ago. The experience has schooled them in ``the
tricks'' required to create wardrobes that can rock and roll while
also moving and dazzling.
 &HT;    ``It is a new kind of glamour, a glamour that is wearable yet
luxurious,'' they said. ``This is achieved by the construction of
the garments and by using fabrics that are always stretch.''
 &HT;    Looks for the ``The Mary Show'' include sparkling gold
wide-ribbed stretch pants with a matching one-shoulder top and hot
pink and green pants paired with a strappy top speckled with the
same color of sequins. Everything is cut to show off Blige's
well-toned figure.
 &HT;    ``Mary J. has great style and has the remarkable ability of
taking street fashion, making it into couture, and then conveying
the message to the masses,'' the designers said.
 &HT;    So will Blige's fans get to buy a piece of that message?
 &HT;    ``Given the response that Mary J. gets when she's onstage, we
are highly considering incorporating some of these looks into our
next women's collection because they are very sexy, which is what
we find women like,'' Dolce and Gabbana said.
 &HT;    
 BODY HEAT  
 &HT;    If art imitates life, then fashion imitates sex, or that's what
happened at Gucci's recent party.
 &HT;    The party, perched on the same balcony at Milan's Stazione
Centrale where Benito Mussolini used to greet guests, may have
represented the flash point in a steamy European men's-wear season.
 &HT;    Tom Ford's guests included actress Heather Graham and ``Saturday
Night Live's'' Molly Shannon. The two were dancing back-to-back on
a tiny, raised platform when an enterprising disc jockey turned
them face-to-face, and the girls were _ as they say _ into it.
Bumping. Grinding. Turning. Churning. Hey, that's how rumors get
started.
 &HT;    At GQ's recent party at the trendy Roialto, designers Roberto
Menichetti of Burberry and Richard Bengtsson and Edward Pavlick of
Richard Edwards turned out. So did actor Matthew Modine, frontman
for Vestimenta's spirited fall campaign shot on the canals _ and,
in some cases, in the canals _ of Venice.
 &HT;    Sandy Dalal, now backed by Italy's GTR, staged his first runway
show in Milan, but the 23-year-old designer didn't turn up at the
party. Instead he sent his mother. His mother?!? Hey, Sandy, it's a
party, not a parent-teacher conference.
 &HT;    Before Milan, where Donatella Versace was sending men who looked
like boys (and boys who looked like girls) down the runway, it was
Florence, where Esquire and Pitti Uomo flew in a busload of
specialty-store retailers.
 &HT;    Marzotto had the gang for lunch at the 15th-century country
villa in the hills 20 minutes outside of Florence. Matteo Marzotto,
the 33-year-old heir to the business, piloted in his own helicopter
_ in suit and tie, no less _ to meet the group for a tour of the
billiards room and the music room, and a tasting in the wine
cellar, followed by lunch in the rotunda of the residence owned by
the Corsini Prince.
 &HT;    The New York Times feted its men's fashion editor, Robert Bryan,
at the Palazzo Peruzzi, a fitting venue for the always elegant
men's fashion director.
 &HT;    You want to throw a party in Florence? It helps to have a sense
of history, or know a family with its own history.
 &HT;    The Zegnas, Anna and Gildo, turned to one of Florence's oldest
families, the Pandolfinis, for a fitting location: the Palazzo
Pandolfini. (By old, Florence means, oh, the 13th century.) So on a
balmy summer night, the Zegnas and Esquire hosted the kind of
flawless barbecue-cum-antipasto sit-down buffet dinner that would
make a father proud on his daughter's wedding day.
 &HT;    
 ON THE ROCKS  
 &HT;    ``Poor Harry. He won't know what hit him,'' Tessa Fane said at
her husband's exhibition of Verdura jewelry at London's Mandarin
Oriental Hotel.
 &HT;    Fane wasn't talking about the jewels; she was outlining her
plans for a swimming pool and tennis court at their house in the
country.
 &HT;    Harry Fane was busy worrying about whether such guests as Lady
Victoria de Rothschild, Baron and Baroness Bentinck and the new
couple Prince Maximilian and Princess Angela of Liechtenstein were
planning to pick up a jewel or two.
 &HT;    At least Katy Tome was in the buying mood _at the strict
instructions of her absent husband.
 &HT;    ``He's so good,'' she said. ``Even if I don't want anything,
he'll insist I buy something.''
 &HT;    Many of the same guests zipped across Hyde Park to the
Dorchester Club for a late-night party to celebrate the opening of
the French jeweler Chaumet's new London boutique _ and to catch a
glimpse of Catherine Deneuve.
 &HT;    In New York, Lisa Heiden, Sandy Golinkin and Peter Bacanovic
invited a few of their friends backstage before American Ballet
Theater's ``The Taming of the Shrew.''
 &HT;    And in the Hamptons, Marjorie Gubelmann threw a dinner at Club
Colette, and the first thing her guests noticed as they arrived was
the thick string of stones hanging from her neck.
 &HT;    ``Wait a minute,'' said Jill Kopelman, ``Isn't that the...''
 &HT;    ``Yes, it is,'' Gubelmann interjected. ``'Mission: Impossible
2.'''
 &HT;    Her Bulgari necklace of pink, blue yellow and white sapphires
was the very same one that Thandie Newton, who played the cat
burglar, stole in the opening scene of the film.
 &HT;    Out on the patio, there was talk of the upcoming premiere of
``Rocky &AMP; Bullwinkle.''
 &HT;    ``Rocky? Bullwinkle?'' Bettina Zilkha cried. ``We've got to!''

 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Resort means different things to different designers,
but this season there's a common thread _ a feminine touch.
 &HT;    At Oscar de la Renta, for example, colorful silk chiffon pieces
with pretty beading are perfect for the party set, while at Narciso
Rodriguez, city looks are more important than tropical locales.
 &HT;    Accordingly, he's offering lots of sleek suede and leather in
soft neutrals and blush tones.

 &HT;    The lure of the ladylike is at a fever pitch. And for resort,
there are lots of different interpretations of the trend.
 &HT;    Ann Sui, who's usually in retro bohemian mode, has combined both
elements, while Richard Tyler keeps things extra sexy.
 &HT;    Gianfranco Ferre, on the other hand, gives it to us straight in
the form of clean classics.

 By SAMANTHA CONTI 
 (One B&AMP;W slide is available.) 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Milan _ In the land of luxury, who has the biggest paycheck of
them all? Giorgio Armani.
 &HT;    Forget Donna's $25 million or Tommy's $22 million. The maestro
of Milano blew them all away, pocketing a cool $100 million in 1999
dividends as the sole shareholder of his company.
 &HT;    Buried at the bottom of Armani's 1999 annual report, which was
released this month, was a sentence referring to the company's
dividend. And while it might have been brief, it spoke volumes
about Armani's 25-year-old business, and the beauty of being
private and independent, with control over production and
distribution.
 &HT;    Although it's private, Giorgio Armani SpA releases a full,
audited balance sheet every year as a part of routine company
practice.
 &HT;    The sentence also made clear that anyone interested in buying
Giorgio Armani SpA will have to pay up: Financial analysts said
that on the basis of the designer's 1999 results _ revenues climbed
11.8 percent to $840 million _ the company could easily command a
multiple of at least four times sales.
 &HT;    In fact, multiples in the luxury sector have hit the
stratosphere since the battle for Gucci last year. That's when
Bernard Arnault ultimately _ and unsuccessfully _ offered up to
eight times sales, or roughly $8.5 billion, for Gucci. Pinault
Printemps Redoute eventually won out with an initial investment of
40 percent in Gucci for $2.9 billion.
 &HT;    With PPR's alliance, Gucci got into the buying game too, paying
slightly over $1 billion, just over one times sales, for Yves Saint
Laurent and its parent Sanofi Beaute last year.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Prada Group and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton,
after a bidding war with Gucci, paid an estimated $545 million for
51 percent of Fendi, which works out to about four or five times
sales.
 &HT;    So Armani could be in the enviable position of virtually naming
his price, should he choose to sell.
 &HT;    The key to all those riches?
 &HT;    In addition to making clothes that people _ especially Americans
_ like to wear, Armani runs one of Italy's most profitable
companies. Over the years he has worked hard to pump up his margins
by directly producing and selling the clothes he designs.
 &HT;    Analysts say that strategy has paid off grandly.
 &HT;    ``Armani's margins are more similar to those in the leather
goods and jewelry business,'' said John Wakely, an analyst at
Lehman Brothers in London, referring to the fact that accessories
usually generate much higher margins than apparel. As a result,
Wakely said, ``If there were to be a sale, Armani would get a
multiple more similar to Gucci than to a clothing company.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Armani's earnings before interest and taxes, including
depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, were 24.6 percent of
sales last year.
 &HT;    ``That's pretty impressive,'' said Claire Kent, an equities
analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. ``It's one of the highest
margins in the luxury apparel business.''
 &HT;    Success, Armani said, has been all about ``a consistent design
philosophy with organic growth of the brande ... and the ongoing
transformation of the group from being royalty-based to
manufacturing-based.''
 &HT;    He added, ``The group plans to continue to take greater control
over all aspects of its business.''
 &HT;    Over the years, Armani has collected manufacturing companies
like others would collect fine art. He now owns four production
facilities that make every apparel collection from the Le
Collezioni right down to Armani Jeans, ties, underwear and
swimwear.
 &HT;    When he decided last year to launch accessories, he flirted with
the idea of licensing the collection to Gucci. In the end, however,
he decided to produce the line in-house.
 &HT;    As for distribution, he owns a variety of companies that oversee
sales and store operations in the United States, Italy, Japan and
the Far East.
 &HT;    Armani is also swiftly buying back franchises and systematically
canceling licenses. In the 1999 report, the designer pointed to his
net cash position of more than $335 million, noting it has already
been earmarked for investments aimed at building the brand.
 &HT;    Even as Armani builds, the question lingers: Will he or won't he
sell his company? Armani turns 66 next month and has no obvious
successors. At the same time, he's tanned, toned and buzzing with
energy. Last year, he said he had a good decade of work left in
him.
 &HT;    ``Does Armani need to be sold? Does he need to go public? No, I
don't think so,'' Wakely said. ``I do think, however, that the
prospect of such a high multiple has to be opening his eyes a
bit.''
 &HT;    Armani has held on-and-off talks with both Gucci Group and LVMH
about a possible sale of all or part of the company. And while he
said last year that he thought LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault was
``simpatico,'' and would be interested in a joint venture, he
appears to be bucking the idea of relinquishing any control of the
company.
 &HT;    Although the LVMH rumor has managed to stay alive in the
European press, Armani only last week denied to reporters after his
men's-wear show that there's a deal in the works.
 &HT;    ``No, there is no accord with LVMH,'' Armani said.
 &HT;    And he has, for the moment, ruled out going public, although the
financial world is still fantasizing about the prospect of a
Giorgio Armani IPO.
 &HT;    When he's not pondering the fate of his company, friends say
Armani genuinely enjoys himself and leads the high life in a
typically understated manner.
 &HT;    Sources close to the designer said he's planning to buy a
10-seat private jet _ his first ever _ although an Armani spokesman
could not confirm that information. The same sources say Armani is
also having a boat built in Pantelleria, the Italian island off the
coast of Tunisia where he has a summer home.
 &HT;    And, after the last double-breasted suit of the season has been
sold and orders are ready to roll out of the factory, he unwinds in
his homes: the villas in Saint-Tropez and Forte dei Marmi; the
villa complex in Pantelleria; the big house in Broni, in northern
Italy, and the apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
 &HT;    ``He's not extravagant and never has been,'' says a former
employee. ``At heart Armani is a very simple person.'' c.2000

 (Color art is available.) 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Not since the days of Don Johnson's Armani jackets on ``Miami
Vice'' or Davy Crockett's coonskin cap way back when has anything
struck America's fancy like Regis Philbin's tonal shirt-and-tie
twosome.
 &HT;    Fashion pundits might complain that the dark shirt/satin tie
combo isn't new or chide that the look isn't all that classy, but
it certainly made Father's Day for many stores around the country.
Like it or not, Regis proved once again that the TV is arguably one
of the most potent influencers and image makers for the modern
American.
 &HT;    But it's the people behind the scenes who make it happen _ the
stylists who dress the TV actors on TV and know how their clothes
make the man, and the show.
 &HT;    These Los Angeles-based professionals know their way around
Rodeo Drive and Melrose Avenue as well as New York's Madison
Avenue. They can reel off the names of the hot designers and best
brands, but they're more interested in creating the appropriate
wardrobe that adds a real lifestyle dimension to a TV character.
And they're literally playing to an audience of millions.
 &HT;    Take Dorothy Cline-Metz, a 12-year veteran in this business who
has dressed her share of game-show hosts, like the anchors on
``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``The Price Is Right.'' She's currently
dressing Bob Goen on CBS's ``Entertainment Tonight'' and calls the
assignment ``a perfect marriage between the designer and the
talent.''
 &HT;    What is it like dressing an anchor who appears every weekday
evening at 7 o'clock? Cline-Metz admits, ``It's a challenge because
you have to project a look that has to keep the producer happy and
the anchor comfortable.''
 &HT;    She gives Goen ``an anchor look _ a white dress shirt with
three- and four-button dark suits and, occasionally, a
double-breasted. We get the clothes from manufacturers and stores.
I like Perry Ellis dress shirts and ties, Kenneth Cole and
Nautica.''
 &HT;    Adds the wardrobe whiz, ``I personally like having some fun,
like putting a print tie with a Regis dark shirt and do it with a
leather blazer, or a soft shirt-jacket with a more casual feel. I'm
not tied down to a suit, and using one depends on the person I'm
working with and his likes and dislikes.''
 &HT;    And for her take on the Regis phenomenon: ``I'm not surprised it
happened because the icons we see on TV set the fashion trends, and
people are influenced by the images they see. This certainly
affects my thinking.''
 &HT;    Catherine Wagner, a costume designer who has worked for
independent producers and dressed ``Beverly Hills 90210'' for the
past two seasons, is scheduled to turn her talents to ``Titans,''
already described as the 2000 version of the over-the-top nighttime
soap of the '80s.
 &HT;    She comments, ``The new show's about very wealthy people. And
it's not as formal as `Dynasty.' `Titans' is about young, hip
people.''
 &HT;    Discussing ``90210,'' she explains that a lot of situations
happen to be about people at work and this is her rule of thumb:
``The clothes show what they do. A Wall Street type would wear a
dark, expensive suit. I feel the clothing tells you something about
the man's career. A young guy? I'd put him in a suit for work and
for a date, an open-collar shirt and trousers. I hate jeans and I
think men really underdress.''
 &HT;    She brings up another situation: ``A professional athlete doing
a press conference would probably wear some exclusive designer ...
a very expensive sweater, sport shirt and slacks.''
 &HT;    Wagner says she gets her clothes from stores and mentions names
such as Hugo Boss, Banana Republic and Club Monaco. She says, ``I'd
like to go to the showrooms, but there aren't enough in L.A.''
 &HT;    Her comment on Regis: ``It almost sounds like he invented this
monochromatic look. It's been done for years. Why is it so
important? Well, he's dressed up and not wearing another polo shirt
and khakis. People aren't dressing up any longer just for the
novelty of it, and we also have to remember that women are probably
buying many of those dark shirts.''
 &HT;    Debra McGuire, who does ``Friends,'' the long-running hit series
on NBC, has the best of two worlds. She operates her own eponymous
women's store in Pacific Palisades, Calif., and recently designed a
line of Big &AMP; Tall men's wear that will be sold on the Internet
this fall.
 &HT;    Aside from ``Friends,'' she also did ``Jesse,'' ``Judging Amy,''
``Jack &AMP; Jill'' and ``Freaks and Geeks.'' She says, ``I love them
all.''
 &HT;    When asked whether her TV clothes have any impact on the way men
dress, she confesses, ``Frankly, I work in a little bubble. I don't
think about anything else than who the character is, what he's
doing, what's been written for him and what the clothes need to
support.''
 &HT;    But for an office that enforces shirt-and-tie dressing, she
likes a ``conservative, preppie Brooks Brothers suit, but the
clothes must have a great fit.''
 &HT;    For a creative career, she likes suits or sportswear that are
``postmodern with simple, clean lines. Monochromatic is always
good.
 &HT;    ``I find corporate casual and men wearing a sport shirt in
corporate settings very odd. I'm all for casual and comfort, but I
think men are taking it to the extreme. I love casual Friday, but I
also love men in suits who dress appropriately and in a
professional way. The problem is men who dress casually really
haven't a sense of style. They often look like buffoons. Get 20 of
them together and I can't handle the visual.''
 &HT;    But fixing her gaze on the club scene, she'd use ``comfortable
casual clothes _ not sloppy _ and more body-conscious. For hanging
out? Comfortable, athletic and unself-conscious. I call it sloppy
preppie'' Which sounds a lot like ``Friends.''
 &HT;    McGuire literally uses the world for her inspiration and it
comes from ``the streets of New York, Tokyo and London.'' She also
has a long list of favorite stores: Banana Republic, Polo, Agnes
b., Tommy Hilfiger, Planet Blue, American Rag and Hugo Boss.
Preferred labels include Zegna, Paul Smith, Polo Sport, Diesel, Ted
Baker and Prada _ and not necessarily in that order.
 &HT;    Finally, her spin on the Regis look: ``I loved it until he
started wearing it. But the show is seductive and people feel he
looks stylish.''
 &HT;    That's the power of TV.

 &HT;    
 DOLCE &AMP; GABBANA COSTUMING MARY J. BLIGE'S CONCERT TOUR  
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ Dolce &AMP; Gabbana is hitting the concert circuit
again, this year outfitting R&AMP;B superstar Mary J. Blige for her
48-city tour.
 &HT;    Blige is strutting stages nationwide in 15 glitzy looks
specifically created by Dolce &AMP; Gabbana for her summer tour.
 &HT;    ``The Mary Show,'' as it's billed, kicked off on June 10 in Los
Angeles at the Universal Amphitheater and continued at New York's
Radio City Music Hall the following week and will include a
performance at Mandalay in Las Vegas during the MAGIC show on Aug.
26.
 &HT;    ``There was an instant attraction between us and Mary J. because
we loved her music from the minute we heard it and she liked our
designs from the first time she wore them,'' Domenico Dolce and
Stefano Gabbana said.
 &HT;    That first time Blige wore their designs, according to the pair,
was in 1994, when they outfitted the singer in a head-to-toe
ocelot-printed chiffon tunic and matching pants for her debut
album. That ensemble appeared in The Metropolitan Museum of Art's
``Rock Style'' exhibit in December.
 &HT;    Dolce &AMP; Gabbana also provided specially designed wardrobes for
Whitney Houston during her 1999 tour, as well as for Madonna
several years ago. The experience has schooled them in ``the
tricks'' required to create wardrobes that can rock and roll while
also moving and dazzling.
 &HT;    ``It is a new kind of glamour, a glamour that is wearable yet
luxurious,'' they said. ``This is achieved by the construction of
the garments and by using fabrics that are always stretch.''
 &HT;    Looks for the ``The Mary Show'' include sparkling gold
wide-ribbed stretch pants with a matching one-shoulder top and hot
pink and green pants paired with a strappy top speckled with the
same color of sequins. Everything is cut to show off Blige's
well-toned figure.
 &HT;    ``Mary J. has great style and has the remarkable ability of
taking street fashion, making it into couture, and then conveying
the message to the masses,'' the designers said.
 &HT;    So will Blige's fans get to buy a piece of that message?
 &HT;    ``Given the response that Mary J. gets when she's onstage, we
are highly considering incorporating some of these looks into our
next women's collection because they are very sexy, which is what
we find women like,'' Dolce and Gabbana said.
 &HT;    
 BODY HEAT  
 &HT;    If art imitates life, then fashion imitates sex, or that's what
happened at Gucci's recent party.
 &HT;    The party, perched on the same balcony at Milan's Stazione
Centrale where Benito Mussolini used to greet guests, may have
represented the flash point in a steamy European men's-wear season.
 &HT;    Tom Ford's guests included actress Heather Graham and ``Saturday
Night Live's'' Molly Shannon. The two were dancing back-to-back on
a tiny, raised platform when an enterprising disc jockey turned
them face-to-face, and the girls were _ as they say _ into it.
Bumping. Grinding. Turning. Churning. Hey, that's how rumors get
started.
 &HT;    At GQ's recent party at the trendy Roialto, designers Roberto
Menichetti of Burberry and Richard Bengtsson and Edward Pavlick of
Richard Edwards turned out. So did actor Matthew Modine, frontman
for Vestimenta's spirited fall campaign shot on the canals _ and,
in some cases, in the canals _ of Venice.
 &HT;    Sandy Dalal, now backed by Italy's GTR, staged his first runway
show in Milan, but the 23-year-old designer didn't turn up at the
party. Instead he sent his mother. His mother?!? Hey, Sandy, it's a
party, not a parent-teacher conference.
 &HT;    Before Milan, where Donatella Versace was sending men who looked
like boys (and boys who looked like girls) down the runway, it was
Florence, where Esquire and Pitti Uomo flew in a busload of
specialty-store retailers.
 &HT;    Marzotto had the gang for lunch at the 15th-century country
villa in the hills 20 minutes outside of Florence. Matteo Marzotto,
the 33-year-old heir to the business, piloted in his own helicopter
_ in suit and tie, no less _ to meet the group for a tour of the
billiards room and the music room, and a tasting in the wine
cellar, followed by lunch in the rotunda of the residence owned by
the Corsini Prince.
 &HT;    The New York Times feted its men's fashion editor, Robert Bryan,
at the Palazzo Peruzzi, a fitting venue for the always elegant
men's fashion director.
 &HT;    You want to throw a party in Florence? It helps to have a sense
of history, or know a family with its own history.
 &HT;    The Zegnas, Anna and Gildo, turned to one of Florence's oldest
families, the Pandolfinis, for a fitting location: the Palazzo
Pandolfini. (By old, Florence means, oh, the 13th century.) So on a
balmy summer night, the Zegnas and Esquire hosted the kind of
flawless barbecue-cum-antipasto sit-down buffet dinner that would
make a father proud on his daughter's wedding day.
 &HT;    
 ON THE ROCKS  
 &HT;    ``Poor Harry. He won't know what hit him,'' Tessa Fane said at
her husband's exhibition of Verdura jewelry at London's Mandarin
Oriental Hotel.
 &HT;    Fane wasn't talking about the jewels; she was outlining her
plans for a swimming pool and tennis court at their house in the
country.
 &HT;    Harry Fane was busy worrying about whether such guests as Lady
Victoria de Rothschild, Baron and Baroness Bentinck and the new
couple Prince Maximilian and Princess Angela of Liechtenstein were
planning to pick up a jewel or two.
 &HT;    At least Katy Tome was in the buying mood _at the strict
instructions of her absent husband.
 &HT;    ``He's so good,'' she said. ``Even if I don't want anything,
he'll insist I buy something.''
 &HT;    Many of the same guests zipped across Hyde Park to the
Dorchester Club for a late-night party to celebrate the opening of
the French jeweler Chaumet's new London boutique _ and to catch a
glimpse of Catherine Deneuve.
 &HT;    In New York, Lisa Heiden, Sandy Golinkin and Peter Bacanovic
invited a few of their friends backstage before American Ballet
Theater's ``The Taming of the Shrew.''
 &HT;    And in the Hamptons, Marjorie Gubelmann threw a dinner at Club
Colette, and the first thing her guests noticed as they arrived was
the thick string of stones hanging from her neck.
 &HT;    ``Wait a minute,'' said Jill Kopelman, ``Isn't that the...''
 &HT;    ``Yes, it is,'' Gubelmann interjected. ``'Mission: Impossible
2.'''
 &HT;    Her Bulgari necklace of pink, blue yellow and white sapphires
was the very same one that Thandie Newton, who played the cat
burglar, stole in the opening scene of the film.
 &HT;    Out on the patio, there was talk of the upcoming premiere of
``Rocky &AMP; Bullwinkle.''
 &HT;    ``Rocky? Bullwinkle?'' Bettina Zilkha cried. ``We've got to!''

 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Resort means different things to different designers,
but this season there's a common thread _ a feminine touch.
 &HT;    At Oscar de la Renta, for example, colorful silk chiffon pieces
with pretty beading are perfect for the party set, while at Narciso
Rodriguez, city looks are more important than tropical locales.
 &HT;    Accordingly, he's offering lots of sleek suede and leather in
soft neutrals and blush tones.

 By SAMANTHA CONTI 
 (One B&AMP;W slide is available.) 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Milan _ In the land of luxury, who has the biggest paycheck of
them all? Giorgio Armani.
 &HT;    Forget Donna's $25 million or Tommy's $22 million. The maestro
of Milano blew them all away, pocketing a cool $100 million in 1999
dividends as the sole shareholder of his company.
 &HT;    Buried at the bottom of Armani's 1999 annual report, which was
released this month, was a sentence referring to the company's
dividend. And while it might have been brief, it spoke volumes
about Armani's 25-year-old business, and the beauty of being
private and independent, with control over production and
distribution.
 &HT;    Although it's private, Giorgio Armani SpA releases a full,
audited balance sheet every year as a part of routine company
practice.
 &HT;    The sentence also made clear that anyone interested in buying
Giorgio Armani SpA will have to pay up: Financial analysts said
that on the basis of the designer's 1999 results _ revenues climbed
11.8 percent to $840 million _ the company could easily command a
multiple of at least four times sales.
 &HT;    In fact, multiples in the luxury sector have hit the
stratosphere since the battle for Gucci last year. That's when
Bernard Arnault ultimately _ and unsuccessfully _ offered up to
eight times sales, or roughly $8.5 billion, for Gucci. Pinault
Printemps Redoute eventually won out with an initial investment of
40 percent in Gucci for $2.9 billion.
 &HT;    With PPR's alliance, Gucci got into the buying game too, paying
slightly over $1 billion, just over one times sales, for Yves Saint
Laurent and its parent Sanofi Beaute last year.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Prada Group and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton,
after a bidding war with Gucci, paid an estimated $545 million for
51 percent of Fendi, which works out to about four or five times
sales.
 &HT;    So Armani could be in the enviable position of virtually naming
his price, should he choose to sell.
 &HT;    The key to all those riches?
 &HT;    In addition to making clothes that people _ especially Americans
_ like to wear, Armani runs one of Italy's most profitable
companies. Over the years he has worked hard to pump up his margins
by directly producing and selling the clothes he designs.
 &HT;    Analysts say that strategy has paid off grandly.
 &HT;    ``Armani's margins are more similar to those in the leather
goods and jewelry business,'' said John Wakely, an analyst at
Lehman Brothers in London, referring to the fact that accessories
usually generate much higher margins than apparel. As a result,
Wakely said, ``If there were to be a sale, Armani would get a
multiple more similar to Gucci than to a clothing company.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Armani's earnings before interest and taxes, including
depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, were 24.6 percent of
sales last year.
 &HT;    ``That's pretty impressive,'' said Claire Kent, an equities
analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. ``It's one of the highest
margins in the luxury apparel business.''
 &HT;    Success, Armani said, has been all about ``a consistent design
philosophy with organic growth of the brande ... and the ongoing
transformation of the group from being royalty-based to
manufacturing-based.''
 &HT;    He added, ``The group plans to continue to take greater control
over all aspects of its business.''
 &HT;    Over the years, Armani has collected manufacturing companies
like others would collect fine art. He now owns four production
facilities that make every apparel collection from the Le
Collezioni right down to Armani Jeans, ties, underwear and
swimwear.
 &HT;    When he decided last year to launch accessories, he flirted with
the idea of licensing the collection to Gucci. In the end, however,
he decided to produce the line in-house.
 &HT;    As for distribution, he owns a variety of companies that oversee
sales and store operations in the United States, Italy, Japan and
the Far East.
 &HT;    Armani is also swiftly buying back franchises and systematically
canceling licenses. In the 1999 report, the designer pointed to his
net cash position of more than $335 million, noting it has already
been earmarked for investments aimed at building the brand.
 &HT;    Even as Armani builds, the question lingers: Will he or won't he
sell his company? Armani turns 66 next month and has no obvious
successors. At the same time, he's tanned, toned and buzzing with
energy. Last year, he said he had a good decade of work left in
him.
 &HT;    ``Does Armani need to be sold? Does he need to go public? No, I
don't think so,'' Wakely said. ``I do think, however, that the
prospect of such a high multiple has to be opening his eyes a
bit.''
 &HT;    Armani has held on-and-off talks with both Gucci Group and LVMH
about a possible sale of all or part of the company. And while he
said last year that he thought LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault was
``simpatico,'' and would be interested in a joint venture, he
appears to be bucking the idea of relinquishing any control of the
company.
 &HT;    Although the LVMH rumor has managed to stay alive in the
European press, Armani only last week denied to reporters after his
men's-wear show that there's a deal in the works.
 &HT;    ``No, there is no accord with LVMH,'' Armani said.
 &HT;    And he has, for the moment, ruled out going public, although the
financial world is still fantasizing about the prospect of a
Giorgio Armani IPO.
 &HT;    When he's not pondering the fate of his company, friends say
Armani genuinely enjoys himself and leads the high life in a
typically understated manner.
 &HT;    Sources close to the designer said he's planning to buy a
10-seat private jet _ his first ever _ although an Armani spokesman
could not confirm that information. The same sources say Armani is
also having a boat built in Pantelleria, the Italian island off the
coast of Tunisia where he has a summer home.
 &HT;    And, after the last double-breasted suit of the season has been
sold and orders are ready to roll out of the factory, he unwinds in
his homes: the villas in Saint-Tropez and Forte dei Marmi; the
villa complex in Pantelleria; the big house in Broni, in northern
Italy, and the apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
 &HT;    ``He's not extravagant and never has been,'' says a former
employee. ``At heart Armani is a very simple person.'' c.2000

 By JOSIE GLAUSIUSZ 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Trumpeting cherubs peer down from the walls of Budapest's
opulent music academy. As pianist Dezso Ranki pounds at the keys,
his breathing is at times so stertorous one could swear that
someone in the audience is snoring.
 &HT;    But there are no somnolent spectators here. When the final
chords of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in C Major crash out, the
crowd bursts into applause _ at first tumultuously, but then,
suddenly, in perfect unison.
 &HT;    There is no signal, no leader; the synchrony is spontaneous. The
pianist bows, his pageboy hairdo flopping about his solemn face. He
disappears backstage, then returns to applause that grows stronger.
Yet as the clapping gathers strength, its synchrony dissolves.
 &HT;    Ranki retreats and reappears repeatedly, and so does the rhythm
of the applause _ one moment chaotic, the next a perfect beat. Then
without warning the entire audience stops, as one, on a single
clap.
 &HT;    Tamas Vicsek, a physicist at Budapest's Eotvos University,
twists around from his second-row seat and explains. \
 &HT;    ``This synchronized clapping is called `iron' applause in
Hungarian,'' he says. ``There was a time when an iron curtain would
descend after a performance between the stage and the audience,
which would clap rhythmically to induce the conductor or actors to
appear in front of the curtain, through a little door at its
center.''
 &HT;    The iron curtain is gone _ in more ways than one _ from this
country, but the rhythmic applause remains. In fact, it's hardly
unique to the theaters of Budapest: When hockey player Wayne
Gretzky retired from the Rangers, for instance, the crowd at
Madison Square Garden burst into rhythmic applause, and the same
response met Cecilia Bartoli when she sang an aria at the Teatro
Olimpico in Vicenza, Italy.
 &HT;    The reason, Vicsek and his colleagues in the United States and
Romania believe, has as much to do with mathematics as it does with
aesthetics and psychology.
 &HT;    According to Steven Strogatz, a mathematician at Cornell
University who has studied synchronization for 20 years, the same
set of mathematical principles governs the phenomenon wherever it
occurs _ be it among applauding people, flashing fireflies or
roomfuls of grandfather clocks.
 &HT;    Strogatz has been fascinated by synchronization since he
experimented with pendulums in his first science class. Now he
seems to see it wherever he looks.
 &HT;    Asian fireflies flash together each night in the mangrove trees
along a riverbank. Crickets chirp in unison, and cicadas emerge
from the ground at the same moment every 17 years.
 &HT;    The moon rotates around its own axis at exactly the same rate as
it orbits around Earth, which is why one side of the moon is never
seen. Pacemaker cells in the heart oscillate in harmony. There is
even the curious case of menstrual synchrony among women who live
together.
 &HT;    To understand the mechanics of synchrony, Strogatz suggests,
imagine several athletes running around a circular track.
 &HT;    ``Suppose these runners are friends, and they would prefer to
run together so that they can talk,'' he says. ``If their speeds
are not too different _ that is, if the slowest one can keep up
with the fastest one _ then you can get a group of runners all
going in sync. But first, they have to be sensitive to each other.
 &HT;    ``They have to be willing to adjust their speeds from what they
would prefer. The fastest ones have to slow down, and the slowest
ones have to speed up, to find some compromise. And that same
principle _ that slow oscillators have to speed up and fast ones
have to slow down, and that this happens because of mutual
interactions _ is a pretty universal principle for synchrony.''
 &HT;    The interactions, Strogatz adds, can be obvious: The runners see
each other, the clappers hear the other claps.
 &HT;    They can also be subtle. Two grandfather clocks can synchronize
their pendulum swings _ an effect first observed in 1665 by their
inventor, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens _ through
imperceptible vibrations traveling through the wall against which
they both lean.
 &HT;    But the story can also be more complicated than that. Picture,
for example, some crickets living alone in soundproof chambers, as
they did in Strogatz's lab. They can listen to their neighbors'
sounds only when controlled levels of chirping are piped in.
 &HT;    ``If we make the sounds loud enough _ if we let enough of the
chirping sound through _ at some point, there will suddenly be
enough mutual influence that they can synchronize. Below that
point, they can't. This is what physicists call a phase
transition,'' Strogatz says. ``There's a critical amount of
interaction when synchrony will burst out. It doesn't just build up
gradually.''
 &HT;    A similar phase transition lies behind an audience's sudden
switch to synchronized clapping.
 &HT;    ``Say the people are clapping in a disorganized way, but they
all know that they're trying to synchronize,'' Strogatz explains.
``However, they don't hear a beat. But then _ and this is rather
mysterious _ suppose a beat just happens to emerge a little bit,
maybe because a few clappers get lucky. That beat will then be
audible above the din of the disorganized rest of the audience. And
since everyone knows that they're trying to clap in unison, the
cooperative clappers will try to join in with that beat. The pulse
becomes stronger, and then it takes off.''
 &HT;    Eighteen months ago, Tamas Vicsek, together with physicists
Albert-Laszlo Barabasi of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana
and Zoltan Neda of Romania's Babes-Bolyai University in
Cluj-Napoca, set out to probe the dynamics of clapping more
closely.
 &HT;    Neda began the project by suspending microphones from the
ceilings of concert halls in Romania and recording the applause. He
and the other researchers then analyzed the recordings and found a
fairly consistent pattern: several rounds _ up to six or seven _ of
synchronized clapping, interspersed with incoherent cacophony.
Moreover, the periods between claps doubled during synchronization.
 &HT;    To study the process further, Neda and his graduate student
Erzsebet Ravasz asked 73 high-school students to stand alone in a
room and clap quickly, as they would after an outstanding
performance. Then he asked them to clap as if they were
synchronizing with others.
 &HT;    He found that their clapping rates varied quite widely when they
were asked to clap quickly _ between three and five claps per
second _ but when asked to simulate synchrony, most people clapped
at around the same, relatively slow rate: about two claps per
second.
 &HT;    As for the waves of chaotic clapping that interrupt the
synchrony periodically, Barabasi and Vicsek think they're a matter
of crowd psychology. When synchrony sets in, the overall noise of
the applause decreases; when it disappears, the noise level rises.
Synchronization, they conclude, triggers a cozy feeling of
togetherness among audience members, whereas faster clapping feels
more enthusiastic. Conflicting desires swing the clappers between
the two modes.
 &HT;    There was a time, Barabasi adds, when comradeship reigned
supreme in countries such as Hungary and Romania and exuberance had
no place, when swings between synchrony and chaos couldn't be
heard.
 &HT;    At the giant rallies common to Barabasi's childhood in communist
Romania _ a childhood marked by the tyrannical regime of Nicolae
Ceausescu _ audiences applauding the ``great leader'' would clap
monotonously and dutifully in synchrony in response to party
speeches. But there was no enthusiasm to spur their clapping into
disorder. Then one day in late December 1989, the synchronized
applause ended _ abruptly.
 &HT;    ``When Ceausescu was overthrown, he organized a huge rally of
250,000 people in Bucharest to show support for him,'' Barabsi
remembers. ``People were supposed to clap synchronously, and at the
beginning they did. But then the clapping stopped. Some people
threw their banners down, and then the shooting started and the
revolution began.''
 &HT;    Four days later, on Christmas day, Ceausescu was shot dead.

 By JACK McCLINTOCK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    In the cool morning, Oumar the Tuareg guide announces that the
elephants might have arrived at watering holes near the
InAdyatafane oasis, so everyone piles into the Land Rovers to cross
60 miles of hot open desert.
 &HT;    Six hours later, the vehicles lurch to a stop a mile from where
the herd should be. The rest of the distance must be covered on
foot to keep from spooking the elephants.
 &HT;    Wildlife veterinarian Billy Karesh carefully screws the barrel
of his rifle into its stock and drops two fully charged anesthetic
darts into the pocket of his cargo pants.
 &HT;    He strides briskly across a desert landscape _ his senses on
full alert. A six-ton pachyderm could be just feet away.
 &HT;    ``It's easy to walk up on them by accident in the thorn scrub,''
he says. ``I don't want to encourage anybody to get close to these
elephants. It's very possible a human could die in this.''
 &HT;    The elephants Karesh hopes to track fatten themselves during the
rainy season in the lush countryside of Burkina Faso, 100 miles
south of here. When the vegetation withers in October, they wander
north to these few reliable water holes in the Gourma region just
south of Timbuktu, in Mali. It's the longest elephant migration in
Africa _ a 600-mile round trip.
 &HT;    To outsiders, the herd remains virtually unknown, but recently,
as the advancing Sahara has eroded the elephants' habitat and
nomads-turned-farmers have seized more of it to grow crops,
scientists have taken notice.
 &HT;    Karesh has come to help Anne Orlando, a wildlife biologist from
the University of California at Davis, who plans to put radio
collars on 10 elephants, track their movements over two years and
develop a conservation program.
 &HT;    Karesh is one of a half dozen globe-trotting wildlife vets, and
Orlando chose him because he knows how to fell wild animals without
injuring them.
 &HT;    Not long ago, scientists studying wildlife diseases simply shot
a few animals and studied their carcasses. But with Karesh in
charge, ``the risks to the elephants will be minimal, so I can
justify putting collars on them,'' Orlando says. She laughs. ``I
have to follow these elephants for the next two years on foot, and
I don't want them to have a bad experience, so that eventually
they'll forgive me. It's rare to find someone with his sensitivity
to animals.''
 &HT;    As the intrepid vet for the Wildlife Conservation Society based
at the Bronx Zoo in New York, Karesh has collected blood samples
from vampire bats in Peru, darted buffalo in Gabon and extracted a
mass of maggots from the festering head wound of an okapi in the
Congo.
 &HT;    ``Billy's kind of beyond real life,'' says his girlfriend,
Stacey Beard, a publicist for Neiman Marcus. ``He has a tremendous
sense of joy, he's enormously compassionate, and he's very real,
very authentic.''
 &HT;    Over the years, Karesh has brought down more than 100 elephants.
He's familiar with the calm, tourist-acclimated elephants of East
Africa. He understands their aggressive cousins in Cameroon, where
poaching is rampant.
 &HT;    He has tracked the vehicle-shy elephants of the Congo and the
hard-to-find forest elephants in the Central African Republic.
 &HT;    But Mali is different. The rangy, short-tusked desert elephants
are mysterious. One thing he does know is that they're
unpredictable.
 &HT;    And dangerous. Last year, they killed two of the goatherds.
 &HT;    As dry limbs crunch under his feet, Karesh moves from a
sun-blasted clearing into a patch of acacias, followed by Orlando
and Anders Lindgren, a technician whose Swedish firm, Televilt,
manufactured the 10 elephant-sized collars from tough fire-hose
material.
 &HT;    Behind them come Oumar, the Tuareg translator and guide, and
Samake, a uniformed Malian forestry official armed with a
high-powered rifle _ at the government's insistence, he's there to
protect Karesh if an elephant charges.
 &HT;    Karesh ignores him. No matter how dangerous the situation,
Karesh refuses to carry any weapon except his C02 rifle.
 &HT;    A hoarse cough from the bush stops him in his tracks. Then comes
a screaming roar, and everyone instinctively ducks. The first
elephant appears over the stunted treetops 90 feet away, followed
by a half dozen others and an enormous bull.
 &HT;    He trumpets, and at the sound two Tuaregs _ nomads who have
known elephants all their lives _ drop their walking sticks and
take off at a full run.
 &HT;    Karesh sets his feet, calmly raises his rifle and fires at a
medium-sized female, hitting her cleanly in the haunch.
 &HT;    Karesh yells and waves his arms to drive off the other
elephants. The herd melts away and, in the silence, there's a slow
crash as the female topples sideways into a thorn tree, shoving it
over as she falls asleep.
 &HT;    The team swarms over her warm body. She's snoring, and her feet,
big as dinner plates, shake.
 &HT;    Karesh drapes a moist blue cloth over her eyes to protect them
from the sun. He injects the dart wound with a long-lasting
antibiotic normally used to prevent mammary infections in lactating
cows.
 &HT;    Karesh inserts a pulse oximeter into her trunk to check her
heart rate (43) and blood oxygen level (95 percent). She's doing
fine and soon stops twitching.
 &HT;    Orlando begins measuring leg length, shoulder height and tusk
size, trying to estimate the animal's age. Lindgren crouches by the
elephant's head, her breath hot and wet on his face as he drapes an
eight-foot-long, 18-pound collar around her neck and fixes it there
with bolts through grommets.
 &HT;    The radio-tracking collar contains a tiny global positioning
satellite receiver linked to a memory chip. As the elephant moves
about, the collar will record her position in latitude and
longitude every two hours.
 &HT;    Every eight weeks, the collar will transmit the data to a radio
receiver, from which it can be downloaded into a laptop computer.
 &HT;    The computer, fitted with geographical software, can plot the
herd's movements on a map. Orlando can then analyze the travel
patterns of the elephants and assess their needs by plugging in
other variables, such as the location of water holes, the density
of vegetation and the movements of nomads and the goatherd.
 &HT;    The research will help her develop a conservation plan for the
Gourma-region elephants.
 &HT;    Karesh finishes examining the elephant for parasites and wounds
as Orlando measures a front leg.
 &HT;    ``I'd get that quickly,'' he says. ``We don't want her to get
overheated.''
 &HT;    He finds a vein in the elephant's ear and injects the antidote
that will wake her. The elephant shivers.
 &HT;    ``OK, I think it's time to go now,'' Karesh says.
 &HT;    Everyone backs away without taking their eyes off the trembling
elephant.
 &HT;    She's waking quickly, eyelashes fluttering and crushing the tree
beneath her as she tries to get to her feet. She waves her trunk in
the air, staggers erect and stands there dazed, swaying.
 &HT;    Karesh, Orlando and the others continue backing away. The
elephant shuffles, senses strangers, lifts her head and turns to
face them. Her eyes focus.
 &HT;    Karesh yells, ``Get the hell out of here!'' as the elephant
throws a cloud of dust into the air with her trunk and charges.
Karesh is already running. Oumar runs. A cameraman sets down his
lenses and runs.
 &HT;    The uniformed Malian official begins to raise his high-powered
rifle, then lowers it, turns and runs.
 &HT;    Panicked, everyone stumbles through the rough gullies and across
the thorn-strewn clay while the elephant crashes through the trees.
 &HT;    Finally the sound fades as she slows, turns and heads upwind to
join the herd.
 &HT;    Scattered and alone in the cover of thorny bush, people lean on
trees, catch their breath and glance around quickly, hearts
pounding. Karesh shakes his head, recalling what some local
``experts'' had proclaimed.
 &HT;    ``Oh, no, they never charge,'' he says with more than a touch of
irony.
 &HT;    The team doesn't spot a single elephant the rest of the day. In
the evening, Karesh divides the blood into ampoules and labels
them. Normally, he'd do a blood-cell count and then freeze samples
in liquid nitrogen, but a promised consignment of nitrogen hasn't
materialized.
 &HT;    ``This is Africa,'' he says, and shrugs.
 &HT;    He smears blood one cell thick on glass slides to be checked for
immune function and parasites.
 &HT;    Later, in New York, he will compare his data with that of other
scientists who monitor the incidence and spread of wildlife
diseases. More blood goes onto filter paper for genetic and
infectious-disease
 &HT;    Time and again during the research expedition, Karesh gets the
best data he can and keeps the team safe. But his concern about
elephants' unpredictability is not misplaced.
 &HT;    One day, as Oumar's 12-year-old cousin tends the family's sheep
and goats at the edge of the forest, an elephant attacks from
nowhere, crushing the boy's skull and leaving his dismembered body
scattered across the sand.
 &HT;    When Karesh arrives at the family's leather-roofed tent, all he
can do is splint the broken arm and leg of the boy's screaming
4-year-old friend, who was injured in the same attack.
 &HT;    The family shrieks in misery as Karesh hydrates the child and
tries to pull him out of shock before sending him off to what
passes for a hospital hours away across the desert.
 &HT;    For a week, Karesh can barely speak of the incident.
 &HT;    When he finally tells Beard about it, she is stunned _ and
relieved.
 &HT;    ``I'm incredibly sad for the child and the family,'' she says.
``And selfishly, I can't help thinking, `That could have been
Billy.'''

 By JOSIE GLAUSIUSZ 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Trumpeting cherubs peer down from the walls of Budapest's
opulent music academy. As pianist Dezso Ranki pounds at the keys,
his breathing is at times so stertorous one could swear that
someone in the audience is snoring.
 &HT;    But there are no somnolent spectators here. When the final
chords of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in C Major crash out, the
crowd bursts into applause _ at first tumultuously, but then,
suddenly, in perfect unison.
 &HT;    There is no signal, no leader; the synchrony is spontaneous. The
pianist bows, his pageboy hairdo flopping about his solemn face. He
disappears backstage, then returns to applause that grows stronger.
Yet as the clapping gathers strength, its synchrony dissolves.
 &HT;    Ranki retreats and reappears repeatedly, and so does the rhythm
of the applause _ one moment chaotic, the next a perfect beat. Then
without warning the entire audience stops, as one, on a single
clap.
 &HT;    Tamas Vicsek, a physicist at Budapest's Eotvos University,
twists around from his second-row seat and explains. \
 &HT;    ``This synchronized clapping is called `iron' applause in
Hungarian,'' he says. ``There was a time when an iron curtain would
descend after a performance between the stage and the audience,
which would clap rhythmically to induce the conductor or actors to
appear in front of the curtain, through a little door at its
center.''
 &HT;    The iron curtain is gone _ in more ways than one _ from this
country, but the rhythmic applause remains. In fact, it's hardly
unique to the theaters of Budapest: When hockey player Wayne
Gretzky retired from the Rangers, for instance, the crowd at
Madison Square Garden burst into rhythmic applause, and the same
response met Cecilia Bartoli when she sang an aria at the Teatro
Olimpico in Vicenza, Italy.
 &HT;    The reason, Vicsek and his colleagues in the United States and
Romania believe, has as much to do with mathematics as it does with
aesthetics and psychology.
 &HT;    According to Steven Strogatz, a mathematician at Cornell
University who has studied synchronization for 20 years, the same
set of mathematical principles governs the phenomenon wherever it
occurs _ be it among applauding people, flashing fireflies or
roomfuls of grandfather clocks.
 &HT;    Strogatz has been fascinated by synchronization since he
experimented with pendulums in his first science class. Now he
seems to see it wherever he looks.
 &HT;    Asian fireflies flash together each night in the mangrove trees
along a riverbank. Crickets chirp in unison, and cicadas emerge
from the ground at the same moment every 17 years.
 &HT;    The moon rotates around its own axis at exactly the same rate as
it orbits around Earth, which is why one side of the moon is never
seen. Pacemaker cells in the heart oscillate in harmony. There is
even the curious case of menstrual synchrony among women who live
together.
 &HT;    To understand the mechanics of synchrony, Strogatz suggests,
imagine several athletes running around a circular track.
 &HT;    ``Suppose these runners are friends, and they would prefer to
run together so that they can talk,'' he says. ``If their speeds
are not too different _ that is, if the slowest one can keep up
with the fastest one _ then you can get a group of runners all
going in sync. But first, they have to be sensitive to each other.
 &HT;    ``They have to be willing to adjust their speeds from what they
would prefer. The fastest ones have to slow down, and the slowest
ones have to speed up, to find some compromise. And that same
principle _ that slow oscillators have to speed up and fast ones
have to slow down, and that this happens because of mutual
interactions _ is a pretty universal principle for synchrony.''
 &HT;    The interactions, Strogatz adds, can be obvious: The runners see
each other, the clappers hear the other claps.
 &HT;    They can also be subtle. Two grandfather clocks can synchronize
their pendulum swings _ an effect first observed in 1665 by their
inventor, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens _ through
imperceptible vibrations traveling through the wall against which
they both lean.
 &HT;    But the story can also be more complicated than that. Picture,
for example, some crickets living alone in soundproof chambers, as
they did in Strogatz's lab. They can listen to their neighbors'
sounds only when controlled levels of chirping are piped in.
 &HT;    ``If we make the sounds loud enough _ if we let enough of the
chirping sound through _ at some point, there will suddenly be
enough mutual influence that they can synchronize. Below that
point, they can't. This is what physicists call a phase
transition,'' Strogatz says. ``There's a critical amount of
interaction when synchrony will burst out. It doesn't just build up
gradually.''
 &HT;    A similar phase transition lies behind an audience's sudden
switch to synchronized clapping.
 &HT;    ``Say the people are clapping in a disorganized way, but they
all know that they're trying to synchronize,'' Strogatz explains.
``However, they don't hear a beat. But then _ and this is rather
mysterious _ suppose a beat just happens to emerge a little bit,
maybe because a few clappers get lucky. That beat will then be
audible above the din of the disorganized rest of the audience. And
since everyone knows that they're trying to clap in unison, the
cooperative clappers will try to join in with that beat. The pulse
becomes stronger, and then it takes off.''
 &HT;    Eighteen months ago, Tamas Vicsek, together with physicists
Albert-Laszlo Barabasi of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana
and Zoltan Neda of Romania's Babes-Bolyai University in
Cluj-Napoca, set out to probe the dynamics of clapping more
closely.
 &HT;    Neda began the project by suspending microphones from the
ceilings of concert halls in Romania and recording the applause. He
and the other researchers then analyzed the recordings and found a
fairly consistent pattern: several rounds _ up to six or seven _ of
synchronized clapping, interspersed with incoherent cacophony.
Moreover, the periods between claps doubled during synchronization.
 &HT;    To study the process further, Neda and his graduate student
Erzsebet Ravasz asked 73 high-school students to stand alone in a
room and clap quickly, as they would after an outstanding
performance. Then he asked them to clap as if they were
synchronizing with others.
 &HT;    He found that their clapping rates varied quite widely when they
were asked to clap quickly _ between three and five claps per
second _ but when asked to simulate synchrony, most people clapped
at around the same, relatively slow rate: about two claps per
second.
 &HT;    As for the waves of chaotic clapping that interrupt the
synchrony periodically, Barabasi and Vicsek think they're a matter
of crowd psychology. When synchrony sets in, the overall noise of
the applause decreases; when it disappears, the noise level rises.
Synchronization, they conclude, triggers a cozy feeling of
togetherness among audience members, whereas faster clapping feels
more enthusiastic. Conflicting desires swing the clappers between
the two modes.
 &HT;    There was a time, Barabasi adds, when comradeship reigned
supreme in countries such as Hungary and Romania and exuberance had
no place, when swings between synchrony and chaos couldn't be
heard.
 &HT;    At the giant rallies common to Barabasi's childhood in communist
Romania _ a childhood marked by the tyrannical regime of Nicolae
Ceausescu _ audiences applauding the ``great leader'' would clap
monotonously and dutifully in synchrony in response to party
speeches. But there was no enthusiasm to spur their clapping into
disorder. Then one day in late December 1989, the synchronized
applause ended _ abruptly.
 &HT;    ``When Ceausescu was overthrown, he organized a huge rally of
250,000 people in Bucharest to show support for him,'' Barabsi
remembers. ``People were supposed to clap synchronously, and at the
beginning they did. But then the clapping stopped. Some people
threw their banners down, and then the shooting started and the
revolution began.''
 &HT;    Four days later, on Christmas day, Ceausescu was shot dead.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    In the cool morning, Oumar the Tuareg guide announces that the
elephants might have arrived at watering holes near the
InAdyatafane oasis, so everyone piles into the Land Rovers to cross
60 miles of hot open desert.
 &HT;    Six hours later, the vehicles lurch to a stop a mile from where
the herd should be. The rest of the distance must be covered on
foot to keep from spooking the elephants.
 &HT;    Wildlife veterinarian Billy Karesh carefully screws the barrel
of his rifle into its stock and drops two fully charged anesthetic
darts into the pocket of his cargo pants.
 &HT;    He strides briskly across a desert landscape _ his senses on
full alert. A six-ton pachyderm could be just feet away.
 &HT;    ``It's easy to walk up on them by accident in the thorn scrub,''
he says. ``I don't want to encourage anybody to get close to these
elephants. It's very possible a human could die in this.''
 &HT;    The elephants Karesh hopes to track fatten themselves during the
rainy season in the lush countryside of Burkina Faso, 100 miles
south of here. When the vegetation withers in October, they wander
north to these few reliable water holes in the Gourma region just
south of Timbuktu, in Mali. It's the longest elephant migration in
Africa _ a 600-mile round trip.
 &HT;    To outsiders, the herd remains virtually unknown, but recently,
as the advancing Sahara has eroded the elephants' habitat and
nomads-turned-farmers have seized more of it to grow crops,
scientists have taken notice.
 &HT;    Karesh has come to help Anne Orlando, a wildlife biologist from
the University of California at Davis, who plans to put radio
collars on 10 elephants, track their movements over two years and
develop a conservation program.
 &HT;    Karesh is one of a half dozen globe-trotting wildlife vets, and
Orlando chose him because he knows how to fell wild animals without
injuring them.
 &HT;    Not long ago, scientists studying wildlife diseases simply shot
a few animals and studied their carcasses. But with Karesh in
charge, ``the risks to the elephants will be minimal, so I can
justify putting collars on them,'' Orlando says. She laughs. ``I
have to follow these elephants for the next two years on foot, and
I don't want them to have a bad experience, so that eventually
they'll forgive me. It's rare to find someone with his sensitivity
to animals.''
 &HT;    As the intrepid vet for the Wildlife Conservation Society based
at the Bronx Zoo in New York, Karesh has collected blood samples
from vampire bats in Peru, darted buffalo in Gabon and extracted a
mass of maggots from the festering head wound of an okapi in the
Congo.
 &HT;    ``Billy's kind of beyond real life,'' says his girlfriend,
Stacey Beard, a publicist for Neiman Marcus. ``He has a tremendous
sense of joy, he's enormously compassionate, and he's very real,
very authentic.''
 &HT;    Over the years, Karesh has brought down more than 100 elephants.
He's familiar with the calm, tourist-acclimated elephants of East
Africa. He understands their aggressive cousins in Cameroon, where
poaching is rampant.
 &HT;    He has tracked the vehicle-shy elephants of the Congo and the
hard-to-find forest elephants in the Central African Republic.
 &HT;    But Mali is different. The rangy, short-tusked desert elephants
are mysterious. One thing he does know is that they're
unpredictable.
 &HT;    And dangerous. Last year, they killed two of the goatherds.
 &HT;    As dry limbs crunch under his feet, Karesh moves from a
sun-blasted clearing into a patch of acacias, followed by Orlando
and Anders Lindgren, a technician whose Swedish firm, Televilt,
manufactured the 10 elephant-sized collars from tough fire-hose
material.
 &HT;    Behind them come Oumar, the Tuareg translator and guide, and
Samake, a uniformed Malian forestry official armed with a
high-powered rifle _ at the government's insistence, he's there to
protect Karesh if an elephant charges.
 &HT;    Karesh ignores him. No matter how dangerous the situation,
Karesh refuses to carry any weapon except his C02 rifle.
 &HT;    A hoarse cough from the bush stops him in his tracks. Then comes
a screaming roar, and everyone instinctively ducks. The first
elephant appears over the stunted treetops 90 feet away, followed
by a half dozen others and an enormous bull.
 &HT;    He trumpets, and at the sound two Tuaregs _ nomads who have
known elephants all their lives _ drop their walking sticks and
take off at a full run.
 &HT;    Karesh sets his feet, calmly raises his rifle and fires at a
medium-sized female, hitting her cleanly in the haunch.
 &HT;    Karesh yells and waves his arms to drive off the other
elephants. The herd melts away and, in the silence, there's a slow
crash as the female topples sideways into a thorn tree, shoving it
over as she falls asleep.
 &HT;    The team swarms over her warm body. She's snoring, and her feet,
big as dinner plates, shake.
 &HT;    Karesh drapes a moist blue cloth over her eyes to protect them
from the sun. He injects the dart wound with a long-lasting
antibiotic normally used to prevent mammary infections in lactating
cows.
 &HT;    Karesh inserts a pulse oximeter into her trunk to check her
heart rate (43) and blood oxygen level (95 percent). She's doing
fine and soon stops twitching.
 &HT;    Orlando begins measuring leg length, shoulder height and tusk
size, trying to estimate the animal's age. Lindgren crouches by the
elephant's head, her breath hot and wet on his face as he drapes an
eight-foot-long, 18-pound collar around her neck and fixes it there
with bolts through grommets.
 &HT;    The radio-tracking collar contains a tiny global positioning
satellite receiver linked to a memory chip. As the elephant moves
about, the collar will record her position in latitude and
longitude every two hours.
 &HT;    Every eight weeks, the collar will transmit the data to a radio
receiver, from which it can be downloaded into a laptop computer.
 &HT;    The computer, fitted with geographical software, can plot the
herd's movements on a map. Orlando can then analyze the travel
patterns of the elephants and assess their needs by plugging in
other variables, such as the location of water holes, the density
of vegetation and the movements of nomads and the goatherd.
 &HT;    The research will help her develop a conservation plan for the
Gourma-region elephants.
 &HT;    Karesh finishes examining the elephant for parasites and wounds
as Orlando measures a front leg.
 &HT;    ``I'd get that quickly,'' he says. ``We don't want her to get
overheated.''
 &HT;    He finds a vein in the elephant's ear and injects the antidote
that will wake her. The elephant shivers.
 &HT;    ``OK, I think it's time to go now,'' Karesh says.
 &HT;    Everyone backs away without taking their eyes off the trembling
elephant.
 &HT;    She's waking quickly, eyelashes fluttering and crushing the tree
beneath her as she tries to get to her feet. She waves her trunk in
the air, staggers erect and stands there dazed, swaying.
 &HT;    Karesh, Orlando and the others continue backing away. The
elephant shuffles, senses strangers, lifts her head and turns to
face them. Her eyes focus.
 &HT;    Karesh yells, ``Get the hell out of here!'' as the elephant
throws a cloud of dust into the air with her trunk and charges.
Karesh is already running. Oumar runs. A cameraman sets down his
lenses and runs.
 &HT;    The uniformed Malian official begins to raise his high-powered
rifle, then lowers it, turns and runs.
 &HT;    Panicked, everyone stumbles through the rough gullies and across
the thorn-strewn clay while the elephant crashes through the trees.
 &HT;    Finally the sound fades as she slows, turns and heads upwind to
join the herd.
 &HT;    Scattered and alone in the cover of thorny bush, people lean on
trees, catch their breath and glance around quickly, hearts
pounding. Karesh shakes his head, recalling what some local
``experts'' had proclaimed.
 &HT;    ``Oh, no, they never charge,'' he says with more than a touch of
irony.
 &HT;    The team doesn't spot a single elephant the rest of the day. In
the evening, Karesh divides the blood into ampoules and labels
them. Normally, he'd do a blood-cell count and then freeze samples
in liquid nitrogen, but a promised consignment of nitrogen hasn't
materialized.
 &HT;    ``This is Africa,'' he says, and shrugs.
 &HT;    He smears blood one cell thick on glass slides to be checked for
immune function and parasites.
 &HT;    Later, in New York, he will compare his data with that of other
scientists who monitor the incidence and spread of wildlife
diseases. More blood goes onto filter paper for genetic and
infectious-disease
 &HT;    Time and again during the research expedition, Karesh gets the
best data he can and keeps the team safe. But his concern about
elephants' unpredictability is not misplaced.
 &HT;    One day, as Oumar's 12-year-old cousin tends the family's sheep
and goats at the edge of the forest, an elephant attacks from
nowhere, crushing the boy's skull and leaving his dismembered body
scattered across the sand.
 &HT;    When Karesh arrives at the family's leather-roofed tent, all he
can do is splint the broken arm and leg of the boy's screaming
4-year-old friend, who was injured in the same attack.
 &HT;    The family shrieks in misery as Karesh hydrates the child and
tries to pull him out of shock before sending him off to what
passes for a hospital hours away across the desert.
 &HT;    For a week, Karesh can barely speak of the incident.
 &HT;    When he finally tells Beard about it, she is stunned _ and
relieved.
 &HT;    ``I'm incredibly sad for the child and the family,'' she says.
``And selfishly, I can't help thinking, `That could have been
Billy.'''

 By JOSIE GLAUSIUSZ 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Trumpeting cherubs peer down from the walls of Budapest's
opulent music academy. As pianist Dezso Ranki pounds at the keys,
his breathing is at times so stertorous one could swear that
someone in the audience is snoring.
 &HT;    But there are no somnolent spectators here. When the final
chords of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in C Major crash out, the
crowd bursts into applause _ at first tumultuously, but then,
suddenly, in perfect unison.
 &HT;    There is no signal, no leader; the synchrony is spontaneous. The
pianist bows, his pageboy hairdo flopping about his solemn face. He
disappears backstage, then returns to applause that grows stronger.
Yet as the clapping gathers strength, its synchrony dissolves.
 &HT;    Ranki retreats and reappears repeatedly, and so does the rhythm
of the applause _ one moment chaotic, the next a perfect beat. Then
without warning the entire audience stops, as one, on a single
clap.
 &HT;    Tamas Vicsek, a physicist at Budapest's Eotvos University,
twists around from his second-row seat and explains. \
 &HT;    ``This synchronized clapping is called `iron' applause in
Hungarian,'' he says. ``There was a time when an iron curtain would
descend after a performance between the stage and the audience,
which would clap rhythmically to induce the conductor or actors to
appear in front of the curtain, through a little door at its
center.''
 &HT;    The iron curtain is gone _ in more ways than one _ from this
country, but the rhythmic applause remains. In fact, it's hardly
unique to the theaters of Budapest: When hockey player Wayne
Gretzky retired from the Rangers, for instance, the crowd at
Madison Square Garden burst into rhythmic applause, and the same
response met Cecilia Bartoli when she sang an aria at the Teatro
Olimpico in Vicenza, Italy.
 &HT;    The reason, Vicsek and his colleagues in the United States and
Romania believe, has as much to do with mathematics as it does with
aesthetics and psychology.
 &HT;    According to Steven Strogatz, a mathematician at Cornell
University who has studied synchronization for 20 years, the same
set of mathematical principles governs the phenomenon wherever it
occurs _ be it among applauding people, flashing fireflies or
roomfuls of grandfather clocks.
 &HT;    Strogatz has been fascinated by synchronization since he
experimented with pendulums in his first science class. Now he
seems to see it wherever he looks.
 &HT;    Asian fireflies flash together each night in the mangrove trees
along a riverbank. Crickets chirp in unison, and cicadas emerge
from the ground at the same moment every 17 years.
 &HT;    The moon rotates around its own axis at exactly the same rate as
it orbits around Earth, which is why one side of the moon is never
seen. Pacemaker cells in the heart oscillate in harmony. There is
even the curious case of menstrual synchrony among women who live
together.
 &HT;    To understand the mechanics of synchrony, Strogatz suggests,
imagine several athletes running around a circular track.
 &HT;    ``Suppose these runners are friends, and they would prefer to
run together so that they can talk,'' he says. ``If their speeds
are not too different _ that is, if the slowest one can keep up
with the fastest one _ then you can get a group of runners all
going in sync. But first, they have to be sensitive to each other.
 &HT;    ``They have to be willing to adjust their speeds from what they
would prefer. The fastest ones have to slow down, and the slowest
ones have to speed up, to find some compromise. And that same
principle _ that slow oscillators have to speed up and fast ones
have to slow down, and that this happens because of mutual
interactions _ is a pretty universal principle for synchrony.''
 &HT;    The interactions, Strogatz adds, can be obvious: The runners see
each other, the clappers hear the other claps.
 &HT;    They can also be subtle. Two grandfather clocks can synchronize
their pendulum swings _ an effect first observed in 1665 by their
inventor, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens _ through
imperceptible vibrations traveling through the wall against which
they both lean.
 &HT;    But the story can also be more complicated than that. Picture,
for example, some crickets living alone in soundproof chambers, as
they did in Strogatz's lab. They can listen to their neighbors'
sounds only when controlled levels of chirping are piped in.
 &HT;    ``If we make the sounds loud enough _ if we let enough of the
chirping sound through _ at some point, there will suddenly be
enough mutual influence that they can synchronize. Below that
point, they can't. This is what physicists call a phase
transition,'' Strogatz says. ``There's a critical amount of
interaction when synchrony will burst out. It doesn't just build up
gradually.''
 &HT;    A similar phase transition lies behind an audience's sudden
switch to synchronized clapping.
 &HT;    ``Say the people are clapping in a disorganized way, but they
all know that they're trying to synchronize,'' Strogatz explains.
``However, they don't hear a beat. But then _ and this is rather
mysterious _ suppose a beat just happens to emerge a little bit,
maybe because a few clappers get lucky. That beat will then be
audible above the din of the disorganized rest of the audience. And
since everyone knows that they're trying to clap in unison, the
cooperative clappers will try to join in with that beat. The pulse
becomes stronger, and then it takes off.''
 &HT;    Eighteen months ago, Tamas Vicsek, together with physicists
Albert-Laszlo Barabasi of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana
and Zoltan Neda of Romania's Babes-Bolyai University in
Cluj-Napoca, set out to probe the dynamics of clapping more
closely.
 &HT;    Neda began the project by suspending microphones from the
ceilings of concert halls in Romania and recording the applause. He
and the other researchers then analyzed the recordings and found a
fairly consistent pattern: several rounds _ up to six or seven _ of
synchronized clapping, interspersed with incoherent cacophony.
Moreover, the periods between claps doubled during synchronization.
 &HT;    To study the process further, Neda and his graduate student
Erzsebet Ravasz asked 73 high-school students to stand alone in a
room and clap quickly, as they would after an outstanding
performance. Then he asked them to clap as if they were
synchronizing with others.
 &HT;    He found that their clapping rates varied quite widely when they
were asked to clap quickly _ between three and five claps per
second _ but when asked to simulate synchrony, most people clapped
at around the same, relatively slow rate: about two claps per
second.
 &HT;    As for the waves of chaotic clapping that interrupt the
synchrony periodically, Barabasi and Vicsek think they're a matter
of crowd psychology. When synchrony sets in, the overall noise of
the applause decreases; when it disappears, the noise level rises.
Synchronization, they conclude, triggers a cozy feeling of
togetherness among audience members, whereas faster clapping feels
more enthusiastic. Conflicting desires swing the clappers between
the two modes.
 &HT;    There was a time, Barabasi adds, when comradeship reigned
supreme in countries such as Hungary and Romania and exuberance had
no place, when swings between synchrony and chaos couldn't be
heard.
 &HT;    At the giant rallies common to Barabasi's childhood in communist
Romania _ a childhood marked by the tyrannical regime of Nicolae
Ceausescu _ audiences applauding the ``great leader'' would clap
monotonously and dutifully in synchrony in response to party
speeches. But there was no enthusiasm to spur their clapping into
disorder. Then one day in late December 1989, the synchronized
applause ended _ abruptly.
 &HT;    ``When Ceausescu was overthrown, he organized a huge rally of
250,000 people in Bucharest to show support for him,'' Barabsi
remembers. ``People were supposed to clap synchronously, and at the
beginning they did. But then the clapping stopped. Some people
threw their banners down, and then the shooting started and the
revolution began.''
 &HT;    Four days later, on Christmas day, Ceausescu was shot dead.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    In the cool morning, Oumar the Tuareg guide announces that the
elephants might have arrived at watering holes near the
InAdyatafane oasis, so everyone piles into the Land Rovers to cross
60 miles of hot open desert.
 &HT;    Six hours later, the vehicles lurch to a stop a mile from where
the herd should be. The rest of the distance must be covered on
foot to keep from spooking the elephants.
 &HT;    Wildlife veterinarian Billy Karesh carefully screws the barrel
of his rifle into its stock and drops two fully charged anesthetic
darts into the pocket of his cargo pants.

face them. Her eyes focus.
 &HT;    Karesh yells, ``Get the hell out of here!'' as the elephant
throws a cloud of dust into the air with her trunk and charges.
Karesh is already running. Oumar runs. A cameraman sets down his
lenses and runs.
 &HT;    The uniformed Malian official begins to raise his high-powered
rifle, then lowers it, turns and runs.
 &HT;    Panicked, everyone stumbles through the rough gullies and across
the thorn-strewn clay while the elephant crashes through the trees.
 &HT;    Finally the sound fades as she slows, turns and heads upwind to
join the herd.
 &HT;    Scattered and alone in the cover of thorny bush, people lean on
trees, catch their breath and glance around quickly, hearts
pounding. Karesh shakes his head, recalling what some local
``experts'' had proclaimed.
 &HT;    ``Oh, no, they never charge,'' he says with more than a touch of
irony.
 &HT;    The team doesn't spot a single elephant the rest of the day. In
the evening, Karesh divides the blood into ampoules and labels
them. Normally, he'd do a blood-cell count and then freeze samples
in liquid nitrogen, but a promised consignment of nitrogen hasn't
materialized.
 &HT;    ``This is Africa,'' he says, and shrugs.
 &HT;    He smears blood one cell thick on glass slides to be checked for
immune function and parasites.
 &HT;    Later, in New York, he will compare his data with that of other
scientists who monitor the incidence and spread of wildlife
diseases. More blood goes onto filter paper for genetic and
infectious-disease
 &HT;    Time and again during the research expedition, Karesh gets the
best data he can and keeps the team safe. But his concern about
elephants' unpredictability is not misplaced.
 &HT;    One day, as Oumar's 12-year-old cousin tends the family's sheep
and goats at the edge of the forest, an elephant attacks from
nowhere, crushing the boy's skull and leaving his dismembered body
scattered across the sand.
 &HT;    When Karesh arrives at the family's leather-roofed tent, all he
can do is splint the broken arm and leg of the boy's screaming
4-year-old friend, who was injured in the same attack.
 &HT;    The family shrieks in misery as Karesh hydrates the child and
tries to pull him out of shock before sending him off to what
passes for a hospital hours away across the desert.
 &HT;    For a week, Karesh can barely speak of the incident.
 &HT;    When he finally tells Beard about it, she is stunned _ and
relieved.
 &HT;    ``I'm incredibly sad for the child and the family,'' she says.
``And selfishly, I can't help thinking, `That could have been
Billy.'''

 By JOSIE GLAUSIUSZ 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Trumpeting cherubs peer down from the walls of Budapest's
opulent music academy. As pianist Dezso Ranki pounds at the keys,
his breathing is at times so stertorous one could swear that
someone in the audience is snoring.
 &HT;    But there are no somnolent spectators here. When the final
chords of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in C Major crash out, the
crowd bursts into applause _ at first tumultuously, but then,
suddenly, in perfect unison.
 &HT;    There is no signal, no leader; the synchrony is spontaneous. The
pianist bows, his pageboy hairdo flopping about his solemn face. He
disappears backstage, then returns to applause that grows stronger.
Yet as the clapping gathers strength, its synchrony dissolves.
 &HT;    Ranki retreats and reappears repeatedly, and so does the rhythm
of the applause _ one moment chaotic, the next a perfect beat. Then
without warning the entire audience stops, as one, on a single
clap.
 &HT;    Tamas Vicsek, a physicist at Budapest's Eotvos University,
twists around from his second-row seat and explains. \
 &HT;    ``This synchronized clapping is called `iron' applause in
Hungarian,'' he says. ``There was a time when an iron curtain would
descend after a performance between the stage and the audience,
which would clap rhythmically to induce the conductor or actors to
appear in front of the curtain, through a little door at its
center.''
 &HT;    The iron curtain is gone _ in more ways than one _ from this
country, but the rhythmic applause remains. In fact, it's hardly
unique to the theaters of Budapest: When hockey player Wayne
Gretzky retired from the Rangers, for instance, the crowd at
Madison Square Garden burst into rhythmic applause, and the same
response met Cecilia Bartoli when she sang an aria at the Teatro
Olimpico in Vicenza, Italy.
 &HT;    The reason, Vicsek and his colleagues in the United States and
Romania believe, has as much to do with mathematics as it does with
aesthetics and psychology.
 &HT;    According to Steven Strogatz, a mathematician at Cornell
University who has studied synchronization for 20 years, the same
set of mathematical principles governs the phenomenon wherever it
occurs _ be it among applauding people, flashing fireflies or
roomfuls of grandfather clocks.
 &HT;    Strogatz has been fascinated by synchronization since he
experimented with pendulums in his first science class. Now he
seems to see it wherever he looks.
 &HT;    Asian fireflies flash together each night in the mangrove trees
along a riverbank. Crickets chirp in unison, and cicadas emerge
from the ground at the same moment every 17 years.
 &HT;    The moon rotates around its own axis at exactly the same rate as
it orbits around Earth, which is why one side of the moon is never
seen. Pacemaker cells in the heart oscillate in harmony. There is
even the curious case of menstrual synchrony among women who live
together.
 &HT;    To understand the mechanics of synchrony, Strogatz suggests,
imagine several athletes running around a circular track.
 &HT;    ``Suppose these runners are friends, and they would prefer to
run together so that they can talk,'' he says. ``If their speeds
are not too different _ that is, if the slowest one can keep up
with the fastest one _ then you can get a group of runners all
going in sync. But first, they have to be sensitive to each other.
 &HT;    ``They have to be willing to adjust their speeds from what they
would prefer. The fastest ones have to slow down, and the slowest
ones have to speed up, to find some compromise. And that same
principle _ that slow oscillators have to speed up and fast ones
have to slow down, and that this happens because of mutual
interactions _ is a pretty universal principle for synchrony.''
 &HT;    The interactions, Strogatz adds, can be obvious: The runners see
each other, the clappers hear the other claps.
 &HT;    They can also be subtle. Two grandfather clocks can synchronize
their pendulum swings _ an effect first observed in 1665 by their
inventor, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens _ through
imperceptible vibrations traveling through the wall against which
they both lean.
 &HT;    But the story can also be more complicated than that. Picture,
for example, some crickets living alone in soundproof chambers, as
they did in Strogatz's lab. They can listen to their neighbors'
sounds only when controlled levels of chirping are piped in.
 &HT;    ``If we make the sounds loud enough _ if we let enough of the
chirping sound through _ at some point, there will suddenly be
enough mutual influence that they can synchronize. Below that
point, they can't. This is what physicists call a phase
transition,'' Strogatz says. ``There's a critical amount of
interaction when synchrony will burst out. It doesn't just build up
gradually.''
 &HT;    A similar phase transition lies behind an audience's sudden
switch to synchronized clapping.
 &HT;    ``Say the people are clapping in a disorganized way, but they
all know that they're trying to synchronize,'' Strogatz explains.
``However, they don't hear a beat. But then _ and this is rather
mysterious _ suppose a beat just happens to emerge a little bit,
maybe because a few clappers get lucky. That beat will then be
audible above the din of the disorganized rest of the audience. And
since everyone knows that they're trying to clap in unison, the
cooperative clappers will try to join in with that beat. The pulse
becomes stronger, and then it takes off.''
 &HT;    Eighteen months ago, Tamas Vicsek, together with physicists
Albert-Laszlo Barabasi of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana
and Zoltan Neda of Romania's Babes-Bolyai University in
Cluj-Napoca, set out to probe the dynamics of clapping more
closely.
 &HT;    Neda began the project by suspending microphones from the
ceilings of concert halls in Romania and recording the applause. He
and the other researchers then analyzed the recordings and found a
fairly consistent pattern: several rounds _ up to six or seven _ of
synchronized clapping, interspersed with incoherent cacophony.
Moreover, the periods between claps doubled during synchronization.
 &HT;    To study the process further, Neda and his graduate student
Erzsebet Ravasz asked 73 high-school students to stand alone in a
room and clap quickly, as they would after an outstanding
performance. Then he asked them to clap as if they were
synchronizing with others.
 &HT;    He found that their clapping rates varied quite widely when they
were asked to clap quickly _ between three and five claps per
second _ but when asked to simulate synchrony, most people clapped
at around the same, relatively slow rate: about two claps per
second.
 &HT;    As for the waves of chaotic clapping that interrupt the
synchrony periodically, Barabasi and Vicsek think they're a matter
of crowd psychology. When synchrony sets in, the overall noise of
the applause decreases; when it disappears, the noise level rises.
Synchronization, they conclude, triggers a cozy feeling of
togetherness among audience members, whereas faster clapping feels
more enthusiastic. Conflicting desires swing the clappers between
the two modes.
 &HT;    There was a time, Barabasi adds, when comradeship reigned
supreme in countries such as Hungary and Romania and exuberance had
no place, when swings between synchrony and chaos couldn't be
heard.
 &HT;    At the giant rallies common to Barabasi's childhood in communist
Romania _ a childhood marked by the tyrannical regime of Nicolae
Ceausescu _ audiences applauding the ``great leader'' would clap
monotonously and dutifully in synchrony in response to party
speeches. But there was no enthusiasm to spur their clapping into
disorder. Then one day in late December 1989, the synchronized
applause ended _ abruptly.
 &HT;    ``When Ceausescu was overthrown, he organized a huge rally of
250,000 people in Bucharest to show support for him,'' Barabsi
remembers. ``People were supposed to clap synchronously, and at the
beginning they did. But then the clapping stopped. Some people
threw their banners down, and then the shooting started and the
revolution began.''
 &HT;    Four days later, on Christmas day, Ceausescu was shot dead.

 By JACK McCLINTOCK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    In the cool morning, Oumar the Tuareg guide announces that the
elephants might have arrived at watering holes near the
InAdyatafane oasis, so everyone piles into the Land Rovers to cross
60 miles of hot open desert.
 &HT;    Six hours later, the vehicles lurch to a stop a mile from where
the herd should be. The rest of the distance must be covered on
foot to keep from spooking the elephants.
 &HT;    Wildlife veterinarian Billy Karesh carefully screws the barrel
of his rifle into its stock and drops two fully charged anesthetic
darts into the pocket of his cargo pants.
 &HT;    He strides briskly across a desert landscape _ his senses on
full alert. A six-ton pachyderm could be just feet away.
 &HT;    ``It's easy to walk up on them by accident in the thorn scrub,''
he says. ``I don't want to encourage anybody to get close to these
elephants. It's very possible a human could die in this.''
 &HT;    The elephants Karesh hopes to track fatten themselves during the
rainy season in the lush countryside of Burkina Faso, 100 miles
south of here. When the vegetation withers in October, they wander
north to these few reliable water holes in the Gourma region just
south of Timbuktu, in Mali. It's the longest elephant migration in
Africa _ a 600-mile round trip.
 &HT;    To outsiders, the herd remains virtually unknown, but recently,
as the advancing Sahara has eroded the elephants' habitat and
nomads-turned-farmers have seized more of it to grow crops,
scientists have taken notice.
 &HT;    Karesh has come to help Anne Orlando, a wildlife biologist from
the University of California at Davis, who plans to put radio
collars on 10 elephants, track their movements over two years and
develop a conservation program.
 &HT;    Karesh is one of a half dozen globe-trotting wildlife vets, and
Orlando chose him because he knows how to fell wild animals without
injuring them.
 &HT;    Not long ago, scientists studying wildlife diseases simply shot
a few animals and studied their carcasses. But with Karesh in
charge, ``the risks to the elephants will be minimal, so I can
justify putting collars on them,'' Orlando says. She laughs. ``I
have to follow these elephants for the next two years on foot, and
I don't want them to have a bad experience, so that eventually
they'll forgive me. It's rare to find someone with his sensitivity
to animals.''
 &HT;    As the intrepid vet for the Wildlife Conservation Society based
at the Bronx Zoo in New York, Karesh has collected blood samples
from vampire bats in Peru, darted buffalo in Gabon and extracted a
mass of maggots from the festering head wound of an okapi in the
Congo.
 &HT;    ``Billy's kind of beyond real life,'' says his girlfriend,
Stacey Beard, a publicist for Neiman Marcus. ``He has a tremendous
sense of joy, he's enormously compassionate, and he's very real,
very authentic.''
 &HT;    Over the years, Karesh has brought down more than 100 elephants.
He's familiar with the calm, tourist-acclimated elephants of East
Africa. He understands their aggressive cousins in Cameroon, where
poaching is rampant.
 &HT;    He has tracked the vehicle-shy elephants of the Congo and the
hard-to-find forest elephants in the Central African Republic.
 &HT;    But Mali is different. The rangy, short-tusked desert elephants
are mysterious. One thing he does know is that they're
unpredictable.
 &HT;    And dangerous. Last year, they killed two of the goatherds.
 &HT;    As dry limbs crunch under his feet, Karesh moves from a
sun-blasted clearing into a patch of acacias, followed by Orlando
and Anders Lindgren, a technician whose Swedish firm, Televilt,
manufactured the 10 elephant-sized collars from tough fire-hose
material.
 &HT;    Behind them come Oumar, the Tuareg translator and guide, and
Samake, a uniformed Malian forestry official armed with a
high-powered rifle _ at the government's insistence, he's there to
protect Karesh if an elephant charges.
 &HT;    Karesh ignores him. No matter how dangerous the situation,
Karesh refuses to carry any weapon except his C02 rifle.
 &HT;    A hoarse cough from the bush stops him in his tracks. Then comes
a screaming roar, and everyone instinctively ducks. The first
elephant appears over the stunted treetops 90 feet away, followed
by a half dozen others and an enormous bull.
 &HT;    He trumpets, and at the sound two Tuaregs _ nomads who have
known elephants all their lives _ drop their walking sticks and
take off at a full run.
 &HT;    Karesh sets his feet, calmly raises his rifle and fires at a
medium-sized female, hitting her cleanly in the haunch.
 &HT;    Karesh yells and waves his arms to drive off the other
elephants. The herd melts away and, in the silence, there's a slow
crash as the female topples sideways into a thorn tree, shoving it
over as she falls asleep.
 &HT;    The team swarms over her warm body. She's snoring, and her feet,
big as dinner plates, shake.
 &HT;    Karesh drapes a moist blue cloth over her eyes to protect them
from the sun. He injects the dart wound with a long-lasting
antibiotic normally used to prevent mammary infections in lactating
cows.
 &HT;    Karesh inserts a pulse oximeter into her trunk to check her
heart rate (43) and blood oxygen level (95 percent). She's doing
fine and soon stops twitching.
 &HT;    Orlando begins measuring leg length, shoulder height and tusk
size, trying to estimate the animal's age. Lindgren crouches by the
elephant's head, her breath hot and wet on his face as he drapes an
eight-foot-long, 18-pound collar around her neck and fixes it there
with bolts through grommets.
 &HT;    The radio-tracking collar contains a tiny global positioning
satellite receiver linked to a memory chip. As the elephant moves
about, the collar will record her position in latitude and
longitude every two hours.
 &HT;    Every eight weeks, the collar will transmit the data to a radio
receiver, from which it can be downloaded into a laptop computer.
 &HT;    The computer, fitted with geographical software, can plot the
herd's movements on a map. Orlando can then analyze the travel
patterns of the elephants and assess their needs by plugging in
other variables, such as the location of water holes, the density
of vegetation and the movements of nomads and the goatherd.
 &HT;    The research will help her develop a conservation plan for the
Gourma-region elephants.
 &HT;    Karesh finishes examining the elephant for parasites and wounds
as Orlando measures a front leg.
 &HT;    ``I'd get that quickly,'' he says. ``We don't want her to get
overheated.''
 &HT;    He finds a vein in the elephant's ear and injects the antidote
that will wake her. The elephant shivers.
 &HT;    ``OK, I think it's time to go now,'' Karesh says.
 &HT;    Everyone backs away without taking their eyes off the trembling
elephant.
 &HT;    She's waking quickly, eyelashes fluttering and crushing the tree
beneath her as she tries to get to her feet. She waves her trunk in
the air, staggers erect and stands there dazed, swaying.
 &HT;    Karesh, Orlando and the others continue backing away. The
elephant shuffles, senses strangers, lifts her head and turns to
face them. Her eyes focus.
 &HT;    Karesh yells, ``Get the hell out of here!'' as the elephant
throws a cloud of dust into the air with her trunk and charges.
Karesh is already running. Oumar runs. A cameraman sets down his
lenses and runs.
 &HT;    The uniformed Malian official begins to raise his high-powered
rifle, then lowers it, turns and runs.
 &HT;    Panicked, everyone stumbles through the rough gullies and across

as the advancing Sahara has eroded the elephants' habitat and
nomads-turned-farmers have seized more of it to grow crops,
scientists have taken notice.
 &HT;    Karesh has come to help Anne Orlando, a wildlife biologist from
the University of California at Davis, who plans to put radio
collars on 10 elephants, track their movements over two years and
develop a conservation program.
 &HT;    Karesh is one of a half dozen globe-trotting wildlife vets, and
Orlando chose him because he knows how to fell wild animals without
injuring them.
 &HT;    Not long ago, scientists studying wildlife diseases simply shot
a few animals and studied their carcasses. But with Karesh in
charge, ``the risks to the elephants will be minimal, so I can
justify putting collars on them,'' Orlando says. She laughs. ``I
have to follow these elephants for the next two years on foot, and
I don't want them to have a bad experience, so that eventually
they'll forgive me. It's rare to find someone with his sensitivity
to animals.''
 &HT;    As the intrepid vet for the Wildlife Conservation Society based
at the Bronx Zoo in New York, Karesh has collected blood samples
from vampire bats in Peru, darted buffalo in Gabon and extracted a
mass of maggots from the festering head wound of an okapi in the
Congo.
 &HT;    ``Billy's kind of beyond real life,'' says his girlfriend,
Stacey Beard, a publicist for Neiman Marcus. ``He has a tremendous
sense of joy, he's enormously compassionate, and he's very real,
very authentic.''
 &HT;    Over the years, Karesh has brought down more than 100 elephants.
He's familiar with the calm, tourist-acclimated elephants of East
Africa. He understands their aggressive cousins in Cameroon, where
poaching is rampant.
 &HT;    He has tracked the vehicle-shy elephants of the Congo and the
hard-to-find forest elephants in the Central African Republic.
 &HT;    But Mali is different. The rangy, short-tusked desert elephants
are mysterious. One thing he does know is that they're
unpredictable.
 &HT;    And dangerous. Last year, they killed two of the goatherds.
 &HT;    As dry limbs crunch under his feet, Karesh moves from a
sun-blasted clearing into a patch of acacias, followed by Orlando
and Anders Lindgren, a technician whose Swedish firm, Televilt,
manufactured the 10 elephant-sized collars from tough fire-hose
material.
 &HT;    Behind them come Oumar, the Tuareg translator and guide, and
Samake, a uniformed Malian forestry official armed with a
high-powered rifle _ at the government's insistence, he's there to
protect Karesh if an elephant charges.
 &HT;    Karesh ignores him. No matter how dangerous the situation,
Karesh refuses to carry any weapon except his C02 rifle.
 &HT;    A hoarse cough from the bush stops him in his tracks. Then comes
a screaming roar, and everyone instinctively ducks. The first
elephant appears over the stunted treetops 90 feet away, followed
by a half dozen others and an enormous bull.
 &HT;    He trumpets, and at the sound two Tuaregs _ nomads who have
known elephants all their lives _ drop their walking sticks and
take off at a full run.
 &HT;    Karesh sets his feet, calmly raises his rifle and fires at a
medium-sized female, hitting her cleanly in the haunch.
 &HT;    Karesh yells and waves his arms to drive off the other
elephants. The herd melts away and, in the silence, there's a slow
crash as the female topples sideways into a thorn tree, shoving it
over as she falls asleep.
 &HT;    The team swarms over her warm body. She's snoring, and her feet,
big as dinner plates, shake.
 &HT;    Karesh drapes a moist blue cloth over her eyes to protect them
from the sun. He injects the dart wound with a long-lasting
antibiotic normally used to prevent mammary infections in lactating
cows.
 &HT;    Karesh inserts a pulse oximeter into her trunk to check her
heart rate (43) and blood oxygen level (95 percent). She's doing
fine and soon stops twitching.
 &HT;    Orlando begins measuring leg length, shoulder height and tusk
size, trying to estimate the animal's age. Lindgren crouches by the
elephant's head, her breath hot and wet on his face as he drapes an
eight-foot-long, 18-pound collar around her neck and fixes it there
with bolts through grommets.
 &HT;    The radio-tracking collar contains a tiny global positioning
satellite receiver linked to a memory chip. As the elephant moves
about, the collar will record her position in latitude and
longitude every two hours.
 &HT;    Every eight weeks, the collar will transmit the data to a radio
receiver, from which it can be downloaded into a laptop computer.
 &HT;    The computer, fitted with geographical software, can plot the
herd's movements on a map. Orlando can then analyze the travel
patterns of the elephants and assess their needs by plugging in
other variables, such as the location of water holes, the density
of vegetation and the movements of nomads and the goatherd.
 &HT;    The research will help her develop a conservation plan for the
Gourma-region elephants.
 &HT;    Karesh finishes examining the elephant for parasites and wounds
as Orlando measures a front leg.
 &HT;    ``I'd get that quickly,'' he says. ``We don't want her to get
overheated.''
 &HT;    He finds a vein in the elephant's ear and injects the antidote
that will wake her. The elephant shivers.
 &HT;    ``OK, I think it's time to go now,'' Karesh says.
 &HT;    Everyone backs away without taking their eyes off the trembling
elephant.
 &HT;    She's waking quickly, eyelashes fluttering and crushing the tree
beneath her as she tries to get to her feet. She waves her trunk in
the air, staggers erect and stands there dazed, swaying.
 &HT;    Karesh, Orlando and the others continue backing away. The
elephant shuffles, senses strangers, lifts her head and turns to
face them. Her eyes focus.
 &HT;    Karesh yells, ``Get the hell out of here!'' as the elephant
throws a cloud of dust into the air with her trunk and charges.
Karesh is already running. Oumar runs. A cameraman sets down his
lenses and runs.
 &HT;    The uniformed Malian official begins to raise his high-powered
rifle, then lowers it, turns and runs.
 &HT;    Panicked, everyone stumbles through the rough gullies and across
the thorn-strewn clay while the elephant crashes through the trees.
 &HT;    Finally the sound fades as she slows, turns and heads upwind to
join the herd.
 &HT;    Scattered and alone in the cover of thorny bush, people lean on
trees, catch their breath and glance around quickly, hearts
pounding. Karesh shakes his head, recalling what some local
``experts'' had proclaimed.
 &HT;    ``Oh, no, they never charge,'' he says with more than a touch of
irony.
 &HT;    The team doesn't spot a single elephant the rest of the day. In
the evening, Karesh divides the blood into ampoules and labels
them. Normally, he'd do a blood-cell count and then freeze samples
in liquid nitrogen, but a promised consignment of nitrogen hasn't
materialized.
 &HT;    ``This is Africa,'' he says, and shrugs.
 &HT;    He smears blood one cell thick on glass slides to be checked for
immune function and parasites.
 &HT;    Later, in New York, he will compare his data with that of other
scientists who monitor the incidence and spread of wildlife
diseases. More blood goes onto filter paper for genetic and
infectious-disease
 &HT;    Time and again during the research expedition, Karesh gets the
best data he can and keeps the team safe. But his concern about
elephants' unpredictability is not misplaced.
 &HT;    One day, as Oumar's 12-year-old cousin tends the family's sheep
and goats at the edge of the forest, an elephant attacks from
nowhere, crushing the boy's skull and leaving his dismembered body
scattered across the sand.
 &HT;    When Karesh arrives at the family's leather-roofed tent, all he
can do is splint the broken arm and leg of the boy's screaming
4-year-old friend, who was injured in the same attack.
 &HT;    The family shrieks in misery as Karesh hydrates the child and
tries to pull him out of shock before sending him off to what
passes for a hospital hours away across the desert.
 &HT;    For a week, Karesh can barely speak of the incident.
 &HT;    When he finally tells Beard about it, she is stunned _ and
relieved.
 &HT;    ``I'm incredibly sad for the child and the family,'' she says.
``And selfishly, I can't help thinking, `That could have been
Billy.'''

 By JOSIE GLAUSIUSZ 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Trumpeting cherubs peer down from the walls of Budapest's
opulent music academy. As pianist Dezso Ranki pounds at the keys,
his breathing is at times so stertorous one could swear that
someone in the audience is snoring.
 &HT;    But there are no somnolent spectators here. When the final
chords of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in C Major crash out, the
crowd bursts into applause _ at first tumultuously, but then,
suddenly, in perfect unison.
 &HT;    There is no signal, no leader; the synchrony is spontaneous. The
pianist bows, his pageboy hairdo flopping about his solemn face. He
disappears backstage, then returns to applause that grows stronger.
Yet as the clapping gathers strength, its synchrony dissolves.
 &HT;    Ranki retreats and reappears repeatedly, and so does the rhythm
of the applause _ one moment chaotic, the next a perfect beat. Then
without warning the entire audience stops, as one, on a single
clap.
 &HT;    Tamas Vicsek, a physicist at Budapest's Eotvos University,
twists around from his second-row seat and explains. \
 &HT;    ``This synchronized clapping is called `iron' applause in
Hungarian,'' he says. ``There was a time when an iron curtain would
descend after a performance between the stage and the audience,
which would clap rhythmically to induce the conductor or actors to
appear in front of the curtain, through a little door at its
center.''
 &HT;    The iron curtain is gone _ in more ways than one _ from this
country, but the rhythmic applause remains. In fact, it's hardly
unique to the theaters of Budapest: When hockey player Wayne
Gretzky retired from the Rangers, for instance, the crowd at
Madison Square Garden burst into rhythmic applause, and the same
response met Cecilia Bartoli when she sang an aria at the Teatro
Olimpico in Vicenza, Italy.
 &HT;    The reason, Vicsek and his colleagues in the United States and
Romania believe, has as much to do with mathematics as it does with
aesthetics and psychology.
 &HT;    According to Steven Strogatz, a mathematician at Cornell
University who has studied synchronization for 20 years, the same
set of mathematical principles governs the phenomenon wherever it
occurs _ be it among applauding people, flashing fireflies or
roomfuls of grandfather clocks.
 &HT;    Strogatz has been fascinated by synchronization since he
experimented with pendulums in his first science class. Now he
seems to see it wherever he looks.
 &HT;    Asian fireflies flash together each night in the mangrove trees
along a riverbank. Crickets chirp in unison, and cicadas emerge
from the ground at the same moment every 17 years.
 &HT;    The moon rotates around its own axis at exactly the same rate as
it orbits around Earth, which is why one side of the moon is never
seen. Pacemaker cells in the heart oscillate in harmony. There is
even the curious case of menstrual synchrony among women who live
together.
 &HT;    To understand the mechanics of synchrony, Strogatz suggests,
imagine several athletes running around a circular track.
 &HT;    ``Suppose these runners are friends, and they would prefer to
run together so that they can talk,'' he says. ``If their speeds
are not too different _ that is, if the slowest one can keep up
with the fastest one _ then you can get a group of runners all
going in sync. But first, they have to be sensitive to each other.
 &HT;    ``They have to be willing to adjust their speeds from what they
would prefer. The fastest ones have to slow down, and the slowest
ones have to speed up, to find some compromise. And that same
principle _ that slow oscillators have to speed up and fast ones
have to slow down, and that this happens because of mutual
interactions _ is a pretty universal principle for synchrony.''
 &HT;    The interactions, Strogatz adds, can be obvious: The runners see
each other, the clappers hear the other claps.
 &HT;    They can also be subtle. Two grandfather clocks can synchronize
their pendulum swings _ an effect first observed in 1665 by their
inventor, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens _ through
imperceptible vibrations traveling through the wall against which
they both lean.
 &HT;    But the story can also be more complicated than that. Picture,
for example, some crickets living alone in soundproof chambers, as
they did in Strogatz's lab. They can listen to their neighbors'
sounds only when controlled levels of chirping are piped in.
 &HT;    ``If we make the sounds loud enough _ if we let enough of the
chirping sound through _ at some point, there will suddenly be
enough mutual influence that they can synchronize. Below that
point, they can't. This is what physicists call a phase
transition,'' Strogatz says. ``There's a critical amount of
interaction when synchrony will burst out. It doesn't just build up
gradually.''
 &HT;    A similar phase transition lies behind an audience's sudden
switch to synchronized clapping.
 &HT;    ``Say the people are clapping in a disorganized way, but they
all know that they're trying to synchronize,'' Strogatz explains.
``However, they don't hear a beat. But then _ and this is rather
mysterious _ suppose a beat just happens to emerge a little bit,
maybe because a few clappers get lucky. That beat will then be
audible above the din of the disorganized rest of the audience. And
since everyone knows that they're trying to clap in unison, the
cooperative clappers will try to join in with that beat. The pulse
becomes stronger, and then it takes off.''
 &HT;    Eighteen months ago, Tamas Vicsek, together with physicists
Albert-Laszlo Barabasi of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana
and Zoltan Neda of Romania's Babes-Bolyai University in
Cluj-Napoca, set out to probe the dynamics of clapping more
closely.
 &HT;    Neda began the project by suspending microphones from the
ceilings of concert halls in Romania and recording the applause. He
and the other researchers then analyzed the recordings and found a
fairly consistent pattern: several rounds _ up to six or seven _ of
synchronized clapping, interspersed with incoherent cacophony.
Moreover, the periods between claps doubled during synchronization.
 &HT;    To study the process further, Neda and his graduate student
Erzsebet Ravasz asked 73 high-school students to stand alone in a
room and clap quickly, as they would after an outstanding
performance. Then he asked them to clap as if they were
synchronizing with others.
 &HT;    He found that their clapping rates varied quite widely when they
were asked to clap quickly _ between three and five claps per
second _ but when asked to simulate synchrony, most people clapped
at around the same, relatively slow rate: about two claps per
second.
 &HT;    As for the waves of chaotic clapping that interrupt the
synchrony periodically, Barabasi and Vicsek think they're a matter
of crowd psychology. When synchrony sets in, the overall noise of
the applause decreases; when it disappears, the noise level rises.
Synchronization, they conclude, triggers a cozy feeling of
togetherness among audience members, whereas faster clapping feels
more enthusiastic. Conflicting desires swing the clappers between
the two modes.
 &HT;    There was a time, Barabasi adds, when comradeship reigned
supreme in countries such as Hungary and Romania and exuberance had
no place, when swings between synchrony and chaos couldn't be
heard.
 &HT;    At the giant rallies common to Barabasi's childhood in communist
Romania _ a childhood marked by the tyrannical regime of Nicolae
Ceausescu _ audiences applauding the ``great leader'' would clap
monotonously and dutifully in synchrony in response to party
speeches. But there was no enthusiasm to spur their clapping into
disorder. Then one day in late December 1989, the synchronized
applause ended _ abruptly.
 &HT;    ``When Ceausescu was overthrown, he organized a huge rally of
250,000 people in Bucharest to show support for him,'' Barabsi
remembers. ``People were supposed to clap synchronously, and at the
beginning they did. But then the clapping stopped. Some people
threw their banners down, and then the shooting started and the
revolution began.''
 &HT;    Four days later, on Christmas day, Ceausescu was shot dead.

 By JACK McCLINTOCK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    In the cool morning, Oumar the Tuareg guide announces that the
elephants might have arrived at watering holes near the
InAdyatafane oasis, so everyone piles into the Land Rovers to cross
60 miles of hot open desert.
 &HT;    Six hours later, the vehicles lurch to a stop a mile from where
the herd should be. The rest of the distance must be covered on
foot to keep from spooking the elephants.
 &HT;    Wildlife veterinarian Billy Karesh carefully screws the barrel
of his rifle into its stock and drops two fully charged anesthetic
darts into the pocket of his cargo pants.
 &HT;    He strides briskly across a desert landscape _ his senses on
full alert. A six-ton pachyderm could be just feet away.
 &HT;    ``It's easy to walk up on them by accident in the thorn scrub,''
he says. ``I don't want to encourage anybody to get close to these
elephants. It's very possible a human could die in this.''
 &HT;    The elephants Karesh hopes to track fatten themselves during the
rainy season in the lush countryside of Burkina Faso, 100 miles
south of here. When the vegetation withers in October, they wander
north to these few reliable water holes in the Gourma region just
south of Timbuktu, in Mali. It's the longest elephant migration in
Africa _ a 600-mile round trip.
 &HT;    To outsiders, the herd remains virtually unknown, but recently,
as the advancing Sahara has eroded the elephants' habitat and
nomads-turned-farmers have seized more of it to grow crops,

the evening, Karesh divides the blood into ampoules and labels
them. Normally, he'd do a blood-cell count and then freeze samples
in liquid nitrogen, but a promised consignment of nitrogen hasn't
materialized.
 &HT;    ``This is Africa,'' he says, and shrugs.
 &HT;    He smears blood one cell thick on glass slides to be checked for
immune function and parasites.
 &HT;    Later, in New York, he will compare his data with that of other
scientists who monitor the incidence and spread of wildlife
diseases. More blood goes onto filter paper for genetic and
infectious-disease
 &HT;    Time and again during the research expedition, Karesh gets the
best data he can and keeps the team safe. But his concern about
elephants' unpredictability is not misplaced.
 &HT;    One day, as Oumar's 12-year-old cousin tends the family's sheep
and goats at the edge of the forest, an elephant attacks from
nowhere, crushing the boy's skull and leaving his dismembered body
scattered across the sand.
 &HT;    When Karesh arrives at the family's leather-roofed tent, all he
can do is splint the broken arm and leg of the boy's screaming
4-year-old friend, who was injured in the same attack.
 &HT;    The family shrieks in misery as Karesh hydrates the child and
tries to pull him out of shock before sending him off to what
passes for a hospital hours away across the desert.
 &HT;    For a week, Karesh can barely speak of the incident.
 &HT;    When he finally tells Beard about it, she is stunned _ and
relieved.
 &HT;    ``I'm incredibly sad for the child and the family,'' she says.
``And selfishly, I can't help thinking, `That could have been
Billy.'''

&HT;     TECHNOLOGY COULD CRACK A WATERGATE MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Twenty-six years after President Richard Nixon
resigned in disgrace, an elite team of electronics specialists will
meet to discuss whether science can unravel one of the biggest
mysteries of the Watergate era: What is on the baffling 18
1/2-minute gap on one of Nixon's White House audiotapes?
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 21, these specialists will gather in College Park, Md.,
at the request of the National Archives, to consider whether new
technologies can resolve mysteries of the 1970s Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers want to know if it is possible to recover any of
the erased sounds on the tape, possibly shedding light on Nixon's
activities and state of mind as his presidency crumbled in the
aftermath of the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the (Watergate) tape recordings were poor quality.
The microphones were hidden in the president's office and other
places, so we don't always have the best sound,'' said Susan
Cooper, spokeswoman for the National Archives, which is responsible
for maintaining federal historical records, including the
Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason the Watergate tapes are so hard to hear is
because they are so cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were purchased by the Secret Service at a local drugstore
across from the White House,'' Cooper said. ``They weren't meant to
be kept for posterity; They were meant for the president's personal
use in writing his memoirs.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest shocks of the Watergate scandal came in 1973,
when a former Nixon White House official, Alexander Butterfield,
told a congressional committee about the president's secret
audiotape network in his White House office.
</P>
<P>
   A battle ensued for the tapes, which might have revealed what
Nixon and his aides were up to before and during Watergate, which
involved accusations of break-ins, payoffs, cover-ups and other
misdeeds by White House employees.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon fought attempts to release copies of the tapes. But in the
summer of 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ordered him to
do so. He complied, and resigned several days later, on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Long before then, investigators had learned that one of the
tapes contained the 18 1/2-minute gap. Nixon's secretary, Rose Mary
Woods, admitted erasing part of that section of the tape.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, experts tried unsuccessfully to extract
intelligible sounds from the erased section.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, technologies for tape analysis have improved
greatly. That is why the National Archives is assembling the expert
panel, whose names are confidential for now, to see whether
prospects today are better.
</P>
<P>
   If so, National Archives officials will face a far tougher
question: Should they actually turn over the tape to the scientists
for study?
</P>
<P>
   The Watergate tapes are so delicate that they are kept in a
frigid room in the National Archives office in College Park, a
Washington suburb. The chill lessens the risk of damage due to heat
and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most promising technologies is called a
magnetoresistive microscope. By mapping magnetic-field variations
on audiotapes and computer disk drives, the gadget can detect
evidence of tampering. It can also recover some erased information.
</P>
<P>
   Before the work can be done, however, officials must be sure the
technology cannot damage the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said that talk of a re-analysis of the tapes is
``extremely preliminary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first commitment, our first priority,'' Cooper said, ``is
to make sure we preserve that tape. . . . As I'm sure you can
appreciate, we have to take this very slowly. This (tape) is an
artifact with high intrinsic value. And we're not going to subject
it to any and all technologies just for the love of science. We
have to be very careful how we proceed.''

PUTTING ALL OF YOUR FINANCIAL STUFF IN ONE PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of people still get jittery at the thought of giving
credit-card numbers or bank-account information to Web sites. They
imagine, with some justification, the nastiness cyber-thieves could
inflict on their personal finances.
</P>
<P>
   I am not one of those people.
</P>
<P>
   For me, any online service that saves time or simplifies my life
is a good service. Laziness, in other words, trumps caution.
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing in Web finance promises to get both Nervous
Nellies and folks like me excited, if for very different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   So-called aggregation services put all of a person's financial
information on a single Internet site behind a single password.
Using a process known as ``screen scraping,'' they log on to all of
your financial accounts, often nightly, and download the
information to a central place.
</P>
<P>
   The services might, for example, spider through your various
mutual funds, checking and savings accounts, frequent-flier
accounts, and even credit-card statements. The idea is to list your
account balances and recent transactions on a single, personalized
Web page.
</P>
<P>
   That strikes me as a great way to save time and energy, but it
also raises significant privacy questions and creates a galaxy of
juicy targets for would-be identity thieves.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, security concerns wildly outweigh concerns over
privacy,'' said Octavio Marenzi, an analyst with Celent
Communications. ``But (aggregators) are just so convenient that
we're seeing the number of users grow 10 to 15 percent per week.''
</P>
<P>
   Unheard of a year ago, aggregation sites now number more than
two dozen. Between 400,000 and 500,000 Americans use them already,
and a recent Celent study forecasts 7 million regular users by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   That prediction, though, came before Chase Manhattan Bank
announced last month it was teaming up with Yodlee.com to offer
all-in-one-place service to its 30 million online customers. Other
banks and brokerages will almost certainly announce similar
ventures in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a natural progression of financial services
online,'' said Jaime Punishill, an analyst at Forrester Research in
Cambridge. ``The first stage involved basic transactions, the next
is bringing all your accounts together in one location.''
</P>
<P>
   And here's the best part: Most of the sites are free, at least
for now. Financial institutions such as Chase Manhattan pay the
freight to give their clients access to the networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a valuable service for people whose Internet lives have
become very complicated,'' Marenzi said. ``Remembering all those
passwords and taking time to visit all those sites is a problem for
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for critics is that you have to give aggregators
your account names and passwords for the process to work. That
alarms privacy advocates, who don't like the thought of giving one
company access to your entire financial life, and security pros,
who worry that hackers will someday gain access to financial
dossiers on millions of unsuspecting people.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to those concerns, aggregators have begun to partner with
old-line financial companies rather than market themselves directly
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Early adopters, Marenzi said, primarily came to the services
through Web portals such as Lycos. But most future customers, he
said, are likely to stumble across aggregators by going through
another institution, such as Chase Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage is that customers already trust banks, brokerages,
and insurance companies with their money. Those institutions also
have the resources to cover their customers in the event of cyber
theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of amazing that anybody would go to a company named
Yodlee and put information about their life's savings there for the
taking,'' Marenzi said. ``That is going to be incomprehensible to
many people, but those same people might be perfectly happy to use
Yodlee's service through their bank.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry is also starting to grow and mature in ways other
than distribution.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of aggregators are developing services that allow
customers to analyze their combined accounts and, eventually, make
changes as needed. Others are beginning to aggregate information
for the benefit of specific, niche audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Woburn-based ByAllAccounts.com, which launched its aggregation
service this week, is doing both. It specifically targets investors
who want to analyze their far-flung holdings, comparing them
against model portfolios using factors such as risk and
diversification.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't sign up for ByAllAccount's WebPortfolio service at
the company's Web site. It will be available, said chief executive
L. Patrick Gardner, only through financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to try an aggregator on your own, a handful of
others let you sign up directly:
</P>
<P>
   --www.yodlee.com is the early leader in the industry. It offers
to pull information from a wide range of services, not all related
to money.
</P>
<P>
   Yodlee, which pulled its name from a Hindi song with the phrase
``Yahoo, Junglee, Yodlee,'' aggregates financial accounts, e-mail,
news, and frequent-flier programs, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't show transaction histories, though, and has
relatively few tools for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   --www.ebalance.com doesn't aggregate information from as many
sites as Yodlee, but it offers more in the way of investment
research and tools. You can, for example, record and categorize
transactions, use financial calculators, and be alerted to analyst
changes in stocks you follow.
</P>
<P>
   --www.1ViewNetwork.com also focuses more on investors than a
general audience. As added bonuses, it allows you to download your
information to Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (so you can sort the
numbers as you see fit) and give financial advisers access to the
numbers (so they can make recommendations).
</P>
<P>
   If you like, it will also send you e-mail notes when account
balances run low or stocks you monitor hit predetermined prices.
</P>
<P>
   --www.ezlogin.com is more of a bare-bones aggregation site, with
no transaction history and only a handful of tools. You can,
though, set up multiple profiles, in case you want to look at
things differently at different times.
</P>
<P>
   --www.GainsKeeper.com is a different animal entirely.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, it's not free. After a 30-day trial period, you'll
have to pay $35 to $199 annually for a membership, depending on how
active an investor you are.
</P>
<P>
   Also unlike the other aggregators, GainsKeeper is geared
specifically to simplifying investors' tax lives. It tracks
purchases, sales, splits, and mergers, in addition to pulling all
of your brokerage accounts and mutual funds together in a central
location.

GOLD LUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Gold!
</P>
<P>
   The word, the metal, and the prospect of unfathomable wealth has
bewitched man since he learned to count, and bewitches him still
even in this age of plastic and paper.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Peter Bernstein is so interesting _ he has peered
into the heart of avarice and tells the story of human nature at
its worst in his book ``The Power of Gold: The History of an
Obsession,'' to be published by John Wiley &AMP; Sons, Inc. this fall.
</P>
<P>
   He calls himself ``the old man of Wall Street,'' which is pretty
accurate since he went into the investment business after
graduating from Harvard in 1940. He now runs an economic consulting
firm in New York and publishes a twice-monthly newsletter called
``Economics and Portfolio Strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   But he could pass for a psychologist, given his exploration of
human risk in his bestseller ``Against the Gods.'' He followed that
project with the gold book because ``I always hated gold and gold
bugs and the Gnomes of Zurich, and the gold standard.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a wry, contrary Solomon, judging the evil and the
ridiculous exploits of man chasing a metal through the ages. He
tweaks a person's lust for the stuff even as he deplores it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gold is a very powerful symbol and has shaped much of human
history,'' he says in an interview. ``It represents eternity
because it is so unchanging. Every other thing we have has a much
more finite existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that all the gold ever mined is still on the earth, he
chuckles and says, ``The gold in your earring or wedding ring might
have come from Hatshepsut's column.'' He refers to the Egyptian
queen whose love of gold was so great that she used to decorate her
face with a gold and silver dust. She built two giant pillars
peaked with gold as monuments to the god Amon Re.
</P>
<P>
   Having a piece of Hatshepsut's rock is a compelling, if
unlikely, notion in 2000, when gold is still a status symbol, if
only a decorative one. While no longer the coin of the realm, or a
serious investment, it sends a powerful message across many a board
room, glinting from the Rolexes of politically savvy wrists.
</P>
<P>
   Chains, pins, bracelets, and pierced body parts make their
14-and-24-carat statements, advertising that a person has cachet
and cool. Plumbing fixtures, cabinet knobs, lamps, and wallpaper
with gold threads speak of gravitas in home fashion. Chi-chi
restaurants sprinkle gold dust on their overpriced entrees, while
some designers even weave it into clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Gold glitters through myth and fairy tale, ever firing the
imagination _ Rumpelstiltskin, King Midas, Jason and the Golden
Fleece, the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the goose that
laid the golden eggs, and the stories of yellowed maps leading to
buried pirate treasures. The old movie ``Solid Gold Cadillac''
lives in a lot of car fantasies, while the theme from the movie
``Goldfinger'' is a classic, calling up the image of James Bond's
beautifully dead girlfriend, painted head to toe with gold paint.
</P>
<P>
   History has its own parade of factual horribles: Crassus, the
wealthy Roman military leader executed by having molten gold poured
down his throat; Atahualpa, the Inca emperor, murdered in a room
surrounded by his gold after Pizarro's troops plundered the
kingdom; the human misery in the African gold mines where slaves
worked, lying on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   The story of gold is full of irony with the reluctant Johann
Sutter wanting nothing more than a nice grist mill out of life, and
cursing his big discovery. There is Charles de Gaulle, attempting
to rally the world to the gold standard to glorify France and
cripple the dollar, and then seeing his own country sink into
economic chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were fools for gold, too, having a love/hate
relationship with it throughout the 20th century. The craziness
reached its zenith in 1980 when speculators drove the price of gold
to $850 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   And then poof.
</P>
<P>
   Now, here we are at the start of a millennium with the dollar
and the stock market ruling our world, and gold fever under
control, more or less, give or take a few extravagances. Are we OK,
Peter Bernstein? Or will the spell take us beyond baubles and into
ruin once again?
</P>
<P>
   ``No monetary system has ever been permanent,'' he says. ``They
all have feet of clay. And looking ahead, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom worth its weight in gold.

FIXING AFRICA _ IN OUR MINDS, FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Woe, woe is Africa.
</P>
<P>
   There is the corruption and the revolution, to say nothing of
the obvious and onerous legacy of the colonial centuries,
compounded by decades in which Africa's nations were, in the truest
sense, pawns in the Cold War chess match. There is AIDS, on the
scale of a Middle Ages plague, and, of course, there is famine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the continent is such a huge mess that voices on the
political right are suggesting a new round of colonialism _ of
benign and humanitarian intent, to be sure _ as the only way to get
the African nations moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   George B. N. Ayittey, a Ghanaian and economics professor whose
columns appear on the op-ed page of The Wall Street Journal, writes
that it may be time for the establishment of ``free economic
zones'' in select African countries that would lure businesses with
tax breaks and waivers on duties. In exchange, the host governments
would essentially give up sovereignty in significant portions of
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Governments unenthusiastic about trading territory for the
promise of foreign assistance likely could be persuaded to give up
``say, 30 square miles . . . for, say, 20 years'' in return for
forgiveness of part of their vast international debt, Ayittey
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds a lot like what the Western powers did in China in the
19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Others stand ready to go considerably farther.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I)t's time we revisited the notion of a new kind of
colonialism _ though we shouldn't call it that,'' writes Jonah
Goldberg, an editor at National Review Inline, asserting that the
United States ought to be ``going in _ guns blazing if necessary _
for truth and justice. . . . The United States should mount a
serious effort to bring civilization (yes, ``Civilization'') to
those parts of Africa that are in Hobbesian despair.''
</P>
<P>
   Hage Geingud, the prime minister of Namibia, has a one-word
description for what he believes is at the root of such proposals:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ignorance,'' Geingud says. ``They maybe really think Africa is
hapless, they maybe really think that Africa is lost. Had they been
informed, I think they wouldn't have come to such a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   But decades of effort to establish an understanding,
appreciation, and affinity for Africa among Americans have not made
much progress, many scholars and educators say; the dominant view
of Africa in this country remains rooted in Tarzan films and the
writings of adventurers and journalists the likes of Henry Morton
Stanley and Joseph Conrad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The white American cultural self-image is strongly reaffirmed
in Tarzan movies, while Africa is a blank slate for them to project
unfavorable images of the opposite of themselves _ wall-to-wall
incompetence, disorder, and danger,'' says James Lorand Matory, an
Africanist and professor of anthropology at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Lesego Malepe, a South African professor of African politics at
Wheaton College, says the American tendency to view Africa as an
undifferentiated mass also springs from the country's experience
with slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped to partially justify such a horrible thing as
slavery, to portray the places the slaves were coming from as very
dark and uncivilized,'' Malepe says. ``So there was this idea that
slaves were from Africa, not from a country or a tribe. The first
problem is getting people to think of Africa as a continent, not a
country.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 54 nations in Africa, some of which _ like Namibia,
the last colony, and Eritrea, which was moshed into Ethiopia by the
United Nations _ have gained independence only in the last decade.
Almost none was independent before World War II. About 15 have
governance that is substantially democratic. About 10 are the scene
of armed conflict either internally or with neighbors. Politically,
culturally, and economically, these nations are in tremendously
varied states of becoming.
</P>
<P>
   But ``what similarities exist between Botswana and Liberia?''
says Malepe. ``Really, very little.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason Americans do not appreciate the diversity found among
African countries is that, unlike Europe and Asia, there is no
clear reason for Americans to focus on Africa. For while many in
the United States can trace their ancestors to England, or Italy,
or Germany for instance, the institution of slavery destroyed most
black Americans' chances of ever tracing their roots to Senegal, or
Congo, or Nigeria. And while most Americans who are aware of the
waves of technology and globalization transforming the world
understand keenly some of the differences between, say, China and
Japan, movement toward postindustrial, information-based societies
has reduced the importance of knowing which nations produce copper
and which gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are places that are highly differentiated because they
are very important to the geopolitical interests of US political
elites, US capitalist elites, and journalists who spend their time
talking with government officials, and following the course of
economic negotiations and developments,'' Matory says. But ``there
is not all that much difference among US political and economic
interests toward sub-Saharan African countries, except South
Africa. That is why South Africa is talked of as a country, while
the rest of sub-Saharan Africa is lumped together, and Arab Africa
is lumped together as part of the Middle East. Most Americans
wouldn't know the difference between Iran and Libya either.''
</P>
<P>
   A colloquialism often heard in Washington about why African
nations do not have high profiles in US policy or media goes like
this: They are no threat to us, they don't make anything we need,
and they are not a top priority for African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Brown, a Bunting Fellow at Radcliffe who works on
Africa-related education programs through Boston University's
Center for African Studies, says that though some African Americans
take pride in the kingdoms, cultures, and music of Africa, young
students ``whether second graders or tenth graders, arrive in class
thinking Africa is yukky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers tell me African American students feel uncomfortable
about Africa,'' Brown said. ``They see Africa as failed, and are
uncomfortable with the association.''
</P>
<P>
   Among students, ordinary citizens, and perhaps pundits too,
``there is a naive and incorrect assumption that Africans have been
running the show in Africa since independence, and that is just not
the case,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say Africa needs to be recolonized or taken over by the
West ignores the fact that the West has been one of the major
players'' all along. ``We kept Mobutu (Sese Seko of Zaire) in power
for years. We kept (South Africa's racist system of) apartheid in
power, along with local interests. We helped overthrow the
government in Uganda. We have never not intervened in Africa . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   But intervention of a far deeper variety is what the proponents
of a new neo-colonialism have in mind.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ayittey suggests that American aid be made
contingent on a country having a strong central bank, and
independent media, courts, and security forces.
</P>
<P>
   In some nations, even that medicine would be too mild. In a
recent Journal column, he proposed that the United Nations simply
take over war-torn Sierra Leone, spend whatever was needed to clean
out the country's twin scourges _ warlords and economic locusts _
and sell off as much of the country's diamond deposits as necessary
to cover the tab.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, advocates of a new colonialism reject the
proposal _ espoused by a forces ranging from Pope John Paul II to
President Clinton to the recent World Bank-International Monetary
Fund protesters _ to forgive African nations' probably
forever-unpayable debt burden.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, perhaps the real first problem has much more to do
with the United States than with the continent of Africa or its
nations. Among both Africanists and conservative pundits, there are
those who feel the US is fumbling for a grand-enough project for
its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``American policymaking is still reeling from the absence of the
Cold War, from its inability to define national interest and
strategy,'' Malepe says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems foreign policy is up for grabs,'' writes the National
Review's Goldberg. ``The internationalist Right has some good
rhetoric . . . but they are hard-pressed to lose their Cold War
baggage. Spending billions and spilling American blood in Africa
``would be imperial . . . French writers would break their pencils
in defiance . . . Kofi Annan would need a pacemaker. Pat Buchanan
would move to Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he concludes, citing the British Empire's efforts against
slavery, ``being imperial is not necessarily a bad thing.''

WARY PARENTS USING CAMERAS, CRIMINAL CHECKS ON CAREGIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some parents insist on reviewing criminal records, even of
part-time baby sitters. Some want a constant eye, choosing day care
centers with Web video cameras. Others go to the extreme of
declaring they would never hire a man to baby-sit, saying data show
sexual predators are overwhelmingly male.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's discrimination. I feel awful saying it,'' said Kim
Arnold, a 34-year-old mother of a toddler. ``But I go with females.
All the statistics show that sexual abusers are usually men.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioning their knack for judging others, parents more than
ever are seeking the power of raw information to assess the adults
in their children's lives. Gut instinct _ that mixture of visual
and verbal cues that create impressions _ hasn't been abandoned,
but is viewed as far less foolproof as a way to screen caretakers,
coaches, and counselors.
</P>
<P>
   In this highly mobile and diverse society, parents say it's hard
to get credible information about a person's trustworthiness. And
with so many working parents and children in a flurry of
activities, parents depend on unknown adults more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relying on intuition, worried parents have fueled a
sevenfold increase in the number of criminal background checks of
child-care applicants processed by the state since 1973. Many also
ask for repeat interviews of child-care workers and engage in
exhaustive reference checks.
</P>
<P>
   Others have a modified-avoidance strategy. Julie Puncochar, a
mother of two, said she now works part-time as a pediatrician,
cutting back her hours in part because she couldn't bear the
anxiety that comes with full-time child-care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel relieved of the burden,'' she said. ``If there's
full-time care, there seems a greater chance that something could
be amiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually the likelihood that a child could fall victim to child
abuse appears to be low. State figures show there was a 1 in 5,000
chance last year that a child would be abused by a non-family
caretaker, such as a child-care worker, teacher, or youth counselor
_ similar to the odds that a person would die in an auto accident
in a given year.
</P>
<P>
   The odds that a relative would abuse a child physically or
sexually was about 50 times higher, according to state figures on
substantiated abuse cases in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents and child-abuse specialists suspect the rate of
abuse is actually far higher; others are sure it's not as bad as it
seems. Regardless, many parents try to fall somewhere between being
obsessive and oblivious, then work for better ways to navigate the
world of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Given wide publicity of many notorious child-abuse cases,
parents have long had an eroding sense of confidence in their
ability to judge trustworthiness. And it may have hit an all-time
low recently with allegations about Christopher Reardon in
Middleton, Mass. If this newlywed youth minister and camp leader
who grew up in a well-respected local family is the sexual predator
he is charged as being, who among us couldn't be fooled?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've become less trusting over time,'' said Linda Post, a
Westwood bond trader and a mother of a 7-year-old boy. ``You hear
so many bad things happening. There's always anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioning our gut instincts may be a good thing, say some
psychologists, because people so often allow wishful thinking to
sweeten their impression of people. They said people are often
unconsciously affected by looks, such as adult faces with
child-like features are often viewed as more trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As human beings, we're easily duped,'' said Colgate University
psychology professor Caroline Keating, who specializes in the study
of deception. ``We have a truth bias. We see what we already
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists say gut instincts, while still important, are
often influenced by mistaken impressions. Some parents assume
sexual predators or physical abusers will have telltale signs, like
shifty eyes or disheveled clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think we should have a preconceived idea of what a
pedophile looks like. Or what mentally ill people look like. We
don't always know,'' said Elizabeth Childs, a child psychiatrist
who recently hired a part-time nanny to watch her infant.
</P>
<P>
   While some specialists in nonverbal behavior say people who
avoid direct eye contact may be lying, others say these cues are
worthless. Colgate researcher Keating conducted a study showing
adults have only a slightly better than 50-50 chance of
distinguishing between video footage of someone lying or telling
the truth, odds that she noted were ``only slightly better than a
flip of the coin.''
</P>
<P>
   She ran studies showing people often let visual signs lead them
astray. For instance, adults with baby-like faces, such as large
eyes, long lashes, smooth skin and soft chins, are often viewed as
more trustworthy than others.
</P>
<P>
   During President Clinton's sex scandal, Keating showed pictures
of his face with digitized distortions. The ones that made him look
more child-like were viewed as more trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of confidence in gut instinct is why some parents
devise their own play-it-safe strategies, including the no-male
hiring policy for babysitters. Even the past president of the
Massachusetts Psychiatric Society, Jerome Rogoff, recently said,
given the choices of two equally good candidates, one male and one
female, to baby-sit a hypothetical grandchild, he would choose the
female.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys are more likely to offend sexually and violently,'' he
said, referring to statistics that do show that more than 90
percent of those arrested for sexual crimes are men.
</P>
<P>
   On this point, others offer a different view. William Pollack, a
clinical psychologist and author of ``Real Boys,'' a book about boy
development, concedes that men are the perpetrators of most sexual
crimes. But, he said, parents must remember the benefit of having
male role models for children.
</P>
<P>
   Child-care specialists and psychologists say if parents have the
time and know-how to ask the right questions, they can expand their
odds for finding trusting adults.
</P>
<P>
   While specialists say parents shouldn't abandon their
intuitions, they emphasize that dispassionate information-gathering
is a good thing. They say collecting as much information on a
caretaker's personal history is key, making sure the pieces all fit
and there are not any strange gaps in a resume.
</P>
<P>
   Some child psychologists said it's important to make sure a
caretaker's interest in children reflects a mature decision, not
that they are child-like themselves and want to exist in a world of
emotional peers. They also say parents should worry about
caretakers who want to spend a lot of time alone with a child, when
their activities would normally put them in groups.
</P>
<P>
   Child-care agencies have also detected that parents feel a
slipping sense of resolve about their own intuition, often asking
for repeat face-to-face interviews. They said criminal background
checks, even of part-time babysitters, is standard industry
practice, even though it was a rarity a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Morrison, 36, said she chose a day care center with Web
video cameras so she could get firsthand information about her
son's day. She said she believes day-care workers under
surveillance will be on the best behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing the cameras are there will deter them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most parents say that, while they aggressively seek out new
information, they know a risk-free world for children is impossible
and trying to create one would be tantamount to locking the doors
and living in a prison.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Lamkin, a Middleton neighbor of Reardon, said many local
parents like him thought Reardon was a kind man who was dedicated
to youth. Despite his sense of betrayal, Lamkin said parents like
him have to find way to tolerate the risks involved in raising
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to live your life,'' he said.

NEW TACTICS SHIFT SENTIMENT ON ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Right to Life Committee's campaign to
outlaw what it calls ``partial-birth'' abortions got derailed in
the US Supreme Court last month. But the antiabortion movement's
larger strategy _ to shape and sway public opinion against abortion
rights via graphic debate has not lost ground. In fact, it is
solidly on track.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are not as sure about abortion rights as they were a
decade ago. According to a Los Angeles Times poll conducted last
month, 43 percent of those surveyed said they supported Roe v.
Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.
That's down from 56 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Just as significant in the Times poll is the finding that 65
percent of the respondents, and 72 percent of women, believe
abortions should not be available in the second trimester (the 13th
through the 26th week) of pregnancy. Asked if abortion should be
severely restricted _ that is, legal only in in cases of rape,
incest, and to save the mother's life _ 46 percent said yes. On
either side of that position, 43 percent said abortion should be
``always legal,'' and 8 percent said it should be ``always
illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   The erosion of support for legal abortion coincides almost
exactly with a repositioning in the early 1990s of
antiabortion-rights forces away from an all-out assault on Roe,
which had failed, to more calculated attacks on certain abortion
methods and on the point in pregnancy when the procedure takes
place.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, antiabortion-rights groups began to dramatize and
demonize a relatively rare, gruesome-sounding second-trimester
procedure known in medical terms as ``dilation and extraction,'' or
D&AMP;X. Instead of dismembering the fetus in the womb (the more common
``dilation and evacuation'' abortion technique) a physician
performing a D&AMP;X pulls the fetus, intact and up to its head, into
the birth canal. Because the head is too large to pass through an
undilated cervix, the doctor uses an instrument to collapse the
skull and remove its contents.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion doctors prefer other methods but use D&AMP;X when the
health of the mother warrants it. In cases in which the fetus is
found to be severely deformed, for example, a D&AMP;X can be the
preferred prodecure.
</P>
<P>
   Antiabortion-rights activists created an attention-getting, less
clinical name for D&AMP;X _ ``partial-birth abortion'' _ and they did
not correct the media for calling it a late-term procedure, even
though it is performed most often to abort nonviable fetuses in the
12th to 24th week of gestation.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did antiabortion-rights activists object when politicians,
sensing voter disgust with a procedure being portrayed as
infanticide, pushed through bans of the procedure in 30 states.
Abortion-rights advocates, convinced their foes' strategy was to
end abortion by restricting access to it, could not wait for the
Supreme Court to put one of these laws to Roe's constitutional
test.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was the swing vote on June 28 when,
in Stenberg v. Carhart, the court struck down the state of
Nebraska's ban on that abortion method. The ban might have passed
constitutional muster if it applied specifically to the D&AMP;X method
and made an exception in cases where a woman's health was at risk,
O'Connor said. Instead, the language was so vague that it
potentially banned most procedures for second-trimester abortions,
which are allowed under Roe, and put an ``undue burden'' on a
woman, restricting her right to choose to end her pregnancy before
the fetus is viable, O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's opinion was consistent with the high court's two key
abortion precedents: Roe, which gave women the constitutional right
to have an abortion, and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.
Casey, a 1992 decision that held states cannot put ``substantial
obstacles'' in the path of a woman exercising that right.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia's dissent in Stenberg was out of sync
with court precedent but perhaps more in step with the country's
moral climate when he wrote that ``the method of killing a human
child _ one cannot even accurately say an entirely unborn human
child _ proscribed by (Nebraska's) statute is so horrible that the
most clinical description of it evokes a shudder of revulsion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that the Constitution of the United States,
designed, among other things, `to establish justice, insure
domestic tranquility . . . and secure blessings of liberty to
ourselves and our posterity' prohibits the state from simply
banning this visibly brutal means of eliminating our half-born
posterity is quite simply absurd,'' Scalia wrote. ``If only for the
sake of its own preservation, the court should return this matter
to the people and let them decide, state by state, whether this
practice should be allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the closeness of the vote assures that abortion
will be on the agenda in the fall presidential campaign; the next
president's Supreme Court nominations could reverse the court's
balance on the issue. And far from giving up the legislative fight,
abortion rights opponents believe Congress will send a bill banning
D&AMP;X-method abortions to President Clinton, who twice has vetoed
similar measures, right before the November election.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom holds that because of strong public
support for keeping abortions legal, Vice President Al Gore, who
supports abortion rights, benefits if the issue gains altitude in
his contest with Texas Governor George W. Bush, who opposes
abortion rights. But conventional wisdom may be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If the polls are any guide, Americans want restrictions on
abortion. According to the Los Angeles Times poll, which has a
sampling error of plus or minus 2 percent, 49 percent of those
surveyed believe women should have the consent of the biological
father before an abortion, and 82 percent say girls under 18 should
have the permission of a parent. A majority oppose public money
being used to pay for abortions for poor women; 85 percent believe
women should be allowed abortions if their physical health is at
risk, but fewer _ 54 percent _ would permit abortions when the
woman's emotional health is seriously endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmingly, women in the poll support abortion in cases of
rape and incest, but oppose it after the first trimester of
pregnancy. Their conflicting values also show up when 61 percent of
women say abortion is murder and 68 percent say abortion would not
be an option for them; at the same time, they feel the abortion
decision should be private, made by a woman and her doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Karlyn Bowman, a researcher at the American Enterprise
Institute, has detected a shift in public attitudes against
abortion, and she attributes it to three things. One is the debate
over the D&AMP;X method; a second is the widespread use of precision
sonography that gives pregnant women a clearer picture of fetal
development; and a third is the trend to delay childbearing. ``It's
been suggested that as older couples experience problems with
conception, they have more of a sense of the preciousness of
life,'' Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation is that many Americans, including a
generation born after the Roe decision, simply do not understand
that the landmark ruling left room for states to limit access to
abortion. Roe is not an abortion license; the Supreme Court has
ruled that states can impose restrictions, including
parental-notification rules, 24-hour waiting periods, and bans on
third-trimester abortions, when the fetus is viable. And states
have done just that; in many regions, access to abortion is
difficult, at some distance away, or for other reasons, nearly
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opponents have framed the debate to make people believe you
can't have restrictions on abortion without overturning Roe, and
that has caused public opinion to shift against Roe,'' said Bob
Blendon, a professor of health policy at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion and complex emotions make abortion dangerous turf
for the presidential candidates. Bush, who opposes abortion except
in cases of rape, incest, and the mother's health and supports
banning the D&AMP;X method, has won the National Right to Life
Committee's endorsement. But he is being careful not to sound too
strident to married, suburban women who do not want all abortions
outlawed. Gore is more assertive about his support for abortion
rights, but his vow to appoint justices who will uphold Roe could
turn off voters who believe the Supreme Court already has veered
too far in protecting the right to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, more than 60 percent of those surveyed by the Los
Angeles Times said they did not know the presidential candidates'
positions on abortion. Once they do, it could have consequences,
since 31 percent of men and 37 percent of women said they would
switch their vote to the candidate who shares their views.

AFTER TRAGEDY, COUPLE NEEDS TO DIVERSIFY INVESTMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. Tragedy struck, and we had to liquidate all assets to pay
off huge medical bills. This included our home, our savings, the
cash value of insurance policies, and our retirement plans. So we
are starting over.
</P>
<P>
   I will probably never be able to work again. After being laid
off, my husband has a new job and became eligible for the 401(k) in
April, and he anticipates a bonus this year.
</P>
<P>
   An inheritance let us put $13,000 in a CD, which we treat as our
emergency fund. After paying off $2,000 of the medical bills each
month, there is nothing left.
</P>
<P>
   Where should we invest? Clearly, we have very little time to buy
a house and save for retirement. Have we selected the right 401(k)
funds? After the medical debt is paid off, where should we invest?
We are frugal people and committed to investing as much as
possible. Should we lower the amount we are paying on the debt and
begin investing now? Should I start an IRA, even though we would
not qualify for a deduction?
</P>
<P>
   G.A., Eugene, Ore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Please accept my consolations. It will be a long road back,
but you sound like the kind of people who rise to challenges.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, your retirement savings are going into the
401(k), so let's start there. Although you use five funds, they all
focus on large-cap domestic stocks. That, of course, has been the
place to be recently, but it's a poor long-term strategy.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you add positions representing 10 percent of the
portfolio in two of the other options that would broaden your
market diversification: the Principal Mid-Cap Index and Fidelity
Overseas funds. I would do this by reducing the American Century
Ultra holding to 20 percent, cutting the two Fidelity offerings to
15 percent, and cutting the Principal Large-Cap Index position to
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   My instinct, given the current market, would be to stick with
the 401(k) contributions and your current course of paying off the
medical bills as quickly as you can. The prospects for general
market gains in excess of 10 percent a year are pretty dim over the
course of the next 16 months, and paying off the medical bills
strikes me as a much more certain proposition. At that point you
could both begin Roth IRAs, which would eventually provide you with
tax-free income in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   As for investing after you the medical bills are paid off, I
suggest a portfolio made up mostly of Vanguard Index funds plus the
Vanguard Health Care fund. The latter, since it has the highest
potential for gain, would be the appropriate investment for the
Roth IRA accounts _ and of course you know from your own experience
the way the health care industry can generate
</P>
<P>
   profits.
</P>
<P>
   As for the balance, I would put 50 percent in Vanguard Index
500, 20 percent each in Vanguards Mid-Cap Index and Small-Cap Index
funds, and 10 percent in Vanguard International Growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Recently, my company was bought by another. I don't know how
good the new company is. I would like to take my money out of my
401(k) and invest in other financial ventures. Would you recommend
any other financial institution?
</P>
<P>
   V.T., Fountain Valley, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The trick is not to take money out, but to transfer it. If
you just take the money out of your 401(k), that would amount to a
withdrawal, and that amount would be added to your taxable income
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   What you can do with no short-term tax consequences is to move
the money into a rollover IRA. Have the new company that you will
be doing business with present the paperwork directly to the
managers of your old company's 401(k) plan, who will then send the
funds to your new institution.
</P>
<P>
   You could easily replicate your current portfolio at Vanguard by
taking a 20 percent position in Vanguard's Total Bond Market Index
fund, 30 percent in Vanguard Balanced Index fund, 30 percent in
Vanguard Index 500, and 20 percent in Vanguard Small-Cap Index
fund. But I'd break the final segment into two parts, putting 10
percent in Vanguard Small-Cap Index and the other 10 percent in
Vanguard Mid-Cap Index. This would give you better market
representation.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage of a rollover IRA is that as long as you do not
add other funds to these accounts, you can at any future date merge
these funds into another 401(k), if you choose. Perhaps at some
point you will be more certain of your new employer, and be offered
some financial incentive for building your 401(k) account with it.
So if you now have other IRA accounts, or decide to open some, make
sure the rollover IRA is kept separate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Q. I'd like to start investing. I have thought about stocks and
mutual funds, but I don't know if that would be a good start. I
have been told that stocks are a good investment, but risky. I have
a few CDs but would like higher returns. I am talking about a
$1,000-plus investment. What is a good investment for someone my
age?
</P>
<P>
   K.P., Port Arthur, Texas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A. Before you can make a sensible choice, you need to decide
what the eventual purpose of the money is likely to be. The
beginning of a retirement pool? Then one sort of investment would
be appropriate. A down payment on a house in five to 10 years?
Quite a different investment would be appropriate. Buying a car in
about three years? Still another route would be the right one.
</P>
<P>
   The last case is the easiest to deal with. If you expect to call
on the money within five years, CDs are the right place for your
savings. Neither the stock nor the bond market can be expected to
deliver predictable returns in such a short time; you could end up
with less money than the CDs would have provided.
</P>
<P>
   For an intermediate-term investment _ in which you would need
the money in five to 10 years _ most people favor balanced funds.
They balance a stock position with bonds and other fixed-income
holdings, typically with about 60 percent of the funds in stocks.
Solid examples include Fidelity Puritan, Fidelity Asset Manager,
Dodge and Cox Balanced, and Vanguard Balanced Index.
</P>
<P>
   For a long-term investment (10 years or more), you want stocks,
stocks, and nothing but stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is with what most people view as a core
holding _ money that's invested in large, well-established US
companies. The largest such fund is Vanguard Index 500, which
simply holds the 500 stocks in the Standard and Poor's 500 Index.
</P>
<P>
   If you do view this as retirement money, I suggest you look into
IRA accounts. They will give you tax-deferred growth until the
funds are withdrawn in your retirement years.

   You are allowed to put up to $2,000 a year into IRAs; depending
on your income, marital status, and whether you participate in a
retirement plan, all or some of the IRA contributions may be
deductible from your taxable income. If you don't qualify for a
deductible IRA, consider Roth IRAs. They offer no deductions but
let you withdraw money tax-free in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   What's the catch with IRAs? If you take money out before age 59
1/2, you must pay the taxes plus a penalty. (There are a few
exceptions, but they are pretty tightly defined and unpleasant,
such as disability or high medical expenses.)
</P>
<P>
   You can learn a great deal about mutual funds and IRAs from the
major fund families. Since those I cited are no-load fund families
(which have no sales charges and rely on mail solicitations), your
mailbox will never be the same if you ask a half-dozen companies
for information. But most provide clear and responsible
descriptions of what they offer.

<P>
   PROVINCETOWN, Mass. _ There are people for whom public nudity is
experienced only in bad dreams. And then there are people like Bill
Falconer, who wants nothing more than to go a beach unregulated,
uninhibited and undressed.
</P>
<P>
   Falconer, who spurns what he calls ``textile beaches,'' wants a
nude beach on Cape Cod so badly that for four years he has gathered
scores of nudists to clean up the Cape Cod National Seashore _
wearing clothes, even _ in the hopes that their contributions will
generate good will for their cause. He thinks it's helping, that
rangers have begun to treat traditional nudist areas of the
Seashore as a ``quasi-hands off area,'' but he concedes that
sunbathers still scramble for their clothes when rangers do show
up.
</P>
<P>
   But with an avowed naturist on the board of selectmen,
Provincetown is once again waging an effort to get some areas of
the Cape Cod National Seashore designated as clothing-optional
beaches. Last week, the board wrote a letter urging the National
Seashore to reconsider the prohibition against nudity _ and to
recognize a 1996 unanimous Town Meeting vote that called for the
same.
</P>
<P>
   But the forecast isn't good for nude sunbathers. The Cape and
Islands, some say, treat people like Falconer as an embarrassing
little secret: While town officials only reluctantly crack down on
nudists _ no one, it seems, wants to take credit for taming
personal freedoms _ they aren't offering open invitations or
advertising their beaches as free-for-alls.
</P>
<P>
   Take the cautious explanation of Nantucket Deputy Police Chief
Jack McGrady, who couldn't remember the last time someone was fined
for indecent exposure while on what's known as ``Nude Beach''
between Miacomet and Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nudity is a very delicate subject,'' said McGrady. ``Nudity in
and of itself supposedly isn't against the law in certain places
and it's not for me to make decisions on it. Call the district
attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, there are spots on Martha's Vineyard _ near the
lighthouse in Gay Head, and at Lucy Vincent Beach in Chilmark _
where nudity is tolerated, but not advertised.
</P>
<P>
   On the Cape, the only legal nude beach is a private one: In
Marstons Mills, visitors pay $15 to enter a nudist trailer park.
There, visitors are greeted by topless middle-age women and naked
couples, and skirted to a pool area _ a gated-off pond of ocean
water _ no bigger than a neighbor's backyard. One can swim out to a
roped-off raft, but not sit upon it naked, for fear of disturbing
the neighbors' peace.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the National Seashore, Chief Ranger Kevin FitzGerald
said people sunbathing nude more often receive verbal warnings than
fines; it's only the persistent ones, like Provincetown Selectman
David Atkinson, who find themselves in trouble with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson, a naturist who has championed the cause for years,
said he has paid more than $600 in fines. (The judge said, ``If we
see you naked again, we'll throw you in jail,'' he recounted.) He
admonishes those who think nudity bespeaks of vanity or
exhibitionist tendenies. It is natural and spiritual, he said, and
not the least bit sexy.
</P>
<P>
   Except to the gawkers, of course, for whom it is quite a show.
When nude sunbathing was permitted on sections of the Cape Cod
National Seashore in the 1970s, the lure of a beach stocked with
bare skin was so attractive that hundreds of tourists flocked to
the beaches, tramping over dunes and ruining vegetation for years
to come, said Maria Burks, Seashore superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can still see the damage today where that occurred,''
Burks said. ``People were chartering buses from Boston, bringing
folks down. The town of Truro was overrun with people parking on
lawns. It is pretty horrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the bulk of the damage was caused by ``the peepers, not
by the bathers,'' Burks said, the bathers were banned in 1975, when
the Cape Cod National Seashore became one of only two national
parks that prohibit nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite New England's puritanical image, the region has a
healthy number of naturists, said Eric Schuttauf, executive
director of the American Association for Nude Recreation. What they
lack is a home, which disturbs Atkinson. ``People from Europe, they
all have places to go,'' Atkinson said. ``People are so surprised
when you come here that there's no place to go to be naked.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson ran unsuccessfully on the Libertarian ticket for
secretary of state in 1998, and when the Globe printed photographs
of all the political candidates in suits, Atkinson wore his
birthday suit. Though he spearheaded the latest push for a nude
beach along the Seashore, he is not alone in a town that enjoys its
freedoms, both personal and civic.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, 1996, Town Meeting members unanimously approved an
article instructing the board of selectmen to request that the
National Seashore ``designate a clothing-optional area at an
appropriate distance from the southeastern end of the Herring Cove
parking lot.'' The selectmen did so three weeks later but never got
any satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dare I say we have nothing to show for our efforts?'' said
Town Manager Keith Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman is hopeful that the time is ripe for change, since the
selectmen are beginning discussions with the Seashore on beach
access and plan a public forum in August on issues such as dune
erosion. ``We fully expect the issue of nude beaches to show
itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burks, of the National Seashore, said officials will look into
the board's request, as they do each time they get an appeal for a
clothing-optional spot. But she said the issue is more complicated
than it appears and that it would be irresponsible right now to
open the beaches ``without guaranteeing some kind of resource
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   There are unintended consequences that need to be assessed _
like gawkers, for instance. Legal nude beaches could cause a
dramatic spike in visitation, which the towns would resist, she
said. And though FitzGerald, the Seashore's ranger chief, says some
now tramp over dunes to find remote spots for nude sunbathing, they
fear that many more would show up if nudity were sanctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Or not. Nobody is really certain, which makes this a cause for
study of what's changed in 25 years, and, as Burks put it,
``whether the sociology of nudity seems to be changing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson said it's as simple as finding good, remote locations
and posting signs clearly warning clothed visitors. ``Most
voyeurs,'' he said, ``would rather not walk a long way.''

CASUALTIES OF CASUAL-DRESS CULTURE

<TEXT>
<P>
   I keep reading about a mental condition called body dysmorphic
disorder, which causes people to think they're unattractive when
they're not.
</P>
<P>
   Lately I've been wondering if there isn't a mental disorder that
works the other way, that convinces people they look good when they
don't. Because how else to explain some of the things I see in
public these days?
</P>
<P>
   Let me pause here for a moment to confess that I am, as my dear
mother would say, no oil painting. I see that quite clearly every
time I look into a mirror, which is why I take care to keep the
most objectionable parts of my anatomy covered when I go out in
public. I don't like looking at my fat, my spider veins, and all
the other horrors, large and small, that come with age. Why would I
want to inflict the sight of these things on innocent strangers?
It's not just vanity, it's a matter of courtesy, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Tall Ships were a spectacle, and so too were many of the
people who came out to see them, dressed for the occasion as though
they were auditioning for a role in a soft-core porn movie. Acres
of bare flesh were on view, and much of it was not a pretty sight.
There were flabby midriffs, love handles, dewlaps of every
description, hairy backs, and even hairy backsides. True, it was
hot. And we were near the water, so maybe people convinced
themselves they were at the beach and dressed accordingly. You
expect to see people in all states of undress at the beach. But we
weren't at the beach. We were in the middle of the city.
</P>
<P>
   My personal breaking point came when I found myself sitting on a
crowded Red Line train with my nose about 2 inches from some guy's
hairy bellybutton. I looked up at his face. He was old enough to
know better. But there he was, in a cropped T-shirt and shorts that
hung low on his hips. I tried to imagine him looking at himself
approvingly in the mirror just before he left the house and saying,
``There. Perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a kind of reverse BDD, a mental disorder that causes
people to think they look great when they don't, this guy had an
acute case. I suppose there may be some other explanation. Maybe he
had been kidnapped by space aliens, dressed by an otherworldly
personal shopper, and sent back among us to test our gag reflexes.
Or maybe he just didn't care what he lookedlike. Or maybe he just
didn't know any better.
</P>
<P>
   Why should he know better? Nobody dresses anymore. Casual is the
rule, on the street and at work too. Casual Fridays weren't enough;
now every day is casual day. How much more casual can we get before
we're all walking around naked? Already companies are finding it
necessary to send out memos reminding people that casual work dress
doesn't include halter tops or short shorts or muscle shirts.
</P>
<P>
   I know what you're thinking: This woman is an old fool, totally
out of touch with the times. Yes, I am old. I admit it. I am so old
that I actually remember when people wore clothes in the
summertime. No kidding. People went around fully covered. Believe
it or not, nobody wore shorts in public back then. There was a kind
of unwritten rule that adults would not wear shorts shopping, or in
restaurants, or on the street. And nobody ever wore them to work.
It seems so long ago. It was so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that back then we carried the covering up too far. We
wore little white gloves, and girdles and hose, even on the hottest
days. I wouldn't want to go back to that, but there must be some
reasonable point between wearing a rubber panty girdle and having
to look into that guy's hairy bellybutton.

<P>
   FLORENCECOURT, Northern Ireland _ Philip Martin was going to
take his two sons to see a 12th of July parade, but he thought
better of it and instead brought them here, to the Marble Arch
Caves, a subterranean world of rivers and waterfalls nestled in the
remote hills of County Fermanagh.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 38, a Protestant, grew up in Northern Ireland and in his
youth belonged to a pipe band that marched in some of the 3,000
parades held each year by the Orange Order, a group akin to the
Masons, to celebrate William of Orange's victory over Catholic King
James in 1690.
</P>
<P>
   But this time he chose to spend what Orangemen call the Glorious
12th at the Caves rather than watching a parade, because, he said
only half-jokingly, ``better the caves than the cavemen.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching two weeks of sometimes violent protests by the
Orangemen and their supporters over being barred from marching
through a Catholic neighborhood in Portadown, Martin is not the
only Protestant who believes that some in his community are
behaving like those from a bygone era.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin and other moderate Protestants also are encouraged by
what they have seen. While the Orangemen in Portadown threatened to
shut down the country, it didn't happen. The violence organized by
loyalists who support the Orangemen was limited compared to 1996,
1997, and 1998, when much of Northern Ireland was paralyzed, and
several Catholics were murdered by loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of plunging Northern Ireland back to the bad old days,
the last two weeks suggest Northern Ireland may have turned a
corner. Extremists, who have set the agenda for more than 30 years,
seem more marginalized than ever; moderates are speaking out more
forcefully than ever; and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 _ and
the power-sharing government that is its cornerstone _ seems to be
taking root.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is one of those watching anxiously. He went to college in
England and stayed there, preferring multicultural London to the
two-tribes mentality and warfare back home. He regularly returns
here, mainly to visit his parents. He considers himself thoroughly
British, wants Northern Ireland to remain part of Britain, and
believes the Orange parades should continue. But he is disgusted by
the violent protests to support Orangemen who want to march down
the Garvaghy Road in a Catholic area of Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   He would someday like to return here, and says he will if the
Good Friday Agreement transforms this place, and the newly growing
prosperity flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   Many Protestant unionists who want to maintain the union with
Britain see their traditions and culture under threat from the new
order envisioned by the Good Friday Agreement, which sought to
bring an end to a 30-year cycle of political and sectarian
violence. The agreement, brokered by former US senator George
Mitchell of Maine, calls for power-sharing with Catholic
nationalists, who make up more than 40 percent of the population,
as well as closer ties with the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of the Orange parades are blocked by authorities
each year, and a handful of others have restrictions placed on
them. But the Orangemen are used to having their way in Northern
Ireland and see the objections raised to their marches as evidence
that their way of life is threatened. Catholics see the marches as
triumphalist, and the British government largely agrees with the
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the Orange Order described the past week as their Alamo,
their last chance to make a stand. But, like those who fell at the
Alamo, the Orangemen found their numbers dwindling as the days wore
on.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of all the main Protestant churches, in an
unprecedented call for restraint, pleaded with the Orangemen to
call off their protest at Drumcree Church on the outskirts of the
Garvaghy Road in Portadown, where the British government's Parades
Commission barred the Orangemen from marching.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding more sad than angry, the Reverend Robin Eames, the
Anglican primate of Ireland, said the Orangemen had to accept that
their defiance attracted and incited loyalist thugs who used
violence and intimidation against Catholics, the police, and
British soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order's leader in Portadown, Harold Gracey, responded
by calling the Protestant clergymen traitors. Gracey drew loud
cheers from a crowd at Portadown last week, but many Protestants
were appalled by his comments and the response he provoked. They
were equally appalled when Jim Rodgers, a Belfast city councilor,
was heckled by loyalists in Belfast after he told the largest
gathering of Orangemen on the Glorious 12th that attacks on the
police and British Army were unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, who opposes the Good Friday Agreement and is widely
regarded as a hard-liner within his own moderate Ulster Unionist
party, said he was not bothered by the heckling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people are a distinct minority,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His assessment was borne out by the small numbers who rose to
the call by the Orange Order to take to the streets this past week.
Police said the number joining the protest was far down from
previous years, as was the accompanying violence.
</P>
<P>
   Most loyalist paramilitaries went out of their way to prevent
violence the last two weeks, which marked the climax to the annual
marching season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days when violence was seen as a solution to problems in
Northern Ireland are over,'' said David Ervine, a former loyalist
paramilitary leader, who is now an enthusiastic democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it seems cool to be cool in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the last century, Protestant unionists were widely
seen as belligerent and intransigent. The British government
reluctantly created Northern Ireland in 1920, calculating that the
threat posed by armed Protestants who would revolt against being
left a minority in a Catholic-dominated Ireland was greater than
that posed by Catholic nationalists clamoring for a united and
independent Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a gerrymandered Northern Ireland that was carved
out of six of the nine counties of the ancient province of Ulster
in order to ensure that it would have a majority Protestant
population loyal to the British crown. Those in the 26-county Irish
Free State, which later became the Irish Republic, fought a bitter
civil war over the compromise. But moderates prevailed, and since
1922 the Irish government has sought the reunification of Ireland
through peaceful, democratic means.
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking has taken longer to take root in Northern Ireland,
where extremists generally have held sway, especially for most of
the last 35 years. But having concluded that violence was getting
them nowhere, the main paramilitary groups have, with some
murderous exceptions, observed cease-fires since 1994. It now seems
that being a moderate in the new Northern Ireland counts for more
than the snarling, menacing sort of unionism that is on display
every year in Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   Many here sense a shift in strategy by the unionists. It mirrors
the path taken by Irish republicans more than a decade ago when
Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness, and other former IRA commanders
decided the fastest, most practical way to unify Ireland was to end
their shooting war and seek the consent of the majority of those
living in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   For unionists, at least the narrow majority within the
Protestant community that supports the Good Friday Agreement, the
strategy is to convince enough Catholics that their rights and
aspirations will be respected, that they will be treated equally,
and that their lives will be better if Northern Ireland remains
part of the United Kingdom than if it becomes part of the Irish
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   But to do that, Protestants will have to spend less time
focusing on the glorious past that so enchants the men on the hill
at Drumcree.
</P>
<P>
   As Philip Martin, the Northern Ireland exile, put it as he
watched his young sons frolic on a grassy knoll, ``I used to think
about the past all the time. It was what we were taught as kids.
But now I don't give a toss about the past. I care about the future
and my two wee boys.''

NADER'S LOGIC DOESN'T HOLD UP _ BARNEY FRANK TELLS WHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doesn't matter. With those two words, putative President Nader
serves up the petard with &UR;  &LR; which he can be definitively hoisted.
That it is Representative Barney Frank helping point this out only
makes the exercise more fun.
</P>
<P>
   In the infancy of his second presidential candidacy, Ralph Nader
must contend with the impact of his Green Party candidacy's impact
on the identity of the next president. Nader makes no effort to
hide the obvious, that it is more likely to boost the fortunes of
George W. Bush over those of Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And since his candidacy could be a significant factor in making
Bush the next president, Nader has to deal with that. He does so by
arguing that it doesn't matter and that it would be better for his
brand of progressive politics and for the Democratic Party if Bush
won.
</P>
<P>
   Nader masks this point in a typical torrent of invective aimed
at Gore and the party (hypocrite, plastic person, corporate
stooge), but the important point is not his rhetoric but his
argument that it doesn't matter if Bush wins.
</P>
<P>
   Voila le petard. Listen to Barney Frank:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nader argument is based on the assumption that there is no
important difference between Al Gore and George Bush that justifies
a decision to vote for Gore. Well, we know for an absolute fact
that Gore and Bush differ completely on abortion rights, on gay
rights, and on controlling gun violence, to pick just three
examples. Well, if there are no important differences between Gore
and Bush, it must follow that these are not important differences.
And in fact this is what Nader does believe. His entire public
career supports that proposition. He has never, ever spoken out on
these matters. The same goes for the poor, for people stuck on
welfare, and for racial minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, the Massachusetts Democrat has discussed the
nascent Nader candidacy from his own progressive perspective,
particularly in a speech before the Americans for Democratic Action
and in keynoting the Democratic convention in Wisconsin. Frank's
credentials for this discussion are pristine _ a veteran
progressive as well as a pol, an activist as well as insider from
City Hall, Beacon Hill to Capitol Hill. Frank is especially helpful
because he doesn't make the mistake many of his friends make on
Gore's behalf _ namely descending into the same invective Nader
relies on to question the legitimacy of a candidacy or to speculate
about and impugn motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Frank's rapier in this case is his logic more than his famous
wit. Last week he pointed out that he agrees with the consumer
activist on many issues involving trade and environmental policy.
And on many of these questions Frank has disagreed passionately
with the Clinton administration and with Al Gore. The question for
this fall, however, is whether there is some issue or competing
agenda that is more important, from a progressive standpoint, than
the consequences of Bush's election.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it is much too early to assess even the potential of
Nader's candidacy, it is also too early to assess the
still-evolving candidacy's policy agenda. At the moment, it doesn't
even approach the kind of comprehensiveness we normally expect of
the so-called major parties. But it is not too early to assess
Nader's remarkable record as an activist _ from the beginning 35
years ago on auto safety through scores of issues involving
political, regulatory and pro-consumer reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph Nader is basically before us, in his conception, as the
champion of the middle-class, a kind of tribune of those people,''
says Frank. But it is precisely this focus on Economic Man or
Consumer Man that Frank says provides ``confirmation of Nader's
lifelong lack of interest in major social causes like civil rights,
women's rights, gay rights and poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about some of these issues, Nader is not negative,
that's not the point. Frank asserts that Nader has a tendency to be
dismissive, however, as in a 1996 remark that he had not spend much
time on ``gonadal politics,'' and he suggests Nader's passion is
more aroused in defending the privacy rights of Internet users than
those of gay couples trying to form families. Fair comment.
</P>
<P>
   Frank also undercuts a corollary of the ``doesn't matter'' Nader
case _ that a vote for him is justified in helping establish the
Green Party as a political fixture on the national scene, in terms
both of ballot position and access to federal campaign dollars. To
Frank, this traditional argument of splinter groups flies in the
face of the hard work progressives have done over the years at the
grass roots fighting for their causes at all levels in Democratic
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   A much fuller discussion of movement candidacies and the major
parties, with Frank's participation, can be found in the recent
pages and on the Web site of Bob Kuttner's oracular American
Prospect magazine (prospect.org). In our conversation, he
emphasized that the self-description of many of these groups as
``silenced majorities'' is on their best days highly argumentative.
</P>
<P>
   I would make the additional point that third party movements at
the Presidential level need huge, overriding issues as fuel: the
Cold War and race (both in 1948), race again (1968), and Washington
gridlock and swollen debt (early Ross Perot in '92). I would also
argue that Jesse Jackson and George McGovern did as much and
probably more than those movements over time by taking their major
causes to Democratic primary voters in 1972, '84 and '88.
</P>
<P>
   In coming out with surprising vehemence last week for Gore, Bill
Bradley said of the real choice this year, ``It isn't even close.''
Nader has gotten off on the wrong foot by arguing that the concerns
of too many tens of millions of American don't matter _ at least
not to him.

CHARGES FLY IN ATLANTA SCANDAL, BUT FROM CORRUPTION NOT RACISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When black officials in Atlanta and Fulton County began
pleading guilty last month to corruption charges in an ongoing FBI
investigation, one charge appeared notably absent in this widening
scandal _ the charge of racism.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps never before has a federal investigation been aimed at
so many high-ranking black officials, and more are expected to be
indicted or fired before this probe is over.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, a federal grand jury indicted Fred B. Prewitt,
the chairman of the city's Civil Service Board and a minority
contractor with the city. Prewitt, 70, a fund-raiser for Mayor Bill
Campbell and also a close friend, was charged with three felony
counts of making false statements on his 1996-1998 personal income
tax returns, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also reported that Fulton County Commissioner
Michael Hightower, 43, pleaded guilty to accepting $25,000 in
payoffs from a local businessman. In addition, Josh Kenyon, chief
of staff to County Commission Chairman Mike Kenn, was fired from
his job and later pleaded guilty in federal court to accepting
money from businessman George Greene. Greene, in turn, pleaded
guilty to bribing Hightower. Prewitt, Hightower and Greene are
black; Kenyon is white.
</P>
<P>
   All this has left the city and county reeling _ and left a taint
on a city proud of its African-American leadership. Atlanta, known
as the gateway to the South, is recognized as the city where
African-Americans have proudly held the mayor's seat since the
election of Maynard Jackson in 1973, and where blacks hold many
other high-ranking positions.
</P>
<P>
   The political landscape in Atlanta began to shake less than a
year ago when Raymond McClendon, a former investment manager for
the Atlanta Pension Board and once the chairman of then-Mayor
Jackson's finance committee, was indicted for defrauding Atlanta of
millions of dollars from the pension fund. McClendon was as close
to Jackson as Prewitt is to Mayor Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   McClendon's trial is expected to begin this summer, but as it
unfolds, it is unlikely that the charge of racism will be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is shocking is that, in all of my years in politics, I am
witnessing black elected officials being indicted or pleading
guilty and no one is saying that these investigations are racially
motivated,'' said Harry L. Ross, an Atlanta-based political
pollster. ``In traveling around metro Atlanta, I have yet to hear a
single person at various meetings I've attended say that this
corruption is based on race.''
</P>
<P>
   That has not always been the case in America. There have been
cities in which black officials were indicted where the charge of
racism might have had some validity, particularly if there were
only one or two black elected officials in a predominantly white
city or county government.
</P>
<P>
   And if this corruption scandal had broken 10 years ago in
Atlanta, Ross noted, ``There would have been charges that it was
racially motivated, that the white establishment was trying to
erode the political power base of the black populace. But no one is
able to make that claim in this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons for that. One is that at least two
officials have pleaded guilty to corruption charges since the
investigation began earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the fact that US Attorney Richard Deane, who is
directly involved in the probe, is African-American, as is Theodore
Jackson, in charge of the FBI in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Deane himself further eroded the racial aspect when at a
televised news conference he asked the people of mostly black
Atlanta and Fulton County that if they know of any corruption, to
please notify the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   As the probe continues, the people (and a few politicians) are
waiting uneasily for the next shoe to drop, and more indictments
will certainly be handed up by the federal grand jury. Meanwhile,
incumbents in Tuesday's state and county elections worry they will
be tarnished by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of black incumbents up for reelection are afraid that
they could be victims of a backlash from the corruption scandal,''
Ross said. ``They're afraid that the tarnished image of black
elected officials will cause many voters who usually support them
to stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal may have an impact even on next year's mayoral race.
With Campbell forbidden to run for a third term, three
African-Americans are vying to succeed him: City Council President
Robb Pitts; Gloria Tinubu, a former city councilor and on the
Spelman College faculty; and Shirley Franklin, a former chief
administrative officer to Andrew Young who recently stepped down
from the Georgia Transportation Board.
</P>
<P>
   So Atlanta will continue its run of black mayors, but be scarred
by this investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Atlanta and Fulton County have been hit hard by the
same disease that has hit many other seats of government across the
nation. As blacks in Atlanta and the surrounding county have
learned how to rise above segregation and racism to attain
political power, they will now have to learn how to survive the
crippling disease of political corruption.

&HT;     GAYS FIND LEAVING MORMON CHURCH IS FRAUGHT WITH OBSTACLES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: Note optional trim)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CAROL NESS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Joining the Mormon Church is easy. Getting out
can be hell.
</P>
<P>
   So says Owen Edwards, a 28-year-old San Francisco masseur and
student aesthetician.
</P>
<P>
   Born into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
Edwards faces a disciplinary hearing and possible excommunication
for submitting his resignation, explaining his reasons and asking
to have his name removed from the Mormon Church's membership
records.
</P>
<P>
   That was 4 1/2 months ago and some 13 years since he had stopped
attending church. Edwards charges he is being kept against his will
in a church that does not even want him because he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel like this is very hurtful to me, that I can't just
walk away. I have to fight tooth and nail,'' Edwards said. ``I
personally believe the Mormon Church is a vindictive bunch of cult
members''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards believes he faces a disciplinary hearing because, in his
resignation letter, he said he is homosexual, had a partner and
wanted his name removed because of the church's all-out campaign
for Proposition 22, the ballot initiative against legal gay
marriage that Californians passed last year. The Mormon Church
considers having homosexual sex grounds for excommunication.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Bryan Earl's letter informing Edwards that he faced
possible excommunication said only that it was ``because of
information contained in your letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Pimentel of Alameda, a spokesman for the Mormons, said he
could not comment on Edwards' case because it is confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards is far from alone. Quitting the Mormon Church has long
been difficult. Excommunication was the only way to sever ties
until the 1980s, when a lawsuit forced the church to allow members
to have their names stricken from membership rolls.
</P>
<P>
   But in many cases, so-called name removal can wind up taking
months or years, require repeated letters and inquiries, and prompt
persistent and ongoing visits and calls from fellow Mormons who,
some former church members say, approach harassment and invasion of
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, disciplinary hearings are called. Members are
investigated, their families and acquaintances are questioned, and
any transgression and its punishment can be announced by church
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Members like Edwards who are gay appear especially vulnerable to
discipline and excommunication when they try to leave, although the
evidence is anecdotal.
</P>
<P>
   The church's campaign for Proposition 22 prompted a spate of
resignations, including Edwards'. Since then, at least 300 Mormons
have contacted Kathy Worthington, an ex-Mormon activist in Utah who
helps members navigate the name-removal process.
</P>
<P>
   At least three, all of them gay, have been excommunicated.
</P>
<P>
   How many people resign yearly, or try to, is impossible to
assess. Through Pimentel, the church declined to provide statistics
on name-removal requests _ how many are submitted, if that number
is growing, how many end up in disciplinary hearings or lead to
excommunication. A call to the membership records director at
church headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah, was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Pimentel said name removals are handled locally and each case is
different. He denied that the church can try to make it hard for
people to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Members who write letters seeking to resign will be contacted by
church leaders to make sure they are not being pressured, and that
they understand the consequences for their souls, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a suspicion that the member has committed some
transgression, however, disciplinary hearings can be called. Such
transgressions include criminal behavior and sex out of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Pimentel was not sure if homosexuality, without proof of sexual
activity, was enough to trigger a hearing. The Mormon Church, like
many mainstream Christian churches, considers homosexuality immoral
but retains gay members if they are chaste and seek to change.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The three excommunications this year, however, suggest a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   Loyd Bulkley, 48, of Murray, Utah, married and reared his four
children as Mormons and then divorced. He proclaimed his
homosexuality nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped going to church, except for special occasions
involving his children. Church leaders challenged him once, and he
told them to get lost.
</P>
<P>
   But after a spat with his most devout son, he decided to quit.
His letter did not say he was gay, and asked that he not be
contacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I get a letter saying, `We have heard from reliable
sources that you are homosexual. We can't just let you resign. We
have to have a disciplinary court,'' Bulkley recalled. His hearing
was June 15, held before 15 assembled church leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twelve men in a high council and three stake presidents, to
kick out one gay man who wants to be out. I felt like one letter
should have done it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was excommunicated, although the church had no evidence of
sexual activity. Family members who had not known he was gay have
cut off contact with him as a result, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't take your name off, he said, ```you can quit going
and they can harass and torment you, they send teachers over and
people to visit you and call you and invite you to functions. They
want you back into the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never really your choice,'' he added. ``Then if you do
something wrong they'll kick you out.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Cedar City, Utah, women in their 30s tell a similar story.
They fell in love. Once they moved in together, the church started
sending visiting teachers, to spy, one of the women thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year they wrote separate letters of resignation,
saying they disagreed with church policies and involvement in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Then their bishop showed up, trembling, to ask if ``what we've
heard is true,'' the woman related. They were excommunicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took away our power to decide what we want to do,'' she
said. Her partner's family was devastated, she said. Her cousins
stopped talking to her.
</P>
<P>
   All three have talked about trying to sue the church.
</P>
<P>
   Worthington has been trying to get a class-action lawsuit
together, but said Utah laws are not conducive. She is hoping
Edwards will sue in California, which has explicit privacy
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is seeking a lawyer, but churches have proved fairly
immune to litigation over their treatment of members.

CONVENTION DEMONSTRATORS LEARN STRATEGY AT CALIFORNIA CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ One demonstrator was down on the ground.
Another squared off against a police officer. Another and another
and another locked arms, shouting and singing and swearing they
would not budge.
</P>
<P>
   In the background, 28-year-old Katie Flynn-Jambeck mentioned how
much she was looking forward to teaching the protesters to scale
buildings, once they had dusted themselves off and gotten a good
night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, they had to finish playing cops and convention
delegates at the camp run by the Berkeley-based Ruckus Society, a
sort of graduate program for liberal protesters. Later they would
master mass actions and learn that human blockades are no bluff.
They were, after all, spending six nights sleeping in tents and
sharing portable toilets, partly to confront their own fears,
mostly to prepare to confront authority nonviolently at the coming
Republican and Democratic conventions.
</P>
<P>
   And they would have fun doing it. Anyone who wasn't could talk
to the designated ``Care Bear.'' The camp was steeped in that kind
of earnestness, with admonishments to recycle and tofu enchiladas
served for lunch. Malachi Garza, a 21-year-old participant,
good-naturedly described the crowd as ``medium to crunchy'' on the
granola scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take our fun very seriously,'' said Ruckus Society
spokesman Han Shan. ``If we can't do that, we can't take our
populist movement to the world and have it catch on.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine-tuned by the Ruckus Society, which has participated in
nearly every major demonstration in recent years in the United
States and many in Canada, the crowd of funsters expects to storm
Philadelphia at the end of this month and Los Angeles next month
with nonviolent actions.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to use everything from political theater to
protesters locked together with tubing to convey concerns about the
environment, human rights, corporate globalization, and a host of
other national and international issues.
</P>
<P>
   As John Sellers, the society's director, put it: ``We make an
implicit political statement in deciding who we train. Our goal is
to build a unified, sustainable democratic future, and that means
pulling the power out of the hands of corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   The camp, which is free and ends Wednesday, is the nonprofit
Ruckus Society's 24th in five years. Nearly 100 people took part in
a recent workshop on the East Coast. Another 150 or so representing
16 states are now broiling on borrowed land in the Santa Monica
Mountains _ one person out of every three or four who applied,
Sellers said.
</P>
<P>
   What they have in common is their relative youth, their
commitment to political activism at a time when many eligible
voters of all ages do not bother to cast a ballot, and their
willingness to put their bodies on the front lines for their
beliefs. That's what many said made them glad to give up the
comforts of home or their paychecks to spend time at the rustic
camp with spectacular views of the ocean and surrounding mountains,
especially from the top of the scaffolding and platforms set up for
practice climbs and descents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Climbing is more mental than physical because you've got to be
focused on what you do,'' explained Flynn-Jambeck, who works in the
development office at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass. when
she's not suspending herself from bridges to stop factory trawlers
from leaving port or unfurling banners above chemical pipelines to
make points about environmental racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to stay calm, think ahead, and be ready for
anything,'' she added. ``It's an ethic you should take with you
into all direct actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the campers, herself included, were at last year's World
Trade Organization meetings in Seattle. This year, they faced off
against delegates to the International Monetary Fund meeting in
Washington. In turn, they got hit with tear gas and pepper spray
and shot with rubber bullets by police in full riot gear _ even
though, they insisted, they were not rioting and were only
employing their legally guaranteed right to demonstrate
nonviolently, even if it meant disrupting traffic or delaying
delegate sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a discussion facilitator how many of them had been
arrested during protests, half of the group attending that session
raised their hands. Questioned about how many were on probation,
about half said they were, including facilitator Sarah Seeds. Terry
Marshall, 23, who lives in Boston and works for the American
Friends Service Committee, has not been arrested yet, but he said
he is willing to be while in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the power and the right to demonstrate against
injustices,'' Marshall said. ``We have the power and the right to
put our bodies in the way of the machine. If it comes to (being
arrested) I'll be arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as recent protests have proved, peaceful demonstrations are
sometimes met with force _ and one of the many exercises showed
that more than a few of the campers would advocate violence under
certain circumstances, if not by themselves then by others. So
Ruckus Society leaders know they have to be ready for anything in
Los Angeles, whose police department is facing its most widespread
scandal in recent history, and Philadelphia, whose officers were
recently captured on videotape beating a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   That means practice ``hassle lines,'' where one-half of the
group plays convention delegates, the other half demonstrators
willing to say or do most anything except cause harm to keep the
enemy from entering the convention hall. It means sessions on
strategic planning and learning to listen one on one.
</P>
<P>
   It means defining ``personal space'' and holding hours-long
talks on imperialism and oppression. In this world of
well-organized anarchy, it means melding high-tech techniques with
old-fashioned grass-roots activism to hit home the points.
</P>
<P>
   And the participants at the camp _ sponsored by groups called
the Action Resource Center, Global Exchange, and Youth Action for
Global Justice Network _ have scores of issues, many of them
represented by T-shirts or hats made of hemp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools not jails,'' read one shirt. ``Defending Land and
Life,'' read another. ``Resist the Global Oil Industry'' and
``Black Panthers Party'' also were represented. Even the volunteer
kitchen staff had its own issue, reserving the right to sniff
diners' hands to ensure they had washed beforehand to prevent the
``oral to fecal germ route.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyranny, tyranny,'' the crowd shouted in its first protest of
the morning on the first day of camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The types of messages you see here resonate with a lot of
folks,'' said Mehrdad Azemun, a 28-year-old environmental activist
from Chicago who is between jobs in his field and hopes to be
outside the convention center in Los Angeles. ``But we're already
interacting. We're hearing each other, and that's always good.''
</P>
<P>
   Azemun said he came to the mountains to formalize his nonviolent
protest skills. Jessy Fernandez, a 23-year-old Yale Law School
student from Weston, Mass., said she relished the chance to learn
among like-minded people while trying to improve the world. Doris
Haddock, the 90-year-old grandmother who walked across the country
to highlight campaign finance reform, said she had come to
encourage America's youth to find political leaders who touch their
hearts and to vote for ``none of the above'' for president until
they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Know when it's time to go,'' facilitator Sarah Seeds warned
members of her group before sending them out to role-play again in
the midday heat. ``Know when you've been co-opted. Know what to do
when you get what you want because it happens so rarely.''

IN CALIFORNIA, A SENSE THAT GORE CAN BE BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With Democrats poised to flock here next month for
their quadrennial convention, uncertainty is casting a shadow over
California, once thought to be firmly on Vice President Al Gore's
side.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush has campaigned
18 days this year in the state with the largest cache of Electoral
College votes, and his aides say the vice president had better not
take his own support for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush made the decision early on last year that he was
not going to write off California,'' said Mindy Tucker, a Bush
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Lowenthal, a retired social work professor who recently
attended a hotel workers protest by the beach in Santa Monica,
helps explain why Gore has not secured California.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more disappointing by the day and I'm a really good
Democrat,'' said Lowenthal. She said she is vexed with Gore for his
stand on Elian Gonzalez and irritated by the vice president's
``progress and prosperity'' tour, which includes no talk of those
who still suffer from poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Marlena Martinez, on the other hand, offers an example of why
the odds remain against Bush taking the state in November.
</P>
<P>
   As the special education teacher browsed for videos in a Latino
neighborhood of East Los Angeles, she said she would never vote for
a Republican. ``They're not for the minority,'' Martinez said
firmly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, enthusiasm for Gore seems weak, and two recent polls of
California voters show Bush and Gore in a dead heat. The respected
Field poll, on the other hand, gives Gore an 11-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing Gore could do would be to assume that
California is his state and that Latino voters will overwhelmingly
support him,'' said Mark Baldassare, a senior fellow and pollster
at the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan think
tank in San Francisco. ``I think Gore has some work to do out
here.'' In recent surveys, Baldassare has found that the voters are
much closer to Gore on abortion, gun control, and the environment
than they are to Bush. But he gives Bush credit for reaching out to
non-Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For independent and moderate voters, the attempt to make that
link, the attempt to change what has been a fairly dismal record of
Republicans connecting with Latino voters, is telling swing voters
in this state about the fact that George Bush is trying to be a new
Republican,'' said Baldassare.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats insist that Bush doesn't stand a chance here. Instead
of seriously making a play for California, they say, he is really
executing a tried-and-true political ploy, pretending to challenge
his opponent in order to scare him into spending more time and
money here than necessary.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bush has two new television ads featuring his
Latino nephew, George P. Bush, speaking in English and Spanish. But
neither ad is running in California, only New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George Bush wants to come in here and waste his time and do
head fakes, that's his option,'' said Garry South, senior political
adviser to Governor Gray Davis, a Democrat. ``The bottom line is,
he's not going to carry California. This is all a little scam
they're running. Nobody should confuse it with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been doing well at the polls in recent years. In
the last eight statewide elections, Democrats won seven
top-of-the-ticket races. And no Republican with antiabortion views
has won the state since 1988, when Vice President George Bush
carried California over Massachusetts Governor Michael S. Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very strongly Democratic state,'' said South.
</P>
<P>
   That, said Tucker, is a dangerous attitude for the Gore camp.
Although she acknowledged the uphill nature of the state contest
for Bush, Tucker insisted that the governor has been making inroads
among women, Latinos, and members of the high-tech community.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands where he's starting from, he has no
illusions,'' said Tucker. ``He understands the incorrect images
that some people have of the Republican party.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in California have a history of targeting immigrants
for political gain among Anglo voters. In 1996, then-Governor Pete
Wilson brought Bob Dole down to the Mexican border to gaze out over
the slums of Tijuana. Dole joined Wilson in demanding more border
guards and urging that public education be made off-limits to
children of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, about a million Latinos have been added to the
voter registration rolls, while the number of Anglo voters has
declined by about 100,000, according to the Field poll. About 13
percent of all voters here are Latino, and two out of three Latinos
are registered Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante said that no matter how hard
Bush tries to reach Latino voters, he still belongs to the party
that has long been hostile to them and their interests. ``I think
he's going to suffer from it,'' Bustamante said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the statistics, Jim Brulte, the Senate Republican
leader from Rancho Cucamonga, said it is the Democrats who are
blowing smoke, not the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closer the race gets, the more vocal the Democrats are
about how the state isn't competitive,'' Brulte said. ``I think
they're trying to drown out reality with the volume of their
rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   Most amusing to many Republicans here is that Davis, the popular
governor, has been mentioned as a potential running mate for Gore.
``The mere fact that they're even entertaining the idea, gives lie
to their belief that it's a lock,'' said Brulte.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, however, may get a boost from last month's 5-4 US Supreme
Court decision to strike down Nebraska's ban on late-term
abortions, analysts say. Voters who favor abortion rights may worry
about the slim margin on the court and what will happen when some
justices retire and future abortion cases arise.
</P>
<P>
   Lowenthal, for example, is intrigued by Ralph Nader, the Green
Party candidate. But she's also concerned about who will be
appointing new justices to the court in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard for me because I don't want Bush in,'' said
Lowenthal. ``I like Nader and I don't think he can win. And I don't
want to throw a vote away.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend, Judith Stacey, is just as frustrated. She called
Gore's comments on the Elian Gonzalez matter ``a travesty,''
``pathetic,'' and ``hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   The choices, she said, ``are abysmal.'' But Stacey, a sociology
professor at the University of Southern California, is certain to
vote for Gore, not Nader, adding: ``I'm not willing to forfeit my
vote in light of the Supreme Court.''

 UNDATED: ... him skyward.

<P>
   But the more frequent discipline was flogging. According to an
account written in 1836 by a sailor known as Jack Nasty Face, a
typical maritime punishment proceeded this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``The prisoner is made to strip to his waist; he is then seized
by his wrists and knees to a grating or ladder; the boatswain's
mate is then order to cut him with a cat-o'nine-tails; and after
six or twelve lashes are given, another boatswain's mate is called
to continue the exercise, and so they go on until the captain gives
word to stop. From one to five dozens lashes are given, according
to the captain's whim, but the general number is three dozen.''
Others say two dozen was the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's early naval service gives a good indication of the
frequency with which masters resorted to the lash; during his
18-months aboard the frigate Seahorse, the teenage seaman saw men
flogged on at least 200 occasions. Naval records show that in 1810,
31 members of the ship Alfred were flogged for different offenses
on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   A brutal flogging could maim or even kill. One particularly
sadistic British captain, Hugh Pigot of the Hermione, who sometimes
ordered the last man down from aloft flogged, killed at least two
men that way; it's no surprise his crew mutinied in 1797 and
murdered him. But Pigot was hardly alone in his sadism.
</P>
<P>
   One British officer reported to the admiralty: ``I served in a
ship where every one of the maintopmen were stripped and flogged at
the gangway for no other cause than that another ship in company
got her topgallant yards up first, and not for any wilful
negligence on the part of our men.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the crew of the Namur rioted, demanding shore leave,
three ringleaders were hanged, while four received 500 lashes.
Another seven received 200 lashes or more. Yet the captain, Edward
Boscawen, was considered such a fair and forgiving officer that men
begged to serve with him.
</P>
<P>
   Flogging was a regular part of American naval discipline as
well, though general treatment seems to have been more lenient, as
evidenced by the fact that men regularly left England's service to
join the US Navy, while desertion seldom occurred in the opposite
direction.
</P>
<P>
   None of which should in any way diminish an observer's delight
in the picturesque armada sailing this summer, of course. It's just
that rapture is always best balanced with reality.
</P>
<P>
   So enjoy the Tall Ships _ but don't let their grandeur sweep you
too far off history's moorings.

TALL SHIPS, BRUTISH LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Tall Ships are sailing again and they again make stowaways
of our fancy, fostering dreams of a life at sea, of rippling sails
overhead, the pitch of the deck beneath our feet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we have a way of forgetting the dark side of history, of
glorifying war, or romanticizing times of sacrifice. Thus, before
we bid bon voyage to the armada (and our senses), it is instructive
to ask what life was like during the golden age of sail, an era
that ran from 1460 to about 1860? Here's a hint: Not a whit like
the impression one might glean from the gleaming flotilla that came
gliding into the harbor on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Writing of the British Navy of the Stuart era, which spanned
most of the 17th century, historian G. M. Trevelyan described life
aboard ship this way: ``The sailors, famished when they were not
poisoned, seldom clothed, and hardly ever paid, were kept together
by flogging, keel-hauling and other sea tortures on men of war that
were often little better than ill-managed convict hulks and
ill-supplied plague hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did perspicacious 18th-century observers think life at sea
had improved much by their time. ``No man will be a sailor who has
contrivance enough to get himself in jail,'' Samuel Johnson said at
mid-century, ``for being in a ship is being in a jail, with the
chance of being drowned. A man in a jail has more room, better food
and commonly better company.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Johnson was right in much of what he said of seafaring
life, he was wrong in implying jail offered protection from the
British Navy. In Horatio Nelson's era (the late 18th and early 19th
centuries), only about half of the sailors on British naval vessels
were volunteers. Others were dragged aboard by the notorious press
gangs in what was essentially legal kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Prison was a regular recruitment site. Britannia filled her
decks with smugglers, thieves, pickpockets, debtors, rogues, and
the like. Complained one veteran sailor of the quick-fingered
scalawags he was forced to serve with: ``Neither chest nor bed nor
blanket nor bag escaped their sleight-of-hand thievery.''
</P>
<P>
   Although American custom and tradition forbade ``impressment'' _
outrage over England's seizing of sailors from American ships was,
after all, one of the causes of the War of 1812 _ the American Navy
was full of characters as shady as any.
</P>
<P>
   In ``White-Jacket: Or the World in a Man of War,'' Herman
Melville, who had served on the frigate the United States, called
the US Navy ``the asylum for the perverse, the home of the
unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   So what was life like aboard ship? At this midsummer juncture, a
review of history serves to remind us. Because although sailing may
conjure up images of endless idle hours spent on deck in the glory
of sun and wind, that was hardly the case. To paraphrase Hobbes,
seafaring life was poor, nasty, brutish _ and wet.
</P>
<P>
   In rough weather, a sailor's work was dangerous indeed as he
wrestled with sails aloft, seldom more than a slip away from
plunging to his death on the deck or in the raging seas. Other
times, a day's labor was dull, tedious, and repetitive.
</P>
<P>
   Sailors themselves knew the allure of the sea was a landlubber's
delusion. ``No sooner . . . has the young sailor begun his new life
in earnest than all this fine drapery falls off, and he learns that
it is but work and hardship after all,'' student-cum-sailor Richard
Henry Dana wrote in ``Two Years Before the Mast,'' a chronicle he
penned in no small part to combat the misimpressions that drew
young men down to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The day aboard ship began between 6 and 7 a.m. with the cry
``all hands ahoy.'' The first chore was often washing and scrubbing
of the decks, a task done daily even in freezing weather. Beyond
the task of sailing the ship _ the setting, reefing, furling, and
bracing of sail _ repairing of the miles of rigging, scrubbing of
sails, overhauling of gear, and general cleaning, tarring,
painting, greasing, and oiling went on without surcease. On a naval
vessel, sailors also found time for regular practice with and
inspection of guns and equipment. Make-and-mend days filled any
spare hours.
</P>
<P>
   Except on Sundays, and for a few moments in the evening, if a
man was on deck, he had to be at work. ``It is the officer's duty
to keep everyone at work, even if there is nothing to be done but
to scrape the rust from the chain cables,'' Dana wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The day ended between 8 and 9 p.m., when the off-duty watch or
shift could retire for four hours below decks to their hammocks,
slung so close that little more than two feet separated one
snoozing sailor from the next.
</P>
<P>
   Only Sunday was different, including a church service and some
sort of music or revelry.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the retrospective romance of sailing is the
notion of traveling the world, sampling the exotic cultures of the
various ports of call. But when shore leave for naval sailors came
at all, it was generally restricted to a small portion of the crew.
In home ports, there was frequently no leave, because reluctant
captains feared desertion. That situation led one British sailor to
call his five years of service ``floating imprisonment,'' other
servicemen to complain of serving ``upwards of ten years without
having the satisfaction of seeing our friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of leave was one of the grievances that precipitated
the great British naval mutiny of 1797, in which more than 50,000
men serving in more than 100 vessels rebelled. (Thomas Payne, who
stoked American revolutionary fervor with ``Common Sense,'' helped
popularize another key grievance in his ``Rights of Man: Part the
Second'': ``The pay . . . is about the same now as it was about a
hundred years ago, when the taxes were not above a tenth part of
what they are at present.'')
</P>
<P>
   The admiralty made one concession to concupiscence: In ports,
wives and prostitutes were allowed aboard, and the lower deck often
took on aspects of an orgy. But if heterosexual sex was allowed,
the sentence for homosexuality, which was sometimes, but not
always, overlooked, was death.
</P>
<P>
   Food was neither plentiful nor good. Breakfast was usually tea
and hardtack (hard, dry, unleavened bread) or biscuit. Salt beef or
pork and biscuits were the monotonous mainstays of other marine
meals, though peas, oatmeal, beans, cheese, potatoes, and rice also
figured in. Even in port, fresh vegetables were not a regular part
of meals until late in the 19th century; only after 1795 was citrus
included to combat scurvy.
</P>
<P>
   A regular rapping came at the beginning of each meal as the men
banged their biscuits on the table to knock the worms out. As a
Sunday treat, the men might have ``duff,'' a gummy flour pudding
eaten with molasses. Beggars ate better, groused one British
sailor.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly calamity made that true, for then, starvation loomed.
Things got so desperate for one English ship blown off-course
during the 16th century that rats, mice, and the ship's cats were
all devoured. During their epic, 12,000-mile crossing of the
Pacific, Magellan's starving men were reduced to eating the leather
that wrapped the mainyard to reduce chafing.
</P>
<P>
   Although men could usually drink freely from the water cask on
deck _ the scuttle butt that has given its name to the gossip
traded there _ water became foul tasting after weeks in casks.
</P>
<P>
   Beer and spirits were a sailor's favored drink. Beer, when it
could be had, was given at the rate of a gallon per man per day.
</P>
<P>
   If not, a sailor was entitled to a pint of wine or a half-pint
of spirits, usually rum or brandy, half in the morning, half at
night. (When, to reduce the general inebriation, Admiral Edward
Vernon, known as Old Grogham after the green grogham cloak he wore,
ordered the half pint of rum cut with a quart of water, the diluted
drink became known as ``grog.'')
</P>
<P>
   Still, drunkenness, or grogginess, was common aboard ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be drunk is considered by every sailor as the acme of
sensual bliss,'' wrote one mariner in his mid-18th century memoirs.
``In our ship the men would get drunk in defiance of every
restriction.''
</P>
<P>
   But at their peril: By most accounts, at least half of all
disciplinary measures had inebriation as their root cause.
</P>
<P>
   And woe betide the poor swab who ran afoul of the captain.
Discipline was unsparing, particularly in the British Navy, and
``all hands ahoy to witness punishment'' a regular command.
</P>
<P>
   Mutiny, of course, was punishable by death. Although we think of
mutiny as a general rebellion, the charge also included striking an
officer, as Melville's Billy Budd found out, as well as individual
acts of disobedience. It could even be stretched to cover
insubordinate language. A condemned man was executed by hanging,
accomplished by fixing a noose about his neck, tossing the end over
the yardarm, and hauling him skyward.

   WORCESTER, Mass. _ A few minutes before the red candle tumbled
to the floor, Julie Barnes and Tom Levesque were coloring.
Coloring, and then fighting about whether to have sex, pushing each
other back and forth on a makeshift bed until the candle fell, and
some clothes ignited.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly fire that resulted turned the nation's attention to
the vacant meat-processing plant a few blocks from downtown
Worcester, and to the thin, scruffy homeless couple who had been
squatting inside.
</P>
<P>
   A court will have to decide whether the two street people,
charged with manslaughter, are responsible for six firefighters'
deaths. But on Friday, as Barnes was released from prison on bail,
their lawyers were insisting that the charges should be dismissed.
They point to grand jury testimony that was made public this month,
and say it demonstrates that the couple were not treated fairly
when manslaughter charges were brought against them.
</P>
<P>
   But the testimony also provides the first vivid details of the
sequence events that led to one of the deadliest fires in state
history, and of the simple, squalid life the couple had been living
in the months before. It shows that they spent nights in a
warehouse without heat, sleeping on a wooden pallet covered with
blankets, eating and playing and having friends over to visit,
alternating between the most childlike activities and the most
adult.
</P>
<P>
   They lived there even though city officials determined that the
owner had sealed the warehouse adequately from trespassers, even
after a police officer witnessed their squalid living conditions,
and had to leave the building because of the stench. They used the
empty warehouse as a home and refuge until the fire forced them
out, killing their dog and cat and destroying their few belongings,
and changing life in Worcester forever.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dramatic end to a situation that Worcester activists
for the homeless say is disturbingly commonplace; some suspect that
dozens of people live in the empty warehouses that once made up a
vibrant industrial district. Last December, a neighborhood priest
said he has walked past many of those buildings at night, and seen
small fires burning inside.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Worcester Cold Storage and Warehouse Co., was 190 feet long
by 70 feet wide, constructed of brick, with freezers inside and
walls lined with cork, styrofoam and styrene. The meat processing
plant it once housed went out of business in 1987. The building had
been abandoned since then, save for the homeless people who have
found their way inside.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Barnes, 20, and Tom Levesque, 37, got in through a back
entrance, near the loading dock, following a cement walkway to an
L-shaped set of steps, which led to an accessible door. They hid a
flashlight behind a steel beam, and used it to help make their way
down dark corridors to a room on the righthand side.
</P>
<P>
   The room was in the northeast corner of the building, on the
second floor, with windows that looked out onto Franklin Street. It
was strewn with clothes and brown paper bags, bread and cold cuts,
mustard, mayonnaise, and cans of soup. The couple kept a kerosene
heater, a cat and a dog. For a bed, they used a wooden pallet lined
with blankets: two to make it soft, four or five to keep warm. Next
to the bed was a wooden end table, and on top of the table was a
radio and the thin red candles they used for light.
</P>
<P>
   At a day laborers office in Worcester, they met Scott Swedis,
another young drifter who made a connection with Julie. They
invited Scott to see the room, and let him stay there a few nights.
Julie and Scott got romantically involved. Tom got jealous.
</P>
<P>
   Julie and Tom had a volatile relationship _ they argued and
sometimes got violent _ and Scott seemed to have been caught in the
middle of it. In early October of last year, Julie applied for a
restraining order against Tom, saying he was kicking Scott. As an
address, she left a nearby homeless shelter. The request was
deined.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 27, Swedis contacted police himself, likely with a
similar complaint. In response, a K-9 officer, Daniel Sullivan,
went into the warehouse with his dog at about 10 p.m. that night.
His report was read to the grand jury in February.
</P>
<P>
   When he walked in the building, Sullivan wrote, he was overcome
by the stench of rotting garbage, feces, and urine. He made his way
down a hallway with a flashlight, and entered one room to find
mountains of trash: garbage bags, take-out containers, half-eaten
meals, and, at the far end, piles of human waste. He saw more food
trays, more animal and human waste, as he continued down the
corridor. ``You couldn't take a step,'' he wrote, ``without walking
on rotting garbage or feces.''
</P>
<P>
   In the makeshift bedroom, where he found a closet with a box
inside. The box was overflowing with cat feces. At that point,
worried for the safety and health of his dog, he left the building.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether Sullivan or anyone in the Police Department
contacted the city building inspector or public safety department,
or the building's owner, Framingham developer Ding On ``Tony''
Kwan.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they did not receive a report of someone
living inside the building. A Police Department records official
said she could find no record of Sullivan's report on file from
October 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julie moved out of the warehouse a week before the fire. She and
Tom had broken up, and Julie went to stay at the nearby Regency
Hotel, with a friend named Bruce Canty. She returned to the
warehouse in the afternoon of Dec. 3. to check on her dog, who had
been sick.
</P>
<P>
   As she headed to the back door, Julie told police, she spotted
Tom at the Kenmore Diner, and figured he was following her. He came
into the warehouse a short time after she did, asked what she was
doing there, and sat next to her on the bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with you today?'' she asked him.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was none of her business.
</P>
<P>
   They continued to argue. He poked her, and she told him to leave
her alone. He started to smoke a joint, and she told him it
bothered her nose. She pulled out a coloring book, lay down on the
edge of the bed, and started to color.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Tom decided he wanted to have sex. Julie didn't.
Tom pulled the book away, and they argued and pushed each other. At
some point, Tom's leg knocked over the red candle that had been
providing their light. At first, neither of them noticed. But then
Julie realized the clothes were burning.
</P>
<P>
   They tried stepping on the clothes, but the fire wouldn't go
out. They hit it with a pillow, and the pillow caught fire. The
fire started to spread to the paper on the floor, and to grow.
``Everything in the room began to burn,'' Tom later told police.
</P>
<P>
   They tried to get their pets out of the room, but couldn't
manage. So Tom told Julie to put on her shoes. Julie turned off the
kerosene heater, and they left.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They took a short walk to the Worcester Common Outlets mall to
the MediaPlay store, where they often listened to music on
headphones, flipped through magazines, and bought candy. The store
manager overheard them arguing. ``I can't believe I lost all my
stuff,'' Julie was telling Tom. ``I lost everything.''
</P>
<P>
   They left the store and headed for dinner _ Tom says they went
to the Mustard Seed, a place that serves meals to the homeless.
They returned to the mall and lingered for a while, then went to a
friend's apartment, where Tom spent the night. Julie went back to
the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, by this point, had been burning for more than five
hours, and was raging. Julie could see the engines and flames from
the hotel window. By the end of the night, 300 firefighters from
Worcester and nearby communities were battling the blaze. It
started as a routine fire _ light haze inside the building,
firefighters able to move freely, a district chief told the Fire
Department's board of inquiry, in testimony that became public this
month. ``All of a sudden, things went bad,'' he said. ``Things went
from light haze to black and hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie kept calling to Canty, telling him to look out the window.
She couldn't seem to pull herself away.
</P>
<P>
   By that evening, police were already on Tom and Julie's trail;
they had interviewed the owner of a diner who remembered seeing
them enter the building, as well as homeless people who knew them
from city shelters. In the weeks after the fire, the details of
their little-noticed lives trickled into public view: How Tom had a
troubled family life and a background of mental illness; how Julie
was described by friends as slow, and had drifted between parents
until she dropped out of school and wound up on the streets. Five
days after the fire, Tom and Julie were arrested and charged with
involuntary manslaughter. He is still waiting to hear whether his
bail will be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days after the fire, investigators cleared the rubble from
the warehouse's second floor. They found a charred wooden pallet,
the remnants of plastic milk crates, a well-preserved prepaid
telephone card, and the remains of a cat and a dog.
</P>
<P>
   They also found a piece of carpet with a red substance on it. A
State Police laboratory determined that it was wax. The remains of
a red candle, which had burned into the floor.

in brain research, using MRIs so finely tuned that they can watch
oxygen cells travel within the brain. This, in turn, allows the

immunologists, especially for infants, whose immune systems need
exposure to help them develop a defense against germs. (Toner,

   CYC-TOUR-LANCE _ The Tour de France took a much needed day off
Monday before riders began their final week of cycling. But Lance
Armstrong, who has dominated the race the past two weeks, wasn't
content to allow things to rest, to stay status quo. The defending
Tour champion has been criticized for his conservative race
tactics, specifically when he allowed Marco Pantani, the 1998 Tour
victor, to take a stage win last Thursday on the legendary Mont
Ventoux. Armstrong, however, turned feisty at a Monday afternoon
press briefing, continually referring to Pantani as ``Il
elephantino,'' a jab at the Italian's bald head and large ears.
Armstrong made the remarks to a press gathering of more than 500
journalists. ``Unfortunately, he has shown his true colors,''
Armstrong said of Pantani. ``I felt like (the stage win) was a
gift. I also feel now that it was a mistake to give the gift. ...
Pantani wasn't the best man on Ventoux.'' (Halliburton, Austin

HOW LOW CAN `BROTHER' GO?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Two things leapt out from last week's revelation that ``Big
Brother'' inmate George had accidentally killed a man: His wife's
assertion that America's knowing of his mishap would ``destroy
him,'' followed by ``Big Brother'' executive producer Paul Romer's
desultory shrug, ``I'm just surprised it came out so early.''
</P>
<P>
   George is the 41-year-old father of three _ best-known for
reclining on a snow-covered diving board clad only in shorts and
donning a wig, a straw hat and performing a clunky chicken dance.
But years earlier, he was responsible for the death of a close
friend in a hunting accident that sounded like something out of the
Coen brothers' ``Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   Picture the portly fellow in bulky winter finery; he scrabbles
onto an icy log, only to slip and tumble; his gun goes off, ammo
flying straight into the back of his buddy. Poor George wandered
the wilderness for hours, so dazed that when he turned up in the
hospital, he didn't even recognize his wife, Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't that have been part of his initial biography? How can
a ``journalist'' like Julie Chen host the show and introduce a
documentary feature that excludes the key event of a person's life
story? If the release of the information was inevitable, as Romer
seemed to suggest, why not steel the guy for it by letting him know
it will be announced up front _ or simply find someone who doesn't
have blood, no matter how inadvertent, on his hands?
</P>
<P>
   Might someone at CBS have asked, would the family of the man
accidentally shot be amused when the network wrung that story for
high drama, using it like a surprise plot twist in a potboiler?
Waiting for the information to leak its way into the national
consciousness isn't disingenuous; it's flat-out dishonest and
dishonorable.
</P>
<P>
   This followed hot on the heels of Karen, the 43-year-old mother
of four, railing vehemently against her husband, Tom, and vowing
that her marriage was kaput. Again, one must assume that the ``Big
Brother'' brain trust was aware that Karen was an emotional powder
keg with a short fuse: Her marital dissatisfaction weighed so
heavily upon her that the slightest provocation would cause her to
blow.
</P>
<P>
   How must Karen's kids feel, watching Mommy dump on Daddy and
realizing that all America _ including the kids at school they
really hate _ now knows that their father has intimacy issues? Have
acquaintances already taunted them: ``Yo, dude! Can I touch your
dad's face?''
</P>
<P>
   (Husband Tom, who had expressed reservations about the whole
enterprise on the show's premiere, made a dignified yet emotional
appearance on Thursday's live episode, at least until he started
getting poetic. Such reserve _ so incongruous with the show's
concept _ probably, coupled with other houseguests' cogent
reservations about Karen, put America squarely on his side.)
</P>
<P>
   When the story that William was a disciple of a Nation of Islam
splinter group came down the pike, it hardly seemed a surprise. But
how many more of these Scuds has ``Big Brother'' prepared to drop
on the American public before the show wraps up? Perhaps the reason
CBS hasn't shown much concern about the show's vague ratings anemia
is that it knows it has a card up its sleeve, one that, once
exposed, will impel America to watch.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, however, is the question: Can America really
find the suffering of those who aren't even on the show that
entertaining? Will Jewish viewers find the show amusing anymore,
knowing now that William hangs with a man whom even the Nation of
Islam found too extreme in his anti-Semitic views?
</P>
<P>
   Random developments in the BB house are posted on the Internet,
where you can also watch the 10 contestants around the clock:
Former stripper Jordan has been bawling her eyes out over her
objectification, first in bars and now on this show (on CBS,
judicious editing made it seem she was just upset that people in
the house didn't like her). Brittany got all lachrymose because
William accused her of bandwagoning on his outsider status. Josh is
fretting that the group is too dull and the show will get canceled
(hey, he's smarter than he looks).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's OK to laugh at these rubes and their penny-ante
travails _ they've put this all on themselves by wanting to appear
on the show. But CBS was perhaps fatally cavalier to think that the
network could contain the humiliation and toxic emotions to the CBS
Radford lot in Studio City, where the BB minimum-security prison
sits baking in the Valley sun.
</P>
<P>
   One dreads the next revelation: Did attorney Curtis successfully
defend a monolithic corporation against the family of a man killed
by one of its products (or puncture someone's eardrums with his
operatic crooning)? Did Jamie, Washington state's idea of a beauty
queen, have an opponent kneecapped before a beauty pageant? Is the
lipstick Brittany smears on daily from a company that tests its
products on animals kidnapped from dewy-eyed children? Did Jordan
break a boyfriend's heart by profiting on more than mere glimpses
of her body? Does Eddie buy human body parts on eBay? Does William
secretly mail Spike Lee videos to rednecks, causing coronaries
across the Deep South? Is someone a closet racist infuriated by
William's antics?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a queasy politicization has subtly emerged on the show
in the racial arena: Cassandra, at age 37, is the only person who
doesn't seem to have a clear-cut counterpart of the opposite sex.
William, the only other African-American in the house, is about a
decade younger than she, and George, the man closest to her age, is
married. Like much Hollywood entertainment, this show has cast a
black woman in an asexual role.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, William has largely been depicted trying to instigate
mischief, passionately discussing race issues, or flirting and
verbally fencing with the white women his age. Is it just a
coincidence that William _ despite the fact that he's virtually the
only housemate even trying to mix things up and keep things
interesting for us poor viewers _ ranked near the bottom of the
popularity polls being maintained on the Internet and was likely to
be the first inmate booted out even before his Nation of Islam ties
came out?
</P>
<P>
   If he claims racism contributed to his ouster, he'll at least be
partially correct (all-American disdain for a certain kind of
self-satisfied iconoclasm will be a culprit, as well). But many of
William's well-reasoned race-based opinions will now be tainted by
his extremist ties. What was CBS' agenda with the racial makeup of
its casting?
</P>
<P>
   And everyone understood from the outset that the network has
some sort of agenda. One question I've been hearing a lot: How much
is CBS controlling the houseguests' behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Unless they've been ordered to be as dull as possible, the
network is likely letting things transpire as they will (or, so
far, won't). The houseguests should understand their responsibility
toward making this show a success. So far, though, save for
William, they haven't, really.
</P>
<P>
   The constancy of that query, however, underscores viewers'
distrust of the proceedings: We (ITAL)expect(END ITAL) the show to
be manipulated. Big Brother does nothing to help the houseguests
(well, OK, he healed the chicken), but constantly confounds them:
Instructions of all sorts are left in the Red Room, from those
goofy challenges to conversation topics. So it wouldn't be
unreasonable to expect BB to tweak George's lingering guilt by
suggesting the group discuss death, or to force another meltdown
from Jordan (or, really, anyone) by asking: Where do you draw the
line in terms of maintaining personal dignity?
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when the houseguests are provoked into griping
about old flames or complaining about their family or slagging
enemies, and begin naming names? Several inmates seem bratty or
petty enough to settle scores in this fashion. Granted, this is
more likely to occur on the Internet than on CBS, but can easily
seep its way into the mainstream. Could a casual acquaintance with
one of the BB 10 disrupt (ITAL)your(END ITAL) life when one of them
starts talking about ``this guy I know who has this twisted hobby
...''?
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty clear: Big Brother is Loki, the Norse god of chaos,
and the 10 (soon, nine) are a modern-day Donner Party going nowhere
fast. But did anyone stop to consider how many other lives beyond
the purview of those ubiquitous cameras would be cannibalized
before the last houseguest staggers off the CBS Radford lot? &QL;

   &QL; 
IF YOU GO &QL; 
RATES: Carnival's 7-day cruise of the Mexican Riviera starts at
$809 per person, double occupancy, for an off-peak trip booked far
in advance. Standard brochure rates start at $1,339 in peak season
($1,1139 off-peak) for an interior cabin. For a porthole, expect to
add $200 to those rates; for a window, slightly more. Fares are
discounted for a third or fourth occupant in a cabin. &QL; 
INFORMATION: Carnival Cruise Lines can be reached at (800)
227-6482. Web: www.carnival.com. &QL; 
MEXICO CRUISE TIPS &QL; 
WALKING AROUND MONEY: Before leaving, go to your bank and get
single dollar bills. A lot of singles; maybe $50 worth. There are
countless opportunities to tip on this trip: dock porters, ship
porters, land-tour guides and bus drivers, cab drivers, deliveries
to your cabin, musical entertainment, cabin stewards, waiters, bus
boys (although the latter three are customarily tipped once, at the
end of the cruise). Elation cabins are outfitted with room safes,
which you can customize with the swipe of any credit card (I used
Chevron), so you can keep the excess dollar bills _ along with
other spare cash, your passport, camera, etc. _ secure during the
cruise. No need to change money into pesos; Mexican service
providers prefer U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
   PHONING HOME: Tell your loved ones you'll write post cards but
might not call. Satellite calls from the ship cost about $10 per
minute. I tried to circumvent this by calling from a pay phone on
the Puerto Vallarta dock, using my American Express card. A
three-minute call to Los Angeles, operator-assisted (the only
option available), was billed to my card as $29.95. At several pay
phones in Cabo San Lucas, meanwhile, it was impossible to use any
American credit card _ only direct-dial calls with peso coins
(you'd need a wheelbarrow full) or collect calls were permitted. A
Mexican operator said the use of AT&AMP;T calling cards had to be
discontinued because of a high incidence of fraud. Cell phones
won't work at sea; they can be hit and miss on land.
</P>
<P>
   QUENCHING A THIRST: The don't-drink-the-water adage in Mexico is
no joke; it's strongly advisable. Unfortunately, the ship's store
does not stock bottled water. Instead, Evian is available as a bar
or room-service item, like Coke or martinis (with prices to match).
Try this: Pick up a six-pack of quart water bottles at the
supermarket and pack some in your luggage, the remainder in a
carry-on bag. That way, you'll have about one bottle available per
day _ particularly important when you go ashore. And as you discard
the bottles, this will give you extra packing space for shopping
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   APPETITE ISSUES: Beg, plead, whine for a late dinner seating.
Believe it or not, this cruise travels significantly east, not just
south, such that you set your clocks back an hour on each of the
first two nights. If you're stuck with the early seating (6 p.m.),
this means dining the third day at the equivalent of 4 p.m. Pacific
time. The word is out on this one, though. On the first day, a few
members of our dinner table (including me) submitted formal
requests for a switch to late seating; all were politely denied. &QL;

the entertainment here.

</P>
<P>
   Particularly popular with kids is the Elation's corkscrew water
slide, which whisks its riders into the ship's seawater pool.

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
OFF MEXICO'S WEST COAST _ It's not difficult to ascertain why some
people favor a cruise ship as their primary mode of transportation
on a visit to Mexico. All you have to do is leaf through a few
guidebooks on the country, paying particular attention to the
sections on driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. insurance is invalid in Mexico'' (Frommer's); ``an
uninsured accident is a crime under Mexican law, which presumes the
defendant guilty until proven innocent'' (Hidden Baja); ``do not
drive after dark if at all possible'' (AAA TravelBook); ``driving
in Mexico ... almost inevitably involves at least one brush with
bureaucracy or the law'' (Mexico: The Rough Guide); ``cavernous
potholes,'' ``banditos who favor the cover of darkness'' (Fodor's).
</P>
<P>
   On a cruise ship, someone else takes the wheel _ or at least the
rudder. And on a vacation excursion far south of the United States
border, that can reduce the anxiety quotient considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, on a recent weeklong Mexican Riviera cruise on
Carnival's Elation, after a few encounters with passengers, one
fact became unmistakable: You wouldn't want some of these people in
control of a motorized anything.
</P>
<P>
   Before we'd even untied from the dock in San Pedro, at the
compulsory lifeboat drill, one woman was already so drunk she
couldn't get her life jacket on. Another passenger arrived with his
lifejacket securely buckled in place _ and a cocktail in hand. The
following day, an elderly, tattooed man in a sleeveless Dodgers
jersey was grumbling about his inability to find a bar open so he
could get a beer; it was 7:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The casino jangled with life nearly at all hours. One evening,
the Dance Till Ya Drop bash at the Jekyll &AMP; Hyde Dance Club didn't
even (ITAL)begin(END ITAL) until midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival has a well-established reputation for throwing one
whale of a party on its cruises, and while its mass-market pricing
obviously has considerable appeal for families and seniors, the
Elation fairly bobbed with raucous diversions throughout our trip.
</P>
<P>
   As with most cruises, this is not a vacation for travelers who
like to be independent _ exploring on their own, operating without
a schedule, contriving their own entertainment. Rather, it is ideal
for someone who doesn't want to deal with the fuss of finding a
hotel in the dark, fumbling with unfamiliar words on the menu ...
or deciphering Spanish-language road signs on blind, unlit curves.
</P>
<P>
   If you're prepared _ eager, even _ to turn off your mind for a
few days, this is the trip for you. It features a dawn-to-wee-hours
orchestration of amusements in a setting that brings to mind the
Sahara Hotel if it were suddenly to slip its Las Vegas foundation
and slide into Lake Mead.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday-to-Sunday, year-round itinerary is well-geared to
urban dwellers who have wound themselves into knots, in that the
first two full days are spent at sea, cruising along Mexico's
coast. This provides ample daytime opportunities for sunning and
snoozing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, right about the time the restlessness begins to set in for
many, there are three consecutive days of port calls _ at Puerto
Vallarta, Mazatlan and (briefly) Cabo San Lucas. Pick the right
shore tours on the first two stops and you can get a look at
Mexico's interior: ancient churches, bustling villages, workers
making pottery, furniture and adobe bricks.
</P>
<P>
   It was exhilarating to be out on the open ocean the first couple
of days. The low mountains of the Baja California peninsula
provided companionship much of the way _ as did an enormous pod of
dolphins that played in the wake one morning. This mode of travel
kind of puts you in touch with other seafarers _ Hurtado, Drake,
Cavendish, Cochrane _ who plied and occasionally plundered these
waters during a period of 300 years before things finally quieted
down in the mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Most of our passengers seemed to be drawn to the pool area
amidships, an area that has the aspect of a giant sun-tanning
reflector shield (two-story wind screens all around). Deck loungers
are positioned edge to edge, and a convoluted, corkscrew water
slide sends kids and a few infantile adults hurtling into the
seawater pool (alas, the security guards only let us use it for
short periods each day).
</P>
<P>
   And there is a stage. If extended moments of silence cause you
to get antsy, you'll delight in this. It never seems to rest. On
the first morning, as at least one passenger nearby was trying to
plunge into the opening pages of ``The Milagro Beanfield War,'' the
frenzy of the morning aerobics class diffused into the country
dance lesson, which gave way to the reggae band with the amplified,
pile-driver snare drum. (It seemed relentless, but most everyone
else, sucking on rum drinks in tall, pink glasses, bobbed
delightedly to the rhythm.) Then came the hula-hoop contest.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a quiet place to read or contemplate the
vast expanse of sea, you might want to repair to the forward tip of
the uppermost Sun Deck. There, you hear only the wind rushing
overhead, the radar equipment spinning innocuously and the clatter
of shuffleboard disks on the wood decking.
</P>
<P>
   For indoor serenity, this cruise offered a pleasant surprise. A
few years ago, Carnival began supplementing its high-energy troupe
of hoofers, crooners and DJs with classical musicians. On this
trip, three young adultsfrom Poland _ pianist, violinist, cellist _
set up at various times each day for performances that often took
on the feel of recitals.
</P>
<P>
   The trio played daily at high tea in the Musical Cafe, which
often resulted in a curious scene: the musicians pouring their
energies into a Loeillet sonata as white-gloved waiters served tea
and delicate, layered pastries ... to people in tank tops and damp
bathing suits.
</P>
<P>
   The higher-brow entertainment might be a subtle nod to Joe
Farcus, the architect of the 2-year-old Elation, who fashioned the
ship's interior design after the Muses of Greek mythology. Examine
the ship's elaborate decor closely and you might detect Clio's
scrolls, Terpsichore's lyre, etc. Various public rooms, meanwhile,
are christened after such figures of music and letters as Cole
Porter, Duke Ellington, Gilbert and Sullivan, Mark Twain, Robert
Louis Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, though: The ship doesn't take itself too seriously.
It is still, at its core, a Carnival party boat.
</P>
<P>
   One night in the Mikado Lounge, the dancers were kicking up a
storm in a Vegas-style (or at least Laughlin) show titled
``Rhythm,'' although some of the music was cleaned up for the
family audience. You couldn't help but wince when the J. Geils
lyric ``My angel is a centerfold'' was somehow mutilated into ``My
girl is on the calendar.''
</P>
<P>
   Another mild disappointment came later when the piano bar opened
for the evening. This seemed a great opportunity to perhaps hear
(or even sing along on) the chestnuts of Jerome Kern, Sammy Cahn,
Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. But the piano man opened up with
the Mickey Mouse Club theme before segueing into the Oscar Mayer
wiener song. Fearing that the ``Gilligan's Island'' theme had to be
just around the corner, I ducked out. But everyone else in the
joint seemed to be thrilled silly.
</P>
<P>
   A few nights into the cruise, one entertainment option was
particularly well-received. In Puerto Vallarta, Carnival has
contracted with some local folk dancers, a nine-piece mariachi band
and even a young charro who does exotic lariat tricks. They come on
board just before the ship's 10 p.m. sailing, deliver a brisk
half-hour show in the main showroom, then scoot off the ship, the
gangway literally being pulled up right behind them. It was an
excellent show, and there was standing room only for this fleeting
glimpse of folklorico.
</P>
<P>
   What do the passengers' young children do during all of this
revelry? Throughout the cruise, there seemed to be extensive
provision for them.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, Camp Carnival operates as kind of a seabound
child-care program, with youth directors overseeing activities for
different age groups. (For toddlers: coloring, video cartoons,
Legos, story time, computer games.) At night, baby-sitting _ in the
guise of a pajama party _ is available until 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise line also constructed a Children's World play room in
an area that housed penthouse suites in previous incarnations of
this ship class (demand for the suites reportedly was slack).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's proven to be very, very popular,'' said Elation hotel
manager Aaron Thomas. ``The kids love having their own place. They
don't have to hang out with Mom and Dad all day.'' He added that
during the summer months ``we're chockablock with kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of its success in marketing to families, Carnival's
reputation as a singles-friendly line still holds up on its Mexican
Riviera run _ at least judging from the turnout at the
opening-night mixer held for them. But it's probably advisable to
travel in a group, or at least to bring along a friend or relative
so you won't be randomly matched up with a roommate.
</P>
<P>
   My wife couldn't make this trip, and I discovered the first
night that solo travelers are gathered together at one desperate
dinner table. One older man arrived at our table, which was set for
12, and took a seat at the extreme side, directly opposite our
meager huddle of three early arrivals. When a member of our clutch
asked the fellow if he would like to join us, he lowered his menu
and said without smiling, ``No, I think I'd prefer to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   After we were all assembled, the excruciating conversation
bounced from high-tech stocks to roommates who snore to the
irregularity of bus service in San Francisco to the merits of not
going outdoors. It brought to mind the scene in ``Animal House''
where Flounder and Pinto are shunted into a roomful of misfits at
the snobby fraternity's pledge party, and the smarmy frat guy says,
``You should have (ITAL)lots(END ITAL) to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   After two nights of this, it seemed preferable to opt for the
ship's alternate dining choice, the Tiffany buffet. The food wasn't
nearly as elaborate or good _in fact, it was fairly ordinary _ but
at least there were carving stations and a considerable salad bar,
plus one feature the main dining room couldn't match: the
opportunity to take your food outside to a deck table and dine in
the fresh, tropical air, the ocean ripping past far below.
</P>
<P>
   This seemed like a particularly viable option as the ship left
Mazatlan _ precisely at the hour of the early dinner seating. The
craggy rock formations that protrude from the water at the harbor's
mouth were dazzling in the setting sun; the prospect of another
night at the solo travelers' table couldn't possibly compete with
this.
</P>
<P>
   Another departure from port was also memorable, for different
reasons. As we pulled out of Puerto Vallarta late at night (right
after the Mexican folk dancers and musicians disembarked), a deck
party was convened at the main pool area. Before long, it seemed as
if the entire passenger list of 2,200 had turned out for it (pajama
party be damned).
</P>
<P>
   The Lido Stage dance floor was packed solid. The reggae band had
that pile-driver snare drum going again. Waiters scurried about in
the dark, dispensing blue margaritas (keep the souvenir glass) for
all they were worth. The only food available at this juncture in
the gluttony calendar was pizza and frozen yogurt in the Tiffany
room, and, duly, I spotted a guy woofing pizza and frozen yogurt
simultaneously. The ``'70s fun and games'' were due to begin in an
hour. The ``R-rated'' stand-up comedy act was to commence in one of
the bars at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   On this cruise, they were assured a party. They got it.

   &QL; 
COPALA, Mexico _ It's the faces that are unforgettable. Even now,
nearly two months later, they remain fixed in the memory. In one
case, gnawing at it.
</P>
<P>
   There was the schoolboy here in Copala who was positively
entranced by a key-chain thermometer that hung from a day-pack
zipper.
</P>
<P>
   There was the old woman in Las Palmas whose smile liberated a
glare of silver-capped teeth. She mistakenly thought a visitor's
eight-word sentence in Spanish meant fluency, and she prattled on
and on with obvious pride about the granddaughter who clutched her
hand.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the girl of about 8 in the adobe brick yard on the
outskirts of Mazatlan. She was barefoot, filthy ... and adorably
bright-eyed, disguising her begging by offering tiny packs of
Chiclet gum for sale.
</P>
<P>
   When the Carnival cruise ship Elation arrives in port on its
7-day Mexican Riviera trip, many passengers seem to opt for
ocean-based activities: deep-sea fishing, snorkel trips, a day at a
beach.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want a fleeting glimpse into Mexican working life _
and into some of these faces _ two shore tours offered through the
cruise line provide the opportunity. They are excursions into the
coastal interior, the 3 1/2-hour Countryside Adventure ($21 per
adult) out of Puerto Vallarta, and the 7-hour Sierra Madre Tour
($41) out of Mazatlan.
</P>
<P>
   By no means do these excursions represent the best way to get a
sense of the land and its people, but when a floating city of 2,200
Americans ties up at the dock for a day, some obvious logistical
challenges are created.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple tours embark on these itineraries, such that during my
visit in May, at a small pottery and furniture factory outside
Concordia, four motor coaches and a van crowded the road's
shoulder, and tourists outnumbered craftsmen perhaps 20 to 1.
Moments later, the same groups besieged an 18th-century church in
Concordia. Still, these tours have their merit.
</P>
<P>
   In Ixtapa (a Puerto Vallarta suburb, not the resort near
Acapulco), guide Gerardo Hernandez directed us to a beautiful
little church, which boasted inlaid tile, superb brick work and an
exterior festooned with flowering plants.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, members of our group swarmed through it like locusts,
talking loudly, blithely filming everything in sight, some men
forgetting the single request Hernandez had issued _ to remove
hats. I felt sorry for the lone village woman who sat in one of the
pews, gazing toward the altar and gamely seeking to worship amid
this bedlam.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as we rode deeper into the coastal hills, we spotted a
man turning the earth in his field _ with a manual plow pulled by a
mule.
</P>
<P>
   One member of our group hounded Hernandez with crass questions
about economics, each of which this proud Puerto Vallarta native
fielded deftly. How much does a doctor earn here? ``It's like in
your country: A good doctor makes more than a bad doctor.'' How
much do houses cost here (as we passed through a particularly
depressed rural village)? ``They are passed down through the
families, so they are more valuable for that reason than for
money.''
</P>
<P>
   In Las Palmas, women emerged from their homes to sweep stoops
and even the edge of the roadway as our bus passed through.
</P>
<P>
   It was here, at the town plaza, that the grandmother was
exhibiting such pride in the girl of about 3 who held her hand.
Through the rapid-fire Spanish, I was able to make out one
particularly amusing point. Turns out the little girl was
transfixed by one member of our group, a guy with a full white
beard whom this toddler was convinced was Santa Claus arriving
early.
</P>
<P>
   The fear here is that she'll grow up thinking Old St. Nick has
tattoos on both forearms, occasionally wears knee-length denim
shorts, and, over an ample belly that shakes like a bowlful of
jelly, is known to stretch a T-shirt that bears the message: ``To
drink or not to drink ... what a stupid question.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, outside Mazatlan, our Sierra Madre Tour made a
stop at a yard where laborers make adobe bricks under an oppressive
tropical sun. They get $16 per 1,000 bricks, which kind of
determines their working pace, said our guide, Alfonso Salman.
</P>
<P>
   We were besieged by several younger boys, who begged for money
when they weren't wrestling with one another in the dust. It was
also here that the girl of about 8 was selling her gum. A 20-peso
note _ all of $1.80 _ was burning a hole in my pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, don't give these kids anything,'' Salman said. He
explained that the kids should be in school, but their parents send
them out here, and the only way to discourage the practice is to
send them home empty- handed. (Hernandez had issued the same
earnest plea the day before in Las Palmas.) As a visitor to this
country, it seemed appropriate to respect the wishes of a presumed
authority figure.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after we proceeded to Copala after the brick-yard visit,
something seemed amiss. As we arrived at this former silver-mining
town tucked into a cleft of the Sierra Madre Mountains _ now
restored down to the cobblestone streets and obviously mining a
rich vein of tourist green _ school-age kids were everywhere
selling their hand-crafted wares. They were well-groomed, wearing
clean uniforms and new shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Salman said vaguely, ``There are two sessions of school, morning
and afternoon, and these kids are between sessions.'' But
unexplained was why the kids were on the street, hawking wares,
throughout our entire stay.
</P>
<P>
   A suspicion crept in: Maybe we were discouraged from giving
money to the urchins at the adobe yard so we wouldn't experience
largesse-overload before arriving at this thriving community, which
obviously stood in much better stead with the tour operators.
</P>
<P>
   Tour buses crowded the town's edge, and guides literally
communicated with hand signals as they directed their gaggles of
tourists through the streets. (``OK, my group's done with the
animal-skin gallery; all yours.'')
</P>
<P>
   When we were herded to lunch at a small patio restaurant, the
proprietor's stereo was playing a rousing version of ``La
Charreada'' _ but any hope of discovering an obscure Mexican torch
singer evaporated with the realization that this was the voice of
Linda Ronstadt.
</P>
<P>
   Copala has so much political clout that a few soldiers carrying
automatic weapons roamed its streets during our visit. At first
their presence was unsettling and perplexing, but later it made
sense. Money is all but tumbling out of pockets when the tour
patrons descend on this remote mountain town. It would take only
one well-timed strike by highwaymen _ and the adverse publicity
that would surely result _ to effectively wipe out the Sierra Madre
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Copala that the young boy in the plaza, urged on by
his amigos, approached to express such fascination with the
key-chain thermometer. After hearing a rudimentary explanation of
its function, he asked in Spanish, ``Is this for me?''
</P>
<P>
   Later, back amid the comparative opulence of the cruise ship,
headed for home, I wished I had given that $3.99 thermometer to
him. I also wish I'd had more time to talk with _ or at least
listen to _ the grandmother with the gleaming bridgework as she
held forth on granddaughters and Christmas myths.
</P>
<P>
   And I really, really wish I'd slipped that 20-peso note to the
little girl with the haunting expression at the brick yard. &QL;

TAKE ME OUT TO THE COUNTERFACTUAL BALLGAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 (Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.)  
David Carkeet is the author of three novels featuring the linguist
Jeremy Cook: ``Double Negative,'' ``The Full Catastrophe'' and
``The Error of Our Ways.'' William Safire is on vacation. 
 By DAVID CARKEET   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; For of all sad words of tongue or pen, &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The saddest are these: ``It might have been!'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ John Greenleaf Whittier
</P>
<P>
   In sports, there is a great deal of talk about what might have
been. Players point to if-then turning points: ``If the ball had
cleared the fence, we would have won.'' But they don't always say
it like that. Sometimes they say it this way: ``If the ball clears
the fence, we win.''
</P>
<P>
   Let me hasten to point out that the moment in question is over.
The events that happened _ and did not happen _ are in the past.
The ball did not clear the fence; ``we'' did not win. Although the
speaker is describing a  &UR; past &LR;  incident that did not come about (a
counterfactual), the speaker is using the  &UR; present &LR;  tense to
narrate the nonevent.
</P>
<P>
   The construction is common in sports and goes back at least as
far as a 1984 San Diego Union-Tribune story, in which a losing
ballplayer recalls a bases-loaded, shoe-top catch by the Chicago
Cubs outfielder Keith Moreland: ``To me, that was the turning
point. If that ball gets by Moreland, we've got three runs and
we're back in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Note the shift from the first sentence, an ordinary assertion
about the past (``that was the turning point''), to the second
sentence, where the present tense undoes a past-time fact.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball pitchers live regret-filled lives, and their postgame
comments provide many examples. The San Francisco Giants pitcher
Robb Nen rues an August 1998 homer that he gave up: ``I left the
ball over the middle, and he did what he wanted to do with it. If I
get it a little inside or a little outside, maybe he gets a hit,
but probably not a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinal Rick Croushore laments his failure to
field a ball cleanly in a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks:
``If I make that play, maybe it's a different game.'' Another
Cardinal pitcher, Lance Painter, bemoans an umpire's call that
proved decisive in a loss to the Cubs: ``But if that call goes our
way, it's a 1-1 game going into the fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   To a historian of the language, the emergence of a new meaning
for an old tense is an earth-shaking event, and yet the
counterfactual present tense has sneaked into usage without notice.
</P>
<P>
   It is to be found in many sports; I have culled examples from
football, basketball, soccer and golf. Tiger Woods used it
wistfully about his fifth-place finish in the Masters: ``If those
putts go in at 10 and 11 ...'' But it occurs most often in
baseball, a game that habitually offers from its humdrum rhythm a
pivotal moment for our contemplation, a crisis in which a single
player stands alone as hero or goat. It is this characteristic that
breeds the old what-might-have-been.
</P>
<P>
   How the new construction came about is not at all obvious.
Linguistic change usually involves a gradual mechanism. ``Smug''
used to mean ``neat,'' but it took on negative meaning by virtue of
a slow shift, year by year, from a preponderance of positive uses
to a preponderance of negative ones until the scale finally tipped.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to imagine a comparable step-wise process that
takes us gradually from (a) to (b) below, from the conventional
past-perfect expression for a past event that did not happen to the
new present-tense way of saying it: (a) ``If the ball had cleared
the fence, we would have won''; (b) ``If the ball clears the fence,
we win.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, (b) has existed all along with a different meaning _
to express a future possibility. Even today, although it would be
decidedly uncool, an eager rookie could shout (b) from the dugout
in the bottom of the ninth inning, while the ball is in flight and
its destination is yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Note the time reference _ the rookie is looking ahead, into the
future, yet he is using the present tense. Therein lies the
probable explanation for the form of the construction. The English
present is an all-purpose tense, used for definitions (``a triangle
has three sides''), general facts (``the towhee sings
`drink-your-tea'''), recurring actions (``I fish in Vermont''),
future possibilities (our eager rookie's shout) and even, in the
historical present, past facts (``At this point, Hermann the German
annihilates the Roman legions'').
</P>
<P>
   The hard-working present tense has taken on one more job, a
blend of the last two functions above, now referring to a past
possibility that was not realized.
</P>
<P>
   The sports counterfactual is an oral, short, peppery
construction that feels inappropriate to the analysis of complex
events. Try this, for example: ``If the Californian responds to the
Titanic's distress signals, not a soul is lost.'' Or this: ``If
Nixon shaves before the debate, there is no Camelot.'' These
retrospective sentences are offensively glib. They sound like
something John Madden would cry out from the broadcast booth,
waving his arms as he rewrites the historical record.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for negative reasons, the sports counterfactual, unlike a
smash by Sosa or McGwire, will probably never leave the ballpark.
But there is a positive sense in which the new construction suits
the world of athletics. To play sports is to fail, sometimes
agonizingly, and declaring that the outcome could have been
different gives one solace.
</P>
<P>
   Using the present tense to express this alternative _ that is,
using the same tense you would use if you were really looking ahead
at an outcome still to be determined _ casts these events into a
land of perpetual potential. ``If the ball clears the fence, we
win.'' The ax has not yet fallen; the opposing players' fists are
not yet raised in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The thwarted outcome, preserved in an eternal present, exists
robustly in the imagination of those who live and die by the
vicissitudes of the game.

CALCIUM AND ARTERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Some coronary artery obstructions are described as calcified.
How do they develop? Should calcium-rich foods be avoided?
</P>
<P>
   A. Heart doctors generally suggest consuming plenty of calcium,
though seeking out low-fat dairy products; fat and cholesterol are
thought to be risky, not calcium.
</P>
<P>
   As people age, ``The Mayo Clinic Heart Book'' explains, the
smooth, elastic artery walls normally become thicker, and their
calcium content increases, in effect hardening all arteries to some
degree. But the dangerous type of hardening called atherosclerosis
involves chiefly the large arteries, including the coronary
arteries. The inner layers of the walls become thick and irregular,
and some areas accumulate fats, cholesterol and other materials.
Initially, the deposits are only streaks of fatty cells. But as
they enlarge, they may invade deeper layers, with scarring and
calcium deposits. Large areas are called atheromas or plaque.
</P>
<P>
   Plaque has a firm shell that may contain calcium deposited from
the blood along with areas of fatty material and a center of soft
cholesterol. The shell may break open, exposing the inner part, and
a blood clot tends to develop at this site. Such a clot may reduce
blood flow so much that chest pain or a heart attack results.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent studies suggest that calcified areas of plaque may
be more stable than those where the buildup is chiefly fatty, and
that they may be less likely to rupture and cause a heart attack.  &QR;

&HT;     CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS GROUP PEACEFULLY GOES ABOUT ITS
BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   GUILDERLAND, N.Y. _ They don't smoke, drink or watch television.
And though their numbers rival groups like the Moonies or
Rajneeshees, this conservative Christian sect has managed to remain
virtually unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders call them ``Two by Twos'' because ministers travel in
pairs to convert new members. But to those who follow the austere
lifestyle prescribed by the sect, which rejects churches and other
institutions, the religion does not have a name and is referred to
simply as ``The Way'' or ``The Truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1921, three generations of the Knaggs family have hosted a
large, somber, spiritual retreat called a ``convention'' at their
dairy farm. Each summer, an estimated 800 people, mostly from the
Northeast, descend on the farm for a four-day religious event.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the large number, most neighbors and officials in the
suburban Albany town knew little about the group's existence until
last month. That is when the town got a tip that four buildings on
the 165-acre farm near the Watervliet Reservoir violated health and
safety codes. The owners had represented the buildings as farm
sheds, but when the town's building inspector visited the site, he
found men's and women's dormitories, washrooms and cooking
facilities inside the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Town and county officials have ordered the owners to make sure
the buildings, septic systems and other facilities meet state code
by the time the event starts on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have these mass gatherings, you want to make sure an
accident doesn't happen,'' said town Supervisor Ken Runion.
</P>
<P>
   A Scottish evangelist, William Irvine, founded the group at the
turn of the century in Ireland as a reaction to organized religion.
For a time, the sect was highly visible, and it spread quickly to
other English-speaking countries. But then the group's charismatic
leader began to deviate from the sect's principal ideas, arguing
that the end of the world was approaching and that ministers should
stop converting new members. Irvine was banished in 1914, said
Benton Johnson, a sociologist who has studied the sect, and the
group developed an aura of secrecy and anonymity that has endured.
</P>
<P>
   The most fascinating aspect about the group, and the key to its
survival, said Johnson, has been its refusal to be named or
identified. When a reporter asked a local minister, Charles
Steffen, what his group is called, he responded enigmatically:
``The greatest name there is, is our father's name.''
</P>
<P>
   Members dress conservatively, but not in a manner that draws
attention. They don't observe special eating rituals. They have no
churches, literature or pamphlets, other than the King James
version of the Bible. They are not incorporated as a tax-exempt
religious group. They send their children to public schools.
Without a name, the group has managed to avert some of the
publicity and problems that smaller sects and cults have attracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very clever strategy,'' said Johnson, a retired
sociology professor at the University of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are no churches, Two by Twos hold Sunday meetings
in their homes. They believe the only path to salvation is by
earning it, through simple living and the teachings of a minister
(you can't be saved on your own). Ministers survive on the
donations of members and are called by their first name. The sect
traces its roots to the birth of Jesus, not the worldly Irvine, and
places its emphasis on Matthew's gospel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell people to get back to the simple life of the
scripture,'' said Steffen. ``It's more of a fellowship or a family
than an organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the group shares some of the characteristics of a cult,
its members take a largely passive view of the world and are not
violent, scholars say. The Guilderland police have directed traffic
at the close of the gatherings but otherwise have had no reason to
visit the farm, said Chief James Murley.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Guilderland, two other gatherings are held in the
Northeast, one on a farm in western New York and another on a farm
in Milford, N.H. There are about 85 convention sites across the
country.

   But the group and its ministers have also attracted criticism
from former members. A West Texan, Gene DeVoll, blew the whistle on
Knaggs Farm last month. DeVoll, who left the group after he got
divorced in 1996, said he reported the violations because he is
troubled by the leadership's secrecy and lack of accountability. He
has never visited the Guilderland farm but got his information from
a member.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men are very controlling,'' he said. ``They hide their
money. They wear $600 suits and have $20,000 credit card bills. And
yet they stand up and preach `I have nothing to my name.'''
</P>
<P>
   All property is owned by individuals who, like the Knaggs, use
it for the good of the movement. ``We charge no admission or other
fees, nor do we take any collections,'' Albert Knaggs, a minister,
said in a prepared statement. ``We have not advertised our
gathering, nor have we sought to hide it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knaggs are now at work making changes to the farm to comply
with code requirements. The Two by Twos expect to hold their
convention this summer, as they do every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not a public gathering,'' Steffen said. ``It's a
gathering of believers. We haven't had any illnesses or problems.
We've been very careful. We want to do what's right.''

NEW SYRIAN LEADER KEEPS HARD LINE ON ISRAEL IN INAUGURAL SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ In his inaugural speech as president of Syria,
Bashar Assad focused Monday on fixing his country's ailing economy
and gave no sign he would be any more flexible than his father was
in negotiating a peace deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, an ophthalmologist by training, officially began a
seven-year term after taking the oath of office before the
250-member Syrian Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   He has been running the country since the death of his father,
Hafez Assad, on June 10. In a referendum last week, in which the
choice was saying ``yes'' or ``no'' to Assad's presidency, he won
the approval of 97 percent of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Recovering the Golan Heights, the Syrian plateau that was
occupied by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, is a top priority,
Assad said. But he repeated the formulaic language of his father in
adding that Syria would not make peace unless all of the Golan was
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``However long it takes, this land is ours and it will return to
us in full,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations have been frozen since
mid-January, mainly over the future of a small strip of land that
borders the Sea of Galilee, the major source of Israel's water.
Syria has insisted on regaining its piece of shoreline, while
Israel has sought to maintain control over access to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   American and European efforts over the last nine years have
failed to find a compromise that satisfied both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Many Western diplomats had hoped that Assad, who was an infant
when Syria lost the Golan Heights, would bring a less ideological
approach to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   His father, who was defense minister during the 1967 war and
president in 1973 when Syria failed to regain the Golan in renewed
fighting, repeatedly proclaimed that any compromise with Israel
would tarnish Arab dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Assad's speech, his first major policy address, was
devoted to economic issues. He pledged to reform the Syrian
economy, which remains largely state-controlled and dependent on
oil exports, by streamlining the government bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, who spoke about the need for modernization but
approved few changes in Syria's laws and ubiquitous security
apparatus, the new president pledged to move slowly. Economic
change, he said, will come about step by step.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian business owners, who have labored under a system with no
private banks and strict controls on currency flows, have urged a
major overhaul of the economic system.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, who is 34, began his tenure by eschewing the
state-orchestrated personality cult that his father cultivated.
Syrian newspapers, which are all run by the state, said he did not
want to see his picture adorning every public and private building.
</P>
<P>
   But he also made a point in his inaugural speech of saying he
did not intend to pursue political reform that would threaten the
dominance of the one-party system that his father built.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom of expression should be encouraged, he said, but in the
form of ``positive criticism'' of government policies. Democracy as
practiced in the West, he added, can not and should not be grafted
onto Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have our own democracy to match our history and
culture, arising from the needs of our people and our reality,'' he
said.

CAFFEINE FOUND IN SEATTLE WATERS; MEDITERRANEAN ALGAE MIGRATES TO
SAN DIEGO; AND SUGAR DISCOVERED IN SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COFFEE EVERYWHERE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The jitters brought on by too much coffee can ruin many a
delicate, hands-on scientific experiment. But too much coffee, it
seems, has ruined a much larger experiment in the latte capital of
the world, Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Water-quality experts with King County, which includes Seattle,
have abandoned plans to use caffeine as a tracer to determine where
treated waste water flows when it enters Puget Sound. The problem,
they found, is that caffeine is everywhere in the sound.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Mickelson, a water quality planner with the county, said
that caffeine had been thought to have great potential as a tracer
because it was not found naturally in the local environment but got
into the waste water through coffee drinking. The idea was to
analyze water samples in the sound for caffeine concentration to
determine where plumes of effluent traveled.
</P>
<P>
   But the scientists found small concentrations of caffeine in
nearly all of the samples, totaling more than 200, that they
gathered. ``It's all over the place,'' Mickelson said. Because the
sound has about the same concentration of caffeine everywhere, it
couldn't be used to determine any kind of gradient that would track
waste water flow.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Mickelson said, is that a lot of coffee apparently
ends up in storm drains, and then goes directly into the sound.
``We have an awful lot of sidewalk baristas out here, he said,
``and at the end of the day, the dregs go out into storm drains.''
</P>
<P>
   TROUBLESOME ALGAE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A feather-like algae that has caused severe ecological problems
in the northwestern Mediterranean has been found for the first time
off the West Coast of the Americas. The algae, Caulerpa taxifolia,
was discovered by divers with a biological consulting firm studying
transplanted eelgrass beds in a coastal lagoon about 20 miles north
of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Caulerpa is native to the tropics, and when introduced into more
temperate waters it quickly crowds out other species as there are
few marine animals that graze on it. It was used for decoration in
saltwater aquariums in Europe starting about two decades ago. Then
in the late 1980s it was found in the Mediterranean (the source was
believed to have been an oceanographic museum in Monaco that
drained its tanks).
</P>
<P>
   The seaweed now covers thousands of acres of the Mediterranean
floor from Croatia to Spain, smothering native sea grass beds that
are the habitat for many other marine organisms. It spreads
rapidly, often carried by the anchors and anchor chains of boats.
</P>
<P>
   Caulerpa had been available for use in home aquariums in the
United States until last year, when its importation was banned. The
San Diego patch probably came from aquarium water dumped into a
storm drain or into the lagoon directly. The patch, which measures
about 60 feet by 30 feet, will be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   CLUES TO EARLY EARTH
</P>
<P>
   To the list of things found in space _ giant planets, dark
matter and the Voyager 2 spacecraft, to name just a few _ can be
added sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers using a radio telescope on Kitt Peak in Arizona have
discovered a simple sugar molecule, glycoaldehyde, in a gas and
dust cloud near the center of the Milky Way. With eight atoms of
carbon, oxygen and hydrogen, it is one of the more complex of the
roughly 120 molecules found in interstellar clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Given the right conditions, glycoaldehyde can combine with other
molecules to form ribose, which is the basis for the nucleic acids
RNA and DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Because the interstellar clouds are the material from which new
stars are made, the finding shows that it is increasingly likely
that some chemicals that are thought of as the precursors to life
formed before the planets developed.
</P>
<P>
   Because in some cases the conditions in a cloud are similar to
conditions on the just-forming earth, the discovery may provide
some insight into how such molecules formed on the early earth, the
astronomers said.

&HT;     IT IS WORTH REPEATING: SLAVERY WAS EVIL  
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CRAGG HINES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reconstruction, it seems after more than a century
and a quarter, was not nearly radical enough.
</P>
<P>
   The latest rancid eruptions of Confederate fervor point to a
culture that was dealt with too leniently. We may know the
political and economic rationale that led to relatively easy
reintegration of the South into the fabric of the nation, but that
doesn't mean we can't regret the current consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Spare me your moss-draped cards and letters. I am the descendant
of slave owners, and a great-grandfather was captured at Vicksburg.
I know veneration of family almost as a religion, a sort of
Southern Shinto, and I revel in it.
</P>
<P>
   But I have no hesitation in saying that slavery was evil and a
despicable cause for rending the republic. I am saddened (not to
mention appalled) that a number of Southerners still cannot seem to
join in this simple statement.
</P>
<P>
   And this heritage and states' rights hogwash with which some
folks try to dress up their racism? Forget it. It's thinner than
the sheets some of this crowd wear on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Manifestations of this illness are well known. Most obvious of
late is the bizarrely zealous defense of the Confederate flag. But
there are other sinister outcroppings, including the recently
formed secessionist Southern Party.
</P>
<P>
   You want to laugh these people off as cranks or badly misguided
nostalgics. But having, within my adult lifetime, seen George C.
Wallace and Orval E. Faubus at work, that's not the best response.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect answer, of course, would be a change of heart, but
let's not hold our breath. Another option is political leadership.
And that's why the speech of George W. Bush to the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People last week was so
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our nation there is no denying that slavery is a blight on
our history,'' Bush said. ``And that racism, despite all the
progress, still exists today.''
</P>
<P>
   Quoting President Lincoln's warning to a divided nation, Bush
went on to say: ``We cannot escape our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, neither can the Texas governor. Less than six
months ago, in the heat of the South Carolina Republican
presidential primary campaign, Bush could not see his way clear to
speak out against the Confederate flag flying above the statehouse
in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insisted the flag question was a local issue. He knew
better. He just wasn't willing to take a chance that South Carolina
Republicans would understand his acting like a leader instead of a
political calculator.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, Bush said at the time that he would refuse the
Confederate flag as a symbol in Texas, and he has recently seen two
commemorative plaques removed from the Texas Supreme Court, one of
which depicted the banner. In the campaign ahead _ and in a Bush
administration if there is another one _ let's hope there will be
more of the NAACP speech and less of the South Carolina posturing.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 100 years, with the exception of the racist fringe
including the Ku Klux Klan, there was little widespread use (much
less adoration) of the Confederate flag until it was dragged from
under the bed in opposition to the civil rights movement. Only then
was it incorporated into some Southern state flags and hoisted atop
the South Carolina Capitol. With these actions, the old flag took
on the official coloration that makes its continued display so
objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never said they can't fly the flag,'' NAACP President
Kweisi Mfume said last week as Confederate sympathizers taunted his
convention-goers in Baltimore. ``We just said they can't fly it on
public buildings, as in South Carolina. If they want to fly it at
home, on the back of their car, wherever, that's property rights,
which I support. That's not our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Mfume was being supremely statesmanlike.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point was the view expressed by NAACP board Chairman
Julian Bond, who called the demonstrators ``apologists for
slavery.'' They are, as Bond said, ``beneath contempt.''

&HT;     PROJECT VOTE SMART A RESPECTABLE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CLAY ROBISON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It is tempting to label Project Vote Smart an
oxymoron, in deference to the disrespect that many voters and
nonvoters alike heap upon our political system and the politicians
who prevail on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it is a project that is attempting to make politics
more respectable by encouraging more people to vote and helping
them to cast their ballots in an informed manner. It is not a task
for the fainthearted, and it is made particularly difficult by
politicians who _ not surprisingly _ are more interested in getting
elected to and remaining in office than in improving the
respectability of their calling.
</P>
<P>
   An informed vote isn't dictated by a certain partisan or
philosophical line. Rather, it is cast by a person who actually
knows something about the candidates and their positions on
relevant issues.
</P>
<P>
   What a concept!
</P>
<P>
   Project Vote Smart's political neutrality is guaranteed by a
board with such diverse selections as Michael Dukakis and Newt
Gingrich. The late Barry Goldwater was a founder, as was George
McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   Funded by member-donors and private foundations, the project
through its Web site and toll-free hotline offers voters a range of
informational services.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, people can use its resources to find out who
represents them in Congress or the Texas Legislature, if they don't
already know _ and many people don't.
</P>
<P>
   Project Vote Smart also offers information on officeholders'
voting records, their evaluations by special interest groups and
candidates' campaign finances.
</P>
<P>
   One of the project's potentially most useful tools is an
ambitious and pretty detailed election-year survey of presidential,
gubernatorial, congressional and state legislative candidates on a
wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, dubbed the National Political Awareness Test, has
been conducted since 1992, but it has never realized its full
potential because many candidates refuse to cooperate, despite
repeated pleas from Project Vote Smart staffers and volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Texas was the first state to have the survey responses from its
congressional and legislative candidates compiled this year, and
the return rate was poor. Only 113 of 374 general election
candidates _ fewer than one in three _ returned the questionnaire
by last week's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Their responses can be viewed on the project's Web site at
www.vote-smart.org or can be obtained by calling 1-888-VOTE-SMART.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also can find out which candidates refused to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Challengers and minor party candidates were more likely to
complete the questions than incumbents because most challengers and
minor party candidates have to scramble for public attention and
are eager to take advantage of any forum to publicize their views.
</P>
<P>
   Most incumbents are more likely to be cautious. More often than
not, they are well-funded by special-interest groups and want to
control the presentation of their messages through paid
advertising, Web sites or news releases. They don't want to answer
questions they have no control over selecting or devising.
</P>
<P>
   They may use the convenient excuse that they are flooded with
questionnaires from various groups and just don't have time to
respond to them.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, they fear that opponents would use their
responses to questions, even to the point of misrepresenting their
answers, to develop campaign attacks against them.
</P>
<P>
   The most noteworthy Texas incumbent to complete this year's
survey was Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who has only
nominal re-election opposition.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush completed the questionnaire during his 1994 and
1998 gubernatorial races. But neither he nor Vice President Al
Gore, the two likely major party nominees, completed the survey for
presidential candidates this year.
</P>
<P>
   So Project Vote Smart filled in the questionnaires for them,
based on the two candidates' statements, speeches and position
papers.
</P>
<P>
   Completing their objective questionnaire is the ``right and
honorable thing'' for a candidate to do, project staffers contend.
Many candidates, however, fear that too much information in the
hands of voters can be downright unhealthy for their political
prospects.

A GUM TO CHEW AWAY TOOTH DECAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Minn., Mass., Pa.)   (Science Times)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chewing gum that contains a substance found in birch bark can
help suppress the bacteria that cause tooth decay, The Journal of
the American Dental Association reported in July.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the University of Minnesota selected 151
patients with high levels of mutans streptococci, the bacteria that
causes tooth decay. After they were treated for two weeks with an
antimicrobial mouthwash, they were given either sugar-free gum, no
gum or gum containing the subtance, xylitol, to chew for five
minutes after meals for three months.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria levels quickly returned to pre-treatment levels
among those given regular gum or no gum. Those chewing xylitol, a
sweetener, had their bacterial levels rebound roughly half as much
as the other patients, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Used in conjunction with other cavity-control strategies, such
as diet modification, fluoride and sealants, a xylitol-sweetened
chewing gum appears to be a helpful treatment for controlling tooth
decay,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   OUTCOMES: A LENS, SOME SLEEP AND BETTER VISION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By wearing contact lenses when their eyes are shut at night,
mildly nearsighted people may be able to improve their vision
enough to do without glasses or contacts, according to the July
issue of Optometry and Vision Science.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Ohio State University gave eight people a new
kind of contact lens called reverse geometry lenses.
</P>
<P>
   All rigid contact lenses exert enough pressure on the eyeball to
change its shape temporarily, and the researchers hoped that
reverse geometry lenses could flatten the cornea in the same way
that refractive eye surgery does.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional contact lenses are convex; reverse geometry lenses
are flatter at the edges and steeper at the center. The research
subjects wore the lenses at night. After a week, their vision
improved significantly.
</P>
<P>
   After three weeks, six were able to go without lenses during the
day; the other two dropped out of the study complaining of
discomfort. None of the eight were severely myopic and they had
little or no astigmatism, an irregular curve across the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Barr of Ohio State said that if further studies
showed similar results, the reverse geometry lenses could present a
cheaper alternative to refractive eye surgery.
</P>
<P>
   AT RISK: TEETH-CLEANING GUIDELINE OFTEN IGNORED
</P>
<P>
   Too few patients who need protective doses of antibiotics before
dental cleaning are getting it, and too many patients who do not
need the medicine are, according to a study published this month in
The Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   In rare instances, bacteria from the mouth can enter the
bloodstream during dental work and cause potentially
life-threatening infections of the heart valves. About
three-quarters of those infected are people with existing heart
problems, including leaky or significantly thickened valves.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1950s, doctors have been recommending prophylactic
doses of antibiotics for patients at risk. Those guidelines were
updated and simplified three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the new study, researchers from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center in Boston followed up on 218 patients who had been examined
for potential heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   They found that the guidelines were being followed for the
patients most at risk, nearly 90 percent of whom were told to take
antibiotics for specific procedures, wrote Dr. Warren Manning, a
cardiologist at Beth Israel Deaconess.
</P>
<P>
   But only 60 percent of the far larger group of patients whose
risks were lower but who still should have gotten the drugs were
told to do so, and 25 percent of low-risk patients were given the
drugs unnecessarily. And 13 percent of patients who were told to
take antibiotics decided on their own not to do so, Manning wrote.
</P>
<P>
   DIAGNOSIS: A COMPOSER'S SLEEP APNEA LULLABY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brahms may have had a good reason for writing lullabies: he may
have suffered from a sleep disorder, according to an article
published last week in the journal Chest.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mitchell L. Margolis, a pulmonologist at the Philadelphia
Veterans Administration Medical Center, wrote that the composer may
have suffered from sleep apnea, a condition involving the
interruption of breathing during sleep with consequences that can
range from annoying to life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy snoring is the most common clue to sleep apnea, but
because Brahms never married, the most common form of documentation
is missing. A traveling companion, however, once complained
bitterly of the noise that Brahms made.
</P>
<P>
   But Margolis said that Brahms exhibited other common symptoms,
including falling asleep at odd times and places (the sight of
Brahms asleep in a Viennese cafe was common enough to draw
tourists), an obese neck (the composer wore collarless shirts after
age 50) and irritability. (Brahms is said to have announced once,
``If there is anyone here I have not offended, I apologize.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``One wonders if the disorder contributed to lifelong alienation
from friends and marriage,'' Margolis wrote, ``thereby indirectly
nurturing his determined devotion to the creation of his immortal
music.''
</P>
<P>
   PATTERNS: DEADLY MOVES WHEN A HEART ATTACK HITS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least in the abstract, most people know what to do if they
are struck by severe chest pain: call an ambulance and get to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But when it really happens, people turn out to be far more
reluctant to dial 911, much to their own detriment, a new study
reports.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published last week in the journal Circulation,
compared survey responses in which 962 people were asked about the
proper course of action when a heart attack was suspected and the
actual steps taken in 875 cases in the 20 communities covered.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from the Oregon Health Sciences University in
Portland and the University of Utah Medical Center in Salt Lake
City, found that while 89 percent of the people surveyed said that
they would use emergency medical services to go to a hospital, only
23 percent of the real-life cases ended up arriving at the hospital
by ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent were driven to the hospital by someone else,
while 16 percent drove themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Prompt treatment of heart attacks has come to be considered
critical, especially since the development of clot-busting drugs
that reduce death rates but which can be administered effectively
only within a few hours of an attack's onset.
</P>
<P>
   Those who took the longest time to reach the emergency room were
those who took antacids, suspecting that the pain was severe
heartburn, those who took aspirin in an attempt to treat the heart
problem themselves, and those who called their doctors for advice.
</P>
<P>
   One of the researchers, Dr. N. Clay Mann of Utah, called that
particularly disturbing. ``Speaking with a doctor may have reduced
patient anxiety in a way that made EMS transport seem optional,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   People who were charged for emergency services called 911 in
lower numbers, the study also found.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Obviously, George W. Bush is fair game for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it quite rightly can be expected that anyone who is a
Democrat can, and likely will, talk tacky about the Republican
Texas governor who is only a couple of weeks away from officially
being nominated the GOP candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   But, let's get one thing straight _ very straight: Talking bad
about Bush is one thing.
</P>
<P>
   Talking bad about Texas is quite another, and, clearly Al Gore
doesn't need any help in that department. And he, by golly for
sure, doesn't need any help from Texas Democrats in slamming Texas.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question there's going to be a lot of Texas Dems
available to go around the country between now and Nov. 7 to speak
ill of the governor and to claim all that's good that's happened in
Texas since Bush took office is because of the hard and honest work
of Texas Dems.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Beth Malcolm, the head of the Texas Democratic Party, is
one who's got that routine down pat. To hear her tell it, if there
hadn't been Democrats in the Texas Legislature, there wouldn't even
be a state left for Gore to denigrate. To Malcolm's credit,
however, she seems to have done a good job of keeping her awful
gripes aimed at Bush - not at the state she suggests he's quite
inclined to ruin. And, she usually does speak well of Texas - or at
least the parts of it on which she thinks the Dems have done such a
boffo job.
</P>
<P>
   And, to a great extent, this has held true for a lot of other
high-profile Texas Democrats who've felt compelled to share their
uncomplimentary opinions of Bush with folk in various other parts
of the country. They've managed to do OK by Texas while contending
Bush hasn't managed to do OK by Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was the report about state Rep. Garnet Coleman of
Houston, whom the Gore campaign brought in late last week to speak
ill of the reported budget predicament facing Texas. Bless his
heart, from all reports Coleman doesn't seem to have done Bush much
harm. What he appears to have told the national press is that he's
now decided the tax cuts Bush pushed through the last Texas
Legislature weren't a good idea after all. We can but presume Bush
_ or someone _ had convinced Coleman they were when he voted for
them last year.
</P>
<P>
   If that alone fails to have much effect on Gore and his
anti-Texas mode, it looks like Texas Dems would work on him to find
something on which to harp besides the horror he claims is Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, you'd think even folk from other states
would be tired by now of hearing the Democratic candidate spend so
much time, sweat and effort talking about how awful Texas is.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's true or not, there's a lot of Texans who are sick
to death of hearing their state portrayed as some sort of hellhole
where people with untreated open sores couldn't read their
insurance policies if they had any. Nor, for that matter, could
they seek help from a teacher in a Texas school for reading because
they're as wretched as all the other wrongs Gore keeps finding in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a group of right prominent Texans has just emerged to
counteract what its members characterize in a letter to Gore as
``misrepresentations by your campaign to the media.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Proud of Texas Committee,'' organized by Texas Monthly
publisher Mike Levy, is a self-described ad hoc group of
independents and Democrats. In a letter to Gore, the members told
the veep they ``are disturbed by the extent to which the Gore
campaign appears to be willing to distort the facts about our state
in order to discredit Gov. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   They took strong issue with what they claim as
misrepresentations in education, health care and the criminal
justice system in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In an obvious attempt to appear independent of Bush and/or the
Republican Party, the group also sent the governor a letter
declaring their intent ``to speak out when information presented in
the media about Texas is incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   In a somewhat harsher wording than that ending the letter to
Bush, the committee wrote Gore: ``All Texans have a vested interest
in ensuring that Texas receives an accurate, fair assessment in the
media. ... We believe that both candidates in this presidential
campaign have a responsibility to uphold the public trust by
sticking strictly to the facts between now and November, and we
call on you to do just that.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, friends and neighbors, is what you might call a real
polite way to say: ``Don't mess with Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Hear. Hear.

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington)_ Bill Bradley's belated endorsement of

Bradley, who looked as though he were going for the sour grapes cup
long thought to have been retired by Eugene McCarthy 30 years ago.

   HINES-COLUMN (Washington) _ Reconstruction, it seems after more

   ROBISON-COLUMN (Austin, Texas) _ It is tempting to label Project
Vote Smart an oxymoron, in deference to the disrespect that many

   RACE-BIRACIAL-FAMILY-CENTERPIECE _ When I was a kid growing up
in Chicago, I used to do anything I could to put off going to bed.
One of my favorite delaying tactics was to engage my mother in a
discussion about the important questions of the day, questions my
friends and I had debated in the backyards of our neighborhood that
afternoon _ like who did God root for, the Cubs or the White Sox?
(The correct answer was, and still is, the White Sox.) Then one
night I remember asking my mother something I had been wondering
for a long time. ``Mom,'' I asked, ``What am I?'' ``You're my
darling Donny,'' she said. ``I know. But what else am I?'' ``You're
a precious little boy who someday will grow up to be a wonderful,
handsome man.'' ``What I mean is, you're white and Dad's black, so
what does that make me?'' By Don Terry. (6,000 words.) WITH PHOTOS.

</P>
<P>
   RACE-FORUM-CENTERPIECE _ In a forum held at The New York Times
on June 19, eight editors and reporters talked about working on the
paper's ``How Race Is Lived in America'' project. Specifically,
they were asked how their own attitudes about race were affected by
the experience. Their comments help to underscore how complicated
the issue of race remains. Moderated by Sam Roberts. (2,600 words;
unabridged 4,100-word version available.) WITH PHOTOS.

<P>
   RACE-ENNUI-ESSAY-CENTERPIECE _ Race is no longer a biological
reality. Scientists have shown that there are more differences
within designated racial groups than between them. It's race
history that matters now; our culture, our politics, the way our
minds are formed and the oh-so-many tricks our psyches play. We
know that love, sex, friendship and work don't take any one shape
in our lives. Why do we coarsen and simplify race so often? Why
must we so often make it boring? By Margo Jefferson. (900 words.)

</P>
<P>
   BC-ECOM-NEW-WEB-LANGUAGE-NYTSF _ In the beginning, the Web was
made possible by a simple innovation known as Hypertext Markup
Language, or HTML. Through this language, which arranged text,
images and buttons in a World Wide Web browser, information could _
and very much still can _ be read by computer users all over the
world. Yet despite its power, HTML has flaws, the most obvious
being an inability to make distinctions between the presentation of
computer data and the data itself. Now the next generation of Web
language, called XML (for Extensible Markup Language), is emerging.
Here, a report on how XML has the potential to establish a real
Internet lingua franca. By John Markoff. WITH ILLUSTRATION.

   BC-ECOM-UNLIKELY-TECH-BOOMTOWN-NYTSF _ Oulu, Finland, must rank
as one of the world's most improbable technology boomtowns. Except
for forests and lakes, there isn't much within 100 miles of Oulu.
The most notable town to the north is Rovaniemi, which has built
its economy on the assertion that it is the true home of Santa
Claus. Yet this town of 100,000 people is home to hundreds of
electronics companies. Driven in part by Nokia, the Helsinki
company that is the world's biggest manufacturer of mobile
telephones, Oulu thrives as a center for research on wireless data
communications. It also has also become a hotbed for Internet
start-ups. Find out why in this feature. By Edmund L. Andrews.

   SOLAR-GADGETS-POPMECH _ Clear sunlight contains 1,000 watts of
power per square meter at sea level. That's enough to power
everything on Earth 1,500 times over if we could just figure out a
way to harness all the free, nonstop solar energy that bathes the
globe every day. Of course, in a very real sense everything on
Earth is already solar-powered _ we just release that power in
different ways. Burning long-buried hydrocarbons to get at stored
solar energy, as we've been doing, isn't particularly efficient.
But other ways to use solar energy are available. There's a whole
campsite worth of clever outdoor gear that runs directly on

   A COLLEGE ADMISSIONS DIRECTOR TELLS THE TRUTH ABOUT ``GETTING

</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE-ADMISSIONS-LIFEBEAT _ According to the director of
admissions at a prestigious college who chooses to write
anonymously, there are three factors that propel candidates toward
the most selective schools: prestige, parents and fit _ in that
order. There are many well-qualified students, and ``admissions is
not a fair process.'' An institution's objectives ``are like a
moving target.'' They can change almost annually as admissions
directors strive to balance the incoming class and meet the

top-of-the-line electric toothbrush, a WaterPik and an arsenal of
toothpastes so varied, they crowd the shelves of my sizable

   IMPROVING A BAD CREDIT HISTORY
</P>
<P>
   THESTREETCOM-DAGEN-NYTSF _ If you have done serious damage to
your credit history, you can take your time shopping for a house.
Most negative information will stay in your credit record for seven
years. Bankruptcies can hang around for 10. To start rebuilding
your record, you'll first need to clear any bad debts and
outstanding balances and start making regular payments to your
creditors. Then you'll have to wait and wait and wait. By Dagen
McDowell.
</P>
<P>
   UNDERSTANDING YOUR CREDIT SCORE
</P>
<P>
   THESTREETCOM-DAGEN-NYTSF _ Even if you've spent hours
scrutinizing every item on your credit report, you still may not
know if you've got a good credit record or a bad one. For that you
need to have an idea of your credit score. This score may be
unfamiliar to everyday people, but it looms large for the lenders
that are deciding whether to let you buy that house or other item.
Your credit score is a triple-digit number that tells a lender how
likely you are to pay back a loan. Essentially, it compresses your
entire credit report into a single number, ranging from 300 to 900.
Generally, you need a 620 or better to get a loan or a mortgage
from an established lender. You may be wondering how you can get
your hands on your score. It's not so easy, but, thankfully, that
may be changing. By Dagen McDowell.

   WHO HAS ACCESS TO YOUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION?
</P>
<P>
   THESTREETCOM-DAGEN-NYTSF _ You wouldn't want a stream of
strangers digging through your file cabinet at home. Unfortunately,
due to advances in technology and stepped-up merger activity across
the financial-services industry, strangers may have free rein to
comb through your personal financial information. Privacy in the
digital age has become an incendiary issue that would have made
George Orwell smile. More and more, consumers want to know: Who has
access to my personal information? Who is selling it to other
business to make a buck? What rights do I have to prevent the
spread of my personal data? By Dagen McDowell.

CRUNCHED FOR TIME? WORKOUT ON AISLE 3 
</HEADLINE>

   Lynn Weisbach walks on a treadmill five days a week between the
deli and produce sections of her grocery store. That's because the
health club she belongs to, CardioTheater Express in Alpharetta,
Ga., is tucked into the front corner of a Kroger supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saves time because I have to shop anyway,'' said Weisbach,
a 46-year-old painter, who started walking on the treadmill six
months ago to lower her blood pressure. ``If this wasn't here, I'd
have to drive somewhere. In that case, I don't think I'd be
exercising.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, commercial health clubs are turning up in
interesting places. These kinds of exercise centers within other
centers have a name: mini-fusion workout centers. They are usually
smaller and generally less expensive than full-scale health clubs,
and are in areas where people would go anyway, like Laundromats,
truck stops and airports. Their purpose is to fuse exercise with
another activity to make it more convenient for time-squeezed
Americans who also want to get and stay fit.
</P>
<P>
   The American Council on Exercise, a watchdog organization in San
Diego, named mini-fusion centers a major fitness trend for this
year. Exercise centers in hotels and apartment complexes are now
common. Mini-fusion centers are a twist on that theme, said Ken
Alan, a personal trainer and college exercise instructor in Los
Angeles, who is a spokesman for ACE.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 reason people say they don't exercise is because of
time,'' Alan said. ``But this kind of facility brings the club to
the consumer, to make working out easier and more accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association,
the trade organization for health clubs, has also taken note of the
mini-fusion trend. Though the organization has no specific data on
these kinds of clubs, William C. Howland Jr., the association's
director of public relations and research, said that more and more
small facilities were popping up in unusual places. It makes sense,
he added. If workout centers are in places where customers can come
and go easily, they will join.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, people appreciate working out in places where once
they get in, they have nothing to do but wait. Like the airport.
Paul Rorden, a pilot for National Airlines, exercises for an hour
and a half a couple of times a week at 24-Hour Fitness, a health
club that opened this year in McCarran International Airport in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you do as a pilot is wait around, then sit for five hours
and then eat,'' said Rorden, 33, who flies out of Las Vegas four to
10 times a week. ``Exercising here is convenient and time well
spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Airport Fitness, runs a health club at the
Pittsburgh International Airport and hopes to expand into nine more
airports in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling is stressful, not just for pilots and flight
attendants but for everyone, said Michael E. Michno, president and
chief executive of Airport Fitness in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing worse than sitting in place and breathing
recycled air. Exercise is a great way to bounce back,'' Michno
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people like mini-fusion centers because they feel more
comfortable and less intimidated exercising in a familiar place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people just don't want to walk into a large,
full-service health club full of hard-bodies,'' Alan said. ``They
would prefer to get started and build their confidence in a
facility that's more comfortable. That's why I expect to see more
and more health clubs in places like malls and supermarkets over
the next couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisbach added: ``I was the beginner of all beginners when I
started. I had tried to join a regular health club, but I didn't
make it past the lobby. I'm this gray-headed, middle-aged lady and
I felt too intimidated. Kroger's is more intimate. Plus, after I'm
finished, I can pick up a few groceries.''

AFTER 6 YEARS, STALKING VICTIM FEARS FOR LIFE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By GABRIELLE CRIST 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Susan Charles says the man who is stalking her has stolen her
life.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's worried he will end it, and the criminal justice
system can do little to help her.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Alexander Lewis, 47, a mechanical engineer from Arlington,
Texas, adjacent to Fort Worth, has been in the Tarrant County Jail
for about a week, accused of leading police on a high-speed chase
after they tried to arrest him on two felony stalking warrants out
of Arlington and nearby Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was following Charles when police tried to arrest him,
prompting the chase, Grand Prairie police Detective Marc Taddonio
said. Lewis is on probation for harassing Charles, whom he dated
for about a year after they met in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Family Violence Court Judge Jamie Cummings delayed a
scheduled bond hearing so that Lewis could be evaluated by a
psychiatrist to see if he is competent to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   If Lewis is deemed competent, a bond hearing will be scheduled
within the next couple of weeks, attorneys said. Bail must be set,
but the judge has discretion over the amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if he gets out of jail, I'm done,'' said Charles, her
hands shaking and her eyes filling with tears.
</P>
<P>
   Charles said she wanted to tell her story in the hope that
publicity might protect her from harm.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is in custody and could not be interviewed for this
article. Lewis' attorney, Danny Burns, declined to comment, saying
he has just been retained and is unfamiliar with the details.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Daniels, Lewis' friend and boss, described Lewis as a
``fine man'' and single father of three who is being stalked
himself, by Charles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a stalker. I kind of figured she was following him,''
Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles, 37, is right to be frightened, said Brad Clark, a
former Tarrant County prosecutor who handled Lewis' prior stalking
and harassment cases.
</P>
<P>
   The short length of their relationship and the intensity and
duration of the stalking have made the case the worst he has seen,
Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis ``really, really concerns me,'' said Clark, who is now in
private practice.
</P>
<P>
   Stalking is a class A misdemeanor in Texas, punishable by up to
one year in jail and a $4,000 fine. If a person is convicted of
stalking for a second time, it becomes a third-degree felony,
punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   National studies show that most stalkers are former husbands or
boyfriends. Only about 25 percent of stalking cases involve someone
who doesn't know the victim, according to some studies.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has left about 100 voice-mail messages for Charles at her
workplace in Grand Prairie, Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always the guy who makes things even, and I guarantee you
I'll make it even till the day I die,'' a male voice says in one
message. Charles identified the caller as Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   When Daniels was told about the messages, he said Lewis ``might
be smitten. ... The boy's just at the end of his rope.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles and Lewis began dating a few months after they met in
February 1993. The relationship quickly turned tumultuous, and when
Charles tried to end it, he wouldn't leave her alone, she has told
police.
</P>
<P>
   Charles said she has moved six times and changed her phone
number repeatedly, but Lewis always finds her. She said she's not
sure how Lewis keeps getting her number.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has been arrested four times on charges related to
harassing her. Each time, he becomes angrier, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For more than five years, Charles has lived in apartment
complexes because she worries that no one would hear her screams in
a house. Fearing that he might follow her, she takes different
routes home from work each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men like this, they do it a little at a time,'' she said.
``Take away your spirit, take away your heart, take away your
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles said she hadn't dated Lewis long before she began to see
signs of possessiveness. He called her constantly, always wanting
to know where she was, wanting to control every moment. Sometimes,
he would pound on her windows late at night, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The pair fought frequently, often loudly, Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   When she tried to break up with him late in 1993, the phone
calls increased and the late-night visits became more frequent, she
told police.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Charles would let Lewis in simply to quiet him, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Frank got his way, everything was fine,'' Charles
said.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Charles would call Lewis, screaming and cursing,
to tell him to stay away from her.
</P>
<P>
   She began filing reports with Arlington police almost
immediately after they began dating. One report says that someone
removed Charles' mail from her mailbox without permission in May
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Possible known suspect is harassing the victim by leaving
trash at her door and window and by banging on her door,'' says
another, from February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspect intentionally and knowingly entered the victim's
apartment without effective consent of the victim, after having
been warned off of the victim's property,'' says another, from
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Lewis posted at her apartment pornographic pictures
of a woman resembling Charles, according to the arrest warrant
affidavit filed by Arlington police. Her name, a description of her
car and her phone number were written on some of them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles said a friend took photographs of her name and work
phone number scrawled near several pay phones in Arlington, along
with a lewd sexual comment.
</P>
<P>
   She said she believed that the harassment would end after the
cases against Lewis began making their way to court in June 1999.
(MORE)
nn
</P>
<P>
   The law defines stalking as engaging in behavior on more than
one occasion that threatens bodily injury or death of the intended
party or that person's family, destroying the intended party's
personal property or causing the intended party or that person's
family to fear bodily injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   In domestic violence cases, the victim can seek a protective
order from a judge. If the order is violated, the offender can be
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles is not eligible for such an order because she and
Lewis haven't been married, never lived together and aren't blood
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis pleaded guilty to misdemeanor stalking and harassment in
June 1999, in a plea agreement reached with prosecutors. He
received no additional jail time for the stalking charge because
he'd spent some time in and out of jail awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   He received two years' probation in a deferred sentencing
agreement for the harassment. Unlike regular probation, if an
offender fulfills the terms of the deferred sentence, a conviction
is not entered in the court record.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis received an additional year's probation for driving while
intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition of the deferred sentencing agreement, Lewis had
to get a job and was allowed to work for Daniels in Oklahoma City.
Lewis was not supposed to leave Oklahoma without the judge's
permission.
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't supposed to contact Charles.
</P>
<P>
   But he did, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   Charles said her life got pretty quiet _ she was getting only
about 10 calls a week _ until November 1999, when Lewis showed up
at her Arlington apartment and banged on her bedroom window,
according to the arrest warrant affidavit from Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   About two months ago, she began getting the calls at work.
Charles said she has saved nearly 100 voice-mail messages that she
said Lewis left for her.
</P>
<P>
   On numerous messages, a male voice repeats, ``July 18, 1993,''
the first time they were intimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave you all my love, all my heart, gave you everything I
had to give,'' the man says in one message. ``You remember July 18,
July 18, 1993? Do you remember? Do you remember that July 18 of
1993, July 18?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, the messages become more ominous.
</P>
<P>
   In one voice-mail message, the man says, ``You (expletive) up my
life and now you don't want to be a part of it? It ain't my fault
now, it ain't my fault. It's your fault. You've got to be a part of
my life until I die. Kill me, that'd be the best thing. Kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   In a whisper, the male voice then says: ``That'd be the best
thing. Susan, evil (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' 22-year-old daughter, Erin Lewis, acknowledged that her
father had called Charles.
</P>
<P>
   The message didn't mean that he wanted to be with Charles, she
said. It meant that Charles cannot accuse him of committing crimes,
then walk away from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that he's the freakin' pope,'' Erin Lewis said.
But Charles, she said, is ``trying to act like she's princess and
he's evil.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOZEMAN, Mont. _ Dr. David C. Sands holds out a clear plastic
petri dish filled with a white fuzzy fungus growing across the
bottom. This substance, he believes, is the key to ending much of
the world's production of illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress also believe that Sands and other
researchers may be on to a powerful and environmentally safe method
of killing not only coca plants, but also marijuana and poppy
plants. The members have asked the government of Colombia to test a
strain of Fusarium oxysporum over the next two years. If it proves
effective, the disease will be sprayed on vast fields of coca
plants there, and experts say it could wipe out much of the coca
crop within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The research holds such promise that officials at Montana State
University ended it two years ago, fearing it could make the
university a target of the drug cartels. But the technique had
already been developed.
</P>
<P>
   Others are not sure that Fusarium will be effective against the
the cartels. ``Efficacy is high on my list of concerns,'' said Eric
Rosenquist, a U.S. Department of Agriculture official involved with
international research programs. ``You can put a lot of energy into
this and get nothing out in the end.'' Rosenquist said a naturally
occurring Fusarium coca virus in Peru had killed only 40 percent of
the crop there.
</P>
<P>
   An attack on coca plants may be only a first salvo in the attack
of the Fusarium fungus. Sands and other researchers believe the use
of fungal disease is an ideal way to kill a broad range of
undesirable plants. Research on Fusarium has been under way for
many years, and Sands and other scientists say the research is
about to usher in an era of effective and environmentally safe
biological controls that would be alternatives to chemical
herbicides and genetically modified organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Biological controls _ the use of a pest's natural enemies
against it _ are an old idea. Centuries ago, the Chinese built
bridges between trees so predatory ants could seek out and destroy
aphids. But biological control has not yet proven to be a viable
alternative to chemicals. Most diseases and predatory insects, for
example, are not especially deadly; they effectively ``farm'' a
plant, attacking it but not wiping it out, so they can keep
consuming it. ``They live in total coexistence, like real estate
agents,'' Sands said. ``They take a percentage. If they took too
much they would be out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   But some diseases are especially virulent and wipe out most, if
not all, of their host. Phytophtora, a fungus that destroyed
potatoes in 19th-century Ireland and caused the great famine there,
is one. Fusarium, Sands said, is another of the ``Attila the Hun''
diseases, and there are strains of Fusarium for virtually every
cultivated plant and many wild ones.
</P>
<P>
   A plant pathologist, Sands came to the field of bioherbicides in
his search for a way to treat exotic plants from Asia that run
rampant through Western range land because they are unchecked by
native enemies. Some diseases found in Montana are being tested on
these weeds. But a much more effective approach, Sands said, may be
to bring back the fungal diseases that the weeds evolved with in
Central Asia and elsewhere and use them as herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   He has had collaborators scouring Kazakhstan and Russia for
diseases that evolved with two especially difficult species,
spotted knapweed and leafy spurge, and some have been shipped to
the United States where they remain in a containment facility in
Maryland awaiting approval to be used in testing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, while working with weeds, Sands got a call from the
department of agriculture. Worried about a revolution in Peru,
Coca-Cola had established a coca plantation in Hawaii to assure a
supply of the plant for its soft drinks. (The stimulating
components of the plant are not included in the product.)
</P>
<P>
   When the plantation was abandoned, the department used the
plants to test herbicides that might be used in the drug war. But
something killed many of the plants in a control plot that was not
being sprayed. Sands discovered that it was a strain of Fusarium.
</P>
<P>
   Sands cultured the fungus and spread it as granules on a
three-acre plot. It killed nearly all of the coca plants.
</P>
<P>
   Fusarium is especially virulent on plants that dominate a
landscape, he said. Dutch elm disease and chestnut blight are both
fungal diseases similar to Fusarium. They destroyed trees across
America because those trees were the only ones that many cities
planted.
</P>
<P>
   While Sands believes that importing diseases can be an effectiv
approach to combating exotic weeds in Montana, officials in
Colombia say they will use an indigenous fungus, a strategy Sands
also advocates, because coca is a native plant.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists generally favor substitutes for chemicals in
killing weeds, but some are not sure that de facto biological
warfare is the answer. They worry about ``mission drift''; a
disease may start as an effective enemy of coca but somehow change
hosts and kill important nontarget plants, like bananas, or attack
wild relatives of the coca plant and threaten biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Stiling, a professor of biology at the University of
South Florida who has studied introduced species, says possible
unintended effects have not been sufficiently examined. ``I am not
prepared to come down on one side of the fence.'' Stiling said.
``But I think we should be careful. It's difficult enough to find
the nontarget effects of insects, and it's even more difficult for
nontarget effects of fungi and bacteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Such problems are often subtle at first and might not be found
for a long time, Stiling said. A study in Oregon has indicated that
the use of Btk, a bacterial pesticide for control of the western
spruce budworm, may have reduced the abundance and diversity of
butterfly larvae.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 500 people working on Fusarium,'' Sands responded,
``and we don't see it changing its host species.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, no environmental problems have been blamed on Fusarium,
largely because it has not been widely used in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The use of fungal disease as a herbicide was studied before by
the Agricultural Research Service, but the agency determined that
it wasn't viable as a biological control primarily because it
required a great deal of the product to cover the vast areas
involved.
</P>
<P>
   To make Fusarium economical, Sands and other researchers have
discovered they can use a native grass seed to culture the fungus.
In a patented process, they spray Fusarium on the seed and drop it;
when it hits the ground the fungus multiplies. Once the fungus
kills the coca plants, the theory goes, the grass seed or whatever
seed officials choose to use, takes over for the dead plants.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the fungus lasts in the soil. ``They kill and they
survive the nongrowing season perhaps for as long as five years,''
Sands said.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage to fungal defoliants is that while chemicals
must be sprayed on coca plants from very low altitudes during
daylight, Fusarium can be dropped from thousands of feet above the
fields at night.
</P>
<P>
   Although the university ended the fungus research, Sands said
others could easily follow his formula for making fungus-based
bioherbicides.
</P>
<P>
   Culturing fungus is fairly simple and can be taught in a couple
of weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The coca producers could respond with a fungicide or
disease-resistant plants, but Sands said that could take many
years.

WEB SITE IS POPULAR NEW STOP IN NURSING HOME SEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL HULSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The emotionally painful task of finding a nursing
home once centered on meeting with medical advisers and a phone
survey of nearby facilities. For an increasing number of Americans,
the search now starts in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people are logging on to a comprehensive
nursing home database operated by the federal Medicare agency,
using it to locate homes in their communities, check the patient
mix and staffing levels, and see how the homes performed in recent
state inspections.
</P>
<P>
   After attracting just a few hundred hits a month following its
launch in 1998, the Nursing Home Compare section of the
www.medicare.gov Web site is thriving. It records 500,000 page
views per month and is by far the most popular stop on the site,
which also includes information about Medicare managed care plans,
Medigap coverage and general Medicare information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea of the kind of interest that is out there,''
said Nancy-Ann DeParle, head of the Health Care Financing
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The nursing home section provides individual information on
17,000 nursing homes certified for Medicare and Medicaid and allows
consumers to locate them by name, state, county, city or ZIP code.
Besides details about ownership and staffing levels, the site makes
available inspection records and shows how each center compares to
state and national averages for deficiencies. The surveys rate the
risk any deficiencies pose to residents, ranking them from
immediate jeopardy to minimal threat.
</P>
<P>
   While consumer advocates and nursing home representatives find
fault with aspects of the site, both groups say it fills an
information vacuum and should be an essential tool for anyone
struggling with placing a relative or loved one in the care of a
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question it is an advantage,'' said Elma Holder,
director and founder of the National Citizens' Coalition for
Nursing Home Reform. ``It is more than we have ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Holder, federal health care officials and nursing home
executives say the Web site should be used only to supplement
information gathered independently by consumers and should not be
the sole basis of a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can certainly be part of their search process but it cannot
and should not be the only stop in the process,'' said Tom Burke,
spokesman for the American Health Care Association, which
represents for-profit nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Interest groups say the most important part of a nursing home
search is personal visits to homes under consideration, including
going at different times of day or night to gauge the overall
atmosphere and level of care.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection reports posted on the Web site, however, provide
information on quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it really does help people understand about quality
even if you don't understand all the jargon,'' said DeParle, who
said the site has had the added benefit of motivating homes to
improve care to burnish their Web portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Holder and Burke said the data on the site had the potential to
exaggerate problems at a facility or give false confidence to
consumers if the survey was not rigorous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as good as the survey data is, that is the key to it,''
said Holder, who cautioned that data on the site could be out of
date if a nursing home had undergone staff changes. ``A nursing
home can change dramatically in a very short period of time if they
lose key staff, which they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke agreed, saying inspection reports could be up to 18 months
old _ ``ancient history'' in nursing home terms. The information is
``convoluted, exceedingly complex and often leads to a
misunderstanding about the true nature of a facility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But California lawmakers referred to the site in recent months
to alert residents about nursing home problems in their
communities, and it has been recognized by outside experts for its
content.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle attributed some of the site's popularity to the growing
Web savvy of older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare agency continues to tweak the type of information
available and added staffing figures this spring, listing the
number of registered nurses, licensed practical or vocational
nurses and nursing assistants in each home.
</P>
<P>
   Holder, who said she found the site fairly easy to navigate,
said her group was pressing HCFA to provide the specific name of
the corporation that owns each home, an idea the agency was
pursuing. ``We think that is valuable information for consumers
because if they run into trouble that is where they are going to
end up,'' Holder said.

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Thurmont, Md.) _ As the Camp David peace summit
meeting moved closer to the supposed deadline of President
Clinton's Wednesday morning departure for Japan, the White House
remained officially committed Monday to reaching ``an agreement''
before then. But some U.S., Israeli and Palestinian officials began
deliberately lowering expectations for a breakthrough, even

scraps of refuse. One week later, rescuers were still digging
through hundreds of tons of muck Monday, working in one-hour shifts
because of the rot of the soaking garbage, the poisonous gasses it
emits and the stench of the decomposing bodies that are buried in
it. So far, about 200 bodies have been recovered. Residents

BRANAGH SHAKES UP SHAKESPEARE _ AND CRITICS _ WITH A '30S-STYLE
MUSICAL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By MARK LOWRY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fans of Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers and Gene Kelly don't have to
worry about their Hollywood icons being overshadowed by
Tinseltown's new generation of song-and-dance performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that we were not really attempting to dazzle in the
way that Astaire or Rogers could, or Kelly,'' says Kenneth Branagh,
whose musical version of ``Love's Labour's Lost'' opened Friday in
Dallas. ``Because we didn't have the time or resources to do that.
Or the talent, quite frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say ``Love's'' a failure as a musical or as a
film experience. In fact, it might just be the most inventive and
audacious cinematic undertaking of the summer, being at the same
time an adaptation of the Shakespeare comedy of the same name and
an homage to the great Hollywood musicals of the '30s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   While it does offer recognizable stars (Branagh, Alicia
Silverstone, Nathan Lane), ``Love's'' biggest attraction is the
off-screen talent involved: First, Shakespeare, and second,
Broadway legends of yore like Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, George
and Ira Gershwin and Jerome Kern.
</P>
<P>
   The latter's music is more than filler for the gaps in the text
caused by Branagh's wholesale editing (some 70 percent of the play
was excised to suit his purposes). Instead, in classic Broadway
musical form, signature tunes such as ``I Get a Kick Out of You,''
``The Way You Look Tonight'' and ``You Can't Take That Away From
Me,'' sung by the cast, become part of the narrative, accompanied
by breezy choreography in lavish production numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have called the project foolhardy or even crazy.
But Branagh, sitting in his Adolphus Hotel suite in Dallas more
than a month ago while on a press tour for the movie (which was
originally supposed to hit the Dallas market in mid-June), talked
with confidence about the venture.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare, to begin with, is old hat for Branagh, who has
directed and starred in ``Henry V'' and a four-hour version of
``Hamlet,'' among other adaptations of the Bard. With ``Love's,''
the challenge for Branagh wasn't Shakespeare's dialogue, but the
footwork that accompanied the songs. ``For me, it was absolutely
physically exerting,'' he says, ``way more difficult than doing
`Hamlet.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, putting Shakespeare into musical form is not a new
concept. Duke Ellington created a famous version of ``Twelfth
Night,'' Rodgers and Hart added music to ``The Comedy of Errors''
for the 1940 film ``The Boys From Syracuse,'' and, of course,
there's ``Kiss Me Kate'' and ``West Side Story,'' which use ``The
Taming of the Shrew'' and ``Romeo and Juliet,'' respectively, as
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that, in Hollywood, musicals are a dead issue.
They don't work onscreen anymore, no one wants to see them, and so
no one wants to make them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite wanting to do a musical, like many other people, I had
been wondering why they hadn't worked in any significant way in 40
years,'' the actor and director says.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't particularly like the answer, though he understood it
_ and thought he could transcend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel deeply the cynicism of the age, absolute
second-guessing of every single thing that we do,'' he says. ``As a
culture, we're examining everything for the calculation behind it.
`They're doing this, but what do they really mean?' We're looking
for postmodern twists for irony, for meanings.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll get none of that in ``Love's Labour's Lost,'' and Branagh
_ who made the film with a relatively small budget _ believes
people might just find that refreshing. The comedy and simple plot
of ``Love's,'' one of the Bard's earliest comedies, are designed
for flights of fancy _ and are ripe, he believes, for an old-school
musical adaptation. The story concerns a young king (Alessandro
Nivola) and three lords (Branagh, Adrian Lester and Matthew
Lillard) who vow to devote three years to their studies and nothing
else, including women. This quickly changes when they meet the
visiting Princess of France (Silverstone) and her three ladies
(Natascha McElhone, Emily Mortimer and Carmen Ejogo).
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like a young man's play,'' Branagh says. ``It's so
technically sophisticated, there's an enormous amount of rhyme.
There's an exuberance in the writing, and a sort of disregard for a
conventional playwright's discipline. What I loved about (both) the
play and (classic musical theater) were a sort of
heart-on-its-sleeve silliness, a delight in silly gags and not
necessarily explaining much.''
</P>
<P>
   This sense of whimsy is certainly evident in the movie. In one
scene, where Branagh's character, Berowne, says ``this love is as
mad as Ajax, it kills sheep,'' he looks out a window and a passing
sheep stops and keels over, in a very cartoony manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, why don't we do that, and not really explain it,''
he says, ``and just say it's silly. That makes me laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, some critics aren't just laughing at the silly
scenes. While ``Love's'' does include stage musical veterans Lester
and Lane, most of the actors were new to singing and dancing, and
their lack of experience shows. Which, on the whole, is OK with
Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   ``My immediate instinct about the casting was that people should
be cast for their appropriateness for the character, and for their
ease for Shakespeare,'' Branagh says. ``I wanted the singing and
dancing informed by character.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which may fall far short of the ideal for Broadway
aficionados or Shakespeare lovers, but it's still something unique
for a generation of filmgoers raised on ``Star Wars'' and ``The
Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However sort of `throwbacky' some of what we do is, in the
context of what's out there now, it feels very original,'' Branagh
says. ``I wanted to make a film that was heartfelt and innocent and
honest and uncaring about whether people mocked it or not.''

DR.KOOP TUMBLES ON WARNING, STAFF DEFECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (EDS: Stock prices are not up-to-the-minute) 
 By JENNIFER BAYOT   
 c. 2000 TheStreet.com/N.Y. Times.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service)
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Picture poor drkoop.com's (KOOP:Nasdaq) stock chart
as a heart monitor, and you see it blipping at about $1.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the Internet health care company went into cardiac
arrest Monday, down 18 percent after it warned that its
second-quarter losses would be more than Wall Street estimates and
that both its chief operating officer and its chief financial
officer had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it expects a net loss of $1.15 to $1.18 cents a
diluted share for the quarter ended June 30 vs. a net loss of $1.28
in the same quarter last year. Analysts polled by First
Call/Thomson Financial expect the company to post a loss of 30
cents a share. Drkoop.com said revenue will be $2.5 million to $3
million, compared with $1 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Upah, chief operating officer, and Susan Georgen-Saad,
chief financial officer, will leave the Austin, Texas-based company
and serve as consultants. Georgen-Saad will act as chief financial
officer until dr.koop.com finds a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The news adds to a profile of ailing health for drkoop.com. Once
upon a Web site, shares of drkoop.com traded as high as 35. Shares
dipped to $1 earlier this year amid reports that the company was a
takeover target and that more than a third of the staff had been
cut. Dr.koop traded down 5/16 to 1 9/32 in afternoon trading
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the company blamed the news in part on bad press
_ ``These results have been adversely affected by our widely
publicized liquidity shortfall'' _ and also referred to expenses
that are either nonrecurring or will drop sharply in the future,
such as employee severance costs and portal expenses. The company
estimated portal cost for the quarter to be $18.5 million to $19
million. The company also cited a charge of about $7.4 million in
write-off costs related to the end of a joint venture with
HealthMagic.
</P>
<P>
   Another diagnosis? Dr.koop.com can't break even on its consumer
information portal. ``Our capital resources are extremely limited
and our operations continue to operate at a loss requiring that
additional capital be available,'' the company said in a Securities
and Exchange Commission filing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the filing, drkoop.com said it was in search of permanent
financing to refinance $1.5 million of bridge financing. Drkoop.com
also disclosed that it had obtained a Nasdaq waiver to allow the
company to privately issue stocks at less than market price even if
the transaction would mean the creation of common stock shares
representing 20 percent or more of the shares outstanding.
drkoop.com attributed the waiver to ``liquidity needs'' so urgent
that stockholder approval would take too long to solicit.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, two law firms, Finkelstein, Thompson &AMP; Loughran of
Washington and Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman &AMP; Herz of New York,
said Friday that they filed a class-action lawsuit in U.S. District
Court for the Western District of Texas on behalf of drkoop.com
shareholders, alleging violations of federal securities laws. In
February, drkoop.com settled a year-old shareholder lawsuit four
days before the trial.

   MONACO GRAND PRIX
</P>
<P>
   Q. For our anniversary next May, my husband and I would like to
attend the Grand Prix of Monaco automobile race. Could you tell me
when the race is and provide other details? _ L.L., Avon, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A. The 59th Grand Prix Automobile de Monaco, part of the
international Formula One racing series, is set for May 24 to 27,
2001. The race itself, run through the streets of the principality
on the Riviera, will be May 27. Practice sessions for the Formula
One cars are May 24 and 26.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere at Monaco is unlike that at any other Formula One
event. The circuit twists and climbs through the principality,
which is half the size of Central Park, with the howl of racing
engines reverberating off towering condos and Belle-Epoque hotels.
</P>
<P>
   To order tickets, contact the Comite d'Organisation, Grand Prix
Automobile de Monaco, Boite Postale 464, 98012 Monaco Cedex, or
call the Automobile Club of Monaco at (377) 93.15.26.00.
</P>
<P>
   The best viewing areas are the grandstands at the Ste.-Devote
turn, the narrow corner immediately after the start. The
grandstands near the casino and the Albert I public swimming pool
are also good.
</P>
<P>
   Although ticket prices have not been determined for 2001, you
can expect them to be slightly higher than this year's prices.
These ranged from $114 to $400 (at 7 francs to $1) for seats in the
grandstands for Sunday's main event, and $57 to $143 for the
Saturday practice session, during which the drivers compete to see
who can run the fastest lap and thus earn the starting berth at the
front of the lineup for the Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
   If you're willing to watch standing up, you can buy a general
admission ticket. The general-admission area just below the palace,
called Rocher de Monaco-Ville, can be particularly tricky, since it
is a steep, slippery hillside. Tickets in the Rocher were $36 on
race day this year; in the other two general-admission areas, they
were $57 to $114.

   Finding a parking spot is about as difficult an event as the
grand prix itself. The train line that runs along the Cote d'Azur
stops in Monaco (Nice is a particularly good place to look for a
hotel room on race weekend) is the most sensible way to get to the
race.

   A tour operator can streamline the planning of your trip. Grand
Prix Tours, 1071 Camelback Street, Newport Beach, Calif. 92660;
(949) 717-3333, fax (949) 717-3344, conducts tours to several
Formula One races. Among its Monaco package this year was one that
included five nights at the Grand Hotel, which overlooks the
slowest turn on the track. Guests can stand on the roof and watch
the race. The package also included a cocktail party at which tour
participants could talk to one of the Grand Prix drivers, daily
breakfast, a race-preview party and airport transfers. The price
this year started from $3,950 a person, based on double occupancy.
Air fare is extra. A two-night package at the Novotel or Sofitel in
Nice was $595 a person, double occupancy. This did not include air
fare or race tickets. Next year's prices have not been determined.

NEW ATTENTION FOR THE EFFORT TO SAVE THE MONK SEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 By RACHEL X. WEISSMAN  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One late spring day in 1982, John Henderson, a fisheries
biologist at the Honolulu Laboratory of the National Marine
Fisheries Service, was scouting for recently weaned Hawaiian monk
seals on Lisianski Island, one of a dozen coral reef atolls
northwest of the main islands, and one of six breeding grounds for
the federally endangered seals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a shallow reef on the windward side of the island
where the mothers take their pups to avoid shark attacks,''
Henderson said. ``Once the pups are weaned at five to six weeks,
they begin ranging further afield.''
</P>
<P>
   That day, standing on a beach covered by bunch grass and low
shrubs and strewn with plastic containers, fishing floats and empty
liquor bottles, Henderson heard the bleating of an animal that
sounded like a weaned pup. Through binoculars, he saw the seal on
the reef shallows some 100 yards from shore.
</P>
<P>
   He waded out through the low tide and found a two- or
three-month-old seal weighing some 200 pounds pinned to a reef by a
fragment of a fishing net. He and his colleagues were able to free
the seal, but if they had not been there, he said, ``the rising
tide would have drowned him within a few hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Hawaii's coral reefs are healthy compared with others in
the world, they are the unfortunate host to huge quantities of
trash, including large fishing nets lost or illegally discarded
from vessels in such far-flung places as Japan, Russia and Alaska.
In El Nino years, currents shift slightly and the flotsam and
jetsam wash up on the Big Island.
</P>
<P>
   Besides entangling endangered animals like the monk seal, the
green sea turtle and the humpback whale, the nets also break off
pieces of coral that range from cauliflower size to boulder size.
Some pieces involve 100 or more years of growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge coral reef refuge, a beautiful resource and it's
getting hammered,'' said Dr. Mary Donohue, a biologist with the
National Marine Fisheries Service, who heads a multiagency task
force effort started in 1998 to clean up the reefs.
</P>
<P>
   While the trash problem has existed since the fishing industry
began using plastics in the 1950s, it is receiving new attention
largely because of the cleanup effort, begun with a goal of
stabilizing the monk seal population. The population has dwindled
to about 1,300 or 1,400, about half the total in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many seals are lost to entanglements in
floating trash. Since 1982, the fisheries service has documented
196, but many more animals are believed to have perished, their
bodies caught below sea level and scavenged by sharks.
</P>
<P>
   While it is difficult to isolate what role entanglement plays in
the overall decline of the species, said Jason Baker, the leader of
the agency's seal population survey, it is one of the few factors
that can be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Seals also suffer starvation, as do the fish on which they prey.
At least one epidemic, whose cause was never determined, killed off
one-sixth to one-quarter of the nearby Laysan Island population in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is male aggression, which occurs when the sex
ratio of a given population shifts. ``Because the sub-populations
are so small,'' Baker said, ``if just a few females die, the sex
ratio becomes skewed.'' In these populations, scientists have
observed sexually aggressive behaviors in males resulting in the
deaths of females and younger animals. ``That's the kind of
situation that can really wipe a population out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the agency's first monthlong reef clean-up mission in
November 1998, six tons of marine debris _ including nets, marine
lines, ropes, plastics and batteries _ were collected from the
reefs by divers. In the second effort, in October 1999, workers on
two ships supplied by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and the United States Coast Guard picked up 25 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Each mission costs an estimated $1 million. So far, just 5
percent of the reefs have been surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   The trips are timed for good weather and the safety of the crew
and seals. ``We choose October because we don't want to go when the
mother monk seals are nursing pups on the reefs because the pup
will die if it's separated from its mother,'' Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
   The crew also avoids the period when albatross chicks hatch
because tiger sharks roam the waters to prey upon the chicks and
pose a threat to divers.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the Hawaiian reefs _ which represent 84 percent of
all reefs in the United States _ and their animal inhabitants will
be highlighted in August, when an international conference on
marine debris will be held at the Humpback Whale National Marine
Sanctuary in Honolulu. The weeklong conference will be attended by
conservationists, scientists and political leaders from Pacific Rim
nations, including Japan, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cmdr. Rusty Brainard, who will be part of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Association delegation at the conference, said he
planned to urge the use of detailed satellite images to pinpoint
debris as it approached the Hawaiian islands. A plane would then be
sent to verify that the object was debris and a boat would pick it
up. Another method likely to be discussed, he said, is mandatory
tagging of fishing nets so discarded or lost nets can be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Coe, who directed the now-defunct Marine Entanglement
Research Program between 1985 and 1995, said that while the method
sounded good, it was abandoned in the late 80s because of the
expense of setting up an international reporting system and the
lack of consensus on enforcement issues like fines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, junk keeps piling up on the Hawaiian shores. ``I just
got a call the other day about a 500-pound trawl net that washed up
on the beach at Kure Atoll, and there's likely to be more on the
reefs,'' said Donohue, who will find out just how much more when
she returns to the reefs in October.

FLEETBOSTON, BANK OF NY EXCEED WHILE BANK OF AMERICA MEETS
ESTIMATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.C., N.J., Conn., N.Y.)  (EDS: Stock prices are not up-to-the-minute) 
 By JENNIFER BARRETT   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three of the nation's largest banking companies
reported gains in their second-quarter earnings Monday, with two of
them _ FleetBoston Financial (FBF:NYSE) and Bank of New
York(BK:NYSE) _ exceeding Wall Street's estimates by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America (BAC:NYSE), the nation's largest banking
company, met analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America reported that its net income rose 7 percent on a
per-share basis, to $2.06 billion, or $1.23 a diluted share, from
$1.92 billion, or $1.07 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bank of America met the consensus earnings estimate of
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial, revenues for the
quarter were down 5 percent from $1.33 per share the previous
period. Much of the company's growth was in its regional banking
sector, which recorded a 19 percent increase in consumer loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issues in the short term had been on the wholesale
side where they had weaker-than-expected trading revenue and
negative operating leverage as they continue to build up their
securities business,'' said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch, in a report issued after the bank's earnings were announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe this quarter is enough for investors to feel
more positive on this stock,'' said Kraushaar, who maintains a
neutral/buy rating on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America said a
slowdown in capital markets activity and depreciation in venture
capital investments from lower stock prices offset strong growth in
the company's consumer banking sector during the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the company's $1.23-per-share earnings were slightly
lower than initial expectations of $1.27 a share at the beginning
of the review process, according to industry analysts. PaineWebber
analysts said they had expected a ``mildly positive reaction''
among investors to the earnings announcement. The firm, which
maintains a buy rating on the stock, has acted in an investment
banking capacity for the Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite a slower market, we did gain market share in a number
of key investment banking businesses,'' said Hugh L. McColl Jr.,
Bank of America's chairman and chief executive, in a statement
issued after the earnings announcement. McColl said he expects the
company to report continued growth in upcoming quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America has about 4,500 retail branches in 21 states and
operates in almost 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
   After climbing initially, Bank of America's shares slipped back
to trade down 1/4, or 1 percent, at 47 1/4 in midday trading
Monday. The stock is trading just a few points above its 52-week
low of 42 5/16 that it hit in early March.
</P>
<P>
   FleetBoston Financial, the progeny of Fleet Financial and
BankBoston, reported that its earnings rose 15 percent on an
earnings-per-share basis to 83 cents a diluted share, or $772
million, compared with earnings of $700 million, or 72 cents a
share, in the year-earlier quarter. The Boston-based company had
been expected to post earnings of 82 cents a share in the latest
quarter, according to analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings from the commercial and retail banking sectors were
$328 million in the second quarter, up nearly one-third from the
same quarter a year ago. Officials attributed the jump to strong
deposit business, increased loan volume, and cost savings from
merging integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exceptional results were reported across the breadth of our
business franchise this quarter,'' said Eugene M. McQuade,
FleetBoston Financial's vice-chairman and chief financial officer,
in a statement released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company reporting better-than-expected earnings and
strong sector-wide growth, shares of FleetBoston fell Monday. The
stock was down 1 3/8, or 4 percent, at 36 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to fathom,'' said Nancy Bush, analyst at Prudential
Securities. ``The selling just seems quite indiscriminate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the bank was prudent in its projections, and expects
it to show continued growth in the third quarter. She gives the
stock a strong buy rating with a target price of $50. Prudential
does not underwrite the stock.
</P>
<P>
   FleetBoston is the country's eighth-largest bank, operating
about 1,250 branches in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of New York, which has about 350 branches in New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut, reported that its earnings rose 10 percent,
to $356 million, or 48 cents a diluted share, from $323 million, or
42 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Wall Street had been
expecting earnings of 47 cents a share, according to a First
Call/Thomson Financial survey of analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of New York said that its second-quarter profits were
largely driven by money management and securities holding fees. The
bank showed particularly strong growth in its securities processing
business and in foreign exchange revenues, with the latter up 50
percent from the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Bank of New York were up 2 3/8, or 5 percent, at 49
5/16. The stock hit a 52-week high of 49 15/16 on July 5. That's up
considerably from a few months earlier, when the stock price slid
to a 52-week low of 29 3/4.

INDONESIAN PRESIDENT MAY SEEK INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE IN MALUKUS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ President Abdurrahman Wahid said on Monday
that he may have to seek international assistance to halt 18 months
of sectarian violence in the eastern Maluku islands, where rogue
army units have taken sides in the intensifying clashes.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that brought to mind last year's East Timor
crisis, Wahid said he may have to call for international help if a
three-week-old state of civil emergency fails to stem the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have ordered the governor (of Maluku province) to work as
hard as he can to control the situation,'' Wahid told a meeting of
regional administrators at the state palace. ``If the outcome is
still not satisfactory after we have done our best, we may ask for
international help in the form of equipment and logistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab went further, telling reporters
later that the government was pondering whether to allow
international peacekeepers into the Malukus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international aid is limited to humanitarian aid, but if
it comes to the level that we are not ready to handle, we may have
to consider it,'' Shihab said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``This is a very hypothetical premise. We are
doing our best to stop the bloodshed. I think that within the
coming week it will get better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 11 days ago, Shihab had flatly ruled out foreign
intervention in the conflict, in which more than 2,500 people have
been killed.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is now a widespread perception that Wahid has
lost control of the crisis as well as his armed forces. Dramatic
television footage aired Monday showed soldiers fighting
side-by-side with Muslim militants in attacks on Christian
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The footage, shot over the weekend by an Associated Press
cameraman in the Maluku capital, Ambon, confirmed claims by
Christian leaders that army units were supporting the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid had ordered military commanders to remove units deemed too
emotionally involved in the conflict after accusations that both
the police and army were taking sides based on their religious
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of Indonesia is Muslim, but Malukus residents
are roughly split between Muslims and Christians. The region, once
known as the Dutch Spice Islands, lies 1,300 miles northeast of
Jakarta and consists of Maluku and North Maluku provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, the government also lost control of the armed
forces when pro-Jakarta militias and rogue military units began a
killing and arson spree in East Timor after the territory voted for
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia eventually bowed to international pressure and allowed
an Australian-led peacekeeping force into East Timor, which was a
humiliation for both the government and armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The American defense secretary, William Cohen, told reporters in
Australia Monday that Australia would probably also coordinate any
international intervention in the Malukus.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has accused political and military extremists of
instigating the latest violence to protect their business interests
and destabilize his government ahead of a crucial showdown with
Parliament next month.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 people have been killed since Wahid declared a
civil emergency in the Malukus last month, including as many as 20
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, local residents reported hearing sporadic gunfire in
Ambon, as well as loud explosions as fighting continued for a fifth
day.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has forced up to 500,000 people to flee the Malukus
and has destroyed tens of thousands of houses, buildings and places
of worship in a region where Muslims and Christians had peacefully
co-existed for centuries.

THEGLOBE.COM NAMES NEW CEO 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Stock prices are not up-to-the-minute) 
 By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service)
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Theglobe.com (TGLO:Nasdaq), a Web site that once
aspired to be a networking crossroads for the young and somewhat
Internet-savvy, named a new chief executive Monday after searching
for nearly six months.
</P>
<P>
   After its stunning initial public offering and a huge
advertising campaign, theglobe.com's fall from Wall Street's graces
has been achingly public. But the company has been remarkably
resilient, and its latest attempts to start anew reflect the
heart-stopping pace at which once-hot ideas have faded and careers
have risen again in the Internet sector.
</P>
<P>
   Charles M. Peck, formerly the senior vice president of
marketing, product and organizational development of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants, will begin the chief
executive job on August 1. Todd Krizelman and Stephan Paternot,
college buddies in their 20s who founded the company, vacated the
co-chief executive posts on January 27. (They remain stakeholders
of the company.) At the time, theglobe.com said it expected to
complete its search by the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based company has reported consistently widening
losses, as it has struggled to define itself. The company's shares,
off from a 52-week high of 17 11/16, rose 1/4, or 13 percent, to 2
3/16 Monday afternoon. Shares traded as high as a split-adjusted 31
3/4 at their initial offering on Nov. 13, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After raising money in the public markets, theglobe.com spent
heavily in subsequent quarters _ sometimes half its operating
expenses _ on the seemingly ubiquitous commercials depicting young
people improving their lives in amusing ways by joining online
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Several Wall Street firms, including underwriters Bear Stearns
and Volpe, Brown Whelan, which has been acquired by Prudential
Securities since the time of theglobe.com's initial public
offering, have dropped their coverage of the company.
Wit/Soundview, which underwrote a secondary public offerings for
theglobe.com, rates the company a hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to restart their business,'' said Jordan Rohan, an
analyst for Wit. ``The centralized content model has failed on the
Web unless you are a portal the size of AOL (AOL:NYSE) or Yahoo!
(YHOO:Nasdaq).''
</P>
<P>
   Selling the club-building function to weightier Web names should
be chief among theglobe.com's new strategies, Rohan said. He
declined to comment further until Peck details his plans.
</P>
<P>
   But Peck disputed the notion that generating advertising profits
by attracting visitors to online clubs has failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``With nearly 5 and a half million subscribers, I don't consider
it starting from scratch,'' he said in a phone interview. ``But how
do you get it to profitability faster?''
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to answer his own question, Peck first called
building online communities the company's ``core competency.''
Currently, 75 percent of revenue comes from advertising, while 25
percent comes from electronic commerce. He plans to add outsourcing
to that mix, as well as ``other things.'' He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Outsourcing possibilities could include selling the
club-building function to the online operations of training
companies and associations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peck said he thinks the company has a great brand reputation. He
did not seek out the job, but he recognized the company's name when
Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, the executive search firm, called him to
discuss the position.

 &HT;    MEDICARE FAILING TO SERVE END-OF-LIFE PATIENTS, PANEL TOLD
 &HT;    By ROB O'DELL
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cuts to Medicare are threatening access to
compassionate and specialized care for the dying, a congressional
panel was told Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare often cannot provide hospice care for the dying because
the reimbursement rate has not kept pace with the changes in
end-of-life care, said Linda Todd, a member of the board of
directors for the National Hospice and Palliative Care
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The increased cost of prescription drugs and out-patient
therapies, as well as more intensive services required from
hospices, have been responsible for the gap in Medicare
reimbursement, Todd said. She called on Congress to immediately
increase the reimbursement rates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 reduced
the inflation adjustment in Medicare reimbursement rates for
hospices and other health care providers. ``We need to eliminate
the reductions,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   An independent study this year found that patients are enrolling
in hospices closer to the time of death, Todd told the Senate Aging
Committee. That means they need more intense and frequent services
than were common when Medicare established the reimbursement rates.
</P>
<P>
   The average hospice stay has dropped from 70 days to 40 days,
the study showed. The rates were based on longer hospice
enrollments with less intense care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far too many patients die without ever being referred to
hospice care, and this is often the result of an unawareness that
hospice programs are available,'' Todd told the Senate Aging
Committee. ``Education is the only thing that will change this
situation, and we need it for consumers, health care professionals
and physicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who last year introduced a bill to
improve care for dying Medicare patients, said Congress needs to
re-examine how Medicare helps care for people at the end of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there is more that we can do to relieve suffering,
respect personal dignity and provide opportunities to people to
find meaning and comfort at life's conclusion,'' Collins said.
``Patients and their families should not have to fear that the
process of dying will be marked by pain, distress, or care that is
inconsistent with their values or wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins's bill would expand Medicare beneficiaries' access to
effective pain medications and develop end-of-life care for those
who do not qualify for hospice benefits, but it does not include
higher Medicare reimbursement rates for hospice care.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are more likely to talk to their children about safe
sex and drugs than to their terminally ill parents about choices as
they near death, Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education and communication is needed for the terminally ill
and their families, so that the dying can be provided with
compassionate and specialized care,'' she said. ``In our survey,
nine of of 10 respondents didn't realize that as Medicare
beneficiaries, their terminally ill family members are entitled to
all inclusive hospice care.''

GEORGIA-PACIFIC TO BUY FORT JAMES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a deal that will create the world's leading
manufacturer of tissue products, Georgia-Pacific (GP:NYSE) agreed
to buy rival Fort James (FJ:NYSE) for about $11 billion worth of
stock and cash, the companies said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Georgia-Pacific will acquire all of
Fort James' shares for $29.60 per share in cash and 0.2644 shares
of Georgia-Pacific stock. Based on Friday's closing prices, the
deal represents a 51 percent premium to the market for Fort James'
shareholders. Georgia-Pacific will also assume approximately $3.5
billion of Fort James net debt.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific said the deal continues a series of major
strategic actions aimed at strengthening its position as a high
value-added paper and building products company.
</P>
<P>
   In connection with the deal, Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific is
set to divest selected businesses, and will shed about 250,000
tones of tissue manufacturing capacity for away-from-home products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transformed Georgia-Pacific will be able to focus on those
paper and building products businesses that are value-added and fit
our strategic direction,'' said A.D. Correll, chairman and chief
executive of Georgia-Pacific. Fort James is based in Deerfield,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The combined revenues of the two companies exceeded $24.8
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum value that Fort James shareholders can receive is
$40 per share. Thus, if the price of Georgia-Pacific shares rises
above $39.33, the stock portion of the deal will be lowered.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch and Banc of America Securities were
Georgia-Pacific's investment bankers for the deal, while Morgan
Stanley represented Fort James.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific fell Friday 15/16 to close the week at 28 1/2.
Fort James was up 1/4 at 24 9/16.

GENERAL MILLS TO ACQUIRE PILLSBURY

<P>
   NEW YORK _ General Mills (GIS:NYSE), which wants to be known as
more than a cereal company, took a significant step in that
direction Monday when it agreed to buy Pillsbury from its British
parent, Diageo (DEO:NYSE), in an all-stock deal valued at just
under $10.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo will receive 141 million shares, or 33 percent, of
General Mills. The total value of the deal also includes $5.14
billion worth of Pillsbury debt.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will allow Diageo to concentrate on its more profitable
beverage divisions, while still maintaining a presence in the U.S.
food market. At the same time, the deal helps General Mills to
advance its ambition of becoming a food company with a broad
portfolio of products.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury makes such brands as Haagen-Dazs ice cream and Green
Giant frozen foods, while General Mills produces brands such as
Cheerios cereal and Betty Crocker cake mixes. Both companies are
based in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The news follows last week's announcement that the two companies
were in merger talks.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills closed last week at 36 5/16, down 11/16. Diageo's
American Depositary Receipts, which are equal to four common
shares, closed the week down 1/2 at 35 13/16.

   Who can blame Christopher Titus, television's latest emotionally
tortured soul, for taking matters into his own hands and ordering
his mother to ``pack your explosives and get out?''
</P>
<P>
   After all, she spent most of Titus' childhood tucked away in a
mental institution and, when at home, she looked for ways to murder
him and his father. Butcher knives, arsenic, an ax.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Mom released and back home, Titus is the only family
member not buying her recovery claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so sorry,'' Titus' girlfriend apologizes to the mother.
``He just can't seem to let go of your ... felonies.''
</P>
<P>
   So goes the message offered up by Titus, which is attracting 5
million viewers Monday nights on Fox. And while the situation
comedy may be extreme for its genre, the show shares the same
fundamental point of view television has had for years whenever it
decides to comment on people suffering from mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Run away. Fast.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Titus'' to ``ER'' to ``The Practice'' to ``Frasier,''
television suggests that people with mental illness are violent
souls destined to commit murder and mayhem, or demented losers who
end up homeless and living sad, lonely, pathetic lives.
</P>
<P>
   When Peter Berg wanted to introduce a series built around the
uncomfortable notion that we're all prone to emotional and chemical
disorders, he decided to set ``Wonderland'' within a ward that
practices forensic psychiatry _ the treatment of mental patients
who have committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which was canceled earlier this year after a brief
prime-time run, had the cooperation and advice of Dr. Robert
Berger, director of Bellevue's Forensic Psychiatry Service in New
York. But mental health professionals were ruthless in their
criticism that, again, people with mental illnesses were written as
violent criminals. Indeed, in the first episode, we learn that a
patient who pierces the stomach of a pregnant doctor with a syringe
had only hours earlier gunned down five people because voices told
him to. There was also a Wall Street broker who tried to kill
himself; and a young man who bit off his mother's thumb.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not only that the mentally ill are presented as
dangerous psychos who kill doctors, as one did this season by
stabbing Lucy (Kellie Martin) on ``ER.'' Mental health
professionals contend that producers and writers have a tendency to
depict people with mental illness as objects of ridicule, to use
psychiatric terminology inaccurately, and to overuse slang and
disrespectful terms for sufferers. It all contributes to a
dangerous form of stigmatization, studies show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to be appalled, saddened and disgusted by our
results,'' says George Gerbner, Bell Atlantic Professor of
Telecommunications at Temple University and author of the Cultural
Indicators Project Report, which was designed to measure
television's diversity and cultural impact.
</P>
<P>
   Founded 25 years ago and now commissioned by the Screen Actors
Guild, the research, updated by Gerbner and released every few
years (the latest in 1997), suggests, among other things, that the
image of people with mental illness as psychotic killers and ``evil
people'' has become deeply embedded in our popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   The current study was based on analysis of 6,882 speaking parts
appearing in hundreds of television programs encompassing three
seasons of major network prime-time programming and network
Saturday morning cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   With 70 percent of the portrayals showing people with mental
illness as violent and dangerous, mentally ill characters are far
and away the most violent and victimized single group on TV. And
since violence and retribution are shown as inherent in the
illness, their ``plights'' are considered inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 percent of telephone respondents said they view TV
characters with mental illness negatively, which makes sense,
considering that well over 50 percent of people with mental illness
are portrayed as drug and alcohol addicts, followed by criminals
(47 percent) and lonesome people who'd rather live in the street
(43 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Mental health advocates have long argued that TV's portrayals of
the mentally ill as criminals are disproportionate to reality, but
finding accurate figures on the violence rate of the mentally ill
is elusive; crime statistics rarely include the emotional state of
perpetrators. (Some point to a 1998 report funded by the nonprofit
John D. and Catherine MacArthur Foundation, which found that
ex-patients who don't abuse drugs or alcohol are no more dangerous
to other people than anyone else.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll admit that we don't know as well as we should,'' says Dr.
Otto Wahl, a professor of psychology at Virginia's George Mason
University and the author of ``Media Madness: Public Images of
Mental Illness.'' ``But we do know that television influences
people's conceptions of reality, and we do know that those who
believe in what they see can't help but see the world as a more
dangerous place.'' ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' may have invited loud protests, but the show's
content actually pales in comparison to many shows that came before
it. For example, the 1996 series ``Profit'' was about a man so
determined to climb the corporate ladder that he framed,
blackmailed and killed people who got in his way.
</P>
<P>
   Played by Adrian Pasdar, Jim Profit was emotionally unstable
after being forced to spend the bulk of his childhood in a
cardboard box. Scraps of food were tossed in, and a hole was cut in
the side so he could watch television.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers knew he was deranged because of his casual way of
killing his colleagues, and when he ventured back to his expensive,
split-level apartment, he'd curl up naked and sleep in a cardboard
box. The series lasted only a season without much written about
this mentally ill protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   More recently were the much-talked-about opening moments of
Stephen Bochco's cop drama ``Brooklyn South,'' in which a man
strolls a busy street picking off cops and others as though he's
walking through an arcade game. Once he's caught, a cop yells,
``We've got the crazy bastard.''
(MORE)
nn
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Titus,'' the studio audience roared with laughter when
the husband of the mentally ill woman came storming into the
apartment asking, ``Did you lock her in (the kitchen)? Take her
shoelaces? Pat her down for weapons?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're used as scapegoats,'' says Jean Arnold, a
co-chairwoman of the New York-based National Stigma Clearinghouse,
considered the hub of a nationwide information source on stigma.
``The most damaging aspect of the stigma is the connection of
mental illness with violence. And there's a lot of research out
there now that shows people with mental illness aren't described as
mentally ill as much as they're (described as) simply evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides images, there is language. Psychiatric terms such as
``schizophrenic'' and ``psychotic'' are routinely used incorrectly,
according to mental health experts, while offensive words such as
``nuts,'' ``psycho'' and ``lunatic'' crop up regularly in
television shows and particularly commercials for products ranging
from furniture (''We're insane for having prices this low!'' barks
a recent one) to stereo equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``Frasier'' abandoned promotional material
showing star Kelsey Grammer, who plays radio psychiatrist Frasier
Crane, wrapped in a straitjacket, under the heading ``television's
only certifiable success.'' ``Frasier'' has long been criticized by
the mental health establishment, which says Frasier and brother
Niles (David Hyde Pierce), also a psychiatrist, are
``condescending'' to their patients, often using them as punch
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier'' producers, like many network executives, declined to
comment for this story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't lack a sense of humor, contrary to popular belief,''
says James Radack, a spokesman for the National Mental Health
Association. ``But sitcoms present more ridicule than humor. Nor is
this a matter of being politically correct. It's a matter of being
sensitive to the fact that stigma pervades society just in everyday
talk, and once you're desensitized to it, it becomes an acceptable
part of your own lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why writers of these series use such damaging dialogue
so freely and frequently. They're not malicious; they really do
think it's OK because they hear everyone around them saying it. We
challenge producers to think outside that box.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Keyser, co-creator and executive producer of the Fox drama
``Party of Five,'' felt that challenge when writing a depression
story line for Paula Devicq's character, Kirsten. Even up to the
show's final season this year, dialogue was written to refer to the
depression, particularly when Kirsten appeared down or out of
sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Party of Five'' was commended for stretching the story line
out to make it more believable _ and, in turn, dramatic, which is
what producers say is the tough trick. ``We have to tell stories,
and it needs to be dramatic because viewers won't care whether it's
accurate _ they merely want good, dramatic TV,'' Keyser says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, as producers we're concerned that we could fall into
stereotypical traps. And, while I'm not defending what any other
producer has done _ we must be concerned with the responsibility of
being accurate _ (the fact is), if you want to keep your show on
the air, you have to be concerned with the need to entertain.''
___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Which is why those with mental illnesses are, at least on TV,
truly a breed apart, a special, distinct class of people
characterized primarily, if not exclusively, by the illnesses they
suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as terms like `a schizophrenic' or `a diabetic' identify
individuals in terms of their illnesses as if the diseases were
their only and most important characteristics, these broad
references to the mentally ill convey a similar lack of
appreciation of the basic human character of individuals with
psychiatric disorders,'' says Wahl, who has been studying the
subject for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the problem, and unfortunately, there are so few
roles that deviate from this that there's no balance. This creates
in the viewers' minds that what they see of people with mental
illness is indeed true. And why not, if that's all they see?''
</P>
<P>
   Berg agrees with Wahl, but wonders if the mental health
community has become so thin-skinned that it is liable to reject TV
projects that could, over time, do more good than harm.
</P>
<P>
   He says he offered to the mental health community more episodes
of ``Wonderland'' for viewing (two of the eight episodes aired,
leaving six unseen) that were lighter and even funnier, including
the hospitalization of a comedian played by Jeremy Piven, and a
happy conclusion to the birth of the child whose mother was stabbed
with the syringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of ``Wonderland'' wasn't depressing and it wasn't
violent,'' says Berg. ``This was a great opportunity to set the
record straight, to represent a world of a mental institution
without vilifying it. They talk about stigma. How can you combat
stigma by not letting people see the real deal? I understand their
paranoia, but you've got to take chances.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Take chances?'' says Wahl. ``Look, we took chances on
``Wonderland,'' which we were initially excited by because it
promoted itself as a realistic portrayal of mental illness. But it
turned out to be just a part of the pervasive pattern that adds up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to dismiss that people are overly sensitive, but
when you have people with mental illness as killers all the time,
it becomes the model,'' says Wahl. ``It's the same thing
African-Americans and gays and lesbians have complained about for
years. It affects how people view you without even knowing you.
That's why this needs to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Crisscrossing the nation like evangelists, the foes of stigma
are lobbying hard to put the matter in the national consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore's ``Change Your Mind About Mental Health'' campaign
and its partnership with MTV is considered a success. Ads running
on the music channel, as well as VH1 and Nickelodeon, are expected
to reach an audience of some 75 million, 60 percent of whom are 19
or younger.
</P>
<P>
   Sleek with high-concept editing, the ads feature brief portraits
of young people making comments including, ``Nobody tells you to
snap out of pneumonia!'' and ``It's easy to pretend you're OK.''
(Gore has been praised by mental health professionals after
discussing publicly her 1989 battle with depression after a car
accident almost killed her then 6-year-old son.)
</P>
<P>
   Has it helped? ``It's a long-term process,'' says Radack of the
National Mental Health Association. ``These type of media
portrayals have been around a long time and won't disappear
overnight. We'll just keep chipping away, hoping that something
like ``Titus'' would think long and hard about offering up mental
illness as a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anytime soon. In the episode about his mother's recovery,
well, Titus was right. By the episode's end, she'd drugged everyone
but her husband, for whom she had more diabolical plans. ``Don't
worry,'' she tells him, smashing a bottle against the wall, ``they
won't wake up until after your funeral.''

   The James Lileks commentary column slugged ``LILEKS-GREEN,''

on a Web site other than that of the Association of State Green

PERSONAL HEALTH: FOR LIFELONG GAINS, JUST ADD WATER 
</HEADLINE>
  ( EDITORS: This is the second of two columns on the body's need for
water.) 
 (Science Times) 
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans have long felt safe drinking their water out of the
tap, and with good reason. For the most part, public water supplies
and even well water throughout the country are highly unlikely to
make anyone acutely ill.
</P>
<P>
   The occasional failures of public systems to operate properly
are few and attract national attention, like the sanitation
breakdown in Milwaukee in 1993 that precipitated an outbreak of
cryptosporidiosis, sickening 400,000 people and causing 100 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years concern has been mounting about less obvious
potential hazards in drinking water, especially residues of
pesticides and industrial wastes, lead from old pipes and compounds
formed by chlorine and organic matter that are believed to be
cancer-causing.
</P>
<P>
   The concern about water safety has prompted millions of
Americans to reject the water that comes straight from the tap,
resulting in two new growth industries: bottled water and
filtration systems.
</P>
<P>
   In New York a section of the state's public health law and
regulations established by the federal Environmental Protection
Agency require the annual issuance of a public statement describing
the city's water supply and the quality of its water. The current
report states that the quality of the city's drinking water
``remains high and meets all health-related state and federal
drinking water standards.''
</P>
<P>
   But this raises a new question: are the standards high enough?
Do the compounds called disinfection byproducts, or DBP's, that are
formed when water is chlorinated pose a significant health risk,
doubling a water drinker's chances of developing bladder cancer and
perhaps causing some miscarriages? And what about turbidity, which
results when particles of clay, decaying plants or even parasites
become suspended in the water? In the same year as Milwaukee's
water disaster, excessive turbidity in Philadelphia's municipal
water led to scores of emergency room visits and hospitalizations,
mainly of children and the elderly, who developed gastrointestinal
illnesses after drinking turbid tap water.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, standards set for water sent from the source do not
take into account contamination from old lead pipes along the way
to the tap. Lead levels should always be below 15 parts per
billion, but to find out how much lead may be in your water, you
must have it tested.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if your tap has been unused for six or more hours,
you can flush out the lead by letting the water run until it is
cold (30 seconds to 2 minutes) before collecting it for drinking or
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   To find a certified lab that can test your water for lead,
turbidity, arsenic, parasites and trihalomethanes (the most common
DBP's), call the Environmental Protection Agency's Safe Drinking
Water Hotline, (800) 426-4791. Likewise, if your water comes from a
well, you will have to get it independently tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filters vary widely in what they can remove, how much they
cost and how expensive they are to maintain,'' states the June
issue of Nutrition Action Newsletter, a publication of the Center
for Science in the Public Interest in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There are table-top carafes that require frequent refilling,
faucet-mounted units that can be switched from a filter to a
nonfilter position and under-the-sink units that supply filtered
cold water from a separate spigot or the main faucet. Prices range
from about $20 to $500 and replacement filters can add up to $25 to
$150 a year. Before shopping, determine what you want to remove
from your tap water, what you can afford and the degree of
convenience you desire.
</P>
<P>
   A carafe uses a carbon filter that improves flavor and removes
chlorine, DBP's and lead, but not microorganisms. Carafes are
inexpensive and particularly handy for use in bathrooms and
bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Faucet-mounted, counter-top and under-the sink filters use more
sophisticated carbon filters, some of which can remove
cryptosporidium (look for a label stating NSF certified for
Standard 53 cyst removal).
</P>
<P>
   There are also rather expensive countertop, under-sink or
basement systems that cleanse water by a process called reverse
osmosis. The process works slowly and wastes a lot of water; it
also removes beneficial fluoride from the water.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are systems that distill water, taking out
everything but pure water. Unfortunately, valuable minerals and
fluoride, as well as flavor, are lost in the process. And water
that is so ``soft'' (that is, free of minerals) is associated with
an increased risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the store, check the available products for a
certification statement by NSF International, an independent
testing organization.
</P>
<P>
   If all you care about is the water's taste, odor or color, look
for a product that meets Standard 42. If you are also concerned
about health effects, for example, from microbial cysts, lead,
asbestos, pesticides and herbicides, mercury and turbidity, look
for a product that meets Standard 53. The label will list only what
the product is certified to do.
</P>
<P>
   For $5 you can buy an NSF book, ``Water Wise _ The Consumer's
Guide to Safe Drinking Water,'' which lists all the units tested by
NSF and what they remove. Write to NSF International, 789 N.
Dixboro Road, P.O. Box 130140, Ann Arbor, Mich., 48113-0140, or
call toll free (877) 867-3435. The Web site is www.NSF.org.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions on how often
to change the filter cartridge. Failing to do so could result in a
reversal of the desired effect, spewing unwanted organisms or
chemicals into your drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Bottled water may or may not be safer than what comes from your
tap. Most bottled water sold in the United States comes from
underground springs that are supposed to be pollution-free. Mineral
water is spring water that has a minimum of 250 milligrams of
dissolved minerals in each liter, and sparkling water is spring
water with added carbon dioxide to create the fizz. About a quarter
of bottled waters, including Pepsico's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's
Dasani, start out as municipal water, and they must say so unless
the water is filtered or disinfected before bottling.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration regulates bottled water and
requires that all products be tested annually for chemical,
physical and radiological contaminants. The International Bottled
Water Association requires all its members to test annually for
other contaminants still under review by the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Unannounced inspections by the NSF determine whether all members
of the association are in compliance. Bottled waters certified by
NSF are listed in its ``Water Works'' guide. But keep in mind that
certification does not mean a water is free of contaminants, merely
that the level of contamination is below certain allowable limits.
</P>
<P>
   Note, too, that, according to a recent study at Case Western
Reserve University School of Dentistry and Ohio State University
College of Medicine and Public Health, only 5 percent of bottled
water tested contained the recommended levels of fluoride.
</P>
<P>
   If children are given mostly bottled water, a fluoride
supplement would be a sensible idea. The researchers also found
that while most bottled water contained lower levels of bacteria
than tap water, about 20 percent of the bottles tested had far
higher bacterial counts.

<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ While it's not true Gabe Jennings was
raised by wolves in the remote California mountain hamlet of Forks
of Salmon, you should have heard him howl on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, his black hair and wispy goatee suggest a lupine
presence lurking inside this ferocious runner.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, a junior at Stanford University, jumped on the
1,500-meter field like a wolf pouncing on a rabbit and made the
race his own to highlight the third day of the U.S. Olympic Track
and Field Trials at Sacramento State's Hornet Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings seized control of the race with 500 meters to go and
won comfortably in 3 minutes, 35.90 seconds to earn a trip to the
Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   This is one man who's free, wild and 21.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, as a 17-year-old high school kid in Madison,
Wis., Jennings recalled working in a running shoe store and
watching the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember dreaming, thinking of where I'd be in four years,''
he said. ``All young kids do that. Here I am now. I can't explain
it. It's one thing to dream it, quite another to make your dreams
come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreams came true for the second- and third-place finishers, too.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Pyrah, a 1996 Olympian, came across second in 3:36.70 and
bettered the Olympic ``A'' qualifying standard of 3:36.80 in the
process. In third was Jennings' teammate at Stanford, Michael
Stember, a Sacramento native who thrilled the home crowd by making
the Olympic team in the time of 3:37.04.
</P>
<P>
   The only qualification for Stember is that he must attain the
Olympic standard by Sept. 11 or else relinquish his spot on the
team to fifth-placer Steve Holman, who already has a qualifying
time. Stember will get his chances right away, in special meets
designed for the purpose at Stanford on July 26 and 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty intense, this high I'm on,'' Stember, a
22-year-old Cardinal senior, said. ``It's amazing. So much work, so
many sacrifices. In front of the hometown crowd, my 94-year-old
grandmother in the stands, waving her arms, screaming her heart
out. I can't put into words how it feels. I'm ecstatic.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a pretty fair description of their coach at Stanford, Vin
Lananna, who put two runners on the Olympic team and nearly a third
when Brad Hauser finished fifth in the 10,000 final Friday night.
Hauser and twin brother Brent get another chance in the 5,000,
starting with Monday's first rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a visionary,'' Stember said of Lananna, who led
Stanford's men's track team to its first NCAA team championship in
64 years last month. ``He's a great balancer of egos. How he
balanced mine and Gabe's, I don't know. I credit a lot to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings and Stember could not be more dissimilar, as runners
and as young men. Thirty years ago, Jennings would have been a
world-class hippie with his penchant for percussion instruments and
free-form expression. Every time he opens his mouth, a stream of
consciousness spills out.
</P>
<P>
   A Jennings sampler:
</P>
<P>
   ``The moon kept getting full and the air kept getting fresh. . .
. I feel we're all brothers and sisters out there. I felt I wasn't
alone out there. . . . The crowd was a part of this experience. We
all raised the roof and broke on through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like this only comes around every four years. It's
so momentous in so many ways. It's something we all train for. It's
the ultimate ritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in my speed, I believe in my kick, I believe in my
heart. Races like this, you want to believe in your heart. . . . I
put my hand on my heart and felt the rhythm. I told my coach this
is my day. You can manifest your dreams and make them come true. I
did. I've been feeling the cosmic energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no nervousness and that stinky fear that exudes from
your sweat glands. . . . I started crying. It was a happy cry. It
was the happiest cry I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Stember interrupted his teammate, looked at him
and said, ``I love this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stember is pragmatic where his teammate is philosophical. He
also has a boyish look that recalls a young Joe Montana. At another
juncture in their postrace press conference, they embraced and
shared a moment that only two friends who had just made the Olympic
team can know.
</P>
<P>
   Pyrah, the man in the middle, had a story to tell as well. The
31-year-old Brigham Young University graduate spoke of his parents
and sisters watching him from the stands, of his recent marriage
and of his brother with cerebral palsy, welling up with tears as he
went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every race I run I dedicate to him,'' Pyrah said of his
brother. ``It's great to make the Olympic team. I train by myself.
I know what it's like to work hard. I couldn't be happier with my
second place.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest in a series of cool Canadian air masses that have
prevailed in the Northeast this month will spread from the Great
Lakes to New England Tuesday. A few showers will occur near a front
marking the leading edge of the cool air in central and northern
New England. Partly sunny and very warm conditions will precede the
front in the Middle Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
   A wavering front separating near record heat in parts of the
Southern states from cooler air to the north will be the focus for
clusters of showers and thunderstorms from the northern and central
Plains to the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the West will be very warm. Ample sun will bathe deserts
of the Southwest. Farther north, scattered afternoon thunderstorms
will form in the Rockies, especially over northern Wyoming and
southern Montana.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HEAT STREAK
</P>
<P>
   An unusual streak of hot days in Denver ended on Sunday as a
weak front with clouds and showers moved into northern Colorado.
The temperature had reached 90 degrees or higher every day since
June 29, peaking at 101 degrees on July 6. The 17-day streak fell
one day short of tying Denver's record for consecutive days of 90
degrees r higher. Hot streaks of 18 consecutive days had been
measured in July 1874 and July 1901. Although Tuesday will be very
warm, increased afternoon thundershowers in Denver later this week
are expected to interfere with the start of a new heat streak.

CONGRESS EXPRESSES ITS CONTEMPT FOR WILDLIFE

<P>
   Congress has been working on appropriations bills this summer so
that government programs and the people who work for the federal
government continue to be funded in the next fiscal year. Members
of Congress want to leave the Capitol early and campaign for the
elections. They certainly don't want to be held up or embarrassed
by presidential vetoes of appropriations bills in the early fall.
Members of Congress played that game with President Clinton once
before and lost. The Republican Congress doesn't want to give
Clinton and his party a political edge going into the elections, so
members want to get these appropriations bills done and agreed upon
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But anti-environmental politics is still a lively game in the
U.S. Senate. And the Senate version of the Department of the
Interior Appropriations Bill is being loaded up with
anti-preservation, anti-nature riders. Riders are attached to
appropriations bills with little or no debate and without public
scrutiny. Often these riders fund pork barrel projects the senators
want in their districts. Locally, such riders help the senator get
reelected using the American taxpayer's money to build some
unnecessary bridge or dam.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-environmental riders can also be pork barrel amendments
such as the rider that Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., has threatened to
add to the Interior Appropriations bill. Thomas' amendment would
delay the National Park Service's ban on snowmobiles in most
national parks.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway communities outside of Yellowstone National Park rent
and sell snowmobiles to winter visitors. As many as 12,000
snowmobilers enter Yellowstone National Park a day in December and
January. Naturally, the gateway communities will vote for Thomas in
their gratitude _ despite the harm to wildlife, air and water
quality and other recreational uses that snowmobiles create.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., has threatened to offer a floor
amendment to the bill that would limit the funding for the
administration of national monuments. Nickles isn't acting because
of local pressure. President Clinton hasn't named a national
monument in Oklahoma and isn't likely to. To date, there are no
sites in Oklahoma under consideration. In the 1995 to 2000 Senate
election cycle, Nickles received more than $500,000 in campaign
contributions from oil, gas and mining industries and the utility
companies.
</P>
<P>
   A second attack against national monuments was already attached
to the appropriations bill when it came out of committee. This
``committee report language'' gives a $1 million windfall to the
Montana Stockgrowers Association under the rubric of the
organization's Undaunted Stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Wilderness Society, the Montana Stockgrowers
Association has been actively campaigning against Clinton naming
the Missouri Breaks, an especially scenic area along the upper
Missouri River, as a national monument. Secretary of the Interior
Bruce Babbitt has held meetings in Montana to discuss the Missouri
Breaks as potential national monument.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., attached a rider to the bill that
exempts the White Mountain National Forest in northern New
Hampshire from the Clinton administration's roadless policy. The
White Mountain National Forest is already threaded with an
interstate highway and numerous state highways. Not enough roads
for Gregg, though. Never mind that roadless areas in large forest
areas provide clean waters without chemical pollutants, without
spending taxpayer dollars, and protect the state's wildlife and
fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., plans to offer an ``extinction
rider'' to the Interior Appropriations bill. The rider would
permanently block all conservation measures to prevent the
extinction of the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow by blocking efforts to
keep sufficient water in the Rio Grande River. At one time, the Rio
Grande Silvery Minnow could be found in nearly 1,000 miles of the
river out to the Gulf of Mexico. It is one of four genetically
distinct subspecies of minnow. Imagine having your name attached to
an authorization that could wipe out an entire subspecies: Sen.
Pete ``Extinction Rider'' Domenici.
</P>
<P>
   Two dangerous riders have been withdrawn and one may still be
attached to the appropriations bill in the next few weeks:
</P>
<P>
   _ Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, withdrew his floor amendment to
limit spending on the administration's roadless policy in our
national forests.
</P>
<P>
   _ A rider that would have taken at least 93 acres from the Cape
Hatteras National Seashore and 33 acres from the Pea Island
National Wildlife Refuge and given those acres to the Army Corps of
Engineers to construct two rock jetties in North Carolina's Oregon
Inlet was withdrawn. The jetties, had they been built, would have
provided better access to the ocean for commercial fishing fleets _
all at taxpayer expense and the expense of a precious ecological
area.
</P>
<P>
   _ And finally, to top off the list of those who believe ``if you
can't mine or drill it, it ain't worth nothin','' Sen. Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska, had planned to attach a floor amendment to
another appropriations bill in order to mandate oil drilling in the
ecologically sensitive Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and it is
conceivable he may offer this same amendment for the Interior
Appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski's timing is suspect. In the past, he has suggested the
rationale that such drilling in the refuge would keep the oil and
gas prices down. Now that the cost of gasoline has spiked to a new
high, Murkowski obviously thought that he could fool the American
public. It's a transparent ruse.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups estimate that the oil supply under the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would only last six months.
However, the potential damage to the ecology of the refuge by
drilling would likely last for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Short-term profits often blind people to long-term damages. And
unfortunately, short-term memory often leads voters to forget those
who would sacrifice the public's natural heritage for a few quick
bucks.

 ART ADV: Two photos, of attendees at the 1996 Democratic (NNS1) and
Republican (NNS2) national conventions). 
 By MILES BENSON  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once upon a time, conventions offered cliffhanging
drama. They became arenas in which two or more claimants truly
battled for the nomination and the outcome was in doubt, with many
successive roll call votes before a winner finally was chosen. No
longer.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a major party candidate failed to win nomination
on the first ballot was in 1952, when Democrat Adlai E. Stevenson
won on the second ballot.
</P>
<P>
   And today, with pollsters and political leaders shaking their
heads over the current low level of public excitement about the
presidential race, the opposing camps of Republican George W. Bush
and Democrat Al Gore are counting heavily on their upcoming
national conventions to kick-start the attention and enthusiasm of
millions of voters.
</P>
<P>
   That may be the most important remaining purpose of modern
political conventions in an era when the presidential nominations
are sewn up months ahead of time in the primary process.
</P>
<P>
   As the Republicans get ready to stage their big, choreographed
and packaged ceremonial show in Philadelphia July 31-Aug. 3,
followed by the Democrats' similar extravaganza in Los Angeles Aug.
14-17, the only real suspense is the identity of Bush's and Gore's
running mates.
</P>
<P>
   There certainly will be no surprises in the party platforms.
Those are being carefully crafted to steer each party close to the
nation's political center, while embracing the broad themes and
specific programs that Bush and Gore have been test-marketing
throughout their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush faces a tricky task at his convention, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   He must simultaneously make the case for both ``continuity and
change,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center
for People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   This apparent contradiction, Kohut said, results from
overwhelming public satisfaction and comfort with the prevailing
economic conditions and with the policies of the incumbent
Democrat, Bill Clinton. It's a mood that co-exists alongside a
clear desire for relief from leadership regarded as personally
flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush wants to blur the issue differences (with
Gore), particularly in the area of economic and social policy,''
said Thomas Mann, a political scientist at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, he wants to make a case for low-risk change, and
that change will be focused mostly on the way we conduct politics.
It's not going to be substantive issue change, it's going to be,
`Let's stop this awful bickering in Washington, let's get this
sleazy, untrustworthy, lying behavior out of the Oval Office,'''
Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP convention \roMDUL\ &UR; -provides Bush with a potential
national audience, one that may be ready to begin paying a little
more attention as the candidate tries to explain the meaning of his
slogan, ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   It will also help fire up party workers and political activists
for the campaign drive to November.
</P>
<P>
   Although the major television networks will not offer the
gavel-to-gavel coverage of the conventions they once provided,
cable television and the Internet will make sure no interested
citizen or political junkie is shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP convention will be available on cable in 69 million
homes, ``two-thirds of the households in America,'' Republican
National Chairman Jim Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, both parties will attempt to reproduce, if not
surpass, the historic intensity, look, sound, flavor and feeling of
past national political conventions, with music, hats, banners,
bunting, confetti and balloons, ``spontaneous'' marching
demonstrations of support for favored political figures and causes,
and, naturally, speeches -- lots of speeches showcasing past heroes
and new young talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, when you have a birthday party you always have a
birthday cake and you sing `Happy Birthday,''' said Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convention is still a chance to project yourself to the
nation and to the world,'' Nicholson said. ``At the same time, it's
a coming together of the grass-roots activists in the party every
four years to examine ourselves and express to the American people
who we are, what we stand for, and what our vision is for the
country and its future. And we'll do all of that, as will the other
great political party.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Conventions are still a vital part of the political process that
goes beyond formalizing the nominees of the two major parties for
the highest office in the land, said Democratic National Chairman
Joe Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``People learn things from conventions,'' Andrew said.
``Conventions define who the candidates are, what concerns them and
what the issues are. You can tell from the convention what kind of
president and what kind of administration you would have.''
</P>
<P>
   The best evidence that conventions have direct impact, Andrew
said, is the measurable ``bump'' the nominee immediately gets in
public opinion polls afterward.
</P>
<P>
   That represents ``massive movements of voters,'' Andrew said.
``People learn more or change their minds'' based on what happens
at conventions. ``Bill Clinton in 1992 went up almost 20 points in
20 days. Clearly that meant the convention was important.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, Gore has a lot of work to do at his own convention,
according to Mann of the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore's most important task, by far, is to stop being vice
president, which is a weak position, and become the standard-bearer
of the party,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   The convention is his big chance to make the transition. The
script calls for Clinton to make an early appearance that allows
him ``to jump his job approval rating up to about 62 or 63
percent'' on the convention's opening night, Mann said, ``and then
have him leave town, giving Gore three days to establish himself as
the leader of the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, Gore must use that time ``to clearly frame the election as
a referendum on the economy,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, reversing the Bush strategy, Gore ``must sharpen the
differences on the key issues of taxes, domestic priorities and
Social Security,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bush have to accomplish their tasks without
further boring a national electorate in which the voting turnout
indicators are already sagging below 50 percent, according to
Kohut's polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``One in five voters say that who wins the election isn't as
important as it used to be, and 30 percent say it doesn't make a
difference who gets elected,'' Kohut said.
</P>
<P>
   A ``bare majority'' think the candidates have different
positions on the issues and the rest are convinced the two
candidates ``are more alike than they are different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cynicism over what the next president can achieve is running
at the same level as it was in August 1976, when the country was
still recovering from Watergate and the oil shortages,'' Kohut
said.
</P>
<P>
   The conventions will be the candidates' opportunity to change
those perceptions -- or to deepen them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Border Patrol rescued two Mexicans abandoned by
smugglers in the Arizona desert last week, U.S. immigration
officials saw a hint of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   They sent in video cameras and captured the men's harrowing tale
for use in public service announcements to be shown in Mexico and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Part of a sweeping program launched two years ago by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, the often-graphic TV spots
and posters show bodies of migrants who died in the desert or
testimonials from relatives who lost loved ones. They are aimed at
potential migrants and relatives in the United States who might
finance their journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the aunt or uncle in Los Angeles or Newark or Chicago
that is saying, `Send up your son or daughter. Here's some money to
pay for a smuggler,''' said Don Mueller, an INS spokesman who is
helping to coordinate the public service campaign. ``If we can
reach that audience, we can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has taken on new urgency along the Mexican border,
where more than 230 undocumented immigrants have died from exposure
or drowning this year, making it the deadliest year on record.
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign is also being launched in places such as China,
the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Central America. The same public
service announcements, which focus on the dangers of paying
smugglers, known in Latin America as coyotes and in China as
snakeheads, have aired on Spanish-language TV programs broadcast in
states where large numbers of Latinos reside.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, new public service announcements produced for
the first time in collaboration with the Mexican government are
scheduled to appear on 91 TV stations and 1,300 radio stations
across Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   INS critics blame tougher enforcement for forcing migrants into
more isolated and dangerous parts of the desert and mountain
passes, but even they agree the public service announcements could
save lives.
</P>
<P>
   When INS Commissioner Doris Meissner visited China two weeks ago
in a bid for anti-smuggling cooperation, she carried with her
posters the service would like the Chinese government to display.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous high-profile incidents in recent years are proof that
the public service announcements are not just scare tactics. Last
month, the bodies of 58 Chinese immigrants were found aboard a
truck entering England, and last year eight migrants died after
being caught in a freak snowstorm while crossing mountains outside
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human smuggling is a nightmare. Don't mistakenly get involved
in it,'' one of the posters for use in China states. It goes on in
poetic Mandarin: ``A stormy journey. By the time you reach the
shore you are near death. Then everyone is sent back immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   A poster destined for use in Latin America shows a funeral and
warns: ``Your brother trusted coyotes. Don't risk your life.''
</P>
<P>
   INS officials in Washington concede that public education alone
will not stop the hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants
streaming into the country each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure of the size of the impact,'' one INS agent
stationed in the Caribbean said. ``I go out with the local Navy and
interview these people after they are picked up, and they tell me,
`Tomorrow, I'll get on another boat.'''
</P>
<P>
   But both the INS and its critics in the immigrant advocacy
community agree that the public service announcements could save
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it represents a response to the extraordinary loss of
life,'' said Cecilia Munoz, vice president for policy at the
National Council of La Raza, one of the nation's most influential
Latino advocacy groups. ``It's important that the U.S. and Mexican
governments respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Omar de la Torre, minister for migration affairs in the Mexican
Embassy in Washington, said the announcements may serve to educate
some Mexicans and Central Americans to the dangers they face.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who live in rural areas far from the border cannot
imagine how it is,'' de la Torre said. ``They live in places where
the temperature is comfortable and the land is easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government also has shown increasing interest in
combating smuggling. Last week, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji met with
European Union officials and vowed to work harder against
international gangs that run the smuggling trade.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz said that in addition to public outreach, the Border
Patrol should re-examine its get-tough strategy, dubbed Operation
Gatekeeper. Instead, the government has announced better safety and
rescue training for agents.

   The two men saved July 12 had been in the desert for three days
and were out of water. They were located by Operation Skywatch, a
new initiative that deploys helicopters and planes to scan the
desert for migrants in trouble. A third migrant alerted the Border
Patrol that his friends had been abandoned when they couldn't keep
pace.

   In recent months, tensions have run high in Mexico about the
increasing number of deaths on the border and the vigilantism of
some Arizona ranchers who have taken to rounding up migrants
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Russo of the U.S. Embassy in Mexico said the State
Department gave the Mexican government veto authority over language
in the most recent public service campaign but has gotten excellent
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we prefer to focus on the common ground we have with
Mexico,'' Russo said. ``We both agree that coyotes are a very
serious problem. They often victimize the undocumented, abandoning
them or stealing their money.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Torre said there must be understanding on both sides of
the border, however, about the underlying issues of poverty driving
the smuggling trade.
</P>
<P>
   And although the public service announcements advise potential
migrants that there are legal avenues, for most Mexicans, Chinese
and other poor immigrants, the odds are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only come if a close family member or employer in the
United States petitions for you,'' Munoz said. ``For someone
without connections, it is impossible.''

   STOCKTON, Calif. _ Jerry Rice made the early-morning drive from
his home in Atherton to the San Francisco 49ers training camp at
the University of the Pacific with his mind drifting to other days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve, he's going to be missed,'' Rice said, referring to the
prospect of camp without just-retired quarterback Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about him on the drive down. . . . He's a hard
guy to replace. He meant so much to this organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice also reminisced about his early camps with ``(Joe) Montana,
Ronnie Lott and all those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like another world. About half the players who will be
in this camp are new. Rice was one of a handful of veteran players
joining more than 30 rookies at 8:45 a.m. Sunday for the first
practice of training camp 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they've got their names on their helmets,'' Rice said
of the large contingent of newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 16-year wide receiver was the oldest player on the
field, and enters camp as the team's undisputed star, Rice arrived
at camp acting a bit like a fretful rookie. Most of the other
veterans don't report until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to get back in there, get back into the best shape I
can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rice always arrives early, he always is in shape and he always
jumps right into practice, acting as if there was some doubt he'd
make the team.
</P>
<P>
   Young once said that a key to Rice's success was that he ``still
acted like a kid trying to make the junior varsity.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, of course, owns 14 NFL records, has been in 12 Pro Bowls
and was named to the NFL's 75th Anniversary Team. He may be the
best wide receiver of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have to do is throw everything out the window,'' he
said, looking to adjust to second-year quarterback Jeff Garcia.
``I've got to start from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice earned the first cheers of training camp. With several
hundred fans looking on during passing drills, Rice ran an out
pattern into the left flat. Rookie quarterback Tim Rattay was off
the mark, throwing the ball behind Rice as he broke for the
sideline. Rice, making it look easy, reached back with one hand,
caught the ball, turned upfield and sprinted 20 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci was obviously delighted that Rice was in camp and
giving the rookies a lesson in proper deportment _ right down to
his meticulous appearance in a fitted No. 80 red jersey and black
tights.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed it today,'' Mariucci said. ``He dresses exactly like
you should, he showed the young guys how to practice, how to carry
out the run. . . . He's doing it mostly by example.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rice was delighted to be in camp. He said he was looking
forward to ``hanging out with the new guys.'' He ran strong routes,
caught everything and finished each play with a burst downfield. He
was jovial and upbeat in talking with writers. He enthusiastically
ran over to the fence after practice to sign autographs for fans.
He was in his element.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have enjoyed coming to training camp,'' he said. ``I didn't
look at it as a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice had slipped into the past-tense in his comments. He
acknowledged the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm trying to enjoy every second of it,'' he said.
``Because I know it's coming to an end.''

<P>
   If Zeus were alive and chucking lightning bolts down from the
sky, he would be perched right over Goodland, Kan. That is where
many of the nation's most violent thunderstorms are spawned, the
kind that drop baseball-size hail, tornadoes, torrents of rain and
furious winds across the Great Plains states.
</P>
<P>
   So when scientists from nearly a dozen universities and
government laboratories recently decided to carry out an advanced
study on what causes lightning and severe weather, they deployed
their instruments on the cornfields around Goodland, hunkered down
and waited for Zeus to rock and roll.
</P>
<P>
   Their eight-week experiment, called the Severe Thunderstorm
Electrification and Precipitation Study, or Steps, ended on July
16. Scientists say the experiment turned up some stunning surprises
that may force them to revise their theories of how lightning is
produced. Among them were many instances of a rare kind of
so-called reverse lightning, in which electrons shoot upward from
the ground to the cloud, instead of downward as in normal
lightning, and new clues about what causes strange lights called
blue jets, red sprites, elves and trolls that appear in the upper
atmosphere above thunderstorms. Sprites, which last long enough to
be seen with the naked eye, happen only above reverse, or
``positive cloud to ground'' lightning, adding to the mystery of
both phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, researchers witnessed several events within
severe storms that seemed to predict when tornadoes would form. For
example, they observed updraft regions in clouds where suddenly all
lightning ceased. Moments later, tornadoes formed in that area. If
lightning-free zones usually precede tornadoes, they said, weather
forecasters might be able to watch for these ``electrical holes''
in the clouds and make better short-term predictions for severe
weather, including large hail, heavy rain and tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   The study was organized because the details of precipitation,
hail and lightning formation within severe storms are still not
completely understood, said Dr. Morris Weisman, a scientist with
the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who
helped coordinate each day's observations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given similar initial weather conditions, we don't know why
some storms produce downpours while others contain just as much
water vapor but make very little or no rain,'' Weisman said.
</P>
<P>
   With funding from the National Science Foundation, the
scientists converged on Goodland armed with radar, weather
balloons, mini-weather stations on wheels, lightning detectors and
an airplane that can fly into the heart of thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   They set up this equipment along the Kansas-Colorado border,
where moist air from the Gulf of Mexico meets hot, dry air from the
Southwest to cook up storms so huge they can last for days as they
move east.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have thought for years that they understood basically
what happens inside storm clouds, said Dr. Donald MacGorman of the
National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla. For example,
lightning is generated in cold upper layers of air when particles
of partly frozen water and ice crystals collide inside large
clouds. These collisions generate positive and negative electrical
charges the same way that walking across a carpet on a dry day can
build up static charges and result in a shock when a person touches
a doorknob. In general, negative charges sink to the middle or
lower parts of the cloud, while positive charges rise to upper
levels, he said. When air can no longer insulate these opposite
charges, an avalanche of runaway electrons initiates a lighting
bolt. Most electrical discharges move sideways within or between
clouds, but electrical charges can also flow to the ground in
familiar flashes of lightning.
</P>
<P>
   As for storms, as hot air near the ground rises into cooler
regions, any moisture in the air condenses into cloud droplets.
Strong updrafts promote the formation of rain, which can fall and
drag air masses back down to the surface. Storms like this are
short-lived. But if winds are strong or there are significant
temperature differences and large amounts of moisture, very large
clouds can evolve into thunderheads that acquire a vortex of
circulating air. These supercells can produce tornadoes and other
violent weather.
</P>
<P>
   But, as everyone knows, weather is fickle, MacGorman said. Some
supercells produce rain, lightning, hail and tornadoes; some
produce no rain or lightning but pound crops with large hail;
others produce floods and tornadoes but no lightning and hail. The
reasons for such different outcomes will eventually be found in the
minute physical properties of storm clouds and a better
understanding of chaotic systems, MacGorman said.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two months, Steps investigators met every morning
at the National Weather Service center in Goodland and pored over
weather data, looking for the storms.
</P>
<P>
   On good days, when the weather was bad, the scientists scrambled
into action. Dr. Erik Rasmussen, a scientist with the Severe Storms
Laboratory, sent out a crew to chase storms in six Oldsmobiles
fitted with ski racks mounted with weather instruments. These
volunteers collected data once a second on winds, temperature,
pressure and humidity under and near the storm front. Conditions
measured on the ground may help researchers learn what is happening
in the clouds overhead.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on June 29, the volunteers discovered that the air
falling to the ground along the rear flank of a very large storm
had suddenly turned warm. Minutes later, the storm spawned
quarter-size hail and a tornado. Still later, measuring other
downdrafts at the back of the same storm, they found that the
falling air had suddenly turned cold. Minutes later it rained and
hailed but no tornado formed.
</P>
<P>
   While this was going on, Charlie Summers, a pilot employed by
the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, took to the skies
in a single-engine airplane designed to fly through severe weather.
Resembling a 1940s Studebaker with wings, the craft is armored with
700 pounds of aluminum coating, a metal grate to keep hailstones
out of its carburetor and thick acrylic windshields. Strapped into
a four-way harness, Summers flew the plane into the heart of severe
storms where he was buffeted by 50-mile-an-hour vertical winds,
direct lightning strikes, hail and enough ice to temporarily stall
the engine. Instruments measured the spectrum of water and ice
particles in the clouds, air pressure, temperature and electric
fields.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane conked out about a week before the experiment
ended, said Dr. Andrew Detwiler, an expert on storm electrification
at the South Dakota School. But the aircraft gathered large amounts
of data that will be compared with information collected on the
ground, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Summers flew, other scientists operated special radar
stations that could directly measure the size and shape of water
particles in every cloud. Conventional radar cannot do this. The
added information is expected to shed light on exactly how
lightning is generated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   To study lightning, scientists from the New Mexico School of
Mines and Technology in Soccorro turned on 13 specially built
lightning detectors that were laid out in cornfields under radar
observation. Each detector is about the size of a small coffee
table and contains a receiver that measures how long it takes for
radio signals, which are always produced by lightning strikes, to
arrive, allowing researchers to calculate the exact time and
location of every lightning strike in every storm that occurred
during the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   By comparing this detailed picture of where lightning occurs
with radar images and airplane data on precipitation, it may be
possible to learn more about how lightning is generated, said Dr.
Paul Krehbiel, who helped develop the system.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary data show that charge fields _ the layers of
positively and negatively charged particles within clouds _ do not
fall into the conventional pattern, Krehbiel said. They are often
upside down, meaning negative on top and positive below.
</P>
<P>
   This inverted polarity was also observed by scientists from the
National Severe Storms Laboratory, who released up to four weather
balloons into the belly of each storm. Each balloon measured
temperatures, humidity, pressures, wind directions and electric
fields.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising number of storms produced the reversed, ``positive
cloud to ground'' lightning that was thought to be rare or at least
restricted to very large supercell storms, said Dr. David Rust,
chief of the Mesoscale Research and Applications Division at the
Severe Storms Laboratory. ``We're seeing it in ordinary smaller
storms'' along with electrically inverted charge fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a positive-to-ground lightning strike, positive charges first
rush from the cloud to the ground, creating a lightning channel
through which electrons flow from the ground back up to the cloud.
Such lightning strikes tend to carry more charge, last tens of
seconds longer and are less branched than the more common
negative-to-ground lightning. But how this reversal of charge
occurs remains something of a mystery, Rust said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Storms may reverse their polarity all the time, but we just
never knew it,'' Krehbiel said. While scientists on the ground and
in the air over Kansas and Colorado ran around collecting
information on each storm, other Steps researchers sat quietly at
an observation post called the Yucca Ridge Field Station in the
foothills of the Rockies near Fort Collins, Colo. There, with an
unobstructed view of the Great Plains, researchers waited for blue
jets, red sprites, elves and trolls _ strange lights that could be
seen with the naked eye or detected with instruments over the tops
of thunderstorms to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Blue jets are extremely energetic fields of charged particles
that rise up to 30 miles from the tops of clouds. After they occur,
lightning stops for several seconds. Red sprites are striated
glowing ribbons that rise high above the jets and reach the
ionosphere, lasting for 3 to 10 milliseconds. They happen only over
regions of reverse lightning. Elves are thin, expanding doughnuts
of light found on the lower edge of the ionosphere. They tend to
occur above sprites after a lightning pulse. Trolls are propagating
waves of energy that appear to come back out of cloud tops and hook
up with sprites, but no one really knows what they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were biologists, it would be like we discovered some new
body parts,'' said Dr. Walt Lyons, a scientist with FMA Research, a
company that runs Yucca Ridge. Somehow, he explained, lightning
discharges in the lower atmosphere are having effects in the upper
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   During the experiment, Lyons and his colleagues observed more
than 1,000 red sprites over the dissipating regions of storms where
clouds flattened out and produced a type of horizontal discharge
called spider lightning or creepy-crawly lightning. These clouds
also produced reverse lightning over which the sprites were seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy but exhausted,'' Lyons said. It will take time to
analyze what happened inside those clouds, he said, but whatever is
going on may help explain sprites.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, each researcher said it will take many years to analyze
the all the data collected on the Great Plains this spring and
summer.

   At the south edge of the Magnolia Plantation, eight simple
cabins stood in a field of clover. Generations of whitewash were
peeling from the mud-brick walls. All but one front porch had
rotted away, and there were gaping holes where doors and windows
used to be. Hidden from the main house by rows of live oaks, the
cabins had been forgotten by many and ignored by most. There was
almost nothing left _ except the stories of the slaves who once
lived in them.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Hertzog hadn't been thinking about slavery when she agreed
to go along with her rich friends' plans to turn part of her
beloved Magnolia into a national park. She had been thinking about
her family's land, and her struggle to hold onto it.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzog's ancestors settled that fertile land at the south end
of Cane River more than 200 years ago, and she had lived in the big
house at Magnolia nearly all her life. She had too little money to
keep it going, and no children to pass it on to. Sometimes when she
talked about her devotion to the land, it sounded almost like
religion. ``If you had land,'' she would say, ``you were raised
that it is very important, and that if you had it, you had to keep
it.''
</P>
<P>
   To listen to Betty Hertzog is to feel the abiding power of Old
South symbols. Slight but still sturdy at 70, Hertzog is reserved
to the point of reclusiveness, happiest walking the plantation
grounds alone. But she had come to believe that the new national
park, with its droves of tourists, offered a way to hold onto the
land _ to preserve her family's stories and teach future
generations about the agricultural practices that made Magnolia the
Goliath of Cane River when cotton was king.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby DeBlieux hadn't been thinking about slavery, either, when
he began his campaign to turn Magnolia's work buildings into a
national park. He had just been trying to rescue his town.
</P>
<P>
   He had been trying since he was mayor in the mid-1970s, and
Natchitoches (pronounced NA-kuh-tish) was drying up: farms were
dying, working families were fleeing, much of downtown was boarded
shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that history was the key to turning the whole town
around,'' said DeBlieux, 67, who owns the Tante Huppe Bed &AMP;
Breakfast on Jefferson Street. ``First people would want to come
here to visit, and if they did, they would want to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBlieux _ pronounced like the letter W _ doesn't look like an
economic-development visionary. With his shock of cottony-white
hair, his shirttails hanging over sagging jeans, he generally seems
to have just rolled out of bed. But he was right. Before long, that
ugly downtown had become a National Historic Landmark, a mile-long
quarter of French Colonial buildings converted into antique shops,
restaurants and souvenir emporiums. The tourists came, and they
stayed, often in the 32 B&AMP;B's _ as people here will tell you, the
most in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when DeBlieux and his preservationist friends thought
about Natchitoches' larger possibilities, they tended to look down
Cane River to Magnolia and its sister plantation, Oakland. The old
places had gone to seed some, but with a little help and money from
the National Park Service, they could make Natchitoches the
Colonial Williamsburg of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, with some deftly applied pressure from Louisiana's
senior senator at the time, J. Bennett Johnston _ Betty Hertzog's
cousin by marriage _ Congress created the Cane River Creole
National Historical Park.
</P>
<P>
   As for how slavery would fit in, Betty Hertzog hoped the Park
Service wouldn't dwell on it too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people around here have put slavery behind them,''
she said. ``It is a part of the history here, and no one wants to
ignore it. But I don't want them to talk about slavery and get
stuck on that.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year ago, though, she started to feel
uneasy about the Park Service's plans. A new ranger, a black woman
named Carla Cowles, had begun scratching around the old slave
cabins.
</P>
<P>
   Slavery was pretty much all Cowles was thinking about when she
came to Cane River. A heavy-set woman of 40 with a booming laugh
laid over an edgy determination, Cowles (pronounced coals) had
started her career at Colonial Williamsburg. But she came away with
a very different ambition than Bobby DeBlieux's: to provide a face
and a voice to the often-ignored stories of African slaves.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, in re-enactment and song, she had shown the
violent fate of captured runaways and the pain of families torn
apart, had explained how people treated as property had held onto
humanity and hope. Magnolia's slave cabins, she thought, would be
the perfect stage for her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to tell the whole story,'' she said. ``Some people
might call it revisionist history, but I think what's been going on
around here is a lot of revisionist history.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories, of course, have consequences. And from the beginning,
what hardly anyone really counted on was how a new park, on a
plantation that once had 260 slaves, might stir things up in a
place where people had agreed long ago that the last thing they
wanted to talk about was race.
</P>
<P>
   When the Park Service held hearings about what kind of programs
people wanted at the park, there was a lot of enthusiasm about
restoring the old buildings. When slavery came up, there was
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking about slavery proved difficult for whites and blacks,
and promised complications for park interpretation,'' the Park
Service reported. ``Blacks and whites treated slavery as a
delicate, nearly taboo subject for public discussion.''

 &UR; NATCHITOCHES, La.: public discussion.'' &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE ROLE OF A LIFETIME
</P>
<P>
   Betty Hertzog had spent weeks getting the big house ready for
the Natchitoches Fall Pilgrimage of Historic Homes, and on opening
day last October, it looked like a movie set. Sunlight cascaded
over the portrait of Magnolia's patriarch, Ambrose LeComte 2nd,
striking a dandy pose in his ascot and Colonial jacket. The
Baccarat chandelier bought years ago in New Orleans was up in the
grand foyer once again. The air was suffused with the history of
Hertzog's ancestors _ it hung from every wall, filled every shelf _
and she wondered if she was doing her family proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy wouldn't have liked these tours, because he didn't like
strangers roaming through his house,'' she said. ``But you can't
make a living from farming anymore. The tourists help pay to keep
up this old place.''
</P>
<P>
   As an only child, she had always known she would someday take
over Magnolia. But she had expected to live a little of her own
life first. She was just out of college and heading to Houston to
look for work when the call came. Her father had suffered a heart
attack. Someone had to manage the harvest. ``It was panic, pure
panic,'` she said. ``I really wasn't sure I could manage it the way
Daddy did, but I had to try, or else we might lose it all.''
</P>
<P>
   So at 23, she traded her big-city dreams for a job at a local
bank, and began her turn as caretaker of the land. No one asked her
to stay. No one had to. Magnolia was simply not going to go the way
of the other Cane River plantations, into strangers' hands.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been more than 10 years since Hertzog oversaw a
harvest. In the late 1980s, when the bottom fell out of cotton, she
rented her fields to corporate growers. Soon, she began the house
tours. And then, in the early '90s, her rich preservationist
friends began talking about turning Magnolia's work buildings _ the
slave cabins and hospital, the blacksmith shop and cotton gin _
into a national park.
</P>
<P>
   On opening day of the fall festival, though, she talked about
Magnolia's good times, not her own struggle. Dressed in a pink
satin Civil War-era gown, she showed tourists the wooden clock
rescued from the original big house, burned down by Union troops;
the 1851 trophy won by the family's prize racer, an auburn
thoroughbred named Flying Dutchman; and the chapel fashioned from
an old workroom at the back of the manor.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 700 tourists, all but 10 or so were white. One black
visitor, 55-year-old Sam Dugar, had come looking for his own
history. Dugar's father and grandfather had been sharecroppers at
Magnolia, but till now he had avoided the place. As the tour ended,
he said he felt cheated.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I kept thinking was that they accumulated all this wealth
because of the blacks who worked here,'' he said. ``But there was
nothing on the tour about black people. It's as if their place in
history was erased.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Hertzog insists she is not trying to erase history. ``We
are showing this house,'' she explained. ``I try to talk about
what's here, and the history that I am aware of. The slaves didn't
have a lot of records, and so you don't know who was here and where
they all were on the place.'' If visitors are interested, she tells
them the slave cabins are out there, on the Park Service's portion
of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she says, talk of slavery can offend. Her cousin
Ambrose recalled a black visitor who demanded back her $5 admission
after learning that the house was still owned by the original
slave-holding family. ``She was yelling so loud, I could hear her
from my house,'' said Hertzog, who lives next door. ``I was
wondering, what does that woman know about Betty? The days of
owning slaves was long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Hertzog says, it was not right for humans to be held
as property. But she feels no shame. ``The government has given
them every opportunity in the world,'' she said, ``so stop
complaining about the past and go out and do something.''
</P>
<P>
   She has a low opinion of the idea, embraced by some black
intellectuals and politicians, of reparations for slaves'
descendants. ``I think they should be grateful they got their
freedom back then,'' she said. ``I think they ought to be glad they
are Americans, living in a free country. The more of that stuff
that gets stirred up, the more hate there will be on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   From the little she has learned, she says, her family did not
mistreat its slaves. A Northwestern State University historian has
found no evidence of abuse or neglect, though a set of ankle stocks
was evidence of punishment. A Park Service archaeologist also told
her that the two-family brick cabins were larger and more
comfortable than the log dwellings on other plantations. And
inventories show that Magnolia's slaves had more balanced diets
than others in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling among the cabins one evening, Hertzog said that in her
mind, slavery looked a lot like the lives of the sharecroppers _
slaves' descendants she remembered from childhood, who worked the
land for part of the crop. To this day, that is the only way she
has known blacks. Even after the last families left the cabins in
1968, she continued to employ a few black workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way things have always been,'' she said.
``Each group had different networks, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Some black old-timers, she says, have told her that their years
at Magnolia were the best of their lives. While segregation
governed life in town, she says, on Magnolia blacks and whites
raced horses together and played on the plantation baseball team,
the Black Magnolias. She knew that black children would not have
the same opportunities as whites. ``But for them,'' she said,
``that's the way life was and they accepted it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Magnolia's slaves, she knew some of their stories would
be told at the new park. But she wanted those stories to reflect
her family's hardships and kindnesses as well. Which was why she
was getting so worried about the Park Service's plan
</P>
<P>
   Hertzog almost never talked directly about Carla Cowles. And for
more than a year after Cowles arrived, Hertzog never met with her.
``I guess I have just been too busy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she complained a lot about the Park Service, and said she
had heard Cowles and her boss were giving tours and talking about
slaves who had never even lived on Cane River. She had been led to
believe the park would be devoted to agriculture, she said, but
increasingly it seemed the emphasis would be on slavery, on
portrayals bound to vilify her family. She felt betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way people from other places feel about the South
anyway,'' she said, ``so I don't doubt it a bit.'`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-RACE-PLANTATION-ART-3RDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; NATCHITOCHES, La.: a bit.'' &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AN OUTLET FOR THE ANGER
</P>
<P>
   ``When we learn about history, we are often told about kinder,
gentler times,'' Carla Cowles was telling a tour group at the
cabins. (Though the park won't open officially for a year or two,
she has begun giving tours of the work buildings and cabins.) ``We
are taught to think about the lives of the rich and glamorous, not
about the common, everyday people _ people like you and you and
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many children do you have, sir?'' she went on, turning to
a man in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He held up two fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lived here, with your two kids, would work be all that
you did in your life?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I would have to take care of my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the people who lived here couldn't even do that. Their
children could be taken from them at any time and sold away.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of simple exchange that Cowles uses to pull her
audience into the lives of the mothers and fathers, cooks and
carpenters who lived in bondage. The history of slavery is so
painful and mind-bending, she says, that teaching anything
meaningful in an hour seems impossible. So she makes it personal,
makes the tourists become slaves, if only for one mental moment.
</P>
<P>
   It was just such a moment that set her on the road to Cane
River. In 1989, with a 16th-century literature degree from the
University of Virginia and yet another dead-end job, she answered
an ad for a job at Colonial Williamsburg: ``Talk about black
history and get paid,'' it said. It sounded promising _ except for
having to portray slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Williamsburg, the daughter of a millworker and a
teacher's aide, she had revered America's civil rights leaders. She
had watched her mother, who never graduated from junior high, fight
to get her children into Advanced Placement classes. And in
college, which she remembers as ``a sea of whites,'' Cowles
organized sit-ins to demand more minority professors.
</P>
<P>
   She saw no spirit of rebellion in slavery. ``I was like a lot of
people who think slaves were weak, and I didn't want to portray
weakness,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her bosses at Colonial Williamsburg persuaded her to try. She
started off in secondary roles, singing songs that showed ``the
lighter side of slavery.'' Later, in a burlap costume, she
portrayed a slave named Secundia, who had just learned that her
mother had died on another plantation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was singing to my dead mother,'' she recalled, ``saying how
we were so busy working in the fields that I never had time to tell
her I loved her.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience, she says, was transforming. Suddenly, the slaves
she had studied in documents came to life and had her face. Their
history became her cause. And her portrayal of Secundia got her a
job at the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial in St. Louis,
organizing programs about the Dred Scott Decision, which upheld the
principle that slaves were property, not citizens.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Cowles was assigned to develop the Cane River
historical and community outreach programs. She imagines the old
cabins as a ``living, breathing slave community,'' complete with
people in costume portraying slaves.
</P>
<P>
   She expected some resistance. She had read the reports from all
the public hearings. Early on, she turned to Frankie Ray Jackson, a
black former school-board member, for help in navigating people's
sensitivities. As for Bobby DeBlieux and his friends, she had
little to do with them; at one meeting she did attend, she asked
why she was the only black person there. And she never knocked on
Betty Hertzog's door. She just hadn't had the time, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Cowles doesn't often deal with whites in
Natchitoches. She speaks warmly of her boss, Laura Soulierre, who
has encouraged her pursuit of slave history. She gets along well
with the park volunteers, most of whom are white. And she deals
comfortably with white tourists, putting them at ease when they
make clumsy comments about slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't heal old wounds until we look at the way life was and
all its problems,'' she often says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the healing power of history, it has increasingly
channeled her racial anger. When she talks about that anger, she
casts back in her mind _ to the St. Louis landlord who at first
refused her an apartment because she was black; to the man who
called her a ``pickaninny'' as she guided him through Colonial
Williamsburg in her slave costume; to the grade-school teacher who
tried to fail her for refusing to pick a hero from a list of white
American leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Today, away from work, she leads an essentially black life. She
dates a black man who calls himself a separatist. And though she
says she doesn't share those views, she has had only two white
friends. She tries not to wallow in anger, but the more she learns
about slavery, the more she regards the old plantation elite with
suspicion and reproach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost impossible, living as a black person in America,
and as a person who has studied so much about slavery, not to be
angry about the injustices done to black people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She avoids talking directly about Betty Hertzog, just as Hertzog
will not talk directly about her. She speaks of no one in
particular when expressing resentment at the ``furniture and
antiques'' tours popular around town. And while she is offended at
the wealth that plantation owners accumulated on the backs of
slaves, she is disturbed more, she says, by whites who ignore the
less noble truths of their families' pasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have to say, `I'm sorry,''' she said. ``But if you
remain silent about it, then you have blood on your hands, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A SOCIAL CONTRACT OF SILENCE
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, for the first time, a black man ran for mayor of
Natchitoches. He was a vice president at the local university and a
six-term councilman. Many whites quietly talked of supporting him;
polls predicted record black turnout. Then the candidate, John
Winston, started talking about race, with the slogan, ``Let's make
history! Let's elect the first black mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't go over too well. White callers to the ``Talk Back
Natchitoches'' radio show worried that Winston would not serve all
equally. Some criticized him for making race an issue. White
support faded.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-RACE-PLANTATION-ART-4THTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QR; 
 &UR; NATCHITOCHES, La.: support faded. &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end Winston lost, by 63 votes, to a white
anesthesiologist named Wayne McCullen. More than 95 percent of
Winston's supporters were black; more than 95 percent of McCullen's
were white. Both men agreed there had been a backlash over the race
issue, and Winston has had second thoughts about his slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to race, the truth gets twisted to mean a lot of
different things,' he said. ``And so most people just prefer not to
talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Public discussion of race is never easy, anywhere. But in this
town of 17,000 in central Louisiana, not talking about race is at
the heart of a social contract, rooted in the slave-owning past,
that governs all sorts of black-white relationships _ or
nonrelationships. Whatever the inner tensions, Natchitoches has
tended to get along.
</P>
<P>
   Black and white Natchitoches are separate worlds of roughly
equal size. (The black half generally includes the mixed-race
Creoles, though socially and politically they float in between.)
Whites live east of Fifth Street, blacks west. Natchitoches Junior
High is mostly black; the junior high at St. Mary's Catholic School
is mostly white. On Sundays, blacks fill the all-you-can-eat buffet
near the Wal-Mart; whites crowd restaurants on the historic
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are a handful of influential blacks, economic and
political power rests in white hands. Indeed, even if Winston had
won, he would have had less power than the three well-endowed, and
virtually all-white, private committees that turned Natchitoches
into a tourist town. Whites own all the new businesses in the
landmark district. In this place where so much revolves around
history, the history it tends to revolve around is white Colonial
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, blacks think this historic district is white
elite,'' Bobby DeBlieux said. ``Well it is. But it's not because we
designed it that way. It's sad, but black people here segregate
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks do not dispute those facts. They just give them a
different spin. ``It's true that blacks have not gotten involved in
the historic things,'' said Clifford Blake, who owns a po' boy
shop. ``I had a chance to open up a place on the waterfront, but I
didn't do it because it seemed like it was too white-dominated, and
I didn't believe they really wanted blacks involved.''
</P>
<P>
   To local preservationists, the racial climate reflects
Natchitoches' history as a ``cultural island'' in the South. From
its founding by French traders in 1714, they maintain, its
colonists were more accepting of other races than the British were,
and generally kinder to slaves. Natchitoches, they say, is the best
place to tell ``a side to slavery most people have never seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People here have always gotten along and respected one
another,'' DeBlieux said, adding, ``Maybe there's no social
closeness now, but there's no tensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Even through the turmoil of the civil rights movement,
Natchitoches was calm; there were no protests, and a single brief
boycott. But silence, Winston and other blacks say, has been less a
matter of contentment than ingrained reticence. They recall the one
time Natchitoches did come close to open confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1927, a white plantation owner had given the city a
bronze statue of a slave tipping his hat and bowing his head in
greeting. A plaque said the statue had been erected ``in grateful
recognition of the arduous and faithful service of the good darkies
of Louisiana,'' and whites saw it as a symbol of their enlightened
view of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   For 40 years the Good Darkey stood on Front Street. But in 1968,
as civil rights protests gripped the South, young blacks vowed to
bomb it, calling it an abominable symbol of servitude. In the end,
after a meeting with the mayor, blacks stood down and the Good
Darkey went gently, removed by officials late one September night.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense of victory among blacks, and integration came
peacefully. But that progress, many blacks say, has gone only so
far. They remain in their separate world, profoundly wary of
whites.
</P>
<P>
   Across Cane River from the new park is St. Paul Missionary
Baptist Church, organized 133 years ago by freed slaves. Even
today, says the pastor, the Rev. Leo Walker, many in his
congregation are struggling to overcome generations of distrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them harbor deep anger about things that happened to
them or their ancestors in the past,'' he said, ``and they honestly
believe that no whites can go to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   A SON OF `THE QUARTERS'
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Vercher winced whenever he heard people call Magnolia's
brick cabins ``slave quarters.'' They had once been his home.
</P>
<P>
   His father was born and raised in the cabins, and his family
didn't move off Magnolia until the late 1960s. Those people were
not slaves, he pointed out. They were the Hertzogs' employees, and
they called their homes ``the quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   But when pressed to think about any ancestors who lived there as
slaves, this fireplug of a man looked as if he might become
physically ill. He refused to watch movies like ``Roots'' or
``Amistad,'' and rejected the term ``African-American'' because he
had never known any relatives from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly some black people on Cane River were interested in
seeing slave stories, however painful, resurrected at the new park.
But Vercher saw slavery only as a shameful part of the past, and
tried to wipe it from his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hear about my people being beaten and raped,''
he said, with his Cajun twang and willful scowl. ``Let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a twist of fate _ he sometimes saw it as a divine trick
played by his late father _ Vercher, 35, was now working for the
Park Service, restoring the cabins. For a black man, especially one
with a ninth-grade education, it was one of the best jobs on Cane
River, with decent pay and benefits for his common-law wife and two
sons.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Ellis, had been happy that the cabins were going to
become part of a new national park. The son was still coming to
terms with the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Vercher was one of Betty Hertzog's father's chief hands,
and the family _ there were 12 children _ lived in the cabin at the
end, the one with the porch still on the front. Ellis Vercher was
always proud to say he was reared on a plantation, as if it gave
more meaning to the five-bedroom house he built when the family
moved away. And he tried to instill that feeling in his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind being out here,'' Leslie Vercher said, ``because
I feel my daddy when I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought life was like for slaves, he frowned and
said, ``Hell, what you think?'' But then he thought again about his
father. There were indeed hard times, when they would work all
season and not make a cent. But there were also good times _
cookouts, horse races and dances at the company store _ and good
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a marble the other day and it felt funny in my hand,''
Vercher said. ``I thought to myself, `I bet my daddy played with
this marble.'''

</P>
<P>
   BRINGING UP SLAVERY
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Carla Cowles brought slavery back to Magnolia
Plantation.
</P>
<P>
   For the opening of an exhibit called ``Free at Last,'' Cowles
had invited two black historical interpreters from Arkansas to
perform skits showing slave life through fables and song. ``We are
going to be talking about things that are uncomfortable,'' she told
the audience gathered at the cabins. ``We are going to show you how
people endured the institution called slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Discomfort had been swirling through town ever since a notice
appeared in The Natchitoches Times the week before. Cowles had
enlisted her boss to deliver Betty Hertzog's invitation _ ``I have
had very little contact with Miss Betty,'' she explained _ and
Hertzog seemed leery about the whole thing. ``You can never tell,''
she said. ``It might just be a bunch of stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Vercher was also worrying about stereotypes. ``It's easy
for Carla to talk about slavery because she don't come from here,''
he said. ``I don't think it would be so easy for her to tell those
stories if she was talking about her own people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowles had invited all 15 schools in the area. But while
teachers at three schools accepted, the rest did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   She shrugged it off at first. With such short notice, there
probably hadn't been time to arrange transportation. Then she heard
that Samuel Jackson, a black man who is principal of Natchitoches
Junior High, was worried the performance might ignite racial
tensions. She went to see him, to explain that everything would be
handled with great sensitivity. But he stood firm.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he had worked hard to keep the peace at his school,
where more than 70 percent of the students are black and almost all
the whites are bused in by court order. Just a few weeks earlier,
he said, a white student had shown up wearing a T-shirt with a
drawing of Ku Klux Klansmen and the words, ``We were the original
Boys in the Hood.'' A black student had come to school upset that a
local white fraternity was planning a mock slave auction. Exposing
students to slave re-enactments, Jackson said, would be like
throwing a match into gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid you would have white students making fun of the
way black people talked, and then blacks might respond in a
combative way,'' he said. ``It could fester into a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, about 70 people _ black and white _ showed up that
evening. Leslie Vercher, anxieties and all, stood in back, pacing
and puffing hard on a cigarette. Betty Hertzog came, too. If the
story of slavery was going to be told, she said, she was going to
make sure it was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The two performers, Curtis Tate and Daryl Minefee, leapt into
the spotlight. They wore tattered pants, bright shirts and oversize
shoes. Their stage was a bench. Tate stood on top, joking like a
country bumpkin. Minefee, wearing that same foolish grin, sat
playing an African drum.
</P>
<P>
   First, Tate told several fables set in Africa. Then he
transported the audience to America, and told a story about a slave
beaten by an overseer for bringing her baby along to the cotton
fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overseer was full of the master's whiskey,'' Tate growled,
flailing one arm as if cracking a whip, ``and when he saw that baby
he started whippin' that girl, and whippin' that girl until she and
the baby started to bleed.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of returning to the fields, the woman ran to a wise
elder who began chanting an African incantation, and all the slaves
flew happily away.
</P>
<P>
   For the finale, Tate portrayed a slave named Luther and his
master, James McVicar. Luther had learned to read and write, but
kept it secret for fear of punishment. The year was 1849, and one
day he blurted out something from the morning paper about a gold
rush in California.
</P>
<P>
   A disturbed McVicar forced a Bible into Luther's hands and
ordered him to read his favorite passage.
</P>
<P>
   Luther trembled and said: ``Naw suh, Massa McVicar. I can't
read.''
</P>
<P>
   McVicar insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Luther opened the Bible and read in a quavering voice, ``Moses
said unto Pharaoh, `Let my people go.'''
</P>
<P>
   The audience held its breath as Luther slumped over in fear.
</P>
<P>
   Then McVicar grinned and jumped with excitement. ``I'll be
darned, Luther, you can read! Can you write, too?''
</P>
<P>
   Luther, paralyzed by confusion, forced his head to nod.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' his master shouted. ``You can help me keep my
books; you can help me with my ledgers.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, the audience seemed as stunned as Luther. But soon
people were laughing and applauding in relief.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Hertzog joined the standing ovation, then headed home,
elated. ``I liked it,'' she said. ``I thought they did a real
professional job. It was especially good for children.''
</P>
<P>
   Students and teachers from Simpson Junior High, a white group
who had seen the show earlier that day, said they had learned
important lessons about blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us understand what they had to go through,'' said
Jenna White, 13. ``It opens our eyes and makes us respect them
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Vercher, though, was pacing and dragging harder on his
cigarette. With their silly grins and floppy hats, he said, the
actors had given no dignity to the memory of slaves. It was as if
the Good Darkey statue had come to life, not the strong, resilient
people who were his ancestors. Slaves could not fly from the
fields, he said, and if a master learned that a slave could read,
he would reach for a rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of historians are they,'' he asked, ``if they make
up things instead of telling it like it was?''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHEN TO WATER THINGS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Carla Cowles was not stunned at all by the show. It went exactly
as she had planned.
</P>
<P>
   The week before, she had called Tate with a warning about the
anxieties around Cane River. She told him that blacks had been
feeling uncomfortable about slave re-enactments, and that Principal
Jackson was concerned. She also told him that the direct
descendants of Magnolia's original family would be in the audience,
along with some of the town's powerful preservationists. She went
over the details of Tate's stories, and did not ask him to change
the content in any way. But be sure, she cautioned him, that none
of the stories appear to reflect the lives of Cane River slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot that went unsaid,'' Tate recalled. ``But I got
the clear impression that she was feeling pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-RACE-PLANTATION-ART-6THTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; NATCHITOCHES, La.: feeling pressure.'' &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the performance, at Lasyone's, a local meat-pie diner,
they discussed the surprise ending to the Luther story. It did not,
they acknowledged, reflect the reality of life for most slaves, who
were beaten or separated from their families for seeking education.
</P>
<P>
   But the story was not a complete lie. The truth is that there is
no one truth to slavery. It was different from state to state,
plantation to plantation. Tate had documents about a slave whose
masters had taught him to read and write, and others about a slave
beaten by whites when discovered reading a newspaper. In using that
first slave as raw material for the Luther story, Tate said, he was
concerned more with whites like Hertzog than blacks like Vercher.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the ones who can't handle the truth,'' Tate said,
crouching over his plate and lowering his voice. ``Isn't it the
same for all black people, that we have to be careful to make white
people comfortable?''
</P>
<P>
   As they struggled to reconcile the Luther story with their
strident commitment to teaching what they saw as the holocaust of
slavery, it became clear that more pragmatic issues were at play,
too. At historical sites across the country, a new generation of
interpreters had begun to pull stories of slavery from the dust of
history. And often, as Cowles and Tate kept hearing, they ran into
turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to economics,'' Tate said. ``Whites still
control most museums and historical parks. Unless black people
start putting more money into these places, then we will never
really be able to have control.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowles added, ``If you make them uncomfortable, they'll shut you
down.''
</P>
<P>
   She had seen that kind of power right here in Natchitoches. Just
weeks before, another Park Service official had come under attack
from local preservationists. The official, John Robbins, headed up
a prestigious federally financed center that develops and teaches
preservation technologies. Robbins had supported a congressional
proposal that would have allowed the center to be moved. But after
a few well-placed calls to Washington, the bill was killed, and
Robbins was transferred to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people around here may come from the country,'' Cowles
said, ``but they are very smart and well connected, and if you
cross them you're out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the performance, Cowles stood in the doorway of
a cabin and reflected on all that had happened. ``I did not want to
make the message too hard the first time,'' she said, ``especially
with me being an outsider and a black woman.''
</P>
<P>
   So she began to settle in for the long haul. Early in the year,
she turned down an assignment on the East Coast and began looking
for land where she could build a house. It might take years, she
realized, for the truth of slavery to be told on Cane River.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they felt good after that performance, they'll come to the
next one and the next one,'' she said. ``And I'll be able to
present something a little bit stronger each time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby DeBlieux says he understands that slavery will be one of
the park's main themes, and he thinks that, too, will ultimately be
good for business. There is an untapped well of black tourists out
there, he says, who might spend money on a plantation tour that
incorporates slave history.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the big house, Betty Hertzog sounds as if she is ready
to move on. The 27-room house has become more showplace than home.
Almost all her personal belongings are crammed into two bedrooms;
the rest of the house stays dark unless tourists come by. Her
relatives don't come too often, either, and so her most consistent
companions are her two dozen cats.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the performance, she decided she was not going to
worry about the new national park any more. She asked Sen.
Johnston's daughter, Mary Catalo, to look out for the family's
interests, and in April, Catalo met with Carla Cowles and offered
herself as the family liaison.
</P>
<P>
   Catalo, who is 37 and sells real estate in New Orleans, is from
the ninth generation of the family that built Magnolia, and her
feelings about how its history should be portrayed seem to mark a
clear shift from those of the woman she calls Aunt Betty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a comfortable thing for me to come out and say that
my relatives owned slaves,'' she said, ``but it is important that
we all openly acknowledge where we came from so we can start to
work through the problems that were created in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism is a difficult thing to deal with because it runs so
deep. To me this park offers a chance to at least help start a
dialogue that doesn't exist right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Betty Hertzog built herself a house near the river,
thinking she would move there after her parents died. What with the
responsibilities of holding onto Magnolia, she has yet to spend a
night there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I got ready to move, something else would happen
and I needed to stay,'' she said. ``But maybe the time has finally
come. Used to be that it was hard to leave this old place. But now
it's harder and harder to stay.''

&HT;     BRADLEY _ BELATEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Bradley's begrudging, belated endorsement of
Vice President Al Gore last week enables Gore to go to the
Democratic National Convention with a technically united party.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, however, the former senator from New Jersey won't
make much difference in the general election. His time came _ and
has already gone.
</P>
<P>
   Doing the right thing did more for Bradley himself than for
Gore. The defeated presidential candidate, who lost every primary
and caucus to Gore, seemed over the last four months to be panting
for the Sour Grapes Cup. That dubious award was long thought to
have been retired by former Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota after
losing the Democratic nomination to Hubert Humphrey in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, in the early primary stretch, Bradley looked like
an attractive candidate, a viable alternative to Gore. During the
campaign, Bradley initially took the high road. But he became
increasingly testy as he failed to break Gore's lock on the
nomination. No resilience.
</P>
<P>
   In politics everything is timing. If Bradley had accepted defeat
gracefully when the game ended in March and promptly endorsed Gore,
he would have seemed like a statesman and a good sport. And he
would have lived again to run another day, perhaps in four years if
Gore loses the election.
</P>
<P>
   But sore losers are bad politicians. Bradley's endorsement four
months too late was strained. The two men did not even hold a joint
news conference afterward, for fear that things better left unsaid
would be said.
</P>
<P>
   During their brief competition, Bradley had accused Gore of
being ``tricky'' and ``the elephant of negative campaigning.'' Gore
returned the compliments with his own charges of Bradley
malevolence.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Bradley gave no indication he had changed his mind.
``Experience is what you get when you don't get what you want,'' he
pouted.
</P>
<P>
   Gore put a sunny face on this awkward moment. He won, after all,
and could afford to be magnanimous. ``This is one of the most
important days in the election,'' Gore told reporters afterward. It
was a political overstatement rivaled for sheer hypocrisy only by
President George Bush's claim in 1991 that he nominated Clarence
Thomas to the Supreme Court because he was the best-qualified
person in America.
</P>
<P>
   But so what? It is better for Gore to have Bradley inside the
tent spitting out than outside the tent spitting in. Tradition
decrees that presidential nominees be surrounded at their
coronation by defeated rivals pledging their loyalty, in order to
reassure partisans that all's well that ends well.
</P>
<P>
   This was so important to President Jimmy Carter that at the 1980
Democratic convention he literally chased his primary challenger,
Sen. Edward Kennedy, around the stage trying to be photographed
clasping hands with Kennedy in a victory salute, a gesture the
Massachusetts senator was reluctant to make.
</P>
<P>
   There was never much philosophical difference between Gore and
Bradley, but the latter couldn't get over the fact that when
pushed, Gore pushed back much harder. With Gore, it wasn't
personal. With Bradley, it was. More's the pity. Good men, both.
</P>
<P>
   Given his sullen attitude, Bradley's usefulness on the campaign
trail is doubtful. If Gore picks House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt as his running mate, Gephardt, not Bradley, will become
the prime symbol of party unity. In contrast to Bradley, Gephardt's
team instincts function well.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush solved his own divisive primary
problem when Sen. John McCain of Arizona endorsed him in early May,
saying he was taking his ``medicine'' but promising to work hard
for the ticket. McCain's support does matter. He remains a popular
figure with a steady following, and Bradley does not.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bradley's supporters have turned to Ralph Nader, the
Green Party nominee, but most have simply gone underground.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of political rivals getting together in their mutual
interest after a period of name-calling is as old as the written
word. According to William Safire in ``The New Language of
Politics,'' the term ``strange bedfellows'' was probably first
coined by Shakespeare in Act II of ``The Tempest.'' The jester
Trinculo huddles with a monster during a storm, noting wisely that
``misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows.''
</P>
<P>
   Odd alliances for expediency's sake make the world go around.
Sometimes, of course, they work better than at other times.
</P>
<P>
   Safire recalls former House Speaker Joseph Martin musing on the
double meaning of the bedfellows phrase. Martin recalled that a
House member shouted, ``Politics makes strange bedfellows,
especially since women got into 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, politics. An ever-changing marvel to behold.

`SPIN' SCRIPTS WON'T GLOSS OVER SHEEN'S BAD-BOY PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Can a sitcom lose its star and still succeed?
More to the point, when that star is America's boy next door and
his replacement is Peck's bad boy, will the viewers give a hoo-ha?
</P>
<P>
   ABC is betting ``Spin City'' with Charlie Sheen will do as well
as ``Spin City'' with Michael J. Fox, even if the stars have public
personae as different as Hollywood and New York.
</P>
<P>
   When Fox decided to leave the series to concentrate on his
battle with Parkinson's disease, producer Gary David Goldberg
thought the show was over. ``Everyone's first instinct was to end
the show,'' Goldberg said yesterday. ``There was no thought
whatsoever as to whether this show should go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said the idea to continue came from Fox, and Goldberg
sought out Sheen, with whom he had shot a comedy pilot that wasn't
picked up. Sheen signed on, several other cast members signed off,
and production will move from New York City to L.A., with Heather
Locklear continuing as Caitline Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest reason we decided to go forward was Charlie,''
Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen's character, New York deputy mayor Charlie Owen, will have
a past not unlike Sheen's, replete with escapades that end up on
the front page for the wrong reasons. But he said he's OK with art
imitating life. ``I think in a self-effacing way, to meet some of
those elements head on and deal with them comedically and laugh at
myself is a good way to dispel a lot of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen also doesn't mind that he'll be going up against his
father on Wednesday nights. ``Spin City'' will air opposite the
second half of NBC's ``The West Wing,'' in which Martin Sheen plays
the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Chernuchin, creator of a new TNT series about maverick
investment bankers, says he has been pitching the idea of a Wall
Street drama for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept getting the reaction that nobody cares about people who
make money, that it's too elite a world,'' Chernuchin said.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. Now that about 60 percent of Americans own stock in
publicly traded companies, the American TV industry agrees that an
ensemble show about bankers and traders and wheelers and dealers is
timely. So timely that, in the grand tradition of TV, there will be
two such shows this season.
</P>
<P>
   Chernuchin's is called ``Bull'' and will premiere Aug. 15 on TNT
cable. The other, titled ``The $treet,'' will debut on Fox this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Chernuchin, former executive producer of ``Law &AMP; Order'' and
``Brooklyn South,'' hastens to say the two shows aren't identical.
His is about venture capitalists. ``The $treet'' is about
high-pressure traders. What's more, ``The $treet'' is from Darren
Star (``Sex and the City''), whose style hews more closely to
prime-time soapers.

FILMS, TV INSPIRED EVANOVICH TO CREATE TOUGH BUT VULNERABLE BOUNTY
HUNTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Janet Evanovich was in an Atlanta hotel room by herself when the
call came from her New York publisher with stunning news: Her
latest novel, the sixth featuring bounty hunter Stephanie Plum, was
about to debut in the top spot on the national best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was so exciting that I almost messed myself,'' recalled
Evanovich in an interview, with a wisecrack worthy of her sassy
heroine. ``I had been hoping to make the top 10, but coming in at
No. 1 was so mind-boggling that I started screaming something
incoherent.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then the first thing I did when I hung up the phone was
burst into tears. Because I've been scratching and clawing away at
this writing for years; I'd worked real hard at it. And I have an
editor, Jennifer Enderlin, who has no life because she had put
herself on the line for me, and a publisher, St. Martin's Press,
that had thrown everything behind me _ all of this was riding on me
and my book. So it was not just the joy of making No. 1; I was
carrying the weight of all those who had struggled with me. That's
what made me have a total PMS moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The sudden chart-topping triumph of Janet Evanovich was no
accident. It was as carefully planned and orchestrated as a
premeditated murder. It's no wonder the New Jersey-raised writer
often refers to her books as ``the product.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot Six'' (St. Martin's Press, 294 pages, $24.95) is the
culmination of years of conscious efforts toward reaching the goal
of best-sellerdom, including Evanovich's switch from writing
romance novels to thrillers and including her flashy Web site
(www.evanovich.com), which was started by her daughter three years
ago and has proven so popular that it had a phenomenal 2 million
visits last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot Six'' centers on the murder of a mob boss, a murder for
which the prime suspect turns out to be Plum's outlaw lover
(``Ranger''). The new book continues the winning Evanovich formula
for her Plum series: The randy, wise-ass heroine from Trenton,
N.J., with the hots for two guys (one safe, one not) and a penchant
for landing in messes of various sorts, especially exploding cars.
The cadre of wacky minor characters to provide comic relief. The
simmering heat waves of sexual tension. The quick-and-breezy plot
that alternates between snap-crackle dialogue, scene-setting
narrative and hard-knuckle action.
</P>
<P>
   The Plum series is part ``Indiana Jones,'' part
``Moonlighting,'' part ``Midnight Run.''
</P>
<P>
   This mix occurred to Evanovich after a year and a half off for
serious study of other popular writers and series _ what worked
well, what did not, plus what she liked herself and what readers
liked too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew by then what the audience wanted, and not just the
audience who loves books, but also the audience who watches
television _ they want a high entertainment level,'' Evanovich
recalled. ``They also want a heroine who is resilient, vulnerable,
a heroine who is not only the woman we are, but also the woman we
want to be. And I also knew she had to operate in a small venue,
like Trenton, and that her successes would be measured in such
small things as being able to button the top snap on her Levi's.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor would Evanovich's heroine be another female private eye. The
smart-mouthed gal PI field was as crowded as a health club in
January, with such popular heroines as Sue Grafton's Kinsey
Millhone, Sara Paretsky's V.I. Warshawski and Marcia Muller's
Sharon McCone.
</P>
<P>
   No, Evanovich needed ``a hole in the marketplace,'' some other
job for her plucky heroine, and ``Midnight Run'' provided the
inspiration _ bounty hunting. So Evanovich immersed herself in the
ways and wiles of that shadow trade, talking with bounty hunters
and cops, learning to shoot a gun, as she developed her fictional
alter ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be a bounty hunter, but with some limitations,''
Evanovich said. ``I know I could find people, I could lie, I could
finesse people, and I could arrest them. But I'd have a hard time
with really dangerous guys because I'm not all that brave.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no hard time with her heroine's smart mouth (``Cooking
wasn't so bad, I thought. In fact, it was a lot like sex. Sometimes
it didn't seem like such a good idea in the beginning, but then
after you got into it ...'').
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old Evanovich may look, as she puts it with a laugh,
``like the president of the garden club.'' But lurking below that
respectable surface is a strong current of off-kilter humor.
Reaching the top spot on the best-seller lists is nice, but what
this self-described ``ham'' truly lusts after is her own comedy
special on HBO. And she may live amid the rural serenity of New
Hampshire, but her favorite place in the world is, bar none, Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The Plum series started slowly for Evanovich. In fact, her
initial books paid her less than what she had been making in
romance writing. But writing these Ms. adventures was ``much more
satisfying'' than romance (and certainly much more satisfying than
such past nightmare gigs as waitressing, car sales, hospital supply
sales, insurance claims adjusting or the decade she spent as an
unpublished writer, which culminated in the time when she piled all
her rejection letters out by the curb and set them afire).
</P>
<P>
   Her Plum audience continued to build. Development of her Web
site was ``critical.'' Like all else in the creation of Janet
Evanovich, best-selling writer, this was calculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our idea,'' she related, ``was that a static Web site was no
good at all. It had to be an entertainment Web site that would make
a reader come back to it at least once a month. So we had contests
(including one to name the next Plum novel), we had places where
fans could talk to one another, we had e-commerce options offering
merchandise, although we don't make any money on that but do it
more as a service to fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``And through it all, we kept building a mailing list, so that
we could tell them when the next book was coming out and when I was
going to be on tour. It all reached critical mass last year _ my
daughter, Alex, and I knew something was going on. I had put out a
good product for some time and people like it _ you can't make it
to No. 1 if you haven't got a good product. But it was the Web site
that truly mobilized readers. If it hadn't been for that, I might
be in the top 12 but not No. 1. The Web site put me at No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Evanovich's entire family is now employed by Evanovich Inc.
Besides her Web-master daughter, her son handles the financing, and
her husband manages the business. That leaves the writer to write,
holed up with her heroine, her laptop and her trusty supply of
Cheese Doodles (``my drug of choice'').
</P>
<P>
   So addictive have Doodles proved to be that Evanovich actually
destroyed a previous laptop with ``all that grease and orange
gunk.'' Her solution? Get a new laptop and a canister of air to
blow the Doodles' leavings away. But give up Cheese Doodles? No
way.
</P>
<P>
   As Evanovich stressed, ``The salt and cheese and crunch make all
my creative synapses come together.''

   CYCLING
</P>
<P>
   CYC-TOUR-LANCE _ The Tour de France took a much needed day off
Monday before riders began their final week of cycling. But Lance
Armstrong, who has dominated the race the past two weeks, wasn't
content to allow things to rest, to stay status quo. The defending
Tour champion has been criticized for his conservative race
tactics, specifically when he allowed Marco Pantani, the 1998 Tour
victor, to take a stage win last Thursday on the legendary Mont
Ventoux. Armstrong, however, turned feisty at a Monday afternoon
press briefing, continually referring to Pantani as ``Il
elephantino,'' a jab at the Italian's bald head and large ears.
Armstrong made the remarks to a press gathering of more than 500
journalists. ``Unfortunately, he has shown his true colors,''
Armstrong said of Pantani. ``I felt like (the stage win) was a
gift. I also feel now that it was a mistake to give the gift. ...
Pantani wasn't the best man on Ventoux.'' (Halliburton, Austin
American-Statesman). WITH PHOTOS.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Adoptions and absent fathers
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush says fathers have no right to prevent the
adoption of their children if they don't claim responsibility soon
after birth. He was in President Clinton's home state of Arkansas
today to promote a 1997 Texas law creating a Paternity Registry.
Fathers of out-of-wedlock children must sign the registry to
maintain a legal claim of parenthood. Bush said the policy gets to
the core of two questions: ``What can we do to encourage dads to be
a part of their children's lives. And, if you cannot make sure a
dad is (responsible), what can we do to expedite adoptions.''
</P>
<P>
   ROAD SHOWS BY RAIL AND WATER
</P>
<P>
   In a transportation showdown aimed at making presidential
politics appealing in the heat of summer after the conventions, Al
Gore plans to cruise the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi River
while George W. Bush will take to the rails through the industrial
Midwest and California. The competing caravans are part of the
effort by both campaigns to extend the euphoria generated by their
conventions toward Labor Day, when many undecided voters are
expected to begin cementing their impressions of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   CAREFULLY PLANNED ROUTE TO PHILLY
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, campaigning in Arkansas today, announced that
the first stop in his pre-Republican convention trek will be in
northwest Arkansas. He'll then travel to Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio
and West Virginia _ all states won by President Clinton in 1996 _
before arriving in Philadelphia on the third night of the
convention, Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   SEEING SOME NIXON IN GORE
</P>
<P>
   Ex-House Speaker Newt Gingrich says Al Gore reinvents himself so
often in the presidential campaign he has become the Democratic
Party's Richard Nixon. In an interview broadcast this morning on
NBC's ``Today''' show, Gingrich said Gore had been both negative
and ``kaleidoscopic''' in his campaign, changing his image
frequently like the Republican Nixon during his campaigning. ``They
used to talk about a new Nixon, but we get a new Gore about every
10 days,'' said Gingrich, who resigned after the Republicans lost
seats in the November 1998 election.
</P>
<P>
   NADER: PUT DEMS IN HOUSE, NOT WHITE HOUSE
</P>
<P>
   Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader told an audience
at Creighton University in Omaha, Neb., that he would consider it a
victory if his third-party presidential candidacy cost Al Gore the
election. Nader: ``Al Gore is a plastic person who doesn't know who
he is anymore. I think the two parties have had their chance. We
have one corporate party wearing two heads with diferent makeup.''
Nader said he'd consider his candidacy a success if George W. Bush
wins, if his Green Party ``emerges stronger, and if enough voters
cast their votes to put the Democrats back in control of the
House.''
</P>
<P>
   NADER THREAT DOWNPLAYED
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore dismissed questions about whether Ralph Nader's
presidential bid is siphoning away support from his candidacy,
saying that by election day most voters will want to choose between
``two very stark alternatives'' _ Gore or George W. Bush. Recent
polls have indicated Nader's Green Party candidacy could hurt Gore
in key states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania. But Gore said he
expects that to change.
</P>
<P>
   POSSIBLE BUSH SHORT LIST
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has narrowed his list of possible running mates
down to about four candidates, including two senators and two
governors, according to the Washington Times. The newspaper, citing
officials involved in the vetting process, said today that four of
the remaining names on Bush's dwindling list are Govs. Frank
Keating of Oklahoma and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, and Sens. Chuck
Hagel of Nebraska and Fred Thompson of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   NOW, LET'S SEE IF BUSH THINKS SO, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse News Services' Quin Hillyer has his bet down for George
W. Bush's running mate selection: Rep. Christopher Cox of
California, age 48. His reasons: ``Possibly the brainiest
Republican in the House, and easily among the most diligent. ... He
would energize the Republican base, impress the pundit classes,
attract both baby boom and Generation X married couples, make
single women swoon, and turn delegate-rich California into a highly
competitive battle. And in front of the cameras, Cox remains cool
and virtually unflappable.''
</P>
<P>
   POSSIBLE GORE SHORT LIST
</P>
<P>
   With House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri reportedly
removing himself from consideration for vice president, chatter now
is focusing on a few other possibilities. Said to be still strongly
in the running are ex-Sen. George Mitchell of Maine, and current
Sens. John Kerry of Massachusetts, Bob Graham of Florida and Dick
Durbin of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   SIDE BY SIDE BY ASIDE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and George W. Bush have yet to meet face-to-face in a
debate, but they they gave voters a chance for the first time to
make a side-by-side comparison as the two sat for hourlong
interviews on network television Sunday talk shows. Gore faced
aggressive questioning from Tim Russert of NBC's ``Meet the Press''
on his record and past statements, while Bush was asked questions
of a more political nature by Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts on
ABC's ``This Week.'' The questioning highlighted some stark
differences between the candidates, for example on Social Security,
the death penalty and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   EASY DECISION FOR FORD
</P>
<P>
   Ramping up the abortion debate, ex-President Gerald Ford is
urging George W. Bush to stare down the GOP's anti-abortion zealots
and pick a running mate who favors abortion rights. ``There's no
question about it,'' Ford told the New York Daily News in an
exclusive interview. ``A pro-choice running mate would help
Governor Bush and help the party. I feel very strongly that way. A
responsible pro-choice candidate will really strengthen the
ticket.'' Anyone in mind? Ford, who turned 87 last Friday, thinks
Tom Ridge, the Catholic governor of Pennsylvania, would be a
splendid veep choice.

   THE WORD FROM CAMP DAVID
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak found time during the Middle
East summit to update Al Gore and George W. Bush about the status
of the peace talks. Both campaigns characterized the telephone
conversation as friendly and brief, and said Barak told them both
the Israeli and Palestinian delegations were working diligently.
Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan, who was not called, said he
worried that peace might come at an enormous price tag to the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   BARELY BREAKING A SWEAT
</P>
<P>
   Out on the campaign trail, George W. Bush is molding the image
he wants by creating carefully choreographed television images in
battleground states. Town hall meetings where large audiences are
free to ask questions vanished months ago when John McCain
disappeared from the presidential race. Now, audiences rarely get
to ask Bush anything. On many days he makes no more than one or two
public appearances, and occasionally they last no more than 15
minutes. The events make him seem to be governing rather than
campaigning. It is almost as if he's running on the Rose Garden
strategy _ with the rose gardens in a few swing states.
</P>
<P>
   FORGET ABOUT MOVIE PREMIERES
</P>
<P>
   From the Playboy Mansion to Paramount Pictures studios, from
Wolfgang Puck's trendy Spago restaurant to Los Angeles' Union
Station, from the Petersen Automotive Museum to the J. Paul Getty
Museum, the convention parties will present the mother lode of
wheeling, dealing and hobnobbing for visiting Democrats. At least
one private fest, whose location was not available but rumored to
be headed up by Barbra Streisand, is expected to see donations to
the party of $15,000 a person.
</P>
<P>
   BUT WOULD HE GO TO HOOTERS?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore objects strenuously to the event, but Rep. Loretta
Sanchez (D-Calif.) is going ahead with her plan to hold an
invitation-only reception at the Playboy Mansion during the Los
Angeles convention. The Playboy Foundation, six corporations and a
40-member host committee are underwriting the event, which will
benefit Hispanic Unity USA, a political action committee chaired by
Sanchez. About 600 people are expected to attend. Playboy founder
Hugh Hefner is scheduled to drop by; Gore is not.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS, Y2K-STYLE
</P>
<P>
   When the Democratic Party's 4,368 delegates arrive in L.A. for
the convention, beginning Aug. 14, they'll plan meetings with each
other online using an Internet scheduling system. They'll chat by
Internet phones and e-mail from computer kiosks throughout the
Staples Center, site of the convention. And back home, folks can
keep in touch with them and watch every second of the gathering
live with Web cameras linked to the convention's extensive Internet
site.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE HELP FROM OUTSIDE
</P>
<P>
   Special-interest groups played an unprecedented role in key
primary elections this year, a new report finds, with conservative
groups battering John McCain in South Carolina and labor unions
providing crucial support to Al Gore in Iowa. ``If the level of
ferocity of the primaries is any indication of the cross party
battles in the fall, we are in a for a very bloody fight,'' said
the report, ``Getting Inside the Outside Campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW CITIZENS, NEW VOTERS
</P>
<P>
   Millions of recently naturalized immigrants are eligible to vote
for president for the first time in November, and some analysts
predict they could be a deciding factor in key electoral states.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service expects the number of
new citizens created this fiscal year (ending Sept. 30) to be about
900,000. That would bring the number of new citizens to nearly 4
million since 1996. They are concentrated in large states such as
Texas, Florida, California, New York and Illinois, which provide
the bulk of the electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   BARRING ANY UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, during the first of several chummy debates in
Georgia, Rep. Bob Barr's three Democratic challengers made a
profound discovery: They agree on just about everything. So, rather
than spar over issues, the Democratic primary battle has centered
on who has what it takes to unseat the outspoken Republican
incumbent, known for his criticism of President Clinton and his
unyielding support of the gun lobby. The three: millionaire
businessman Roger Kahn; ex-Atlanta police officer Chip Warren; and
Jim Williams, an ex-county commissioner. The primary is Tuesday .
</P>
<P>
   HIS OWN BEST (OR WORSE) EXAMPLE
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. George Nethercutt built his campaign in 1994
around his term-limits pledge, holding up then-House Speaker Tom
Foley ``as a creature of Washington, D.C., born and raised in that
system.'' Now the eastern Washington state congressman insists his
promise was ``gratuitous on my part'' and ``something I blurted out
in a debate with my predecessor.'' Says Nethercutt: ``To term-limit
yourself really reduces your effectiveness. I'm less enamored with
the idea of term limitations, and I'm the perfect example of why we
don't need them.''

JAPAN'S CENTRAL BANK LEAVES SHORT-TERM RATES ALONE

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Despite signs of strength in Japan's economy, Bank of
Japan policy-makers voted Monday to prolong their policy of keeping
short-term interest rates at virtually zero, attributing the
decision to concerns over the fallout from the failure of a highly
indebted department store company last week.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement unusual for its attempt to explain the decision,
the central bank said it had decided to leave rates alone because
of continued uncertainty about employment and wages. Even more
unusual was its mention of the the failed department store
operator, Sogo Co., which declared bankruptcy under loans totaling
more than $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pointed out that the board needed to see how the
commencement of reconstruction proceedings of Sogo Co. could affect
market developments and business sentiment,'' the bank said in a
statement issued Monday afternoon after its nine-member policy
board concluded its regular monthly meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation had been building for weeks that the Bank of Japan
would nudge interest rates raise upwards Monday for the first time
in 10 years because of evidence that the world's second-biggest
economy is in a sustainable recovery from its worst period of
protracted economic weakness since World War II. Central bank
officials themselves have said that keeping rates so low is
abnormal and temporary, hinting that recent evidence of economic
strength like improved corporate profits, rising production and
higher business investment justified a rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   But the collapse of Sogo, which operates 25 stores and employs
10,000 people, dampened the optimism about Japan's recovery and
served as a sobering reminder of how much bad debt still infects
the Japanese banking system. Rising interest rates would make it
more expensive and difficult for debtors to repay loans, which
could lead to more insolvencies and business failures.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's decision to leave rates alone was welcomed by
economists, government officials and politicians, many of whom have
argued in recent weeks that the bank lacked a clear-cut rationale
for raising rates and ran the risk of short-circuiting the economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bank seemed adamant about raising rates last week,'' said
Ronald Bevacqua, senior economist at Commerz Securities in Tokyo.
``The fact that they didn't do it immediately was related to Sogo,
which reinvigorated uncertainty about the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the news was likely to have a positive impact on stock
and bond markets, which had been bracing for a slight increase in
rates, but weaken the yen.
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Koll, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, said he
believed Monday's decision would force the bank to postpone a rate
increase for at least another year and perhaps longer. ``I actually
think in terms of the business cycle, we're peaking out right about
now,'' he said. ``Industrial production is now growing 7 percent
compared to last year, but I think at the end of the year, we'll be
at about half that pace.''
</P>
<P>
   How the bank will determine that its concerns about Sogo can be
safely set aside is a bit of a mystery. There will be little
economic data released between now and Aug. 11, when the policy
board meets again, and the bank did not spell out which tea leaves
it would be watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic conditions are now strong enough to be compatible
with rising rates, so unless we see some unexpectedly weak
indicators over the next month, we could see an increase in
August,'' said Masaaki Kanno, senior economist at J.P. Morgan in
Tokyo. ``Stock prices are probably going to be quite important.''
</P>
<P>
   He said if the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index, which at
17,286.83 is now down 8.7 percent for the year, rises above 18,000
and stays there, the bank might raise rates next month.
</P>
<P>
   While there was widespread praise for the bank's restraint, the
decision raised questions about when the bank will carry through on
its intentions to eventually raise rates. ``The importance of the
decision is not so much about interest rates as it is about
credibility,'' said Marshall Gittler, a currency strategist at the
Bank of America in Hong Kong. ``The Bank of Japan is now the
central bank that cried wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   Masaru Hayami, the bank's governor, has made it clear that he
wants to raise rates and quickly, arguing that the so-called
zero-interest rate policy was adopted as an emergency measure in
February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Such an extremely loose monetary policy normally runs the risk
of fueling inflation. But Japan has the opposite problem _ prices
are falling here. Consumer spending is erratic at best, and
bankruptcies are rising to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Although business investment has picked up, companies are not
borrowing to finance their expenditures despite exceptionally low
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own view is that monetary policy in this current
environment when everyone is trying to pay down debt is largely
irrelevant,'' said Richard C. Koo, chief economist at the Nomura
Research Institute Ltd. ``So I think a little too much emphasis has
been placed on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Koo said the bank was right to delay a rate increase in the wake
of Sogo's demise. Sogo failed after the government abandoned plans
to use 97 billion yen in taxpayer money as part of a plan to
forgive some of Sogo's debts.
</P>
<P>
   That turnabout was initially hailed as a sign that politicians
would stand aside and allow painful structural adjustments to take
place in the economy, and while investors are generally still
applauding the government's decision, they have also begun trying
to assess the costs of that decision.
</P>
<P>
   What has become increasingly clear is that, whereas the original
plan would have required a handful of major banks and the taxpayers
to shoulder the burden of Sogo, allowing the retailer to fail under
court supervision will spread the pain to scores of smaller
financial institutions and trade creditors.
</P>
<P>
   The government will also have trouble coming to the rescue of
other heavily indebted companies, now that it has set a precedent
with Sogo. ``If this kind of thing goes on unabated, we could
actually break the cycle of growth that the Japanese economy is
in,'' Koo said.

   STOCKTON, Calif. _ Jeff Garcia says he's ready to assume the
role of the No. 1 quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers. Coach
Steve Mariucci, pleased with his starting quarterback's improving
play, isn't so sure about the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a work in progress,'' Mariucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia reported to camp Saturday with the rookies and was on the
field practicing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great,'' Garcia said. ``I'm coming out here without
any question marks in my head. I know I'm the No. 1 guy.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first 49ers training camp in 20 years when the
starting quarterback hasn't been either Joe Montana or Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome considering those were two of my favorite
quarterbacks growing up,'' Garcia said. ``It's a tremendous
feeling. I don't want to let myself down.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci says Garcia is handling the pressure well, although he
noted it was a potentially difficult situation following in the
wake of two future Hall of Famers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would probably be devastating for a quarterback to dwell
on that,'' Mariucci said. ``Therein lies the potential of being
overwhelmed. . . . He's got to be Jeff Garcia.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was rushed into the starting job last year during his
rookie NFL season when Young was lost with a concussion. But it was
still Young's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Steve is on the field, Steve is the leader. Period,''
Mariucci said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Garcia's leadership, Mariucci said that would come with
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Steve is not around anymore lets Jeff start to
step into that position,'' he said. ``It doesn't happen
overnight.''

Monday before riders began their final week of cycling. But Lance
Armstrong, who has dominated the race the past two weeks, wasn't
content to allow things to rest, to stay status quo. The defending
Tour champion has been criticized for his conservative race
tactics, specifically when he allowed Marco Pantani, the 1998 Tour
victor, to take a stage win last Thursday on the legendary Mont
Ventoux. Armstrong, however, turned feisty at a Monday afternoon
press briefing, continually referring to Pantani as ``Il
elephantino,'' a jab at the Italian's bald head and large ears.
Armstrong made the remarks to a press gathering of more than 500
journalists. ``Unfortunately, he has shown his true colors,''
Armstrong said of Pantani. ``I felt like (the stage win) was a
gift. I also feel now that it was a mistake to give the gift. ...
Pantani wasn't the best man on Ventoux.'' (Halliburton, Austin

 &HT;    Tour takes day off but Armstrong feuds with Italian racer
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COURCHEVEL, France - The Tour de France took the day off Monday,
but that didn't stop race leader Lance Armstrong from feuding with
Italian competitor Marco Pantani
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who has dominated the race the past two weeks, has
been criticized allowing Pantani, the 1998 Tour victor, to win
stage 12 Thursday on Mont Ventoux.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Armstrong turned feisty, referring to Pantani as ``Il
Elephantino,'' a jab at the Italian's bald head and large ears, in
front of 500 journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, he has shown his true colors,'' Armstrong. ``I
felt like (the stage win) was a gift. I also feel now that it was a
mistake to give the gift. Pantani wasn't the best man on Ventoux.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been disappointed in his actions. I thought he had more
class than that. The strongest should win the stage. At the time, I
thought it was the right thing to do, the classy thing to do. Since
then, I've been disappointed with his attitudes and his
declarations.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Pantani did not see Armstrong's gesture as a gift.
He was quoted in a French publication as saying ``If Armstrong
thinks it's all over, he's wrong. In any case, he's not finished
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper ``L'Equipe'' also quoted Pantani as saying, ``When
Armstrong told me to speed up he was looking to provoke me. This
diminished him in my eyes, and I felt closer to him (in form and
strength). The Tour is not over.''
</P>
<P>
   The spat between two of the biggest names in cycling will add
spice to the rest of the race, including today's 121.8-mile
mountain climb from Courchevel to Morzine.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has a commanding 7-minute, 26-second lead over 1997
Tour champion Jan Ullrich, his nearest competitor. Pantani is
seventh, 9:57 behind Armstrong, but he has won two mountain stages
_ the one Armstrong said he gave him and stage 15 on Sunday, when
he dashed past Armstrong within 10 miles of the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's race, Pantani said he preferred to finish alone.
``It's much more satisfying,'' he said. ``There's a different taste
to victory when you leave everyone behind. It's the taste of
triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   Replays of the finish of the Mont Ventoux stage show Armstrong
pulling back just before he crossed the finish line, allowing
Pantani to ease past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought at the time it was the right thing to do because I
like Pantani and I respect him as a rider,'' Armstrong said. ``I
know that the last 12 months have been hard on him. I thought he
rode a tough race. I'm disappointed with the way things have
transpired. I made a mistake (in allowing him to win). But it
doesn't change the fact that I respect him as a rider.
</P>
<P>
   Today ``is his last day to do anything,'' Armstrong said.
``Marco came here to win stages. I'm here to win the Tour de
France. I feel very comfortable with where I am now.''
</P>
<P>
   Pantani is one of the more popular athletes in Europe. The
Italian media started calling him ``Il Elephantino'' early in his
career. Pantani then started calling himself ``Il Pirata.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Armstrong, of Austin, Texas, has a huge lead over a
field that features two other Tour champions, he is without a stage
win. If he wins the overall race, he would be the first Tour
champion to do so since Greg LeMond in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also responded Monday to criticism from Tour director
Jean Marie LeBlanc, who was quoted in French publications as saying
that Armstrong would be more popular in France if he spoke French.
Armstrong can speak French but prefers to use a translator when
giving interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that (LeBlanc) said that,'' Armstrong said. ``I'm not
here to win a popularity contest. I love the country of France. I
live in the country of France. I like the people here. But
unfortunately, I can't speak French very well. I did try to speak
French last year, and I was taken advantage of several times. I
don't want to put myself in that position again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to win a bike race, not a popularity contest.''

 &HT;    The A-to-Z guide for a sure-fire successful lemonade stand
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Carey O'Donnell is a lemonade-stand
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, she opened a stand next to the Flagler Museum and
flagged down customers by tying a fishing line between two trees.
Those riding by on bikes would ... well, they'd have to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably not the best way to get customers,'' admits
O'Donnell, who now owns a West Palm Beach PR firm.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Donnell has other good ideas for making your lemonade
stand tops in the neighborhood. And so does developer Joel
Channing. And home-improvement wizard Bob Vila.
</P>
<P>
   We asked them and other grown-up experts how to build, market,
staff and run the perfect, profitable stand.
</P>
<P>
   The Entrepreneurial Personality
</P>
<P>
   First of all, you need to decide if you have what it takes to
squeeze profits out of lemons.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Administration provides wannabe entrepreneurs
with the following quiz to determine if they've got the makings of
a self-made man, woman or child:
</P>
<P>
   - Am I a self-starter? (A good test: Do you clean your room on
your own or do you need constant prompting from Mom and Dad?)
</P>
<P>
   - How well do I get along with a variety of personalities?
</P>
<P>
   - Do I have the physical and emotional stamina to run a
business? (Consider that running a South Florida stand requires
standing in the heat for several hours a day.)
</P>
<P>
   - How good am I at making decisions?
</P>
<P>
   - Are my attitudes and drive strong enough to maintain
motivation? (Or will you want to reach for the Game Boy Color when
you hit a lull in customers?)
</P>
<P>
   - How well do I plan and organize?
</P>
<P>
   - How will the business affect my family? (Will big sis mind
that your bustling biz may block the drive?)
</P>
<P>
   Attracting Customers in a Competitive Marketplace
</P>
<P>
   You gotta figure that the kids down the street are going to take
the boring route: Two orange crates, a piece of plywood, lemonade
in Dixie cups.
</P>
<P>
   You can do better than that!
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of something eye-catching that nobody's done with a
lemonade stand; make it unique,'' suggests Sloan Kamenstein, whose
downtown West Palm Beach ice-cream store contains a working model
train, an explosion of neon colors and fuzzy textures, and
transparent restroom doors that instantly fog up when locked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the whole store to be something unusual that people
would remember and they would go home and talk about.'' Decorate
your own stand with bright, fun colors. ``It adds to the
atmosphere, it sets the tone.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sloan's, they get creative, serving special ice-cream sundaes
in flower pots, for instance, decorated with pinwheels, toy monkeys
and palm trees. Why not put a paper umbrella in each cup of
lemonade?
</P>
<P>
   Or, Kamenstein says, you could add food coloring for 'ades of
crazy hues. Or serve the drinks in hollowed-out lemons (for kids)
or grapefruits (for adults).
</P>
<P>
   But remember, great presentation can't disguise a lackluster
product, Kamenstein says. No matter what, ``make the best lemonade
possible. Use the best ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Structure
</P>
<P>
   No need to get too fancy when you're building a temporary stand,
says home improvement guru Bob Vila.
</P>
<P>
   ``A card table and nice linen cloth are best,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   (Best of all, those are two items that Mom and Dad might already
have around the house. Read: Working with materials at hand means
keeping start-up costs down.)
</P>
<P>
   But let's say you want to build a permanent stand...
</P>
<P>
   Says Vila: ``In that case, I would suggest mahogany planks
straddling a couple of coconut palms.''
</P>
<P>
   Very Florida, which you'd expect from a Miami native and
University of Florida graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Personnel: Your Human Resources
</P>
<P>
   You're going to need help running your stand, but not everyone
is front-counter material. Who among your friends and family is up
to the task?
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the world's top food-service companies say they look
for when hiring:
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's _ Employees who are ambitious, creative and looking
for a challenging career.
</P>
<P>
   Tricon Global Restaurants (Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, KFC) _ ``People
who are committed to quality food and satisfying customers better
than anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy's _ ``Individuals who critically value collaboration,
recognition of individual and team contributions, new ideas and
dedication to `best practices' in all areas of expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrols Corp. (owners of Pollo Tropical and franchisee of Burger
Kings) _ Applicants looking for excitement and personal growth.
</P>
<P>
   In short, steer clear of the couch potato or computer junkie in
your home, and opt for the kids in your neighborhood who are the
first ones to wheel their bikes onto the street each morning.
</P>
<P>
   Dispensing a Quality Product
</P>
<P>
   Courtesy ``Martha Stewart Living''
</P>
<P>
   3 cups freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 20 lemons)
</P>
<P>
   2 cups superfine sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 cups water
</P>
<P>
   4 cups ice
</P>
<P>
   2 lemons, thinly sliced, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup cranberry juice (optional, for pink lemonade)
</P>
<P>
   Makes 10 cups
</P>
<P>
   Into a large serving container, strain the lemon juice and mix
it with the sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Add the water
and stir again until well-combined. Add ice to fill and a few lemon
slices to garnish. The recipe is for strong lemonade that can
tolerate dilution by an afternoon's worth of added ice.
</P>
<P>
   Martha also recommends these good things to supplement your
beverage income: Construction-paper fans, folded by hand and priced
at a $1 each; stick candy purchased at the corner store and marked
up to 15 cents a piece; bar cookies at $1 each; and cups of Jell-O
kept chilled in a pan over ice.
</P>
<P>
   Selecting a Location
</P>
<P>
   Think visibility and traffic (pedestrian is obviously better
than vehicular in this case). That's the advice from local
developer Joel Channing.
</P>
<P>
   When Channing set up his first lemonade stand in 1946 in
Washington, D.C., he put it on a bustling thoroughfare (luckily, he
happened to live on the busy street).
</P>
<P>
   ``It did very well _ must have made a dollar,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Channing Corp. is developing PGA Commons, a $50 million retail,
residential and office project scheduled to open in Palm Beach
Gardens in October.
</P>
<P>
   But, hypothetically speaking, Channing says his best bet for
this kind of business is on the island: ``A lemonade stand on Worth
Avenue would be great. There's no really convenient place to stop
for just a quick drink, and it gets pretty hot out there
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   But remember, you may need friends in great locations. The city
of West Palm Beach, for instance, doesn't allow lemonade stands on
public land. You'll have to set up your citrus on private property,
either your own or someone else's, if you have permission.
</P>
<P>
   Product Positioning
</P>
<P>
   Carey O'Donnell, whose public-relations firm handles accounts
for CityPlace and PGA Commons, gives the following tips for making
your stand stand out in a crowd:
</P>
<P>
   - Location, location, location.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go where you're likely to find thirsty people. Anywhere people
exercise is a good bet, but there's two sides to that. If they're
exercising, they may not have any money in their pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Or follow a retailing principle: ``A corner is always great.''
</P>
<P>
   - Safety first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing is to select a place where it's safe for people
to stop and for kids to have their stand.''
</P>
<P>
   And try to set up under a shade tree. ``That way they don't get
hot and neither do their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   - Signage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would make absolutely sure that the sign was written by a
child. I would even throw in a backward letter or two. People are
charmed by that. You don't want to it to look professional.''
</P>
<P>
   And add something like, ``Voted the most delicious lemonade in
all West Palm Beach by my entire family.'' Humor will boost sales
since most adults buy lemonade ``to help out the children, not
because they're thirsty.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, O'Donnell says, ``I don't recommend my fishing line
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasing Revenue through Advertising
</P>
<P>
   A basic rule of advertising: Establish how your product is
different from your competitors' and how it fulfills the needs of
the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the more nontraditional the approach is, the better off
you're going to be in positioning the product,'' says Lori McAlear
of McAlear &AMP; Associates, whose clients include Cushman Fruit Co.
and the Pete Rose restaurants. ``The more unique it is and the more
it catches somebody's attention, the more successful the marketing
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a McAlear idea: Make a series of signs leading from the
waterfront or a major roadway to your stand.
</P>
<P>
   The first few signs don't tip off the viewer that you're selling
lemonade. Instead, they capitalize on the emotional appeal of a
cool drink.
</P>
<P>
   Sign 1: ``Feeling hot?''
</P>
<P>
   Sign 2: ``Feeling tired?''
</P>
<P>
   Sign 3: ``Need something cool and refreshing?''
</P>
<P>
   Intersperse these with designs that convey ``cool and
refreshing'': blocks of ice, an old rotary fan ... (If you need an
adult's help visualizing this, ask your grandparents about the old
Burma Shave signs.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the signs will lead the pedestrian or commuter
straight to your stand, where you will handily capitalize on the
emotional appeal of drinking something cool on a hot day.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you do, if you sell lemonade, make sure you're
marketing lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to position yourself as gourmet dining and then
have customers disappointed, which is the worst thing you can do,''
McAlear says.
</P>
<P>
   The Profit Margin
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, one of the main reasons you're opening a stand is to
earn a little extra cash. But how?
</P>
<P>
   A few helpful pricing hints from ``The Accounting Game: Basic
Accounting Fresh from the Lemonade Stand'' (Sourcebooks, $16.95):
</P>
<P>
   To determine a price per glass, you need to total the cost of
your lemonade ingredients and count how many glasses of lemonade
you've made. Divide the cost of ingredients by the number of
glasses. Now you have the cost per unit.
</P>
<P>
   To turn a profit, you obviously need to charge more than the
cost per unit. How much more?
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask around,'' say authors Darrell Mullis and Judith
Orloff. ``You ask your family and your friends and your neighbors
and your dog or pet turtle. You think about what restaurants charge
for drinks. You remember that last summer the kid down the street
(who you don't like) got a dollar for his lemonade which was made
from some awful-tasting powder mix.''
</P>
<P>
   You want to strike a balance between clearing a profit and not
scaring away business. In ``The Accounting Game,'' for example, the
fictional lemonade stand charges 50 cents for a glass of lemonade
that cost 20 cents to produce.
</P>
<P>
   Closing the Deal
</P>
<P>
   At long last, a customer approaches. How do you send him or her
away with a glass of lemonade, and earn a pocketful of change in
the process?
</P>
<P>
   Start by asking questions that your customer can't say ``no''
to, advises Gemmy Allen, About.com's sales expert.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of saying to a passer-by, ``Do you want a lemonade?'',
entice your customers into saying ``yes'': ``Is it hot enough for
you today? Need something cool to drink?''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be discouraged if you get a negative response. ``If people
tell you `no,''' Allen says, ``it will help you learn how to
satisfy their needs in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're using the Martha Stewart recipe provided here, you
might mention that in your sales pitch. That's called brand
recognition, and people associate a certain level of quality with
Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if you're selling lemonade made from a recipe that's been in
your family for 100 years, make that part of your spiel. ``That
appeals to people's emotions,'' Allen says. ``The lemonade
satisfies their thirst, but people have other needs, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But if people are ready to buy, ``you close (the sale)
immediately. You don't give them the story'' of your lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, use basic customer service techniques. Look the
customer in the eye. Smile. If there's a line, tell them you'll be
right with them and apologize for the wait. And always, always
thank them for their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``How you make money in business is through your repeat sales,''
Allen says. ``You want to build a relationship with yy'' and a
natural subject for him to explore. ``In the opening moments of our
history of baseball that we released six years ago, writer Gerald
Early told us that when they study our civilization 2,000 years
from now, Americans will be known for only three things: the
Constitution, baseball and jazz music. They are the most beautiful
things Americans have ever created.''
</P>
<P>
   Move over, ``WWF Smackdown!'' Get ready for ``BattleBots!''
</P>
<P>
   I know what you're thinking: What the heck is a BattleBot?
</P>
<P>
   ``BattleBots'' is a new Comedy Central series in which homemade,
remote-controlled metallic robots fight to the ``death'' in a
48-foot-by-48-foot Thunderdome-like arena. In this bizarre _ some
might say insane _ series, such fierce-sounding contraptions as
Vlad the Impaler and Biohazard crash and smash each other until
only one is left standing. But that's not all. The battling robots,
which can weigh up to 488 pounds, must also dodge such weapons as
spikes and buzz saws that emerge from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over this madness are twins Randy and Jason Sklar
(MTV's ``Apartment 2F'') and ``Baywatch'' babe Donna D'Errico.
</P>
<P>
   Is Comedy Central serious?
</P>
<P>
   I'm afraid so.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Comedy Central as you may not have seen it before,''
admits Bill Hilary, the network's vice president and general
manager. ``We think it'll be slightly shocking at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, from the in-your-face clip I saw, ``BattleBots,''
tentatively scheduled to debut next month, will make ``Smackdown!''
look like ``Masterpiece Theater.'' Sklar, however, sniffs at those
comparisons. ``It's not like World Wrestling Federation where it's
fake,'' he says. ``There are real pieces of robot flying around.
This is real pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Possibly painful for the viewer, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, this is a real sport. There is an actual
league and winners do take home prize money (up to $30,000) and
something called ``The Golden Nut.'' (No jokes please.) The sport
is thriving in Japan and Germany. Some robots even cost up to
$75,000 to make. ``They're deadly serious about it,'' notes Mack
Anderson, a ``BattleBots'' executive producer. ``I mean, people
spend years designing these robots. I ran into one of the
competitors in San Francisco and he was pacing the streets late at
night. And I said, `What's the matter, my friend?' He said, `I've
got to face Biohazard tomorrow and I'm a wreck.'''
</P>
<P>
   But if you're not into raw destruction, look for hidden
educational messages. ``It's about teaching kids how to build
things,'' Trey Roski, ``BattleBots'' creator and president, says
with a straight face. ``Building these robots is difficult and you
have to be a little bit intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   And probably a little stupid to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Newshour with Jim Lehrer'' and ``Frontline'' will join
forces with National Public Radio in a live election broadcast
scheduled to air in November, PBS announced. ``Time to Choose -- A
PBS/NPR Voter's Guide'' will air live on Nov. 1 for three hours
from five PBS stations around the country.
</P>
<P>
   PBS will also unveil a new promotional campaign this fall.
``Come to Public Television if You're Curious'' will become PBS'
new slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Say goodbye to Adam Schiff, the gruff ``Law &AMP; Order'' D.A.
played by Steven Hill. The 78-year-old actor will not return to
NBC's long-running series. Hill reportedly grew tired of the show's
long shooting hours. He'll be replaced by two-time Oscar winner
Dianne Wiest, whom you may recognize from such Woody Allen movies
as ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' and ``Bullets Over Broadway.'' She'll
become the show's new D.A. I'll miss the gravelly-voiced Hill,
though. No one delivered irony-dripping lines better.
</P>
<P>
   Quote of the weekend: Jonathan Winters on why he uses a cane:
``I'm not crippled. I'm just trying to deal with violence. I'm
afraid.'' You can catch more of Winter's rib-tickling shtick on
``Jonathan Winters: On The Loose,'' a PBS documentary scheduled to
air Aug. 21.

   WASHINGTON _ There's pressure on the new Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers to expand the number of ``top
level'' Internet domains.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet currently uses seven top-level domain names, the
broad categories that appear at the end of World Wide Web addresses
in the United States:
</P>
<P>
   gov _ federal government sites. (www.senate.gov)
</P>
<P>
   mil _ military sites (www.navy.mil)
</P>
<P>
   edu _ four-year accredited institutions of higher education
(www.harvard.edu)
</P>
<P>
   int _ international treaty organizations (www.nato.int)
</P>
<P>
   com _ commercial enterprises (www.amazon.com)
</P>
<P>
   org _ nonprofit organizations (www.naacp.org)
</P>
<P>
   net _ networking companies (www.earthlink.net)
</P>
<P>
   Campanies and groups pay a fee to register .com, .org and .net
domain names.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two-letter codes are use to identify sites in 247
countries. For example, FR for France, JP for Japan and SA for
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   However, as many desirable domain names have been used up in
recent years, there has been a cry to create more top-level
domains, and thus more ``room'' on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting last week in Japan, ICANN agreed to expand the number of
top-level domains, probably by next year. But no decisions have
been made yet about the new names. Here are some that are being
pushed by interested groups:
</P>
<P>
   banc _ financial services companies
</P>
<P>
   travel _ travel agencies
</P>
<P>
   shop _ online retailers
</P>
<P>
   union _ labor unions
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The address system for locating sites on the Internet originally
involved numbers rather than names.
</P>
<P>
   To make the Internet easier to use, the ``domain name'' system
was introduced in the mid-1980s. Its purpose was to convert a
numeric IP (for Internet Protocol) address, such as 192.0.34.65,
into an easy-to-remember name, such as www.icann.org.
</P>
<P>
   Each top-level domain (such as .org) can be divided into many
second-level domains (such as icann.org). Second-level domains can
be divided into third-level domains (such as members.icann.org),
and so on.

 &HT;    AS INTERNET GROWS, CAN HARDWARE KEEP PACE?
 &HT;    1030&AMP;add. With HARDWARE-DATA and INTERNET-SOFTWARE. Moving in

 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as the Internet expands the horizons of
millions of users and energizes the world economy, fears have
arisen that it could fall victim to its very success.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the World Wide Web offers about 2.1 billion pages and
growing by more than 7 million pages a day. A new study by
Cyveillance, an Internet research company, sees the number of pages
doubling by early 2001. Likewise, the community of users, now 275
million people around the globe, is projected to reach 1 billion by
2005.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the amount of information traveling across the
Internet is doubling every three months. But such growth rates pose
the very real nightmare that this massive online structure,
representing a $650 billion investment, could come crashing down in
gigantic cyber-traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the system has remained a going concern because key
service providers keep installing more and better hardware. The
question is, how long will this solution work?
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people think that adding capacity will solve the
problems,'' said Paul Segan, president of Akamai Technologies. ``It
simply will not.''
</P>
<P>
   Sagan, whose firm distributes online data through 4,000 servers,
told an industry conference in Chicago this month that the
Internet's backbone is already taxed to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   As high-speed broadband services become increasingly available,
he predicted, content providers will offer more streaming media and
users will spend more time on line, canceling out the hardware
gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, Sagan added, ``was never designed to be a
business-critical, 7-by-24 marketplace where real-time commerce,
entertainment and information is exchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   For the short term, at least, online activities are safe from
catastrophic failure for much the same reason that they remain
vunerable to hacker attacks. Since the Internet was designed as a
decentralized tself by automatically re-routing of data to
``healthy'' hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with keeping nightmarish failures in check are the
unsung people _ part cybercops, part cyberdocs _ who manage the
hardware that undergirds the Internet revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly employees of private companies rather than government,
they monitor traffic patterns to see where the load is increasing
fastest, so that new data lines and switching equipment can be
installed before the system can be overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   At its physical core, the Internet is vast network of copper
wires and optical fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttling packets of data across these ``pipes'' to their proper
destinations are tens of thousands of special-purpose computers
known as routers, all programmed with same protocol, or addressing
language. Backing up those machines are simplified routers, known
as switchers.
</P>
<P>
   As Internet use continues to mushroom, so does the demand for
more sophisticated routers and switchers and higher-capacity pipes.
The technology is moving so rapidly that the $100,000-plus routers
that manage the Internet's ``backbone'' need to be replaced with
more powerful units every 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the upgrades resemble the way today's PCs are improved:
through more sophisticated processing chips and caching techniques,
coupled with larger storage and transmission capacities.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet's rapid convergence with telecom, video and
wireless devices are making ever more massive demands on the
network. A few years' hence, the only way to avoid gridlock may be
through now-experimental technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, experts see promise in ``photonic'' switches.
If such optical devices replaced electronic switches, there would
be no need to covert the light pulses carring data swiftly through
fiber-optic cables into electrons at central router hubs, a current
choke point in the data flow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another future prospect: Integration into the network of
Internet II, a blazingly fast closed system now being tested at
more 170 U.S. universities.
</P>
<P>
   Internet II is a four-year-old partnership among academia, the
government and industry. Its huge bandwidth, routed through some
some 30 dedicated hubs known as gigapops, make for both reliable
and efficient links that enable distant researchers to routinely
perform tasks that would be impossible to achieve on the public
system.
</P>
<P>
   They can, for example, watch full-motion video images _ in real
time, in full color and on large screens _ from a telescope in
Arizona and to simultaneously steer that huge tube around the
cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Another innovation helping the Internet keep up with growing
demands are ``server farms,'' huge data centers that consolidate
many high-volume Web operations in one location.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of these ``engine rooms'' of the Internet is one run by
IBM in the western Chicago suburb of Schamburg, Ill. It powers the
Web sites and electronic commerce operations of more than 500
companies and organizations, including BankAmerica, Macy's,
Goodyear Rubber and the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to own their own information but they don't want
to maintain it, and that is driving the shift back toward
centralization,'' said Adele Goldberg, a member of the team at
Xerox Palo Alto Research Center on the Stanford campus in the early
1970s that eventually spawned today's pervasive network-friendly,
PC-oriented computing universe.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike prior commercial revolutions _ telephones, power lines,
railroads, highways and airplanes _ government regulators play no
role in making sure the Internet keeps pace with explosive growth.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, those tasks are being largely met by Cisco Systems
Inc., a Silicon Valley hardware giant with a current valuation of
some $460 billion. Cisco, which sells its products in some 115
countries, enjoys an effective lock on the world's high-speed data
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fiber (optical cables) are the railroad tracks, and Cisco
makes the trains,'' said Hal Varian, dean of the School of
Information Management at the University of California in Berkeley.
``There's been a lot of investment putting fiber into the ground.
But if you want to use that fiber, you need Cisco routers.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Once users are connected to the Internet, routers serve as an
``intelligent device that works almost like a post office,'' said
Kevin DeNuccio, Cisco's senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It understands where you're trying to get to and where that
is, and what's the easiest way to get you there, and it actually
directs your question, your request, to a server.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's clear dominance over the Internet networking scene _ the
company controls 65 percent of all Internet routers and continues
to grow at the rate of 40 percent a year _ raises the question of
whether it is likely to become a future target in the government's
antitrust gun sights.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the company has managed to avoid the fate of Microsoft
Corp., which has been branded in a federal court as a predatory
monopolist that needs to be split into two competing firms.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, at about the same time as the Justice Department filed
its civil suit against Microsoft, the Federal Trade Commission
began to probe charges that Cisco had illegally colluded with two
other big players in the telecom hardware market: Lucent
Technologies and Nortel Networks.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency subsequently dropped its inquiry. Since that
time, Cisco general counsel Dan Scheinman and other key executives
have meeting regularly _ on their own initiative _ with antitrust
chief Joel Klein and other Justice Department officials to contend
that Cisco lacks a monopoly choke hold on the Web and should be
left alone by federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's ``pipes'' present yet another facet of intense
market concentration. On July 10, the two largest fiber-optic
firms, JDS Uniphase and SDL, announced merger plans. If their $41
billion deal goes through, it promises to be the largest technology
merger ever.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by industry-watching Red Herring magazine noted
that ``three vendors _ JDS Uniphase, SDL, and E-Tek _ own their
market now and for the foreseeable future.'' In late June, after
the report was published, JDS acquired E-Tek.

   Meeting last week in Japan, ICANN agreed to expand the number of
top-level domains, probably by next year. But no decisions have
been made yet about the new names. Here are some that are being
pushed by interested groups:
</P>
<P>
   banc _ financial services companies
</P>
<P>
   travel _ travel agencies
</P>
<P>
   shop _ online retailers
</P>
<P>
   union _ labor unions
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The address system for locating sites on the Internet originally
involved numbers rather than names.
</P>
<P>
   To make the Internet easier to use, the ``domain name'' system
was introduced in the mid-1980s. Its purpose was to convert a
numeric IP (for Internet Protocol) address, such as 192.0.34.65,
into an easy-to-remember name, such as www.icann.org.
</P>
<P>
   Each top-level domain (such as .org) can be divided into many
second-level domains (such as icann.org). Second-level domains can
be divided into third-level domains (such as members.icann.org),
and so on.

 &HT;    AS INTERNET GROWS, CAN HARDWARE KEEP PACE?

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as the Internet expands the horizons of
millions of users and energizes the world economy, fears have
arisen that it could fall victim to its very success.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the World Wide Web offers about 2.1 billion pages and
growing by more than 7 million pages a day. A new study by
Cyveillance, an Internet research company, sees the number of pages
doubling by early 2001. Likewise, the community of users, now 275
million people around the globe, is projected to reach 1 billion by
2005.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the amount of information traveling across the
Internet is doubling every three months. But such growth rates pose
the very real nightmare that this massive online structure,
representing a $650 billion investment, could come crashing down in
gigantic cyber-traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the system has remained a going concern because key
service providers keep installing more and better hardware. The
question is, how long will this solution work?
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people think that adding capacity will solve the
problems,'' said Paul Segan, president of Akamai Technologies. ``It
simply will not.''
</P>
<P>
   Sagan, whose firm distributes online data through 4,000 servers,
told an industry conference in Chicago this month that the
Internet's backbone is already taxed to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   As high-speed broadband services become increasingly available,
he predicted, content providers will offer more streaming media and
users will spend more time on line, canceling out the hardware
gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, Sagan added, ``was never designed to be a
business-critical, 7-by-24 marketplace where real-time commerce,
entertainment and information is exchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   For the short term, at least, online activities are safe from
catastrophic failure for much the same reason that they remain
vunerable to hacker attacks. Since the Internet was designed as a
decentralized network, it can ``repair'' itself by automatically
re-routing of data to ``healthy'' hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with keeping nightmarish failures in check are the
unsung people _ part cybercops, part cyberdocs _ who manage the
hardware that undergirds the Internet revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly employees of private companies rather than government,
they monitor traffic patterns to see where the load is increasing
fastest, so that new data lines and switching equipment can be
installed before the system can be overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   At its physical core, the Internet is vast network of copper
wires and optical fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttling packets of data across these ``pipes'' to their proper
destinations are tens of thousands of special-purpose computers
known as routers, all programmed with same protocol, or addressing
language. Backing up those machines are simplified routers, known
as switchers.
</P>
<P>
   As Internet use continues to mushroom, so does the demand for
more sophisticated routers and switchers and higher-capacity pipes.
The technology is moving so rapidly that the $100,000-plus routers
that manage the Internet's ``backbone'' need to be replaced with
more powerful units every 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the upgrades resemble the way today's PCs are improved:
through more sophisticated processing chips and caching techniques,
coupled with larger storage and transmission capacities.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet's rapid convergence with telecom, video and
wireless devices are making ever more massive demands on the
network. A few years' hence, the only way to avoid gridlock may be
through now-experimental technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, experts see promise in ``photonic'' switches.
If such optical devices replaced electronic switches, there would
be no need to covert the light pulses carring data swiftly through
fiber-optic cables into electrons at central router hubs, a current
choke point in the data flow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another future prospect: Integration into the network of
Internet II, a blazingly fast closed system now being tested at
more 170 U.S. universities.
</P>
<P>
   Internet II is a four-year-old partnership among academia, the
government and industry. Its huge bandwidth, routed through some
some 30 dedicated hubs known as gigapops, make for both reliable
and efficient links that enable distant researchers to routinely
perform tasks that would be impossible to achieve on the public
system.
</P>
<P>
   They can, for example, watch full-motion video images _ in real
time, in full color and on large screens _ from a telescope in
Arizona and to simultaneously steer that huge tube around the
cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Another innovation helping the Internet keep up with growing
demands are ``server farms,'' huge data centers that consolidate
many high-volume Web operations in one location.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of these ``engine rooms'' of the Internet is one run by
IBM in the western Chicago suburb of Schamburg, Ill. It powers the
Web sites and electronic commerce operations of more than 500
companies and organizations, including BankAmerica, Macy's,
Goodyear Rubber and the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to own their own information but they don't want
to maintain it, and that is driving the shift back toward
centralization,'' said Adele Goldberg, a member of the team at
Xerox Palo Alto Research Center on the Stanford campus in the early
1970s that eventually spawned today's pervasive network-friendly,
PC-oriented computing universe.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike prior commercial revolutions _ telephones, power lines,
railroads, highways and airplanes _ government regulators play no
role in making sure the Internet keeps pace with explosive growth.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, those tasks are being largely met by Cisco Systems
Inc., a Silicon Valley hardware giant with a current valuation of
some $460 billion. Cisco, which sells its products in some 115
countries, enjoys an effective lock on the world's high-speed data
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fiber (optical cables) are the railroad tracks, and Cisco
makes the trains,'' said Hal Varian, dean of the School of
Information Management at the University of California in Berkeley.
``There's been a lot of investment putting fiber into the ground.
But if you want to use that fiber, you need Cisco routers.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Once users are connected to the Internet, routers serve as an
``intelligent device that works almost like a post office,'' said
Kevin DeNuccio, Cisco's senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It understands where you're trying to get to and where that
is, and what's the easiest way to get you there, and it actually
directs your question, your request, to a server.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's clear dominance over the Internet networking scene _ the
company controls 65 percent of all Internet routers and continues
to grow at the rate of 40 percent a year _ raises the question of
whether it is likely to become a future target in the government's
antitrust gun sights.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the company has managed to avoid the fate of Microsoft
Corp., which has been branded in a federal court as a predatory
monopolist that needs to be split into two competing firms.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, at about the same time as the Justice Department filed
its civil suit against Microsoft, the Federal Trade Commission
began to probe charges that Cisco had illegally colluded with two
other big players in the telecom hardware market: Lucent
Technologies and Nortel Networks.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency subsequently dropped its inquiry. Since that
time, Cisco general counsel Dan Scheinman and other key executives
have meeting regularly _ on their own initiative _ with antitrust
chief Joel Klein and other Justice Department officials to contend
that Cisco lacks a monopoly choke hold on the Web and should be
left alone by federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's ``pipes'' present yet another facet of intense
market concentration. On July 10, the two largest fiber-optic
firms, JDS Uniphase and SDL, announced merger plans. If their $41
billion deal goes through, it promises to be the largest technology
merger ever.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by industry-watching Red Herring magazine noted
that ``three vendors _ JDS Uniphase, SDL, and E-Tek _ own their
market now and for the foreseeable future.'' In late June, after
the report was published, JDS acquired E-Tek.

 &HT;    NEW INTERNET GOVERNING BODY FINDS ITS AUTHORITY CHALLENGED
 &HT;    WITH INTERNET-ICANN, INTERNET-DOMAINS, INTERNET-TAKEN and
INTERNET-HARDWARE. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, July 23.

   WASHINGTON _ Www.any-site.com.
</P>
<P>
   To American ears, this familiar pattern identifies a World Wide
Web site on the Internet. The system seems simple and settled, but
a global battle is being waged this summer over how addresses will
be assigned to keep pace with rapid Internet growth.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   If plans to establish private control over the Internet's
address system founders on technical details and political
disputes, the global expansion of the online community could become
gridlocked.
</P>
<P>
   But if it succeeds, Americans will have to get used to having
the Internet governed by an international body that may be located
in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force for change is an explosion in Internet use.
More than 14 million Web sites are now registered, with 59 percent
of them based in the United States. But with the rest of the world
discovering cyberspace, industry experts estimate that by 2003, the
Internet will be populated by some 160 million registered sites,
most of them overseas.
</P>
<P>
   So many companies are trying to squeeze themselves onto the
Internet that people everywhere are clamoring for more virtual real
estate beyond the already-crowded ``.com'' category. They want
addresses that end ``.shop,'' ``.travel,'' ``.banc,'' ``.med,'' and
even ``.porn.''
</P>
<P>
   And Internet users everywhere want a simple, inexpensive system
for resolving disputes over addresses and trademark names.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping up with the dizzying growth is technically
complicated and politically charged.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the rules is ``like rearranging the streets of a
city,'' said Frederick Weingarten, of the American Library
Association, a group trying to stir Internet users' interest in the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Because one's address is also one's name in cyberspace, the
issues also are legally complex, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you choose to call yourself ... has free speech
implications and it has intellectual property implications,''
Weingarten said. ``It essentially boils down to a fight over
identity who you are and what you call yourself in cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   In coming months, many of the key issues about the future of
addresses will be settled by a group charged with taking away
control of the system from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   That group is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers (ICANN), based in Marina del Rey, Calif. Put together in
1998 at the prompting of the Clinton administration, ICANN's
mission is to assemble a permanent international board to run the
Internet's address system and help settle disputes over trademarks
and names. Eventually, ICANN may move its global headquarters to
Switzerland, a country widely regarded as neutral ground.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have questioned the legitimacy of ICANN, calling it an
illegally formed quasi-government entity. But earlier this month,
the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
found nothing illegal about ICANN's formation.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report also concluded that ICANN can impose fees on
Internet registrars to defray operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, (July 12-16) ICANN's interim board met in Yokohama,
Japan, to continue hammering out the procedures for electing a
permanent board. ICANN plans to hold online elections this October
open to any Internet user 16 or older who registers on the ICANN
Web site by July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Staging a fair, free election on a global level in cyberspace
will be an unprecedented event.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic election,'' said Scott Harshbarger,
president of Common Cause, a non-profit group trying to get
Americans registered to vote. Even people who have no interest in
the U.S. presidential election may want to get involved in ICANN,
he said, because ``the Internet may matter much more in their daily
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet address system got its start decades ago when the
network of computer networks was being cobbled together by computer
lovers employed by universities or government. Decisions tended to
be made informally and by consensus among a fairly tight-knit
group.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Internet's use expanded in the early 1990s, a more
sophisticated system evolved that divided addresses into major
categories, called domain names. An example is the familiar .com.
The system also uses two-letter country codes such as ``.uk'' for
the United Kingdom and ``.fr'' for France.
</P>
<P>
   To handle the growing number of addresses, the U.S. government
awarded an exclusive contract for registering commercial sites to
Network Solutions Inc., a Herndon, Va.-based company. At first,
Network Solutions' business was slow. Then Internet use exploded in
the mid-1990s, and demands grew to further ``privatize''
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of continuing to grant government contracts to register
names, the Clinton administration started putting together ICANN to
act as a private, non-profit corporation to administer policy for
the address system.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, ICANN and Network Solutions agreed to the terms under
which other companies could enter the registration business. Today,
more than 100 entities have been approved by ICANN to compete with
Network Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   With so many companies registering names, ICANN's role is vital.
It must coordinate with the Internet Engineering Task Force, the
Internet Architecture Board, and other organizations dealing with
Internet protocols and standards so that addresses can be ``read''
correctly.
</P>
<P>
   This coordination will be especially important when the Internet
starts grappling with new top-level domains.
</P>
<P>
   And that day is coming soon.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting in Japan, ICANN's interim board agreed to add new
top-level domain names in the coming year. But it did not yet
settle the issue of what the suffixes will be or how many can be
added.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to create new top-level domain names is so great
that even before ICANN finalizes its plans, Internet users are
finding ways around the rules. For example, one California company
has agreed to pay $50 million to Tuvalu, a tiny island group in the
South Pacific, for rights to Web addresses ending in that country's
code, ``.tv.'' The plan is to make money by getting media companies
to register television-related Web sites in the ``.tv'' domain.
</P>
<P>
   To carry out its mandate to administer the address system, ICANN
needs funding. But today, its budget is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ICANN's $4.3 million annual budget comes from the fees paid by
private companies that have registered their Web sites. Last year,
ICANN decided to raise 35 percent of its budget from national
governments, which have registered about 5 million addresses ending
with country codes.
</P>
<P>
   But ICANN is having trouble collecting $1.5 million owed from
many of the 247 nations taking part in the system. Dues are based
on the number of registered Web sites in each country, with bills
ranging from $500 in small nations to $500,000 in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ICANN's relationship with the country-code operators is so
ill-defined that many countries have been refusing to acknowledge
ICANN invoices, calling the fees a ``domain name tax'' imposed by a
U.S. corporation with no power to do so.
</P>
<P>
   At its Japan meeting, ICANN decided that any group trying to
create a new domain name will have to pay ICANN a non-refundable
application fee of $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even if ICANN is able to bolster its budget, it faces other
challenges in expanding the list of countries that should get
codes. It was only after years of lobbying by Palestinians that
ICANN this March approved a ``.ps'' domain name. That move came
only after the United Nations added Palestine to its list of
country and territory codes.
</P>
<P>
   In coming years, ICANN's single most important role may be to
help settle commercial trademark disputes as the Internet grows. It
is striving to create a process that is fair, fast and reasonably
priced.
</P>
<P>
   The first major test of its ability to settle disputes came this
year after the organization changed the rule that had limited names
to 22 characters. To create more room for new Web sites, it boosted
the number of allowed characters to 63.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a battle between the World Wrestling Foundation and
a California man. The WWF had www.wwf.com, a site it had held since
1994. But a California stockbroker, Michael Bosman, took advantage
of the ICANN change to register the address
www.worldwrestlingfederation.com for $60. After registering the
name, he contacted the Federation, which said he offered to sell
the name for ``a significant profit.''
</P>
<P>
   The federation filed a complaint using ICANN's Uniform Dispute
Resolution Process. ICANN uses the mediation services of World
Intellectual Property Organization, an arm of the United Nations,
to help settle the disputes. The WIPO ruled in favor of the
wrestling federation.
</P>
<P>
   Already, hundreds of trademark disputes have been submitted for
mediation. Critics believe the ICANN process may be too slow for
the volume of disputes that will be brewing. Others worry ICANN
will make it too easy for trademark holders to take away the names
of people who staked legitimate claims to them. But at least for
now, the ICANN experiment in global cooperation offers the best
hope for expanding the Internet create new cyber-neighborhoods.

 &HT;    NEW INTERNET GOVERNING BODY FINDS ITS AUTHORITY CHALLENGED
 &HT;    WITH INTERNET-ICANN, INTERNET-DOMAINS, INTERNET-TAKEN and
INTERNET-HARDWARE. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial

   WASHINGTON _ Www.any-site.com.
</P>
<P>
   To American ears, this familiar pattern identifies a World
Wisses will be assigned to keep pace with rapid Internet growth.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   If plans to establish private control over the Internet's
address system founders on technical details and political
disputes, the global expansion of the online community could become
gridlocked.
</P>
<P>
   But if it succeeds, Americans will have to get used to having
the Internet governed by an international body that may be located
in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force for change is an explosion in Internet use.
More than 14 million Web sites are now registered, with 59 percent
of them based in the United States. But with the rest of the world
discovering cyberspace, industry experts estimate that by 2003, the
Internet will be populated by some 160 million registered sites,
most of them overseas.
</P>
<P>
   So many companies are trying to squeeze themselves onto the
Internet that people everywhere are clamoring for more virtual real
estate beyond the already-crowded ``.com'' category. They want
addresses that end ``.shop,'' ``.travel,'' ``.banc,'' ``.med,'' and
even ``.porn.''
</P>
<P>
   And Internet users everywhere want a simple, inexpensive system
for resolving disputes over addresses and trademark names.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping up with the dizzying growth is technically
complicated and politically charged.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the rules is ``like rearranging the streets of a
city,'' said Frederick Weingarten, of the American Library
Association, a group trying to stir Internet users' interest in the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Because one's address is also one's name in cyberspace, the
issues also are legally complex, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you choose to call yourself ... has free speech
implications and it has intellectual property implications,''
Weingarten said. ``It essentially boils down to a fight over
identity who you are and what you call yourself in cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   In coming months, many of the key issues about the future of
addresses will be settled by a group charged with taking away
control of the system from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   That group is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers (ICANN), based in Marina del Rey, Calif. Put together in
1998 at the prompting of the Clinton administration, ICANN's
mission is to assemble a permanent international board to run the
Internet's address system and help settle disputes over trademarks
and names. Eventually, ICANN may move its global headquarters to
Switzerland, a country widely regarded as neutral ground.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have questioned the legitimacy of ICANN, calling it an
illegally formed quasi-government entity. But earlier this month,
the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
found nothing illegal about ICANN's formation.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report also concluded that ICANN can impose fees on
Internet registrars to defray operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, (July 12-16) ICANN's interim board met in Yokohama,
Japan, to continue hammering out the procedures for electing a
permanent board. ICANN plans to hold online elections this October
open to any Internet user 16 or older who registers on the ICANN
Web site by July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Staging a fair, free election on a global level in cyberspace
will be an unprecedented event.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic election,'' said Scott Harshbarger,
president of Common Cause, a non-profit group trying to get
Americans registered to vote. Even people who have no interest in
the U.S. presidential election may want to get involved in ICANN,
he said, because ``the Internet may matter much more in their daily
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet address system got its start decades ago when the
network of computer networks was being cobbled together by computer
lovers employed by universities or government. Decisions tended to
be made informally and by consensus among a fairly tight-knit
group.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Internet's use expanded in the early 1990s, a more
sophisticated system evolved that divided addresses into major
categories, called domain names. An example is the familiar .com.
The system also uses two-letter country codes such as ``.uk'' for
the United Kingdom and ``.fr'' for France.
</P>
<P>
   To handle the growing number of addresses, the U.S. government
awarded an exclusive contract for registering commercial sites to
Network Solutions Inc., a Herndon, Va.-based company. At first,
Network Solutions' business was slow. Then Internet use exploded in
the mid-1990s, and demands grew to further ``privatize''
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of continuing to grant government contracts to register
names, the Clinton administration started putting together ICANN to
act as a private, non-profit corporation to administer policy for
the address system.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, ICANN and Network Solutions agreed to the terms under
which other companies could enter the registration business. Today,
more than 100 entities have been approved by ICANN to compete with
Network Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   With so many companies registering names, ICANN's role is vital.
It must coordinate with the Internet Engineering Task Force, the
Internet Architecture Board, and other organizations dealing with
Internet protocols and standards so that addresses can be ``read''
correctly.
</P>
<P>
   This coordination will be especially important when the Internet
starts grappling with new top-level domains.
</P>
<P>
   And that day is coming soon.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting in Japan, ICANN's interim board agreed to add new
top-level domain names in the coming year. But it did not yet
settle the issue of what the suffixes will be or how many can be
added.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to create new top-level domain names is so great
that even before ICANN finalizes its plans, Internet users are
finding ways around the rules. For example, one California company
has agreed to pay $50 million to Tuvalu, a tiny island group in the
South Pacific, for rights to Web addresses ending in that country's
code, ``.tv.'' The plan is to make money by getting media companies
to register television-related Web sites in the ``.tv'' domain.
</P>
<P>
   To carry out its mandate to administer the address system, ICANN
needs funding. But today, its budget is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ICANN's $4.3 million annual budget comes from the fees paid by
private companies that have registered their Web sites. Last year,
ICANN decided to raise 35 percent of its budget from national
governments, which have registered about 5 million addresses ending
with country codes.
</P>
<P>
   But ICANN is having trouble collecting $1.5 million owed from
many of the 247 nations taking part in the system. Dues are based
on the number of registered Web sites in each country, with bills
ranging from $500 in small nations to $500,000 in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ICANN's relationship with the country-code operators is so
ill-defined that many countries have been refusing to acknowledge
ICANN invoices, calling the fees a ``domain name tax'' imposed by a
U.S. corporation with no power to do so.
</P>
<P>
   At its Japan meeting, ICANN decided that any group trying to
create a new domain name will have to pay ICANN a non-refundable
application fee of $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even if ICANN is able to bolster its budget, it faces other
challenges in expanding the list of countries that should get
codes. It was only after years of lobbying by Palestinians that
ICANN this March approved a ``.ps'' domain name. That move came
only after the United Nations added Palestine to its list of
country and territory codes.
</P>
<P>
   In coming years, ICANN's single most important role may be to
help settle commercial trademark disputes as the Internet grows. It
is striving to create a process that is fair, fast and reasonably
priced.
</P>
<P>
   The first major test of its ability to settle disputes came this
year after the organization changed the rule that had limited names
to 22 characters. To create more room for new Web sites, it boosted
the number of allowed characters to 63.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a battle between the World Wrestling Foundation and
a California man. The WWF had www.wwf.com, a site it had held since
1994. But a California stockbroker, Michael Bosman, took advantage
of the ICANN change to register the address
www.worldwrestlingfederation.com for $60. After registering the
name, he contacted the Federation, which said he offered to sell
the name for ``a significant profit.''
</P>
<P>
   The federation filed a complaint using ICANN's Uniform Dispute
Resolution Process. ICANN uses the mediation services of World
Intellectual Property Organization, an arm of the United Nations,
to help settle the disputes. The WIPO ruled in favor of the
wrestling federation.
</P>
<P>
   Already, hundreds of trademark disputes have been submitted for
mediation. Critics believe the ICANN process may be too slow for
the volume of disputes that will be brewing. Others worry ICANN
will make it too easy for trademark holders to take away the names
of people who staked legitimate claims to them. But at least for
now, the ICANN experiment in global cooperation offers the best
hope for expanding the Internet create new cyber-neighborhoods.

NEWSPAPER JUNKIE PEARSON OFTEN AHEAD OF FRONT-PAGE STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the season of the ``beach read,'' and crime novels by
Northwesterner Ridley Pearson are finding their way onto many a
towel spread at water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   Other writers might aspire to have their work on library shelves
or in handsome homes, but having his work right there amid the
sunscreen, the sand granules, the cold drinks and the hot rays is
just fine with the 47-year-old crafter of high-adrenaline page
turners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more of a storyteller than a writer. I'm the first to
admit that,'' Pearson said in an interview. ``I like to write in as
smooth and literary a fashion as I can, but, first and foremost, I
want to entertain you. I want you to forget there's a clock on the
wall. I want you to forget there's laundry in the washer. So having
my books taken on vacation and being considered a `beach read' is a
real compliment. It is certainly better than having what you write
considered a `doorstopper.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson's latest is a heart-stopper at times but never a
doorstopper. ``Middle of Nowhere'' (Hyperion, 375 pages, $23.95)
zings with high-tension narrative electricity, tantalizing twists
of plot, hard-edged realism straight from the headlines, plus such
a welcome return appearance by his two signature characters that
this is Pearson's first hardback to make the national best-seller
lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm doing a little jig today,'' he said, although
the dance was too subtle to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson's Lou Boldt, the knight-errant of a Seattle homicide
lieutenant, is back on the case, assisted by Daphne Matthews, the
Seattle police psychologist of stunning good looks and sharp-witted
insights. Their intense partnership is tested from without and
within, as Boldt's marriage again suffers from this flawed
loyalist's total immersion in work.
</P>
<P>
   Boldt has no choice in ``Middle of Nowhere.'' Seattle police are
staging a sickout, this ``blu flu'' decimating the force and
inviting a rash of thefts and assaults that has the tense Emerald
City teetering on the edge. Few officers remain on the job, and
some who do are subjected to attack, including Boldt, with fellow
officers among the suspects. The threat of retaliation hangs in the
Puget Sound air, along with precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   A police sickout in New Orleans provided some of the impetus for
``Middle of Nowhere,'' as did news reports of prison inmates
getting paid to work as telephone solicitors (a discovery that
satisfied Pearson's pledge, after being interrupted during dinner
by a telephone solicitor, that ``I now know who the next book's
villain will be!''). But the Sun Valley, Idaho, writer _ the first
American to receive the Raymond Chandler Fulbright Scholarship at
Oxford University _ had a larger theme in mind when he started the
novel.
</P>
<P>
   As Pearson stressed, ``Despite these books being seen as genre
fiction, it's still the intent of most writers in this field to
tell a good story and have it be more than some surface cop chase
seen on TV. I always try to start my books with a concept. `Middle
of Nowhere' was to be a story about loyalty and trust, actually the
loss of loyalty and trust, and how that affects the principal
characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, I seized on wanting to isolate Lou Boldt,
professionally, emotionally, and the vehicle I came up with was the
`blu flu.' So I came to Seattle police and wanted to talk to some
isolated officer, and I was led to a gay African American woman _
you probably can't get much more isolated than that _ and she was
marvelous. I put what she told me into Boldt and his situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson is a stickler for realism in his 13 novels, right down
to the latest high-tech innovations (triangulation to track the
user of an analog cell phone in his new novel). The Brown
University graduate's reputation for accuracy has earned him many
fans in blue uniforms, as has his uncanny ability to have his
novels foreshadow upcoming headlines, which often break almost upon
publication.
</P>
<P>
   That started in 1988 when ``Undercurrents'' led to two murder
convictions in Washington after prosecutors linked up with the
oceanographer cited in the acknowledgements of Pearson's novel, an
oceanographer whom the writer had consulted on similar crimes for
his book. This strange prescience has continued in the wake of four
other Pearson novels, with such subjects as high-tech arsons,
illegal adoptions and the deaths of foreign stowaways in cargo
containers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a weird thing,'' Pearson admitted. ``People ask if
I'm psychic, and of course I'm not. It may be nothing more than I
get interested in little things from reading papers so thoroughly.
I read a small item about a cargo container being found in Houston
with human waste and food, and I thought there's my story (``The
First Victim'' in 1999). Halfway through the writing, there was a
container found with dead stowaways in California; three weeks
before publication, there was one found in Tacoma and later more in
Seattle. It is awfully coincidental.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson is a soft-spoken, erudite and earnest fellow, so dead
serious about writing that he devotes 65 hours a week to the task
(but then he also spent eight years writing fiction without earning
a penny).
</P>
<P>
   He has gentlemanly manners and many enthusiasms, including fly
fishing, tree climbing and public service (volunteer teaching at a
nearby alternative high school). He is also a confirmed family man
whose writer's Web site (www.ridleypearson.com) includes a
heart-tugging account of the pilgrimage that he and his wife,
Marcelle, made to China last year to adopt tiny Storey, who joined
a big sister named Paige.
</P>
<P>
   Music has always had a part in Pearson's life, and he plays bass
guitar in the Rock Bottom Remainders, the much-noticed garage band
that includes some of the country's best-selling authors (Stephen
King, Amy Tan, Dave Barry, Barbara Kingsolver) and has raised
$400,000 for charity.
</P>
<P>
   His recollection of his first meeting with other band members is
vintage Pearson: ``I thought it would be little old me with all of
them _ these guys are going to have egos the size of New York, and
I would cower in the corner. But they were all like brothers and
sisters, so normal, so wickedly bright and all so funny. We all
feed off each other. Some of my best friends now have come from
that band _ Dave Barry was even the best man at my wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Remainders hit the road again this fall for gigs in Denver,
Boston and Washington, D.C. It will be a time of considerable
change for Pearson. The writer and his family are moving to St.
Louis, although they will still spend summers in Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
   And after many disappointments from busted Hollywood deals, it
seems likely that Lou Boldt will finally be making it onto the
screen for a series of TV movies on the Arts &AMP; Entertainment
Network. Pearson hopes the two Boldt films a year will be shot in
Seattle, with Richard Dreyfuss probably in the title role (even if
Ed Harris looks more like Pearson's vision of Boldt).
</P>
<P>
   Whoever plays Boldt on film will probably never top what
happened when Pearson met Don Cameron, a veteran homicide sergeant
with Seattle police (since retired) whom the writer had admired and
gotten to interview with the assistance of a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   As Pearson recalled, ``I was buzzed into the homicide office,
and I stopped dead in my tracks _ Cameron looked that close to the
Lou Boldt I had imagined. I had an interview with him in an
interrogation room, and at its close, I said, `If I've stumbled or
gagged in this interview, please forgive me. It's just that you
bear an uncanny resemblance to my character.'
</P>
<P>
   ```I know,' Cameron responded, `I am Lou Boldt, Ridley. I've
read all those books.'''

 &HT;    Emory fest hosts author Dorothy Allison
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dorothy Allison isn't sure whether storytelling saved her life,
but she knows it saved her sanity.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in a world of poverty, violence and sexual abuse in
a Greenville, S.C., mill village. Her stepfather began raping her
when she was 5, she says, and for years she and her younger sisters
tried to find ways to kill him. ``You can leave pork chops out in
the sun, it won't kill him,'' she says. ``You can pour castor oil
in his tea, and it won't kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother was helpless to stop him, Allison says, because there
was no battered women's shelter, no money to flee, and no one
urging her to do anything other than try to be a good Baptist wife.
(Allison's mother is dead; her stepfather denies the abuse.)
</P>
<P>
   Allison coped with her nightmare by reading voraciously and
hiding under the porch, listening to the stories her aunts and
grandmother told. Laced with humor and bawdy details, these were
vivid accounts of family members who killed or were killed or drank
themselves to death.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Allison will tell students at Emory University's
Summer Writers' Institute and Festival how she turned the horrific
material of her life into award-winning fiction. For the first
time, the focus of the festival will be on the work of one writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, having several writers sometimes diluted the
focus,'' says institute Director Judson Mitcham. ``Dorothy
Allison's work is very powerful, and it evokes the atmosphere and
conflicts of the South very well. She has one of the strongest
voices of anyone writing about the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous writers at the summer festival have included Fred
Chappell, Shay Youngblood, Tony Grooms and Judith Ortiz Cofer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Storytelling can be a strategy to help you make sense of your
life,'' says Allison, 50, who finally escaped from her world of
poverty and violence when she won a scholarship to Florida
Presbyterian College.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, she still felt overwhelming shame, not because she
was an incest survivor and a lesbian, but because she had run away
from her family. Eventually she moved to Brooklyn, became involved
in the feminist movement and decided that the only way she could
write about her past was to confront it.
</P>
<P>
   The result was her acclaimed, semi-autobiographical ``Bastard
Out of Carolina,'' published in 1992 and later made into a Showtime
movie by Anjelica Huston. Ted Turner turned it down because of the
disturbing content, and ``Bastard Out of Carolina'' continues to
spark debate, Allison says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very forthright book on sexual violence, and there
aren't that many books that have been written about that,'' she
says. ``And it's written in an accessible style, so that teenagers
can read it. That disturbs a lot of people who don't want to
discuss the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison has become a magnet for young people who have come out
of abusive situations. They flock to her at book signings and write
her letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to listen,'' she says. ``I'm from the South, and when
somebody comes up to you crying, you have to listen. Mostly what
they want to do is tell me their story.''
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Bastard,'' Allison has written a memoir, ``Two or Three
Things I Know'' (1995), and a novel, ``Cavedweller'' (1998), about
an alcoholic rock singer who returns to her Georgia hometown to try
to make amends with the daughters she left behind. The novel is
being produced as an off-Broadway play.
</P>
<P>
   Allison is finishing another novel, ``She Who?'' the story of a
young woman who loses her memory after she is assaulted in a
parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about what happens in a family when you lose people, how
they have to adjust. ... I had a student, Earl, who was in a car
accident and was in a coma from head injuries. When I went to see
him, he was doing really well, but the Earl who had been a great
writer was not there. I found myself wondering what would happen in
that kind of situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Now living in San Francisco with her partner and their
8-year-old son, Allison says life is better for her these days. ``I
do miss the South _ the food, the people, the smell,'' she says.
``It just smells different.''

SIGHT UNSEEN: PAUL VERHOEVEN IS BACK WITH `HOLLOW MAN' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of director Paul Verhoeven on the set of
``Hollow Man.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It takes a tough man to make a tough movie.
 &HT;    So argues Paul Verhoeven, the director of such envelope-pushing
films as ``RoboCop'' (1987), ``Total Recall'' (1990), ``Basic
Instinct'' (1992), ``Showgirls'' (1995) and ``Starship Troopers''
(1997).
 &HT;    ``I'm supposed to be a hard taskmaster, and I am,'' Verhoeven
says in his still-thick Dutch accent. ``I'm described by people who
have worked with me as a man who tries to get as close to the edge
as possible without pushing people into the abyss.
 &HT;    ``I am trying very hard to reach the maximum of a movie, whether
it is science-fiction or sex or decadence or violence,'' he says.
``I have always done that, even in my early Dutch movies. There is
an element of provocation in that, because I'm trying to go where
other people aren't going.
 &HT;    ``There has been a tendency in the movies to embellish life and
portray it in a more principled way than the reality of life as we
know it,'' he adds. ``So filmmakers shy away from the sexual, from
the functions of the body, from violence.
 &HT;    ``The essential elements of our existence cannot be shown _ on
television in America you still can't show a person going to the
bathroom _ and that's absurd,'' Verhoeven continues. ``I show these
things. I don't sweeten it. I show it as I think it is, as I
perceive it.''
 &HT;    All of which ups the ante on the director's latest cinematic
gamble, ``Hollow Man,'' a variation on the ``Invisible Man'' saga.
Kevin Bacon stars in the Aug. 4 release as Sebastian Caine, a cocky
scientist working on a covert government project to develop an
invisibility serum. Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin play associates
who must stop Caine after he injects himself with the serum,
becomes invisible and, while losing more and more of his humanity
with each passing moment, takes full advantage of his new powers.
 &HT;    ``We abandon the idea that invisibility should be funny,''
Verhoeven says by telephone from a Los Angeles editing bay, where
he's putting the final touches on the film. ``So it plays more with
morality and with fear or danger or whatever word you want to use.
 &HT;    ``Honestly, the idea goes back to the time of Plato, and we
didn't even know that until very recently,'' the director adds.
``As a philosopher he wrote about invisibility, and he said that a
man who was invisible would steal left and right and, more
importantly, would enter everybody's house, rape the women, kill
the men or, if necessary, go into the prisons and free the men so
that all the criminals could run around.
 &HT;    ``Plato not only predicts what our movie will be about _ because
that is our theme _ he also tries to state why a human being would
behave that way,'' he says. ``For him, human beings in general
might naturally do such things, but they don't because of the
restraints society puts on us.
 &HT;    ``In other words,'' Verhoeven continues, ``if you could get away
with it, everybody would do it. The restraints would fall away,
because a man is only moral or just when society keeps an eye on
him. That theme, in its deepest sense, is what `Hollow Man' is
about.''
 &HT;    Films about invisible men are nothing new. But Verhoeven points
to advances in digital effects as his secret weapon in creating a
film the likes of which no one has ever, well, seen before.
 &HT;    ``The outstanding and most important reason why this movie could
be done at this moment _ and perhaps you could say should be done
at this moment _ is that we can do it,'' he says. ``All of the
amazing elements of how you can express invisibility or express an
invisible man are fun to play with.
 &HT;    ``You can shine a light through him and not see him, but if you
pour sand or water over him, you can see his form,'' Verhoeven says
animatedly. ``He's like a walking waterfall. This could not be done
before, and it can be done now. So I experimented with it and went
a step further than had been done before.
 &HT;    ``It goes beyond the T-1000 in `Terminator 2' (1991),'' the
director says. ``It goes beyond the dinosaurs in `Dinosaur' (2000).
We have almost 600 effects shots in `Hollow Man,' and the film
takes the element of digital possibility a step further.''
 &HT;    Verhoeven declares himself something of a reluctant sci-fi
specialist. He first won notoriety in America with ``RoboCop'' and
``Total Recall,'' then branched out with the suspense thriller
``Basic Instinct.'' However, he followed ``Basic Instinct'' with
the disastrous ``Showgirls,'' a universally maligned epic about Las
Vegas dancers, and had to return to the genre fold for ``Starship
Troopers.''
 &HT;    If ``Hollow Man'' proves solid at the box office, the
62-year-old Verhoeven can probably parlay that into another shot at
directing a more reality-based film. One story he'd like to tell is
that of Victoria Woodhull, the 19th-century feminist who was
America's first female presidential candidate.
 &HT;    ``She was a provocative, sexual and spiritual woman who was as
much a prostitute as she was a woman running for president,''
Verhoeven says. ``It's the first time I've found a person in
American history who would give me the responsibility to do in the
United States what I had been doing in Europe, where I was not
typecast as a special-effects or science-fiction director. I would
love to do something like that.''
 &HT;    Should that not work out, there are always the further
adventures of author/ice-pick wielder Catherine Tramell, Sharon
Stone's ice-queen character in ``Basic Instinct,'' to consider.
Stone recently signed on for a reprise, and the buzz is that
Verhoeven might do so, too.
 &HT;    ``I think it will be a great movie,'' he says, ``if I direct
it.''
 &HT;    Which is a big ``if.'' So, for the record, is Verhoeven actually
interested in ``Basic Instinct 2?''
 &HT;    ``If there's a great script and the conditions were perfect,
yes,'' he says. ``If not, no.''
 &HT;    Whatever happens, whatever Verhoeven's next film turns out to
be, don't expect him to go soft. After all, who'd want to see a
film by a mellow Paul Verhoeven? Certainly not Paul Verhoeven.
 &HT;    ``Some people would think they'd be less offensive,'' he says.
``Is that better? I don't know. They could lose their visceral
aspects. They could lose their energy.
 &HT;    ``I might even lose my motivation then,'' he says with a laugh.
``If that happened, I'd probably prefer to sit at home and read a
book.''

THE RIDING IS STILL EASY FOR PETER FONDA

 (Includes a color slide of Peter Fonda in a scene from ``Thomas and
the Magic Railroad.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Peter Fonda is riding again.
 &HT;    But 31 years after ``Easy Rider'' made him an icon, it's not a
Harley that he's gunning one stormy summer morning on his Montana
ranch. It's a power mower.
 &HT;    ``Hon, he's out there getting all dirty,'' Portia Crockett
Fonda, his wife of 28 years, tells a telephone caller. ``Let me go
round him up.''
 &HT;    If it's hard to believe that the one-time Captain America of
``Easy Rider'' (1969) has gone domestic, try this: The 61-year-old
counterculture icon's latest film is ``Thomas and the Magic
Railroad,'' opening July 26. And, yes, it's a kiddie picture.
 &HT;    ``I've always wanted to do a children's film,'' Fonda says.
``And basically I did this movie because lots of people only think
of me as Captain America smoking pot. But that's not me anymore.
I'm a parent and a grandparent.
 &HT;    ``Plus, inside I'm really an 8-year-old,'' he adds. ``I just
pretend to be this cool dude.''
 &HT;    After several lackluster decades, Fonda kicked his career back
into gear with an Oscar-nominated performance in ``Ulee's Gold''
(1997), then followed it up with solid work in ``The Passion of Ayn
Rand'' (1997) and ``The Limey'' (1999).
 &HT;    ``I feel like I've been given a second chance with my career,''
the actor says. ``I think part of it has to do with something going
on inside of me _ I honestly think it's all about getting hungry
again. And I'm starving for good parts.''
 &HT;    Another reason, he says, is that he's at a happier place in his
life, finally having come to terms with his place in the Fonda
acting dynasty as son of Henry, brother of Jane and father of
Bridget.
 &HT;    ``People get mixed up and think I'm living in the past,'' he
says. ``But honestly, I've gotten rid of the baggage by talking
about it. It doesn't bother me anymore.''
 &HT;    He remembers the first time he saw his father up on the big
screen.
 &HT;    ``I freaked out,'' he admits. ``I ran up to the screen and
pounded on it, yelling, `Daddy! Daddy!' My mother had to say,
`That's not your father. It's a character named Chad Hanna. Your
father is in the Pacific, fighting the war.'
 &HT;    ``I went home and looked at all the pictures of my father in our
house,'' Fonda recalls. ``I thought, `How did Chad get in those
pictures?' It was so confusing.
 &HT;    ``Then my father came home on a short leave from the service,
and his only son catches a glimpse of him and goes outside to hide
in the bushes.''
 &HT;    The elder Fonda was a remote, emotionally distant man who rarely
spoke to his children and was capable of going through with a
Broadway performance in 1950 only hours after learning that his
wife _ Peter's mother _ had killed herself.
 &HT;    ``We had no service, no funeral for my mother. We didn't talk
about it,'' Fonda says. ``It was like it didn't happen.''
 &HT;    Despite his difficulty relating to his father, the actor says,
they had come to terms by the time Henry Fonda died in 1982.
 &HT;    ``There's no more baggage _ it has been cleared away,'' he says.
``The last words my father said on this planet were `Son, I love
you very much.' So that was rather cool. I wasn't happy that he
died, but he was in pain and he didn't cotton to living that way.
And I'm glad, at the end, we came to some understanding.''
 &HT;    A gift from Crockett on his 35th birthday was a turning point
for Fonda.
 &HT;    ``This woman I eventually married gave me her childhood copy of
`Stuart Little,''' he recalls. ``She didn't know that my love of
Stuart was one of my biggest childhood fears. I refused to even
tell Jane that I loved Stuart, because I thought she would make fun
of me.
 &HT;    ``Stuart was my hero,'' Fonda says. ``He was born into a
seemingly normal family, but it was tough. He longed to be part of
a normal family. I felt like that mouse.''
 &HT;    That dogeared book told the actor all he needed to know.
 &HT;    ``I knew this was the person I was supposed to love for the rest
of my life,'' he says. ``Take one look at my wife, and you know
that I've got bragging rights here.''
 &HT;    His own past has given Fonda his share of ghosts, but nothing
too grim, he adds.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't an angel,'' he says. ``But I never had an addictive
personality. I never did cocaine. I watched too many friends get
addicted or die. I think I was rather lucky to escape those times
in one piece, because so many others lost so much.''
 &HT;    He's tried to have the kind of relationship with his children
that he always wished he had with his father, and has become
especially close to his daughter in recent years.
 &HT;    ``We're tough on each other,'' he says. ``We also listen. I'll
get a call from Bridget, who will say, `Dad, I've had it with that
makeup person! And if they put me in that water tank one more time,
I'll scream!'
 &HT;    ``Then she will say, `Oh, gosh, Dad, all I've been doing is
unloading on you,''' he says. ``I'll say, `My dear, who better to
unload on?'''
 &HT;    The Fondas gathered en masse at Jane's home in Atlanta for the
Fourth of July, and Peter Fonda reports that he put some concerted
effort into talking his sister into returning to moviemaking in the
wake of her impending divorce from media mogul Ted Turner.
 &HT;    ``The first move is already made,'' he says cheerfully. ``Jane
said she was interested in perhaps acting in a great play in
Atlanta _ that's just a hop and skip away from doing a film.
Bridget and I have both said we would love to work with her.
 &HT;    ``I'd want to direct her,'' Fonda adds. ``It would be really
stylin', right out there, for us Fondas to do a project together.''
 &HT;    As for Turner, Fonda doesn't have much to say.
 &HT;    ``I liked Ted. I'm kind of feeling `shame on him' now,'' Fonda
says, his voice heated for the first time all morning. ``I told
Ted, when he married my sister, how important it was for someone to
`be on Jane's bond.' That's a saying that means there's someone
there for you until the end.''
 &HT;    Family is the center of his own life, Fonda says. But that
doesn't mean that he's chained to his power mower. Every now and
then, he admits, he likes to get out onto the highway for some
serious biking.
 &HT;    ``If someone recognizes me on a Harley, they smile and wave,''
he says. ``They yell, `Keep doing it, man!'''
 &HT;    Still, no one is likely to mistake him for Captain America these
days.
 &HT;    ``I don't like to ride fast,'' he says. ``I like to cruise. I
take a fly rod, just in case I pass a brook that needs to be
fished. But I don't keep the fish _ I release them. Live and let
live, man.''
 &HT;    As for his career, don't ever expect Fonda to retire to Montana
once and for all.
 &HT;    ``I want to die hearing, `That's a wrap, buddy,''' the actor
says. ``I want people to whisper, `What happened to Fonda? Oh, he
died right when the curtain dropped and the show was over.'
 &HT;    ``Now, that's an exit.''

ROCKY ROAD: THE ALLMAN BROTHERS RIDE OUT ANOTHER STORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of the Allman Brothers Band, including
Jimmy Herring, Butch Trucks, Oteil Burbridge, Derek Trucks, Marc
Quinones, Jaimoe Johanson and Greg Allman.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    In ``Midnight Rider,'' one of its most popular songs, the Allman
Brothers Band boasts triumphantly that ``the road goes on
forever.'' But that doesn't mean the Southern rock band's road has
been a smooth one.
 &HT;    During the 31 years since its founding in Macon, Ga., the group
has withstood drug addictions, the deaths of founding members Duane
Allman and Berry Oakley, member defections and enough intraband
squabbling to make ``The Simpsons'' look like a functional family
unit. It also survived a near-decade of inactivity during the
1980s, before coming back together in 1989 for a reunion that's
lasted _ but not without its share of bumps.
 &HT;    The latest is the group's split, apparently intended to be
temporary, with guitarist Dickey Betts, whose past drug and
behavioral problems have led to previous hiatuses from the group.
 &HT;    The Allmans made the move in May, bringing in Jimmy Herring from
the band Aquarium Rescue Unit to take Betts' place for their
current summer tour.
 &HT;    Betts, meanwhile, reportedly plans to sue the group. Having only
received a fax stating that ``you have not been performing well and
our shows have been repeatedly disappointing to both us and our
fans as a result,'' the guitarist feels his bandmates _
particularly fellow founding members Gregg Allman, Butch Trucks and
Jaimoe Johanson _ owe him a better explanation.
 &HT;    In a posting on the group's Web site, Betts told fans that ``the
implication was that I was suffering from some sort of health or
drug problem. THIS IS TOTALLY, ABSOLUTELY UNFOUNDED!''
 &HT;    The rest of the band issued a brief public statement of support
for Betts, indicating a desire to have him back in the lineup at
some point. And singer/keyboardist Allman says that there's little
more to be said about the issue.
 &HT;    ``We still love him,'' the 52-year-old Allman says. ``He's still
our friend. It's nothing personal. I don't know _ maybe the road
got to be too much for him or something.''
 &HT;    Pressed a bit, Allman explains that Betts had become a divisive
personality within the group, and that his attitude had even
jeopardized this summer's tour.
 &HT;    ``If somebody's bummed out, it goes through the whole band like
a cancer,'' Allman says. ``Just about anybody that put in any kind
of suggestion, he had something to say about it. This had gone on
for a long, long time. I really hate to even go there, man.
 &HT;    ``Now, on to the music!''
 &HT;    On that front, Allman has a lot to say. The 38-year-old Herring,
he says, has injected new energy into a group that in recent years
has been driven by the youthful infusion of bassist Oteil
Burbridge, another Aquarium Rescue Unit member, and guitarist Derek
Trucks, drummer Butch Trucks' 21-year-old nephew.
 &HT;    ``I'm telling ya, it's smokin','' gushes Allman, who's been
clean and sober for nearly three years and recently replaced a
longtime cigarette habit with chewing gum. ``They bring youth and
vitality, of course _ that's the No. 1 thing. And a boatload of
talent.
 &HT;    ``These guys, at their ages ... '' He shakes his head in
wonderment. ``They play multiple instruments. When I was their age
I could whip out some Chuck Berry, maybe, and they can cut their
own demos! It took me awhile to get turned on to Coltrane and Miles
(Davis) and all these different jazz guys _ they listen to those
parts, and can just whip 'em out like that.''
 &HT;    As for Herring, he admits to feeling ``uneasy'' about stepping
in for Betts, who was a major influence on his playing. But the
chance to work with the Allmans was too good a chance to pass up.
 &HT;    ``It's about playing the music _ really, that's what it comes
down to,'' Herring says. ``It's great music. It's legendary music.
It's a chance for me to play with legendary musicians.
 &HT;    ``(The Allmans') albums, they were ringing through my house from
the time I can remember, from the earliest memories I have of
listening to music,'' he adds. ``I had two older brothers and they
were Allman Brothers fanatics, so I became one, too. That's what
made me want to pick up guitar in the first place.''
 &HT;    Herring says that, in the Allmans' new order, he's largely taken
Betts' role, while the younger Trucks covers Duane Allman's
territory, including the slide-guitar parts that were his
trademarks.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, Herring says that he and Trucks have felt free to
explore their own ideas and styles within the Allmans' framework.
 &HT;    That enthusiasm for the material has led the group to resurrect
``Mountain Jam,'' a lengthy, improvised piece that usually
stretches beyond a half-hour, meandering through solos and changes
in time and tempo. It was a staple of the Allmans' early shows, but
was laid aside after Duane Allman died in a 1971 motorcycle
accident.
 &HT;    Now, however, the song is back in the band's repertoire.
 &HT;    ``That was Butch's idea,'' Allman says. ``He said `Man, how many
times have we gone out there and heard somebody yell ``Play
`Mountain Jam!''' for the last 30 years?'
 &HT;    ``We have heard that for years,'' Allman says, ``and I don't
think it's the same guy following us around. So we decided to bring
it back. The first night, in Virginia Beach, we opened up with it,
and it was great _ I mean, people started hitting their cell phones
and calling their friends. It was something else.''
 &HT;    Though the band is freely dipping into the past for its current
repertoire, Allman says that he has his eye on the future.
 &HT;    ``It's definitely time for the Allman Brothers to get into the
studio again,'' says Allman, who has five children and plans to
marry his fiancee, Stacy Fountain, this fall, as well as do a solo
tour. The group members have been working on new material, he adds,
and have ``all kinds of songs'' ready, some of which occasionally
pop up in the live show.
 &HT;    Recording that music, Allman says, ``will all come to pass,
probably very soon.''
 &HT;    Assuming, of course, that no more bumps appear on the road.
 &HT;    ``Well, we do have to wait,'' Allman acknowledges. ``We have to
get everything sorted out before we go back into the studio. But
we're itching to do it, man. We really are.''

TRUE `BLUE': HENRY SIMMONS ADJUSTS TO LIFE ON `NYPD BLUE'

 (Includes a color slide of Henry Simmons in a scene from ``NYPD
Blue.'') 
 By KEN CARRIERE  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before July 30. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Born to be blue?
</P>
<P>
   Some television cops are born, others are made _ and to judge by
his childhood memories, ``NYPD Blue's'' Henry Simmons is one of the
former, a fact that has been apparent since he was 5 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember running around, pretending to be on a SWAT team,''
the 30-year-old, 6-foot-4-inch actor says. ``My favorite shows were
`Starsky and Hutch' and `S.W.A.T.,' which nobody remembers.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, Simmons is still running around and
pretending to be a cop, but he's got a lot more people watching.
Last season, he joined Steven Bochco's long-running police drama
``NYPD Blue'' as the mysterious Det. Baldwin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   So far, little has been revealed about Baldwin's background and
personal life, except that he's very even-tempered. That makes him
a natural contrast to series star Dennis Franz's character, the
explosive Det. Andy Sipowicz, but not all that far from the
levelheaded Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baldwin doesn't let anger rule him,'' Simmons says. ``I try to
live that way, as well. Adversity and hurdles challenge us and make
us stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, fresh out of college, Simmons landed a good
job with a prosperous financial firm. The only problem was, it took
only a week for him to realize that he wouldn't be happy in a Wall
Street career. He wasn't sure what he wanted to do _ only that
business wasn't it _ so on a whim, spurred by the pleasure he'd
gotten out of a college acting class, he decided to try his hand as
an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured, I'm young, I'm not married, I have no
responsibilities,'' he recalls. ``I'm gonna go for it!''
</P>
<P>
   Some early stage work led to Simmons' big-screen debut, in a bit
part in the not-especially-well-received basketball flick ``Above
the Rim'' (1994). Television proved more hospitable, however, with
guest spots on such series as ``New York Undercover'' and ``The
Cosby Mysteries'' giving the young actor hope that he could make a
go of his chosen profession.
</P>
<P>
   His first regular gig followed not long afterward _ a recurring
role on the popular daytime soap opera ``Another World.'' He stayed
for two years, until he got the chance to move into prime time with
``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing Baldwin Jones wasn't a slam dunk, however. It isn't easy
to join an established show, vying for writers' attention with fan
favorites such as Franz. Moreover, Simmons found himself under
something of a microscope, because he was stepping into the shoes
of another fan favorite, Nicholas Turturro, who had left the show
after a full six seasons on duty.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the actor says, the esprit de corps of the ``NYPD
Blue'' cast helped. It didn't hurt that Rick Schroder's
near-simultaneous arrival, stepping in for the departing Jimmy
Smits, took some of the heat off Simmons. Furthermore, the show's
producers and cast were used to the problems of assimilating new
actors, and went out of their way to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I wasn't nervous at all,'' Simmons says. ``My fellow
cast members helped me along.''
</P>
<P>
   Solidly in his corner was Franz, who has played the troubled
Sipowicz since the show debuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is like a family here,'' Simmons says, ``and Dennis
is the center of it. He just exudes confidence, and there's
something paternal about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since its first episode, ``NYPD Blue'' has been the edgiest
series on network television, with nudity and very gritty story
lines, not to mention a large cast whose complicated histories
aren't easy to keep straight. It's a tough show for an actor to
integrate himself into, but Simmons feels he's succeeded in doing
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of that,'' he says. ``You can't be a casual viewer _
you really have to be vested in the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   As was the case last year, the next season of ``NYPD Blue''
won't begin until January 2001. Last season, ABC's decision to push
the show back to make room for ``Once and Again'' _ which became a
hit _ prompted threats and posturing on both sides, with producer
Bochco going so far as to talk of taking the show to a different
network.
</P>
<P>
   However, a two-year ABC renewal has soothed feelings on both
sides, and now Simmons views the entire experience positively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it worked out, it was to our benefit,'' the actor
says. ``We would go through 22 episodes in 22 weeks, without

SIGHT UNSEEN: PAUL VERHOEVEN IS BACK WITH `HOLLOW MAN'

 (Includes a color slide of director Paul Verhoeven on the set of
``Hollow Man.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It takes a tough man to make a tough movie.
 &HT;    So argues Paul Verhoeven, the director of such envelope-pushing
films as ``RoboCop'' (1987), ``Total Recall'' (1990), ``Basic
Instinct'' (1992), ``Showgirls'' (1995) and ``Starship Troopers''
(1997).
 &HT;    ``I'm supposed to be a hard taskmaster, and I am,'' Verhoeven
says in his still-thick Dutch accent. ``I'm described by people who
have worked with me as a man who tries to get as close to the edge
as possible without pushing people into the abyss.
 &HT;    ``I am trying very hard to reach the maximum of a movie, whether
it is science-fiction or sex or decadence or violence,'' he says.
``I have always done that, even in my early Dutch movies. There is
an element of provocation in that, because I'm trying to go where
other people aren't going.
 &HT;    ``There has been a tendency in the movies to embellish life and
portray it in a more principled way than the reality of life as we
know it,'' he adds. ``So filmmakers shy away from the sexual, from
the functions of the body, from violence.
 &HT;    ``The essential elements of our existence cannot be shown _ on
television in America you still can't show a person going to the
bathroom _ and that's absurd,'' Verhoeven continues. ``I show these
things. I don't sweeten it. I show it as I think it is, as I
perceive it.''
 &HT;    All of which ups the ante on the director's latest cinematic
gamble, ``Hollow Man,'' a variation on the ``Invisible Man'' saga.
Kevin Bacon stars in the Aug. 4 release as Sebastian Caine, a cocky
scientist working on a covert government project to develop an
invisibility serum. Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin play associates
who must stop Caine after he injects himself with the serum,
becomes invisible and, while losing more and more of his humanity
with each passing moment, takes full advantage of his new powers.
 &HT;    ``We abandon the idea that invisibility should be funny,''
Verhoeven says by telephone from a Los Angeles editing bay, where
he's putting the final touches on the film. ``So it plays more with
morality and with fear or danger or whatever word you want to use.
 &HT;    ``Honestly, the idea goes back to the time of Plato, and we
didn't even know that until very recently,'' the director adds.
``As a philosopher he wrote about invisibility, and he said that a
man who was invisible would steal left and right and, more
importantly, would enter everybody's house, rape the women, kill
the men or, if necessary, go into the prisons and free the men so
that all the criminals could run around.
 &HT;    ``Plato not only predicts what our movie will be about _ because
that is our theme _ he also tries to state why a human being would
behave that way,'' he says. ``For him, human beings in general
might naturally do such things, but they don't because of the
restraints society puts on us.
 &HT;    ``In other words,'' Verhoeven continues, ``if you could get away
with it, everybody would do it. The restraints would fall away,
because a man is only moral or just when society keeps an eye on
him. That theme, in its deepest sense, is what `Hollow Man' is
about.''
 &HT;    Films about invisible men are nothing new. But Verhoeven points
to advances in digital effects as his secret weapon in creating a
film the likes of which no one has ever, well, seen before.
 &HT;    ``The outstanding and most important reason why this movie could
be done at this moment _ and perhaps you could say should be done
at this moment _ is that we can do it,'' he says. ``All of the
amazing elements of how you can express invisibility or express an
invisible man are fun to play with.
 &HT;    ``You can shine a light through him and not see him, but if you
pour sand or water over him, you can see his form,'' Verhoeven says
animatedly. ``He's like a walking waterfall. This could not be done
before, and it can be done now. So I experimented with it and went
a step further than had been done before.
 &HT;    ``It goes beyond the T-1000 in `Terminator 2' (1991),'' the
director says. ``It goes beyond the dinosaurs in `Dinosaur' (2000).
We have almost 600 effects shots in `Hollow Man,' and the film
takes the element of digital possibility a step further.''
 &HT;    Verhoeven declares himself something of a reluctant sci-fi
specialist. He first won notoriety in America with ``RoboCop'' and
``Total Recall,'' then branched out with the suspense thriller
``Basic Instinct.'' However, he followed ``Basic Instinct'' with
the disastrous ``Showgirls,'' a universally maligned epic about Las
Vegas dancers, and had to return to the genre fold for ``Starship
Troopers.''
 &HT;    If ``Hollow Man'' proves solid at the box office, the
62-year-old Verhoeven can probably parlay that into another shot at
directing a more reality-based film. One story he'd like to tell is
that of Victoria Woodhull, the 19th-century feminist who was
America's first female presidential candidate.
 &HT;    ``She was a provocative, sexual and spiritual woman who was as
much a prostitute as she was a woman running for president,''
Verhoeven says. ``It's the first time I've found a person in
American history who would give me the responsibility to do in the
United States what I had been doing in Europe, where I was not
typecast as a special-effects or science-fiction director. I would
love to do something like that.''
 &HT;    Should that not work out, there are always the further
adventures of author/ice-pick wielder Catherine Tramell, Sharon
Stone's ice-queen character in ``Basic Instinct,'' to consider.
Stone recently signed on for a reprise, and the buzz is that
Verhoeven might do so, too.
 &HT;    ``I think it will be a great movie,'' he says, ``if I direct
it.''
 &HT;    Which is a big ``if.'' So, for the record, is Verhoeven actually
interested in ``Basic Instinct 2?''
 &HT;    ``If there's a great script and the conditions were perfect,
yes,'' he says. ``If not, no.''
 &HT;    Whatever happens, whatever Verhoeven's next film turns out to
be, don't expect him to go soft. After all, who'd want to see a
film by a mellow Paul Verhoeven? Certainly not Paul Verhoeven.
 &HT;    ``Some people would think they'd be less offensive,'' he says.
``Is that better? I don't know. They could lose their visceral
aspects. They could lose their energy.
 &HT;    ``I might even lose my motivation then,'' he says with a laugh.
``If that happened, I'd probably prefer to sit at home and read a
book.''

THE RIDING IS STILL EASY FOR PETER FONDA 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Peter Fonda in a scene from ``Thomas and
the Magic Railroad.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Peter Fonda is riding again.
 &HT;    But 31 years after ``Easy Rider'' made him an icon, it's not a
Harley that he's gunning one stormy summer morning on his Montana
ranch. It's a power mower.
 &HT;    ``Hon, he's out there getting all dirty,'' Portia Crockett
Fonda, his wife of 28 years, tells a telephone caller. ``Let me go
round him up.''
 &HT;    If it's hard to believe that the one-time Captain America of
``Easy Rider'' (1969) has gone domestic, try this: The 61-year-old
counterculture icon's latest film is ``Thomas and the Magic
Railroad,'' opening July 26. And, yes, it's a kiddie picture.
 &HT;    ``I've always wanted to do a children's film,'' Fonda says.
``And basically I did this movie because lots of people only think
of me as Captain America smoking pot. But that's not me anymore.
I'm a parent and a grandparent.
 &HT;    ``Plus, inside I'm really an 8-year-old,'' he adds. ``I just
pretend to be this cool dude.''
 &HT;    After several lackluster decades, Fonda kicked his career back
into gear with an Oscar-nominated performance in ``Ulee's Gold''
(1997), then followed it up with solid work in ``The Passion of Ayn
Rand'' (1997) and ``The Limey'' (1999).
 &HT;    ``I feel like I've been given a second chance with my career,''
the actor says. ``I think part of it has to do with something going
on inside of me _ I honestly think it's all about getting hungry
again. And I'm starving for good parts.''
 &HT;    Another reason, he says, is that he's at a happier place in his
life, finally having come to terms with his place in the Fonda
acting dynasty as son of Henry, brother of Jane and father of
Bridget.
 &HT;    ``People get mixed up and think I'm living in the past,'' he
says. ``But honestly, I've gotten rid of the baggage by talking
about it. It doesn't bother me anymore.''
 &HT;    He remembers the first time he saw his father up on the big
screen.
 &HT;    ``I freaked out,'' he admits. ``I ran up to the screen and
pounded on it, yelling, `Daddy! Daddy!' My mother had to say,
`That's not your father. It's a character named Chad Hanna. Your
father is in the Pacific, fighting the war.'
 &HT;    ``I went home and looked at all the pictures of my father in our
house,'' Fonda recalls. ``I thought, `How did Chad get in those
pictures?' It was so confusing.
 &HT;    ``Then my father came home on a short leave from the service,
and his only son catches a glimpse of him and goes outside to hide
in the bushes.''
 &HT;    The elder Fonda was a remote, emotionally distant man who rarely
spoke to his children and was capable of going through with a
Broadway performance in 1950 only hours after learning that his
wife _ Peter's mother _ had killed herself.
 &HT;    ``We had no service, no funeral for my mother. We didn't talk
about it,'' Fonda says. ``It was like it didn't happen.''
 &HT;    Despite his difficulty relating to his father, the actor says,
they had come to terms by the time Henry Fonda died in 1982.
 &HT;    ``There's no more baggage _ it has been cleared away,'' he says.
``The last words my father said on this planet were `Son, I love
you very much.' So that was rather cool. I wasn't happy that he
died, but he was in pain and he didn't cotton to living that way.
And I'm glad, at the end, we came to some understanding.''
 &HT;    A gift from Crockett on his 35th birthday was a turning point
for Fonda.
 &HT;    ``This woman I eventually married gave me her childhood copy of
`Stuart Little,''' he recalls. ``She didn't know that my love of
Stuart was one of my biggest childhood fears. I refused to even
tell Jane that I loved Stuart, because I thought she would make fun
of me.
 &HT;    ``Stuart was my hero,'' Fonda says. ``He was born into a
seemingly normal family, but it was tough. He longed to be part of
a normal family. I felt like that mouse.''
 &HT;    That dogeared book told the actor all he needed to know.
 &HT;    ``I knew this was the person I was supposed to love for the rest
of my life,'' he says. ``Take one look at my wife, and you know
that I've got bragging rights here.''
 &HT;    His own past has given Fonda his share of ghosts, but nothing
too grim, he adds.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't an angel,'' he says. ``But I never had an addictive
personality. I never did cocaine. I watched too many friends get
addicted or die. I think I was rather lucky to escape those times
in one piece, because so many others lost so much.''
 &HT;    He's tried to have the kind of relationship with his children
that he always wished he had with his father, and has become
especially close to his daughter in recent years.
 &HT;    ``We're tough on each other,'' he says. ``We also listen. I'll
get a call from Bridget, who will say, `Dad, I've had it with that
makeup person! And if they put me in that water tank one more time,
I'll scream!'
 &HT;    ``Then she will say, `Oh, gosh, Dad, all I've been doing is
unloading on you,''' he says. ``I'll say, `My dear, who better to
unload on?'''
 &HT;    The Fondas gathered en masse at Jane's home in Atlanta for the
Fourth of July, and Peter Fonda reports that he put some concerted
effort into talking his sister into returning to moviemaking in the
wake of her impending divorce from media mogul Ted Turner.
 &HT;    ``The first move is already made,'' he says cheerfully. ``Jane
said she was interested in perhaps acting in a great play in
Atlanta _ that's just a hop and skip away from doing a film.
Bridget and I have both said we would love to work with her.
 &HT;    ``I'd want to direct her,'' Fonda adds. ``It would be really
stylin', right out there, for us Fondas to do a project together.''
 &HT;    As for Turner, Fonda doesn't have much to say.
 &HT;    ``I liked Ted. I'm kind of feeling `shame on him' now,'' Fonda
says, his voice heated for the first time all morning. ``I told
Ted, when he married my sister, how important it was for someone to
`be on Jane's bond.' That's a saying that means there's someone
there for you until the end.''
 &HT;    Family is the center of his own life, Fonda says. But that
doesn't mean that he's chained to his power mower. Every now and
then, he admits, he likes to get out onto the highway for some
serious biking.
 &HT;    ``If someone recognizes me on a Harley, they smile and wave,''
he says. ``They yell, `Keep doing it, man!'''
 &HT;    Still, no one is likely to mistake him for Captain America these
days.
 &HT;    ``I don't like to ride fast,'' he says. ``I like to cruise. I
take a fly rod, just in case I pass a brook that needs to be
fished. But I don't keep the fish _ I release them. Live and let
live, man.''
 &HT;    As for his career, don't ever expect Fonda to retire to Montana
once and for all.
 &HT;    ``I want to die hearing, `That's a wrap, buddy,''' the actor
says. ``I want people to whisper, `What happened to Fonda? Oh, he
died right when the curtain dropped and the show was over.'
 &HT;    ``Now, that's an exit.''

ROCKY ROAD: THE ALLMAN BROTHERS RIDE OUT ANOTHER STORM 
</HEADLINE>

 (Includes a color slide of the Allman Brothers Band, including
Jimmy Herring, Butch Trucks, Oteil Burbridge, Derek Trucks, Marc
Quinones, Jaimoe Johanson and Greg Allman.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    In ``Midnight Rider,'' one of its most popular songs, the Allman
Brothers Band boasts triumphantly that ``the road goes on
forever.'' But that doesn't mean the Southern rock band's road has
been a smooth one.
 &HT;    During the 31 years since its founding in Macon, Ga., the group
has withstood drug addictions, the deaths of founding members Duane
Allman and Berry Oakley, member defections and enough intraband
squabbling to make ``The Simpsons'' look like a functional family
unit. It also survived a near-decade of inactivity during the
1980s, before coming back together in 1989 for a reunion that's
lasted _ but not without its share of bumps.
 &HT;    The latest is the group's split, apparently intended to be
temporary, with guitarist Dickey Betts, whose past drug and
behavioral problems have led to previous hiatuses from the group.
 &HT;    The Allmans made the move in May, bringing in Jimmy Herring from
the band Aquarium Rescue Unit to take Betts' place for their
current summer tour.
 &HT;    Betts, meanwhile, reportedly plans to sue the group. Having only
received a fax stating that ``you have not been performing well and
our shows have been repeatedly disappointing to both us and our
fans as a result,'' the guitarist feels his bandmates _
particularly fellow founding members Gregg Allman, Butch Trucks and
Jaimoe Johanson _ owe him a better explanation.
 &HT;    In a posting on the group's Web site, Betts told fans that ``the
implication was that I was suffering from some sort of health or
drug problem. THIS IS TOTALLY, ABSOLUTELY UNFOUNDED!''
 &HT;    The rest of the band issued a brief public statement of support
for Betts, indicating a desire to have him back in the lineup at
some point. And singer/keyboardist Allman says that there's little
more to be said about the issue.
 &HT;    ``We still love him,'' the 52-year-old Allman says. ``He's still
our friend. It's nothing personal. I don't know _ maybe the road
got to be too much for him or something.''
 &HT;    Pressed a bit, Allman explains that Betts had become a divisive
personality within the group, and that his attitude had even
jeopardized this summer's tour.
 &HT;    ``If somebody's bummed out, it goes through the whole band like
a cancer,'' Allman says. ``Just about anybody that put in any kind
of suggestion, he had something to say about it. This had gone on
for a long, long time. I really hate to even go there, man.
 &HT;    ``Now, on to the music!''
 &HT;    On that front, Allman has a lot to say. The 38-year-old Herring,
he says, has injected new energy into a group that in recent years
has been driven by the youthful infusion of bassist Oteil
Burbridge, another Aquarium Rescue Unit member, and guitarist Derek
Trucks, drummer Butch Trucks' 21-year-old nephew.
 &HT;    ``I'm telling ya, it's smokin','' gushes Allman, who's been
clean and sober for nearly three years and recently replaced a
longtime cigarette habit with chewing gum. ``They bring youth and
vitality, of course _ that's the No. 1 thing. And a boatload of
talent.
 &HT;    ``These guys, at their ages ... '' He shakes his head in
wonderment. ``They play multiple instruments. When I was their age
I could whip out some Chuck Berry, maybe, and they can cut their
own demos! It took me awhile to get turned on to Coltrane and Miles
(Davis) and all these different jazz guys _ they listen to those
parts, and can just whip 'em out like that.''
 &HT;    As for Herring, he admits to feeling ``uneasy'' about stepping
in for Betts, who was a major influence on his playing. But the
chance to work with the Allmans was too good a chance to pass up.
 &HT;    ``It's about playing the music _ really, that's what it comes
down to,'' Herring says. ``It's great music. It's legendary music.
It's a chance for me to play with legendary musicians.
 &HT;    ``(The Allmans') albums, they were ringing through my house from
the time I can remember, from the earliest memories I have of
listening to music,'' he adds. ``I had two older brothers and they
were Allman Brothers fanatics, so I became one, too. That's what
made me want to pick up guitar in the first place.''
 &HT;    Herring says that, in the Allmans' new order, he's largely taken
Betts' role, while the younger Trucks covers Duane Allman's
territory, including the slide-guitar parts that were his
trademarks.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, Herring says that he and Trucks have felt free to
explore their own ideas and styles within the Allmans' framework.
 &HT;    That enthusiasm for the material has led the group to resurrect
``Mountain Jam,'' a lengthy, improvised piece that usually
stretches beyond a half-hour, meandering through solos and changes
in time and tempo. It was a staple of the Allmans' early shows, but
was laid aside after Duane Allman died in a 1971 motorcycle
accident.
 &HT;    Now, however, the song is back in the band's repertoire.
 &HT;    ``That was Butch's idea,'' Allman says. ``He said `Man, how many
times have we gone out there and heard somebody yell ``Play
`Mountain Jam!''' for the last 30 years?'
 &HT;    ``We have heard that for years,'' Allman says, ``and I don't
think it's the same guy following us around. So we decided to bring
it back. The first night, in Virginia Beach, we opened up with it,
and it was great _ I mean, people started hitting their cell phones
and calling their friends. It was something else.''
 &HT;    Though the band is freely dipping into the past for its current
repertoire, Allman says that he has his eye on the future.
 &HT;    ``It's definitely time for the Allman Brothers to get into the
studio again,'' says Allman, who has five children and plans to
marry his fiancee, Stacy Fountain, this fall, as well as do a solo
tour. The group members have been working on new material, he adds,
and have ``all kinds of songs'' ready, some of which occasionally
pop up in the live show.
 &HT;    Recording that music, Allman says, ``will all come to pass,
probably very soon.''
 &HT;    Assuming, of course, that no more bumps appear on the road.
 &HT;    ``Well, we do have to wait,'' Allman acknowledges. ``We have to
get everything sorted out before we go back into the studio. But
we're itching to do it, man. We really are.''

 &HT;    Entertaining convention delegates falls to Big Business
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - It'll be party time in more ways than one when the
Republicans meet in Philadelphia and the Democrats in Los Angeles.
Because the nominees of each political party already are shoo-ins,
entertaining the delegates becomes the No. 1 priority of convention
planners, Business Week (July 24) says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is Big Business coughing up most of the $95 million
that Philadelphia and Los Angeles need to put on the conventions,
but it's also shelling out millions to host hundreds of
invitation-only bashes that give execs and lobbyists face time with
elected officials and power brokers,'' the magazine reports.
</P>
<P>
   To Common Cause and other watchdog groups, the conventions have
evolved into the Super Bowl of Lobbying, well out of the public
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Looking abroad
</P>
<P>
   After five fat years, we finally see that markets also go down,
Money (August) says in its midyear investing guide. Since tech
stocks have fizzled, the best places to look for winners in the
next round of stock investing are overseas and in wireless
technology, Money says.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual Funds (August) agrees in its midyear forecast, suggesting
that ``as the new century unfolds, the focus on hot funds may be
spinning toward Europe. Germany's Deutsche European Equity was the
No. 1 mutual fund in the first quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Wild, wild Wall Street
</P>
<P>
   The worst that most financial analysts get when they lower their
stock ratings or earnings forecasts is a growl of disappointment
from shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But Barron's (July 17) says Jonathan Joseph of Salomon Smith
Barney got a more hostile response after he lowered his forecast
for popular semiconductor stocks _ a series of death threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, the folks at Salomon took the threats rather
lightheartedly,'' says Barron's. ``But the eerie e-mail and
telephone messages persisted, and giggles gave way to bodyguards.''
</P>
<P>
   The millennial generation
</P>
<P>
   The newest generation _ the millennial, which began in the 1980s
_ has grown up with prosperity, the Internet, high divorce rates
and high school violence. And according to a Fortune (July 31)
survey, they don't want to live or work the way their parents do.
</P>
<P>
   They ``assume that jobs and money will be available as needed
and that they will be able to indulge in luxury that few of their
parents could; they don't want to be consumed by work ... and they
view their friends as their strongest role models and support
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoils to the winners
</P>
<P>
   Smart Business (August), meanwhile, has found role models for
Fortune's millenial generation: stock market winners.
</P>
<P>
   The market has created more than $8 trillion in wealth during
the past five years. So what are these new millionaires and
billionaires spending it on? On $300,000 watches, $95,000 Cellini
sapphire brooches and $4,000 bottles of champagne, among other
``toys for the super rich,'' the magazine says.

Blue.'')

 Not to be published in Canada before July 30.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Born to be blue?
</P>
<P>
   Some television cops are born, others are made _ and to judge by
his childhood memories, ``NYPD Blue's'' Henry Simmons is one of the
former, a fact that has been apparent since he was 5 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember running around, pretending to be on a SWAT team,''
the 30-year-old, 6-foot-4-inch actor says. ``My favorite shows were
`Starsky and Hutch' and `S.W.A.T.,' which nobody remembers.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, Simmons is still running around and
pretending to be a cop, but he's got a lot more people watching.
Last season, he joined Steven Bochco's long-running police drama
``NYPD Blue'' as the mysterious Det. Baldwin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   So far, little has been revealed about Baldwin's background and
personal life, except that he's very even-tempered. That makes him
a natural contrast to series star Dennis Franz's character, the
explosive Det. Andy Sipowicz, but not all that far from the
levelheaded Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baldwin doesn't let anger rule him,'' Simmons says. ``I try to
live that way, as well. Adversity and hurdles challenge us and make
us stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, fresh out of college, Simmons landed a good
job with a prosperous financial firm. The only problem was, it took
only a week for him to realize that he wouldn't be happy in a Wall
Street career. He wasn't sure what he wanted to do _ only that
business wasn't it _ so on a whim, spurred by the pleasure he'd
gotten out of a college acting class, he decided to try his hand as
an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured, I'm young, I'm not married, I have no
responsibilities,'' he recalls. ``I'm gonna go for it!''
</P>
<P>
   Some early stage work led to Simmons' big-screen debut, in a bit
part in the not-especially-well-received basketball flick ``Above
the Rim'' (1994). Television proved more hospitable, however, with
guest spots on such series as ``New York Undercover'' and ``The
Cosby Mysteries'' giving the young actor hope that he could make a
go of his chosen profession.
</P>
<P>
   His first regular gig followed not long afterward _ a recurring
role on the popular daytime soap opera ``Another World.'' He stayed
for two years, until he got the chance to move into prime time with
``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing Baldwin Jones wasn't a slam dunk, however. It isn't easy
to join an established show, vying for writers' attention with fan
favorites such as Franz. Moreover, Simmons found himself under
something of a microscope, because he was stepping into the shoes
of another fan favorite, Nicholas Turturro, who had left the show
after a full six seasons on duty.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the actor says, the esprit de corps of the ``NYPD
Blue'' cast helped. It didn't hurt that Rick Schroder's
near-simultaneous arrival, stepping in for the departing Jimmy
Smits, took some of the heat off Simmons. Furthermore, the show's
producers and cast were used to the problems of assimilating new
actors, and went out of their way to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I wasn't nervous at all,'' Simmons says. ``My fellow
cast members helped me along.''
</P>
<P>
   Solidly in his corner was Franz, who has played the troubled
Sipowicz since the show debuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is like a family here,'' Simmons says, ``and Dennis
is the center of it. He just exudes confidence, and there's
something paternal about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since its first episode, ``NYPD Blue'' has been the edgiest
series on network television, with nudity and very gritty story
lines, not to mention a large cast whose complicated histories
aren't easy to keep straight. It's a tough show for an actor to
integrate himself into, but Simmons feels he's succeeded in doing
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of that,'' he says. ``You can't be a casual viewer _
you really have to be vested in the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   As was the case last year, the next season of ``NYPD Blue''
won't begin until January 2001. Last season, ABC's decision to push
the show back to make room for ``Once and Again'' _ which became a
hit _ prompted threats and posturing on both sides, with producer
Bochco going so far as to talk of taking the show to a different
network.
</P>
<P>
   However, a two-year ABC renewal has soothed feelings on both
sides, and now Simmons views the entire experience positively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it worked out, it was to our benefit,'' the actor
says. ``We would go through 22 episodes in 22 weeks, without
reruns. Often `NYPD Blue' was the only show on that wasn't a rerun
_ which may have helped the series to its best ratings since
1996-97.''

MARCUS OLIPHANT, KEY FIGURE IN ATOM BOMB CREATION, DIES AT 98 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marcus Oliphant, Australia's leading nuclear physicist and a key
figure in the making of the atom bomb _ a creation he came to
loathe _ died Friday in Canberra. He was 98.
</P>
<P>
   Oliphant entered the field in England under the guidance of
Ernest Rutherford, director of the famous Cavendish Laboratory at
Cambridge University, where the atom was first split by
artificially accelerated particles in 1932. The center was a world
leader in nuclear and experimental physics. Oliphant, known as
Mark, became its assistant director of research in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   He investigated nuclear disintegration and made his reputation
with the design of heavy high-voltage apparatus. With the equipment
he was able to produce intense beams of protons and of the nuclei
of heavy hydrogen, and then study their interactions with light
nuclei.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer intensity of the beams made it possible for him to
study such events at far lower voltages than had been required
before. Particularly significant was his work with the lithium
nucleus, in which he separated the two lithium isotopes by
electromagnetic means.
</P>
<P>
   Working as a team, he, Rutherford and Paul Harteck drew
worldwide attention to Cavendish in 1934 when they discovered a
third type of hydrogen. Known as triple-weight hydrogen, or
tritium, its existence had been suspected, but it took them and
their atom smasher to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Oliphant was named director of the physics laboratories and a
professor of physics at Birmingham University in 1937, posts he
filled until 1950. He first visited America in 1941 in connection
with his work on what became radar. In 1943, he was chosen to lead
a group of British scientists to the United States to share their
advanced knowledge of nuclear physics with American colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The group joined the profoundly secret workings of the Manhattan
Project, which built the bombs dropped in 1945 on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, ending the war against Japan. The reality of such bombs
destroying whole cities and their people so horrified Oliphant that
he was to observe later that his part in their creation had made
him a ``war criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of his life he pressed for the peaceful use of
atomic energy and spoke out against all weapons capable of mass
destruction. Starting in 1945 he insisted that the world must ``get
rid of war or die,'' and that the use of nuclear arms would be a
``moral crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Using nuclear weapons, he said, was ``a dirty, rotten way to
kill people'' that could not be justified ``in any circumstances,''
even in retaliation. The West, he said in 1950, was ``foolish'' to
engage in a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The next year he was blocked from attending a conference in
Chicago. His visa application had not been rejected, but no visa
was forthcoming, a predicament he shared with the author Graham
Greene and Ernest Chain, who won the Nobel Prize for his work on
penicillin.
</P>
<P>
   All three appeared to have run afoul of the 1950 McCarran
Internal Security Act, and passport authorities were still mulling
over their cases while their travel dates came and went. Because of
these cases, Congress modified the act to spare the United States
the embarrassment of similar visa troubles and the headlines they
prompted.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Laurence Elwin Oliphant was born in Adelaide in South
Australia on Oct. 10, 1901. He graduated with honors from Adelaide
University in 1927 and received a Ph.D. from Trinity College at
Cambridge in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   After he returned to Australia in 1950 he directed the Research
School of Physical Sciences at the fledgling Australian National
University until 1963, then headed the university's research unit
on ionized gases. He also was chairman of a committee that advised
the Australian government on the development of nuclear power
stations.
</P>
<P>
   He was a founder and past president of the Australian Academy of
Sciences. In recognition of his accomplishments, he was appointed
governor of the state of South Australia in 1971, a ceremonial post
he held until 1976. Britain named him a knight of the British
Empire in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Oliphant's wife, Rosa Wilbraham Oliphant, died in 1987 after 52
years of marriage. He is survived by a daughter, Vivian Wilson;
three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   His biographer, David Ellyard, said in Australia that his role
in the Manhattan Project never gave him peace. ``There was that
pride of achievement and shame of being associated with it,'' he
said in a radio interview there. ``Those contradictions, I think,
remained with him until the end.''

   EMAIL-PRIVACY-REGULATE (Washington) _ With concern growing among
lawmakers and privacy groups about a new FBI system that easily
intercepts and searches private e-mail, the White House on Monday
proposed legislation to set legal standards for surveillance in
cyberspace similar to those required for telephone wiretaps. By
Stephen Labaton and Matt Richtel.

<P>
   MIDEAST-TALKS (Thurmont, Md.) _ As the Camp David peace summit
meeting moved closer to the supposed deadline of President
Clinton's Wednesday morning departure for Japan, the White House
remained officially committed Monday to reaching ``an agreement''
before then. But some U.S., Israeli and Palestinian officials began
deliberately lowering expectations for a breakthrough, even
suggesting that there may need to be additional summit meetings. By

   INTERNET-BOOKS (Undated) _ The Frommer's guide to France may be
made up of chapters and maps, but most readers know it as an
indivisible and coherent whole: a book. This fall, that book and a
few hundred others will take a new form on the Internet. They will
be sold in component parts _ chapters, maps and even paragraphs _
that can be mixed and matched. Readers will be invited to create
customized books by picking pieces of content a la carte from an
array of already-published guides. Buyers will have the option of
receiving their books electronically or ordering them printed,
bound and delivered to their door. By Lisa Guernsey.

</P>
<P>
   BUSH-ABORTION-VEEP (Washington) _ When George W. Bush is asked
what factors he is seeking in his running-mate, he talks about
things like preparedness to be president and compatibility. But he
never mentions the one factor that several of his advisers say is
hovering over his entire selection process: abortion. This is the
first presidential campaign in which the Republican candidate can
talk about picking a running mate who supports abortion rights and
not be laughed off stage. By Richard L. Berke.

<P>
   NY-HAMPTONS-WEALTH (Southampton, N.Y.) _ Based on the frenzied
pace of speculative construction here this summer and the frazzled
lives of craftsmen doing the building, the Hamptons have never
before been invaded by so many rich people wanting to be wowed and
demanding that it happen fast. The invasion has jacked construction
costs to record levels, seduced builders, architects and even
carpenters to build houses on ``spec,'' choked roads with commuting
workmen and encouraged subcontractors to insist on bonuses merely
for showing up on time. It also has enriched and exhausted nearly
everyone willing to drive a nail, paint a wall or dig a swimming
pool. By Blaine Harden.

<P>
   NY-APPLE-GROWERS (Milton, N.Y.) _ Poor weather and a number of
economic forces, from depressed apple prices to spotty insurance
coverage to consumer demand for flawless fruit, have pushed New
York's Hudson Valley apple farmers to the brink. Many are wondering
aloud whether the 10-minute hail bursts in May and June will be the
straws that finally broke them _ and in the process altering an
austere landscape of gnarled trees and open sky forever. As the
apple growers band together to ask the federal government for
direct cash assistance of $20 million to cover their losses, they
are talking as much about open space and suburban sprawl as
agriculture, speaking a language they know resonates with
politicians, tourists and the many owners of weekend houses here in
Ulster County, the second largest apple producing county in the
state. By Lisa W. Foderaro.

 &HT;    Coke plans line of clothing in Europe to drive future beverage
sales
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Coca-Cola wants more Europeans to wear what they drink
and drink what they wear.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based beverage giant will announce today that it
plans to sell a line of casual wear and sports-inspired clothing in
both Eastern and Western Europe. Currently, the line of clothes is
primarily sold in the United Kingdom, with a sprinkling of sales in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes wholesale sales in continental Europe will
build to $500 million between next spring, when the clothes become
available in stores, and 2009.
</P>
<P>
   But Coke is not teaming up with Fashion Box of Italy to enter
the apparel business. Instead, it hopes the clothes, which it is
licensing to Fashion Box to distribute, will connect with young
consumers and drive future beverage sales in those key markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many countries in the world, Coke is considered cool, and
this serves two purposes,'' said John Sicher, editor and publisher
of Beverage Digest. ``It gives young people the chance to wear
clothing that they think will be fun and interesting, and it gives
Coke yet another chance to reinforce the visibility of its flagship
brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Williams, Coca-Cola's director of merchandise services for
Greater Europe, said the company is ``reacting to and feeding off
of what consumers have been telling us in the U.K. They connect
with the clothes. The whole idea is to make it affordable and
reflective of our brand. ... This is a marketing asset. This builds
... an experience with the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   That experience is designed to be a subtle one, Williams said.
Research in the United Kingdom among teen-agers and young adults
told Coca-Cola and Fashion Box to downplay the Coke logo on the
clothes, which include shirts, jeans and hooded sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some of the clothes don't even have Coca-Cola written
on the outside of the garment. Instead a ``dynamic ribbon''
symbolizing the company is used, but this icon is far less known to
consumers than the likes of the Nike swoosh or Ralph Lauren polo
player.
</P>
<P>
   On some garments, ``Enjoy Coca-Cola'' is written in Korean, even
though the items are not sold in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers told us they would connect better with clever and
quirky, as opposed to overt branding,'' said Coca-Cola spokesman
Scott Jacobson.
</P>
<P>
   On other clothes, Jacobson said, there is just a small
silhouette of a Coke bottle.

RING LARDNER UNDERSTOOD BASEBALL _ AND LIFE, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did Roger Clemens throw his fastball at Mike Piazza's head on
purpose during the recent subway series? Piazza thinks he did, and
others are suspicious. But only Clemens knows for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter? For a reader with limited tolerance for
sports-hero coverage, the main accomplishment of this incident is
to awaken memories of Ring Lardner, who was not merely America's
incomparable analyst of a pitcher's psyche but of much else about
the America of his time and ours.
</P>
<P>
   In Lardner's acid-etched portrait, ``You Know Me Al: A Busher's
Letters,'' Jack Keefe, the letter-writing White Sox pitcher,
announces right out that if he had known that Joe Hill, a rival
left-hander, had stolen his girl, Violet, ``I would of made
Callahan,'' the Sox manager, ``pitch me against him.'' He
continues: ``And when he come up to bat I would of beaned him. But
I don't suppose you could hurt him by hitting him in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   It is just Jack's bad luck that when he finally gets
sufficiently steamed up actually to bean Joe Hill, the game is tied
and the bases are loaded. ``I catched him square on the fourhead
and he dropped like as if he had been shot. But pretty soon he gets
up and gives me the laugh and runs to first base.'' That gets Jack
suspended without pay.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Hill, along with many others, stirs up Jack's visions of
violent retribution: ``I don't know what for but I felt like
busting his jaw only the boys told me I had better not do nothing
because I might kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballplayers' syntax has been smoothed over considerably since
Lardner's Jack was in the big leagues in 1914; these days
interviews with athletes mostly sound as though they were pitched
by the same hand, with a spin for a clean public image. Even John
Rocker has been tamed. The price or the reward has been a blandness
of personality.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in the majors or in exile in a bush league, however,
Jack is distinctive in his hapless way. Not for Lardner was the
sentimental celebration in which others of the sportswriting
fraternity indulge. To call him a sportswriter is like calling F.
Scott Fitzgerald a gossip columnist. The critic Maxwell Geismar was
not overstating when he credited Lardner with being ``one of the
most savage and merciless satirists and social critics of his
period who dissected Babbitt before Babbitt was born.'' Lardner was
cruelly comical. Jack's skirmish with Joe Hill is an affair of the
heart, but his typical reaction to competitors on field and off,
and to slights imagined and only too real, take the form of dreams
of physical retaliation. Take the time when Allen, Jack's teammate
on Chicago's pitching staff, buys a big diamond ring for his
girlfriend Marie and makes Jack look cheap in front of his wife,
Florrie, who is Marie's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Jack writes to his pal, the ever-sympathizing and accommodating
Al: ``I guess all these lefthanders is alike though I thought this
Allen had some sense. I thought he was different from the most and
was not no rummy but they are all alike Al and they are all lucky
that somebody don't hit them over the head with a ax and kill them
but I guess at that you could not hurt no lefthanders by hitting
them over the head.'' Unable to take vengeance by beaning a
teammate, Jack consoles himself that ``Allen has not got nothing
but a dinky curve ball and a fast ball that looks like my slow
one.'' Allen's curve ball, he reports to Al, ``has not got no more
smoke than a rabbit or something.'' It was such inventions that
inspired Geismar to credit Lardner with creating ``a new American
language that made Hemingway's look like parlor conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, with the exception of the Joe Hill beaning mishap, Jack
would never admit to throwing a fastball at a batter's head on
purpose because that would imply he was afraid to pitch to the
plate, which Jack, who comes on with claims to being the best in
any league, except when his arm hurts, is not about to admit.
</P>
<P>
   His epistolary outbursts are generally connected to rebuffs in
romance brought on by a severe case of stinginess; he is a tightwad
who suspects that some sharpie or fickle girlfriend is always
trying to put one over on him.
</P>
<P>
   When Allen smacks him after Jack threatens to bust Marie's jaw,
his account betrays Jack as a blowhard who has rarely delivered a
hard blow: ``Well Al I am not going to stand that from nobody not
even if he is my brother-in-law and a lefthander that has not got
enough speed to brake a pain of glass. So I give him a good beating
and the waiters butts in and puts us all out for fighting and I and
Florrie comes home in a taxi and Allen and his wife don't get in
till about 5 oclock so I guess she must of had to of took him to a
doctor to get fixed up. I been in bed ever since till just this
morning kind of sick to my stumach. I guess I must of eat something
that did not agree with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack is matchless when it comes to self-advertisement and
self-revelation. The combination of cheapness and bluster, of
all-purpose hostility and infallible miscalculation, delivered in
inimitably Lardnerian prose, make Jack an exasperating yet
endearing and enduring figure, propelled on a sure road to
destruction. He can't figure out why people so often seem to be
laughing at him.
</P>
<P>
   Readers laughed, too, and by the end of his classic tale we know
the poor jerk and the America that he represents a lot better than
Al ever can.

   WOMEN ON AUTO ASSEMBLY LINES HAVE MORE RISK OF BREAST CANCER
</P>
<P>
   ASSEMBLY-LINE-CANCER-NYTSF _ Women who put together America's
cars may be up to 20 percent likelier to get breast cancer than
other women, say preliminary results of a study. The exposure of
automotive assembly line workers to metalworking fluids over time
increased their chances of getting the disease, but the
environmental epidemiologists who did the study, are quick to add
that this does not prove a cause-and-effect relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot say that exposure to metalworking fluids is the
cause of disease. We can say there is a statistical association,''
says Deborah Thompson, a doctoral student in the University of
Massachusett's Department of Work Environment. The final study
results are being completed this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers think that toxic components -- like polyaromatic
hydrocarbons, biocides, nitrosamines and chlorinated paraffins --
in the metalworking fluids react with the female hormonal system,
elevating the risk of breast cancer. In this scenario, the fluids
behave like estrogen and attach themselves to cells in the fatty
breast tissue.

   THE DEVASTATION OF FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME
</P>
<P>
   FETAL-ALCOHOL-SYNDROME-NYTSF _ Seventeen years ago, when Linda
LaFever was eight months pregnant, she went on a drinking binge.
For two weeks, she drank a half bottle of vodka a day. Five years
later, she learned the price of that binge. A panel of experts told
her that her son, Daniel, with an IQ of 58, had fetal alcohol
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``My world stopped. It took about three seconds to link those
words. I picked up my child and put him on my lap and rocked him,''
LaFever recalls. ``I'm still trying to get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Daniel is a 17-year-old whose high school curriculum in
Hawaii includes learning to make his own bed and doing laundry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time alcohol is mixed in with pregnancy, it's going to
cause some damage,'' LaFever says. ``Don't think it can't happen to
your child. And when it happens to your child, it happens to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Fetal alcohol syndrome is a diagnosis that means a child will
probably suffer stunted growth and facial deformities, attention
and behavior problems, and, in some cases, mental retardation.
Worst of all, it's a diagnosis that's never outgrown; adults with
the syndrome will never function normally.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a diagnosis that's becoming increasingly common -- up
six-fold since the mid-1980s.

   ATHLETES USE HYPOXIC TRAINING FOR UPCOMING OLYMPICS
</P>
<P>
   HYPOXIC-TRAINING-NYTSF _ Spencer Duval doesn't want to go to the
mountains, so he brings the mountains to him. Well, at least the
high altitudes. Duval, 30, is a British runner training for the
2000 Olympic Games in Sydney by sleeping in a hypoxic tent -- set
up in his own bedroom -- to recreate the lower oxygen levels of a
high-altitude mountainous atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who will represent Britain in the 3,000-meter
steeplechase, started sleeping in the tent last November and will
continue using it until the Olympics. The tent, although not
air-tight, is attached to a small generator that pumps in levels of
oxygen that match an atmosphere of 9,000 feet above sea level.
That's equal to about three-quarters of the way up Mont Blanc in
the French Alps.
</P>
<P>
   While he sleeps, Duval's body acclimatizes to the lower oxygen
levels by producing more red blood cells. The increase in red blood
cells increases oxygen flow to his muscles, delaying the onset of
fatigue and improving performance.
</P>
<P>
   Tests at the University of Staffordshire's Sports Performance
Center by sports scientist Steve Day showed that Duval's body is 10
percent more efficient now than before he started using the hypoxic
tent.

BRITISH OVERCAME RESISTANCE TO EXPORT `MILLIONAIRE' AND
`SURVIVOR' 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One is a game show, the other a pseudo-survival test on a desert
island, but in terms of impact on American culture, ABC's ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and CBS's ``Survivor'' qualify as
another British invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in terms of paternity if not artistry, Michael Davies,
the British-born executive producer of ``Millionaire,'' said,
``It's actually a pretty good analogy: `Millionaire' as the Beatles
and `Survivor' as the Rolling Stones.'' Both ``Millionaire'' and
``Survivor'' are 100 percent British-made television ideas, and
Davies had a hand in bringing both shows to American audiences.
</P>
<P>
   They are also providing a bit of cultural revenge for the
British, who have lately felt disrespected and mistreated by
American films like ``The Patriot'' and ``U-571.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of ``Millionaire'' has been widely told in the last
year as that game show has gradually colonized much of prime time.
``Millionaire,'' turned down for two years by the ITV network in
Britain, went on the air there in late 1998 and was an instant hit.
But it was the expansion to the United States and myriad other
outposts that stamped the show as possibly England's most
successful cultural export in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit like the old days of the British empire,'' said
Paul Smith, managing director of the British production company
Celador, which came up with the game show. ``We've got a map of the
world in the office colored in pink where we've placed the show.
Most of the world is pink.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' is the scruffier newcomer, and its roots are less
well known, largely because the show never got onto British
television. Instead ``Survivor'' went through one of the longest
gestation periods of any breakthrough television show. It took 12
years, during which it was rejected by every network in Britain and
two in the United States, before it finally emerged into the
relative obscurity of Swedish television.
</P>
<P>
   The show made it principally because of the commitment of its
creative team, a threesome that includes an Irish rock singer, the
leading producer of what the British press call ``yoof TV'' (as in
``Youth TV'') and the youngest life peer in the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
   The latter, surely the first member of the House of Lords to
bring a hit television show to American television, is Waheed Alli,
35. Alli was the principal business executive of Planet 24, a
television production company responsible for often controversial
but usually successful British shows. These included ``The Big
Breakfast,'' in which the anchor, Paula Yates, often interviewed
guests from her bed; ``The Word,'' a music- and occasionally
raunch-filled late-night show; and ``Gaytime TV,'' a magazine show
about gay life that critics described as ``deliberately
frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
   The rock star is 45-year-old Bob Geldof, the organizer of the
``Live Aid'' benefits for famine relief in Africa. But by all
accounts the chief creative force in the team is Charlie Parsons,
42, a longtime producer and creator of shows and a man Davies calls
``the brightest guy I've ever been around in television.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons and Alli, partners in life as well as in business, have
contributed media advice to Prime Minister Tony Blair and are known
for lavish Christmas parties on their estate in Kent, attended by
many of the most prominent members of the Labor government. Alli is
famously press shy, reputedly having given only one interview in
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Parsons says, Alli divides his time between his political
duties in the House of Lords and his duties as a television
executive. ``It's a bit mad,'' Parsons said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, after the years of waiting, it is gratifying to
own the hottest show in television.
</P>
<P>
   To say nothing of lucrative. Parsons, Alli and Geldof divided
about $20 million when they sold Planet 24 to Carlton Television a
year ago. And thanks to Parsons' insistence on excluding the
``Survivor'' concept from that sale, the partners stand to reap
another big payoff.

 &HT;    AS TIME RUNS DOWN ON SUMMIT, CLINTON PRESSES FOR PEACE DEAL
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ With time running out before his planned
Wednesday departure for Tokyo, President Clinton hunkered down with
Israeli and Palestinian leaders Monday for a seventh straight day
of Camp David peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   With no outward signs of a peace agreement in sight, White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said negotiators from both sides would
likely be working into the morning Tuesday in an effort to strike a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties understand the schedule here,'' Lockhart said.
``The pace and the intensity has quickened.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid speculation that Clinton could delay his departure for the
G8 summit in Okinawa to shepherd the parties the final painful
steps toward a peace accord, the White House sought to use his
schedule as a deadline to force negotiators into the vice of
decision-making that would make or break a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who said Sunday that no agreement was in view, was
still hopeful that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak would resolve the issues at the core of
their 52-year bloody dispute by the time Air Force One is slated to
take off Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect that when the president leaves,'' Lockhart said,
``the parties will have wrapped up their business.''
</P>
<P>
   With the two sides still reportedly far apart on key issues,
though, Lockhart declined to rule out the possibility that the
president might postpone his departure for Japan, where he is to
meet with his counterparts in the so-called Group of Eight big
democratic powers _ Britain, Japan, Germany, Italy, France, Canada,
the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I know is that the president intends to get on a plane
Wednesday morning to go and fulfill his requirements as an
important leader in the G8,'' Lockhart said. Leaving open the
prospect that Clinton's departure could slip, though, he said,
``You'll know that we're following through on the schedule when you
see the president walk up to the top of the steps and wave and the
door close.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has some leeway.
</P>
<P>
   He's scheduled to arrive in Tokyo Thursday afternoon for a
bilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   If he postponed that meeting _ there's little on the agenda _
Clinton could depart Thursday morning and still arrive in Okinawa,
the southernmost island in the Japanese archipelago, by Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The G8 summit is to begin in Okinawa Friday afternoon. Clinton
is scheduled to preside over a memorial service there Friday
morning for the Americans and Japanese killed there during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began the day Monday meeting with Barak, then held
strategy sessions with his top Mideast aides throughout much of the
afternoon in preparation for an evening meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations on core issues such as territory and security,
the future of Jerusalem and the question of Palestinian statehood
stretched deeper into the night, parties to the talks were
beginning to show signs of wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   The White House released a photograph Monday showing U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, with dark circles under her
eyes, holding the hand of Arafat as the two listened intently to
his interpreter while strolling through the darkness of the
presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Albright appeared to be steadying the aging Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult coming continually back to the same issues with
the same people,'' said Lockhart. ``That kind of environment is not
always the best for the warm and fuzzies.''

   THURMONT, Md. _ With time running out before his planned
Wednesday departure for Tokyo, President Clinton hunkered down with
Israeli and Palestinian leaders Monday for a seventh straight day
of Camp David peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   With no outward signs of a peace agreement in sight, White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said negotiators from both sides would
likely be working into the morning Tuesday in an effort to strike a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties understand the schedule here,'' Lockhart said.
``The pace and the intensity has quickened.''

 UNDATED: big payoff.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea for ``Survivor'' came up in 1988, Parsons said, in a
segment for one of his earlier creations, ``Network 7.'' He was
looking for something ``cutting edge,' he said, something that
hadn't been tried before. So Parsons dumped four participants,
including a tennis star and an ex-convict, onto an island with
cameras recording their efforts to survive together. He refined the
idea until he had the current format: 16 people, lots of tests and
games, a vote to eliminate teammates and one winner.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a buyer was the tough part. No British television entity
was interested. But Parsons had a British connection in American
television: Davies. Shortly after graduating from the University of
Edinburgh, Davies started out in Hollywood writing for the game
show ``Let's Make a Deal.'' By the time Parsons called, Davies was
an executive at Buena Vista Television, the production arm of Walt
Disney. He was, in Parsons' words, ``very keen on `Survivor.'''
</P>
<P>
   Davies pitched the show around and won some interest at both ABC
and Fox. This was 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a pretty interesting reputation in those days,'' Davies
said. ``I'd go around and there'd be these raised eyebrows: `What's
this crazy Brit going to come up with today?'''
</P>
<P>
   At ABC Stu Bloomberg, then executive vice president for
entertainment, was enthusiastic about the island survival show.
``Stu really got it,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that there was no pilot, and there could be no
pilot for such a series. So Davies took $150,000 in development
money from Bloomberg and built a model of the island. The show was
never picked up.
</P>
<P>
   It might have ended there if another British expatriate had not
dropped himself into the scene: Mark Burnett, a former paratrooper
and outdoorsman, had developed ``Eco-Challenge,'' an
environmentally correct adventure road race for MTV. Burnett's
background is deep in adventurism, starting with his decision to
join the elite British Parachute Regiment at 18, and when he heard
the concept, he campaigned to acquire the American rights. ``He
always kept hustling for it,'' Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no American network would bite. So Alli and Parsons sold
the idea to Swedish television under the title ``Expedition
Robinson,'' as in ``Swiss Family.'' Now they had proof of how the
concept worked on television. The only problem was that the first
participant to be kicked off the island committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Davies, by then at ABC as executive in charge of alternative
series, was worried about the suicide but ``I had so much faith in
Mark Burnett as a producer that I sent him to Disney.'' There the
concept was enthusiastically supported by Lloyd Braun, the head of
Disney's production company.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this point that another television idea percolating in
Britain dropped unexpectedly onto Davies' doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   In London a friend of Davies, Duncan Gray, who worked for the
ITV network, attended the first taping of ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' and immediately sent off a tape to Davies. ``I said
to myself, This is the best quiz show format, perhaps the best
format, I have ever seen,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the networks had for decades disdained game shows in
prime time, mainly because they were thought to attract older
viewers, Davies sent tapes of the show around ABC corporate
meetings. Bloomberg again was enthusiastic. So was Michael Eisner,
the Disney chairman. ``I got this e-mail from Michael saying
something like, `I'm not sure if I'm embarrassed by this, but I
really, really like this program.'''
</P>
<P>
   But one of the biggest hurdles was the format established in
Britain, where the show played 13 nights in a row.
</P>
<P>
   That tournament-style format was one of the show's great assets,
Smith said. And it was far more typical of British television,
which does not depend on yearly runs of 22-episodes, to break away
from the traditional once-a-week series format.
</P>
<P>
   Davies needed a crosscultural breakthrough. He brought in
another key player, Ben Silverman, an agent with the William Morris
Agency who had been living in London and watching British
television for four years. ``I needed somebody on the ground in
London to explain the difference between American and British
television to Paul,'' Davies said, speaking of Paul Smith,
Celador's managing director.
</P>
<P>
   With Silverman's help, Smith made the deal with ABC. Davies then
made a decision of his own. He quit his executive job at the
network to become the executive producer of ``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' still had no American home, though Burnett had
promising negotiations going with CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that in some quarters of ABC there wasn't enough
passion for `Survivor,''' Davies said. ``And I wondered whether we
could launch `Millionaire' and `Survivor' in the same year.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS stepped up. ``All credit to CBS for taking on the risk,''
Parsons said. The show went on CBS in June and eclipsed last
summer's ``Millionaire'' ratings, especially among younger viewers,
whom CBS had not been able to reach with any other programming.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Davies said, he is glad to be part of the
trend toward ``globalization of television concepts.''
``Millionaire'' is a hit in 29 countries and has sold in 50 more.
`Survivor' is already sold in Germany, Argentina, Denmark and Spain
and expectations are that with the American success, it will sell
far and wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago,'' Davies said, ``if I had said the two biggest
things in television are going to be a young-skewing show on CBS
that's a reality concept based on a British-created Swedish
television program produced by a former British paratrooper and
part owned by a member of Parliament, and a prime-time quiz show
hosted by Regis Philbin, that would have been an inconceivable
notion.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``It is even more inconceivable that American
television had completely boxed itself in, that everybody thought
television was only dramas, sitcoms and news magazines. I think
it's fantastic now that everybody's thinking, What can we do
next?''

WELCOMING NEW IDEAS INTO A PLAYWRIGHTS' NEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn. N.Y.)   By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERFORD, Conn. _ For 35 summers, the National Playwrights
Conference has been the tall ship of the Eugene O'Neill Theater
Center, giving a berth to hundreds of new plays and new
playwrights. This year there is a major difference: James Houghton
as the new artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton, 41, the founder and director of the Signature Theater
Company, has succeeded Lloyd Richards, 80, the first, and until
now, the only head of the conference commonly known as ``the
O'Neill.'' Looking ahead, Houghton said, ``The O'Neill is about to
be born again.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first season at the conference Houghton is trying to put
the emphasis even more firmly on the writers, and he has made small
but significant alterations. For the first time, all the writers
are living on the O'Neill ``campus'' for the month of their
residency instead of being boarded at a nearby college, and they
are encouraged to bring their families with them.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekend, playwrights were very much in evidence in
the grand O'Neill environment, an elegant estate with a green lawn
leading down to Long Island Sound. The writers were in rehearsals
or staged readings, talking to members of the staff or simply
meeting their colleagues and comparing notes about their plays in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, there were critical forums following the readings,
with directors, dramaturges and critics (from the National Critics
Institute, an adjunct of the conference) speaking out about the
plays while the playwrights were asked to remain silent. In some
cases the result was a wounded playwright. Now there are no longer
such sessions. Criticism of the work may be offered privately and
informally.
</P>
<P>
   Greeting the audience at the opening event of the monthlong
conference, a staged reading of ``Parts Unknown,'' a new play by
Ron Fitzgerald, Houghton spoke about ``the need to take the time
and to have the patience to allow the writers to create.'' He said
that when the process works, ``it elevates us all.''
</P>
<P>
   John Henry Redwood, one of this year's playwrights, was at the
O'Neill in 1995 with ``The Old Settler,'' which was later presented
at Primary Stages in New York City. Looking back on his first
residency, he said, ``It served me, and it served the play.'' His
new play, about the rape of a black woman by a white man in North
Carolina in 1949, has the provocative title ``No Niggers, No Jews,
No Dogs.'' Redwood, who is black, said he was aware that the title
might present problems for any theater producing the work.
Informally, he was referring to it as ``The No Play.''
</P>
<P>
   In the limited rehearsal time he had not done much work on it,
but the actors (Tonya Pinkins and Ruben Santiago Hudson) and David
Esbjornson, as director, were adding their touches. The playwright
said he would be seeing the results that evening when the play had
the first of two readings.
</P>
<P>
   On opening night theatergoers, some from Boston, some from New
York, many of them from the O'Neill center and the surrounding
area, filled the bleachers in the outdoor theater, named the Edith
in memory of Edith Oliver, the longtime Off-Broadway critic for The
New Yorker and an O'Neill dramaturge.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton made his introductory remarks, again stressing that the
conference was for the playwrights. Then on an open stage under a
large tree Redwood's play began. After the performance, as is
customary at the O'Neill, the actors did not take a curtain call.
But the audience, realizing that the playwright was seated in a
rear row, rose, turned and applauded him.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward there was no critical forum, no outsiders dissecting a
writer's work, but Redwood has the option of private conversations
with his director, Houghton or others. Then, in the O'Neill
tradition, he can go back to work on his new play.
</P>
<P>
   Each year at this conference a dozen or more plays go through a
period of brief but intensive rehearsal and then have public
readings on the various stages. Many of the plays have gone on to
great success, beginning with the work of August Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   George C. White created the center in 1964, leasing 8{ acres of
the former Hamman Estate. The next year, with Richards, he began
the playwrights conference. The center itself also includes a music
theater conference, a symposium on cabaret, the National Theater
Institute and the Monte Cristo Cottage, Eugene O'Neill's childhood
home in nearby New London. White, 64, is retiring at the end of
this year, to be succeeded as executive director by Howard Sherman,
38, the managing director of the Geva Theater in Rochester. During
White's years in Waterford, the O'Neill has inspired similar
conferences in other states and also in Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Houghton said that he admired the pioneer work
of Richards and White, but he also made it clear that he was aware
of his position as a new artistic director in a new century. He
said that his first responsibility was ``to empower the
playwrights, to give writers a place where they can explore their
plays in a relatively safe environment.''
</P>
<P>
   In various developmental programs ``there are too many chefs in
the mix way too soon,'' he said. ``I'm trying to take the emphasis
away from fixing and doctoring plays and to encourage writers to
listen to the impulse that's inside them and to honor that impulse.
Across the country plays are being `developed' to death. I'm
encouraging a notion of play evolution versus play development. I
want to let a play find itself and to let a writer find himself
within a play.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, there are 13 playwrights at the O'Neill, including
Sarah C. Diamond, who is there with her first full-length play, to
experienced writers like Lee Blessing and Daisy Foote. There are
also several graduates of the playwriting seminar taught by Marsha
Norman and Christopher Durang at the Juilliard School.
</P>
<P>
   In previous years four or five directors would each stage three
plays. Now there are 13 directors, one for each play. Houghton has
also made staff changes, and many of the actors are new to the
O'Neill. There are three special projects, including one (written
by John Belluso and directed by Joseph Chaikin) that dramatizes
experiences of the disabled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Computers have been installed, and a script department helps
playwrights find information. For example, Wendy Hammond, one of
this year's playwrights, needed to clarify a minor point in her
play. She wanted to know if a cell phone could be bugged. After
inquiries were made to the CIA and the FBI, she was quickly given
an affirmative answer.
</P>
<P>
   Some things remain the same. Plays are rehearsed over four days,
and when they are performed, actors carry their scripts onstage.
There is a minimum of modular scenery. The emphasis is on the
process, and during the rest of their time at the conference
playwrights can restudy and reshape their plays. As in the past the
O'Neill is a cross between a festival and an adult summer camp,
with playwrights, actors and directors freely communicating.
Wherever one turns, there is theater talk: over meals, a drink in
the O'Neill pub or a walk across the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier days producers and agents often scouted plays. White
said that there was one stricture. No negotiations were to take
place on the O'Neill grounds: ``If a playwright said, `So and so is
interested in my play, who's interested in yours?' that would ruin
a playwrights conference.'' As before Houghton places no
restriction on who can see the plays; they are open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the principal change is in the play selection process,
which has been broadened geographically as well as aesthetically.
In order to ``open this conference up to a national theatrical
landscape,'' Houghton enlisted readers from around the country,
more than 60 theater professionals who read plays without knowing
the names of the authors (always the case at the O'Neill). This
year the process winnowed 750 submissions to 45, which then went
before a selection committee. Every script accepted had been read
by four people. Houghton said that as director he retained the
prerogative to name two writers of his own choice.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton has invited guest artists (Edward Albee, Paula Vogel,
Ed Bullins and Doug Hughes, the head of the Long Wharf Theater in
New Haven) to give seminars. In one session Romulus Linney spoke to
the playwrights about his own choice of material for plays, saying
that even when the subject is historical, it has a relationship to
his own life.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that the playwrights have to take
responsibility for their work. ``You have to decide at what point
you're willing to please people in order to get your play on,'' he
said, ``and at what point you don't care if they do it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   For Linney the Signature Theater was a turning point. After
Houghton had appeared as an actor in one of Linney's plays, he
raised the possibility of producing an entire season of his work in
New York. That was the beginning of the Signature, and it was
followed by seasons of plays by Blessing, Albee, John Guare, Arthur
Miller and others. It was Houghton's work with playwrights at that
company that brought him to the attention of the O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   White said the principal reasons he was chosen to head the
conference were that he was highly recommended by a search
committee of playwrights and other theater professionals and that
he had never been to the O'Neill before. ``I wanted somebody to
come in and see it fresh,'' White said. ``He brought no baggage,
none of this, `It's always been done this way.' '' He added: ``The
O'Neill needed an infusion of youth. There's a new spirit blowing
here.''

<P>
   Women who put together America's cars may be up to 20 percent
likelier to get breast cancer than other women, say preliminary
results of a study.
</P>
<P>
   The exposure of automotive assembly-line workers to metalworking
fluids over time increased their chances of getting the disease,
but environmental epidemiologists at the University of
Massachusetts/Lowell, who did the study, are quick to add that this
does not prove a cause-and-effect relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot say that exposure to metalworking fluids is the
cause of disease. We can say there is a statistical association''
between environmental exposure and breast cancer, says Deborah
Thompson, a doctoral student in the University of Massachusett's
Department of Work Environment.
</P>
<P>
   She and a team of researchers did the study, which looked at the
exposure of almost 5,000 women to metalworking fluids between
l940-1996. She received no financing from the auto industry; the
final study results are being completed this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers think that toxic components _ like polyaromatic
hydrocarbons, biocides, nitrosamines and chlorinated paraffins _ in
the metalworking fluids react with the female hormonal system,
elevating the risk of breast cancer. In this scenario, the fluids
behave like estrogen and attach themselves to cells in the fatty
breast tissue. Such fluids are commonly used in industrial
workplaces to cool and lubricate parts during machining.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson says, ``once they form a bond with the receptors in the
breast, they are absorbed into the cell's nucleus, setting off a
cascade of disregulated growth leading to carcinogenesis.''
</P>
<P>
   These results are the latest to come out of this entire group of
50,000 auto workers (45,000 are men). Previous studies on this
whole group have linked them to a risk of cancers of the larynx,
esophagus and pancreas. In Thompson's study, they only looked at
women and also took into account the family history of breast
cancer, lifestyle and whether they had children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipated a negative study and were surprised to find an
association between environmental pollutants and breast cancer,''
she says. They measured the risk by calculating how much of these
compounds were in the air and found that when they reached a
certain amount, the risk increased 20 percent. That amount was a
milligram of metalworking fluid per cubic meter of air per year,
and was added up over time to arrive at a risk level.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the U.S.
More than 180,000 women will be diagnosed with it this year, and
more than 40,000 will die of it this year, according to the
American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me like there may be a lot of hazardous things out
there in the workplace and the environment that might put us at
risk, not just for breast cancer, but for other hormonally related
cancers, for example, ovarian and prostate,'' she Thompson. The
difficulty lies in how to measure these hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson added that this study, as others before it, was done
with permission from the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) and
General Motors (GM), both of which have formed a scientific board
to evaluate the worth of each piece of research. Despite repeated
phone calls over two weeks, neither the UAW nor GM would respond to
questions from HealthSCOUT.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Mullen, executive director of the Women's Informational
Network Against Breast Cancer in San Diego, embraces the results of
this study and sees it as indicating there may be even broader
problems. Pesticides and other chemicals _ in the water we drink
and the air we breathe _ have been linked to cancer, she says. And
cancer rates are rising. ``Everywhere you look, somebody's been
impacted, and we have to look at the big picture _ the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's study was funded by the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health Breast Cancer Research Program.

 &HT;    Delta set to add Bogota service in December
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Delta Air Lines announced Monday it will start flights
between Atlanta and Bogota, Colombia, Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   That will be in addition to three other routes from Atlanta to
Mexico and South America that Delta already is set to launch:
Santiago, Chile, Nov. 1; Leon, Mexico Oct. 1; and Los Cabos,
Mexico, Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Delta subsidiary Atlantic Southeast Airlines also is starting
regional jet flights between Atlanta and Monterrey, Mexico, Sept.
1.
</P>
<P>
   The new routes continue Delta's 2-year effort to build service
to Latin America, a region where it previously had no significant
presence. The strategy hinges on drawing travelers from the eastern
United States through Delta's Atlanta hub. Most Latin-bound traffic
flows through Miami, where American has a hub.
</P>
<P>
   When all the announced new flights are added, Atlanta-based
Delta will serve 15 destinations in Mexico, Central America and
South America from Atlanta, an increase from four at the beginning
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Bogota flights are allowed under a new U.S.-Colombia air
treaty that allows seven more weekly round trips by a U.S. carrier.
The U.S. Department of Transportation designated Delta in a
preliminary decision. The DOT picked Delta over Continental
Airlines, which proposed serving Cali, Colombia, from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serving Colombia is an integral part of our strategic plan to
expand Delta's overall Latin America presence and to compete more
aggressively in the region,'' said Scott Yohe, senior vice
president-government affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America still accounts for only 3 percent of Delta
revenue, and the airline remains well behind American and
Continental in passenger volume and destinations. But Delta
executives say the region produces a 15 percent profit margin,
higher than the margins achieved by its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation is that Delta has focused on flying to national
business centers rather than tourist destinations, and more of its
passengers travel on higher, less restrictive fares.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate) &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Seventeen years ago, when Linda LaFever was eight months
pregnant, she went on a drinking binge. For two weeks, she drank a
half bottle of vodka a day.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, she learned the price of that binge. A panel
of experts told her that her son, Daniel, with an IQ of 58, had
fetal alcohol syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``My world stopped. It took about three seconds to link those
words. I picked up my child and put him on my lap and rocked him,''
LaFever recalls. ``I'm still trying to get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Daniel is a 17-year-old whose high school curriculum in
Hawaii includes learning to make his own bed and doing laundry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time alcohol is mixed in with pregnancy, it's going to
cause some damage,'' LaFever says. ``Don't think it can't happen to
your child. And when it happens to your child, it happens to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Fetal alcohol syndrome is a diagnosis that means a child will
probably suffer stunted growth and facial deformities, attention
and behavior problems, and, in some cases, mental retardation.
Worst of all, it's a diagnosis that's never outgrown; adults with
the syndrome will never function normally.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a diagnosis that's becoming increasingly common _ up
six-fold since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 5,000 babies are born each year with the syndrome;
another 50,000 have disabilities stemming from maternal use of
alcohol during pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading
known cause of mental retardation, and some experts estimate that
each afflicted child will cost $1.4 million over a lifetime in
institutional and medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   A HEARTBREAKING ADOPTION
</P>
<P>
   Vicky McKinney, the co-director of the FAS Family Research
Institute in Seattle, also knows the emotional cost first-hand.
</P>
<P>
   After giving birth to three sons, McKinney adopted a
2-1/2-year-old girl. There were problems early on, McKinney
recalls. Jessie would color on the walls, and she couldn't seem to
understand that it wasn't OK, no matter how many times McKinney
tried to teach her. Each time, they'd talk and Jessie would then
have to wash the walls as punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have happened four or five times a day,'' says
McKinney, who lives in Seattle. ``I put that poor little girl
through hell because I thought she was normal.''
</P>
<P>
   When she finally learned Jessie had the syndrome, McKinney felt
an odd combination of devastation and relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had adopted the first woman president of the
United States,'' she remembers thinking. ``And to get the knowledge
that because of something she had no choice over, she will suffer
the consequences of for the rest of her life ...,'' McKinney's
voice trails off.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problems of fetal alcohol syndrome children,
diagnosis is often slow and preceded by inaccurate assessments. A
couple who recently adopted a Russian baby saw six pediatricians
before discovering their baby's problems were rooted in fetal
alcohol syndrome, according to Kathleen Tavenner Mitchell, national
spokeswoman for the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
(NOFAS), and the mother of a child with the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Many children with the syndrome are also diagnosed with
attention deficit disorder, which has some similar characteristics,
Mitchell says. Some doctors simply have not received adequate
training to recognize the syndrome. And then there are others who
hesitate to apply the fetal alcohol syndrome label, because of the
stigma it attaches to the family if the baby lives with its birth
mother.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome was first described as a syndrome in America in the
early 1970s. Before that, doctors actually recommended that women
drink beer to put on weight during pregnancy, says Dr. John Larsen,
professor of obstetrics, gynecology and genetics at George
Washington University in Washington, D.C. Today, NOFAS literature
says, 57 percent of women under 45 have never even heard of fetal
alcohol syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   More devastating still are statistics from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention that suggest pregnant women are
drinking more now than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   CASES ON THE RISE
</P>
<P>
   The CDC estimates there's been a six-fold increase in the number
of babies with the syndrome in the last 15 years. And a 1998 CDC
survey found that the number of pregnant women who reported any
alcohol use rose from 9.5 percent in 1992 to 15.3 percent three
years later. At the same time, ``frequent'' alcohol use by pregnant
women, defined as at least one episode of binge drinking or at
least seven drinks a week, rose from 0.9 percent to 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of drinking during pregnancy had actually declined
in the late 1980s, when there was a burst of publicity about the
syndrome, according to Louise Floyd, acting chief for the CDC's
Fetal Alcohol Branch. But the passage of time and recent publicity
touting the health advantages of certain types of alcohol, like red
wine, seem to have eroded the gains.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, Mitchell and others say, is that many women tend to
view alcohol as more benign than other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think, 'If I'm not using heroin or cocaine like the
people down the street, if I'm just using beer, that's OK,' ''
Mitchell says.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence suggests otherwise. In the first trimester of
pregnancy, alcohol can create limb and facial deformities and,
perhaps, neurological damage, Mitchell says. In the second
trimester, alcohol consumption can lead to preterm delivery and
stillbirths. In the third trimester _ when many women think they're
home free _ a baby's brain development peaks and is at risk from
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   So how much is too much alcohol? No one is sure. Amounts
certainly matter _ but so do specific time frames, individual
tolerances and genetics.
</P>
<P>
   A University of Washington study showed that the 4-year-old
children of middle-class mothers who'd taken three or more drinks a
day during pregnancy scored, on average, five points lower than
children whose mothers hadn't touched alcohol during their
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   And a study published in Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental
Research last summer showed that alcohol imbibed during a single
day in a mouse's 19-day pregnancy greatly increased the likelihood
of early _ and dangerous _ labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A drink a day during pregnancy can be associated with adverse
effects, like miscarriage, and other selected birth defects,'' the
CDC's Floyd says. Minimal amounts of alcohol can result in ``subtle
changes in cognition,'' she adds. ``The question is, why take a
risk?''

LITTLE BILLY GILMAN, AGE 12, HAS NASHVILLE LISTENING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By DAVE FERMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hi! It's Billy Gilman!''
</P>
<P>
   It's 9 a.m. Monday, and Billy Gilman, the boy wonder of country
music, is on the line _ and sounding very upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   At 12, Gilman's already seen his debut single, ``One Voice,''
hurtle onto ``Billboard'' magazine's country singles chart, and he
replaces Brenda Lee as the youngest artist ever to do so. Just last
week, his debut CD, also titled ``One Voice,'' debuted at No. 4 on
the country charts, vaulting over George Strait, Tim McGraw and
Shania Twain.
</P>
<P>
   And on the phone, he sounds about ... 9 years old. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the (Grand Ole) Opry and my manager called me and it
was my debut on the Opry and I was `flippin' _ it was really
surprising!'' he says breathlessly about the moment he heard the
news about his single. ``I, like, froze!''
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable. Becoming one of the hottest young stars in
Nashville before you're old enough to shave or drive isn't
something you can prepare for _ although in several ways, the tiny
(4 feet 7 inches), blond-haired Gilman really has been rehearsing
for this nearly all his short life.
</P>
<P>
   While growing up in suburban Providence, R.I., he listened to
Tammy Wynette, George Jones, Eddie Arnold and other classic country
artists. Singing along with a Pam Tillis video led to performing at
local functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wanted to do this when I was 7,'' Gilman says.
``After a show, I was asked if I had ever made a record and I was
like, `I'm 7 years old,' and that was the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a series of introductions, Asleep at the Wheel's Ray
Benson became a fan, and cut a demo with Gilman in Austin, Texas.
Benson then introduced him to to Scott Simon, who manages Tim
McGraw, among others. Blake Chancey, Sony Nashville's senior vice
president of artist and repertoire, flew to Providence, where
Gilman was opening a show for Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing Blake said to us was, `I'm going to play you
this tape _ I want you to talk me out of this,' '' says Michael
Kraski, senior vice president of sales and marketing for Sony
Nashville. ``We couldn't. We weren't looking to sign a child, but
he's not a contrivance. He's a prodigy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``One Voice,'' song and CD, were recorded in short order;
Chancey produced the CD with David Malloy (Reba McEntire, Eddie
Rabbit) and Don Cook (Brooks &AMP; Dunn, Lonestar). No surprises here:
The CD features several tried-and-true pop or country staples,
including Tammy Wynette's ``'Til I Can Make It On My Own'' and
Bobby Goldsboro's ``Little Things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One Voice,'' though, is clearly the standout track. Written by
Malloy and Cook, it's a sentimental pining for the way life used to
be, and should be, complete with references to the golden rule and
kids riding their bikes to school. ``What I'm trying to do with
`One Voice,''' Gilman says earnestly, ``is hopefully get all the
violence out of the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation for Gilman was primed with a well-received
appearance this spring at the Academy of Country Music Awards; when
``One Voice'' charted several weeks ago, Gilman was still 11, so he
edged out Lee, who was 12 when she first made the country charts.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lee, Gilman often edges into rockabilly territory. Unlike
her, though, he has to worry about his voice breaking: On several
tracks, he sounds like a young woman. Is he worried?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we're looking at that,'' he says. ``But with the proper
voice training, I'll be able to hit the high notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Proper voice training? Do 12-year-olds really talk this way?
Gilman does. He peppers his speech with several such adult phrases;
unlike other young musicians, he is enthusiastic and expansive.
Sony, Kraski says, is betting that his appeal will cut across age
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that show in Providence, grown women were coming up to the
stage and laying bouquets at his feet,'' Kraski says. ``Country is
adult-driven music _ the core audience is a 35-year-old female. We
feel we'll connect with preteen females and moms. But we've found
he has gotten response from dads and teen-age boys _ and teen-age
females.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gilman hasn't even started touring to support his hit. He
doesn't know who he'll be touring with _ there are no Fort
Worth-Dallas dates on the schedule yet _ and these days he's doing
TV shows (he's off to Los Angeles to do ``The Tonight Show With Jay
Leno'') and then starting work on a Christmas CD.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing much, it seems, gets him down, not even after being hit
in the face by a golf ball recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible,'' Gilman says. ``I hit a ball right next to a
creek and one kid hit his ball across the river facing the creek.
It hit me right in the mouth. I held my mouth and closed my eyes
and my tooth fell out. It was gross! We put it (the tooth) right in
and it'll take six to eight weeks to heal. I feel great. I'm really
getting back on my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, anyway, nothing seems to slow Gilman down.

<P>
   Spencer Duval doesn't want to go to the mountains, so he brings
the mountains to him.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least the high altitudes. Duval, 30, is a British
runner training for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney by sleeping in
a hypoxic tent _ set up in his own bedroom _ to recreate the lower
oxygen levels of a high-altitude mountainous atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like going camping. It takes a couple of days to get
used to it, but after that, it's not a problem. It's like a two-man
tent, but it's got two big clear panels that you can see out of.
It's quite light and airy,'' says Duval, who will represent Britain
in the 3,000-meter steeplechase.
</P>
<P>
   He started sleeping in the tent last November and will continue
using it until the Olympics. The tent, although not air-tight, is
attached to a small generator that pumps in levels of oxygen that
match an atmosphere of 9,000 feet above sea level. That's equal to
about three-quarters of the way up Mont Blanc in the French Alps.
</P>
<P>
   While he sleeps, Duval's body acclimatizes to the lower oxygen
levels by producing more red blood cells. The increase in red blood
cells increases oxygen flow to his muscles, delaying the onset of
fatigue and improving performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to spend a certain number of hours in it each
night _ just whatever time you happen to sleep there. It's the
cumulative effect over a couple of weeks that's the key. If you
just keep using it, then you're going to get the benefits,'' Duval
says.
</P>
<P>
   Tests at the University of Staffordshire's Sports Performance
Center by sports scientist Steve Day showed that Duval's body is 10
percent more efficient now than before he started using the hypoxic
tent.
</P>
<P>
   Day says Duval is one of only two athletes in Britain using the
hypoxic tent, though others around the world are using the
technology and it will probably become more popular. He says this
type of conditioning has no health drawback or hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tried in various formats over the last few years. I
know the East Germans, quite a long time ago ... sealed a house up
and pumped in particular concentrations of oxygen. I believe the
Australians may do something similar, but only on a more high-tech
approach. But in terms of affordability and size, this is a
relatively new approach,'' Day says.
</P>
<P>
   While high-altitude training is known to benefit athletes,
getting to such places is expensive and time-consuming. The hypoxic
tent, which costs about $7,000, means athletes can stay at home to
get the same benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Duval says the hypoxic tent may seem expensive, but it's much
cheaper than having to travel to a high-altitude training center
for three weeks, four or five times each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travel is fairly expensive and accommodation is fairly
expensive and also, you have the problem of coming down from
altitude to sea level to actually do the training part of the whole
process. This system is incredibly portable and relatively cheap
and enables the athlete to live at home, particularly if the
athlete doesn't have a great deal of sponsorship and needs to work
to support himself. This could be an amazing benefit for them,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of home, Duval says his wife accepts the presence
of the tent in their bedroom at their Stafford home. She's a former
athlete who appreciates the necessities of conditioning and on
occasion will even join Duval in his enclosure, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better me being in the U.K. than being away for weeks at
a time. That's my argument,'' Duval says.

LITTLE BILLY GILMAN, AGE 12, HAS NASHVILLE LISTENING
</HEADLINE>
  (Resending to add slug) 
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By DAVE FERMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hi! It's Billy Gilman!''
</P>
<P>
   It's 9 a.m. Monday, and Billy Gilman, the boy wonder of country
music, is on the line _ and sounding very upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   At 12, Gilman's already seen his debut single, ``One Voice,''
hurtle onto ``Billboard'' magazine's country singles chart, and he
replaces Brenda Lee as the youngest artist ever to do so. Just last
week, his debut CD, also titled ``One Voice,'' debuted at No. 4 on
the country charts, vaulting over George Strait, Tim McGraw and
Shania Twain.
</P>
<P>
   And on the phone, he sounds about ... 9 years old. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the (Grand Ole) Opry and my manager called me and it
was my debut on the Opry and I was `flippin' _ it was really
surprising!'' he says breathlessly about the moment he heard the
news about his single. ``I, like, froze!''
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable. Becoming one of the hottest young stars in
Nashville before you're old enough to shave or drive isn't
something you can prepare for _ although in several ways, the tiny
(4 feet 7 inches), blond-haired Gilman really has been rehearsing
for this nearly all his short life.
</P>
<P>
   While growing up in suburban Providence, R.I., he listened to
Tammy Wynette, George Jones, Eddie Arnold and other classic country
artists. Singing along with a Pam Tillis video led to performing at
local functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wanted to do this when I was 7,'' Gilman says.
``After a show, I was asked if I had ever made a record and I was
like, `I'm 7 years old,' and that was the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a series of introductions, Asleep at the Wheel's Ray
Benson became a fan, and cut a demo with Gilman in Austin, Texas.
Benson then introduced him to to Scott Simon, who manages Tim
McGraw, among others. Blake Chancey, Sony Nashville's senior vice
president of artist and repertoire, flew to Providence, where
Gilman was opening a show for Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing Blake said to us was, `I'm going to play you
this tape _ I want you to talk me out of this,' '' says Michael
Kraski, senior vice president of sales and marketing for Sony
Nashville. ``We couldn't. We weren't looking to sign a child, but
he's not a contrivance. He's a prodigy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``One Voice,'' song and CD, were recorded in short order;
Chancey produced the CD with David Malloy (Reba McEntire, Eddie
Rabbit) and Don Cook (Brooks &AMP; Dunn, Lonestar). No surprises here:
The CD features several tried-and-true pop or country staples,
including Tammy Wynette's ``'Til I Can Make It On My Own'' and
Bobby Goldsboro's ``Little Things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One Voice,'' though, is clearly the standout track. Written by
Malloy and Cook, it's a sentimental pining for the way life used to
be, and should be, complete with references to the golden rule and
kids riding their bikes to school. ``What I'm trying to do with
`One Voice,''' Gilman says earnestly, ``is hopefully get all the
violence out of the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation for Gilman was primed with a well-received
appearance this spring at the Academy of Country Music Awards; when
``One Voice'' charted several weeks ago, Gilman was still 11, so he
edged out Lee, who was 12 when she first made the country charts.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lee, Gilman often edges into rockabilly territory. Unlike
her, though, he has to worry about his voice breaking: On several
tracks, he sounds like a young woman. Is he worried?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we're looking at that,'' he says. ``But with the proper
voice training, I'll be able to hit the high notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Proper voice training? Do 12-year-olds really talk this way?
Gilman does. He peppers his speech with several such adult phrases;
unlike other young musicians, he is enthusiastic and expansive.
Sony, Kraski says, is betting that his appeal will cut across age
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that show in Providence, grown women were coming up to the
stage and laying bouquets at his feet,'' Kraski says. ``Country is
adult-driven music _ the core audience is a 35-year-old female. We
feel we'll connect with preteen females and moms. But we've found
he has gotten response from dads and teen-age boys _ and teen-age
females.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gilman hasn't even started touring to support his hit. He
doesn't know who he'll be touring with _ there are no Fort
Worth-Dallas dates on the schedule yet _ and these days he's doing
TV shows (he's off to Los Angeles to do ``The Tonight Show With Jay
Leno'') and then starting work on a Christmas CD.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing much, it seems, gets him down, not even after being hit
in the face by a golf ball recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible,'' Gilman says. ``I hit a ball right next to a
creek and one kid hit his ball across the river facing the creek.
It hit me right in the mouth. I held my mouth and closed my eyes
and my tooth fell out. It was gross! We put it (the tooth) right in
and it'll take six to eight weeks to heal. I feel great. I'm really
getting back on my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, anyway, nothing seems to slow Gilman down.

<P>
   BAINBRIDGE ISLAND, Wash. _ The ferry from Seattle is 10 minutes
from landing as first light slips through the silvered mist of
Puget Sound, and Ron Sims is still not sure what face he will
present to the world this day.
</P>
<P>
   Two school assemblies in Kitsap County, barely 10 miles across
the water but a world removed from King County, the one Sims
governs, will hear him. The question is: which Ron Sims will take
the stage?
</P>
<P>
   At a time when so much of politics is about conveying the
authentic personal narrative, Sims is a natural storyteller with a
compelling one to offer, a bootstrap tale about a journey from
anger to open arms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet friends and advisers have long urged him to keep a large
part of that story _ race _ bottled up, even if it is the one thing
that deeply affects how people view him. It would do him no good to
talk about it, they say. Especially if he personalizes it. The way
to succeed is to be seen but not seen. Flesh without color. What
people want to hear from the second-highest-ranking elected
official in the state are his views on property taxes, traffic,
growth.
</P>
<P>
   On this January day, however, Sims has been asked to talk about
race, and he is tempted, he says, to throw caution aside, to let
them see it through his eyes. But do they really want to hear what
it is like for a black politician to live in two worlds?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding?'' he says, laughing. ``I lead a dual life. I
struggle with it every day. There is Ron Sims the person and Ron
Sims the public official. And my greatest fear is that in order to
govern, I will end up divesting myself from who I really am.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington does not look like a state where a nonwhite
politician would have to anglomorph to succeed. The old boundaries
of race and power appear to be fading. When he was sworn in as King
County executive three years ago, Sims became one of three
nonwhites holding the top political jobs in the state. The others
were Gary Locke, the nation's first and only Chinese-American
governor, and Norm Rice, Seattle's mayor, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   Asian-Americans have been elected to high office in Washington
state for 20 years, and black mayors have won not just in the
heavily Democratic Puget Sound area but in the overwhelmingly white
and Republican eastern part as well _ all this in a state that is
89 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters say that by putting a Chinese immigrant's son and
two descendants of slaves atop the governing pyramid of the state,
Washington state has transcended race; in the new century, in the
New West, the expressed hope is that politics has shed its color
barriers, and even its color consciousness. Not long after electing
Locke in 1996, the voters threw out all laws allowing Washington to
hire based on racial preference. No more affirmative action.
Competence was all that mattered. End of subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, people think we are beyond prejudice here,''
said Locke, 50. ``Certainly growing up in Seattle I never felt any
overt racism. And I think that's because of our newness. We are a
young state, open to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the old racial order _ of whites always on top _ has
eroded, a more complex one has replaced it. Now the system rewards
nonwhites who know how to make the largely white electorate see in
them what the voters see in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Locke, a popular Democrat seeking re-election this year,
has played up his family story _ an American immigrant's tale about
coming from poverty in China to a country where the Chinese had
long been barred.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Sims has concluded that the best way to get people to
listen to him in a state that is barely 3 percent black is to
shatter assumptions about black politicians and become an expert in
what the white majority cares about most.
</P>
<P>
   RESISTING STEREOTYPES
</P>
<P>
   When Sims was first elected to a county legislative post more
than 10 years ago, he was taken aside by Sam Smith, a Seattle
councilman and the dean of the city's black politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you sit on no health and human services committee,''
Smith warned him, Sims recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He followed his mentor's advice. ``And if you look at what Gary
Locke and Norm Rice have done, they took the same path,'' Sims
said. ``We all became budget chairmen _ the opposite of the
stereotype.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims, 51, has since become a national expert on the life cycle
of Pacific salmon, a Northwest icon now in decline.
</P>
<P>
   Locke knows stereotypes too. It was not so long ago, in the
mid-1980s, that a few former colleagues in the state Legislature
were not sure if he was Japanese or Chinese and, in any case,
assumed his family was no friend of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said: `Your people disrupted my life. I had to go off and
fight because of your people,''' Locke recalled. His people _
actually, his father _ also fought, also in an American uniform,
against the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Chinese-American governor has not heard or seen
what the African-American county executive has _ the kind of thing
usually transmitted in a code that has become ever more
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will call me an `inner-city politician' whenever they
want to remind someone of my race,'' Sims said. No matter that he
grew up in the less populated, nearly all-white eastern part of the
state and now spends most of his time talking about suburban
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Locke lived in public housing as a boy in a
racially mixed part of Seattle; he is by far the more ``inner
city'' political leader. But that label has never been pinned on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Charting a course through the racial terrain of the
post-civil-rights era is tricky, Sims said. He saw what happened to
his best friend, Rice, when as a black mayor he tried to step out
of the urban political box by running for governor. And he has seen
how Locke, who defeated Rice in the Democratic gubernatorial
primary, has used a favorable public perception of Asian-Americans
to advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But Sims cannot change his skin color, and if he tries to follow
Locke to the governor's mansion in four years, he has to find a way
on his own, he said. Asked by a reporter to talk about that
exploration, he did so over several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't deny your race,'' he said at one point. ``But it's
there. It's always there. It's like a huge anchor around your neck,
even though nobody ever asks about it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-RACE-POLITICS-ABRIDGED-ART-$ADV20-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; BAINBRIDGE ISLAND, Wash.: about it.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Black politicians have learned certain approaches, he said:
``One thing we do is called the get-over technique. You know how
the world sees you. But in order for them to get-over it, you speak
their language.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best minds in American politics have told him as
much, saying that if he wants to be governor, he has to stay out of
the race zone. Be a black who does not run as a black, in the words
of Frank Greer, a political consultant who helped L. Douglas Wilder
of Virginia become the only black ever elected governor in the
United States. Keep it neutral, upbeat, informed, the way he talks
about salmon.
</P>
<P>
   This day will be different, though. Sims has been asked by his
hosts to talk about something other than salmon or sewers. The
person and the politician will be one.
</P>
<P>
   HISTORY LESSON VS. LIFE LESSON
</P>
<P>
   A sea of white faces awaits Sims at Woodward Middle School on
Bainbridge Island. A murmur rolls through the assembly as the King
County executive walks in.
</P>
<P>
   On Bainbridge Island, an outpost of new wealth and settled
rhythms, blacks are a novelty, but throughout this side of Puget
Sound, racial troubles still surface. At a high school basketball
game in the southern part of the county a few days earlier, some
boys chanted ``Go rob a liquor store!'' at visiting black players
from Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Spokane, where a slim 1 percent of the population
of 175,000 was black, Sims felt the daily rub of racial
humiliation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a kid who used to run by our house every afternoon
and shout, `Nigger, nigger, nigger,' and then run off,'' Sims said.
He did not repeat that story to the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Sims approaches the microphone to polite applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you know who Harriet Tubman is?''
</P>
<P>
   The students are blank-faced. A boy raises his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, wasn't she a slave?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes! What else?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She got the underground railroad going or something?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very good. What's your name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Zack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, Zack. Stand up, please. Why did slaves have to be smuggled
north?''
</P>
<P>
   Zack turns red and stammers. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims tells the students about a Supreme Court decision. They
grow fidgety. Where does he go with this?
</P>
<P>
   ``A slave was still a slave back then because the Supreme Court
ruled that they were property. Not human beings. Property. So if
slaves are property, what does that make Harriet Tubman?''
</P>
<P>
   No hands go up.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an outlaw!'' he says. ``A thief. If slaves are
property, as the Supreme Court has ruled, Harriet Tubman was a
thief. They should have arrested her, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Sims is pacing, microphone in hand, trying, it seems, not to
lose the audience. His aim is to bring the story around to Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., a onetime outlaw. How to make it matter to
the Pokemon generation?
</P>
<P>
   ASIAN IN THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION
</P>
<P>
   To see the current occupants of the governor's mansion in
Olympia is to realize how much this state has changed. A century
ago Asians were considered such a threat to white employment that
they were marched out of their homes at gunpoint and told never to
return. And not quite 60 years ago, Asian-Americans were again
uprooted, this time forced into internment camps.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gov. Gary Locke lives amid Chippendale mirrors and
windows fashioned after those at Monticello. For him, it is a
return to public housing, albeit with 27 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   On becoming Washington's 21st governor, Locke noted in his
inaugural address that his grandfather had worked as a houseboy
less than a mile from the Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a hundred years to go one mile,'' Locke said. ``But
it's a journey that could only take place in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Now some Asian-Americans hope that Locke will run for president
one day.
</P>
<P>
   Locke rarely uses the bully pulpit for social change. But he did
make a public fuss for an issue that touched his own life:
affirmative action. Were it not for a race-conscious admissions
policy, he said, he would not have gone to Yale. But though he
spoke against a 1998 ballot measure rolling back affirmative
action, the voters went their own way, removing racial preference
from state hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Sims, Locke says he lived a childhood virtually free of
racial insults, living as he did in a melting pot. What made him
realize that he was thoroughly American, he said, was when his
parents took him to Hong Kong at the age of 10 to stay with his
maternal grandparents and learn Chinese customs. He was appalled by
the squalor he saw.
</P>
<P>
   It was when he left Seattle, at the height of the Vietnam War,
that Locke began to understand how some people in his own country
considered him foreign, if not the enemy. As he was leaving for
Yale, he and his parents, waiting in the airport, were confronted
by an American soldier, who cursed them and called them gooks.
</P>
<P>
   Locke won a seat in the state Legislature in 1982, then rose
swiftly to budget chairman. In 1993 he defeated an incumbent to
become the King County executive.
</P>
<P>
   His rise excited the pan-Asian community, an unusual alliance of
Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos, Vietnamese and Pacific Islanders who
make up about 6 percent of Washington's population. But Locke's
heritage was rarely mentioned, in press accounts or by opponents,
during any of his seven campaigns. His public life followed the
unspoken rule for nonwhites in American politics: to be successful,
be race neutral.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE `ANGRY' BLACK MAN
</P>
<P>
   In the turbulent '60s, Sims was one of a handful of black
students who pushed for change at Central Washington University,
challenging teachers and administrators on curriculum and
admissions policies. He wore a dashiki, grew an Afro and quoted
Malcolm X.
</P>
<P>
   He questioned not only authority but his own core beliefs. He
once wrote a term paper on how Christianity had justified slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely does the old indignation seep out now. At a public
hearing on land use in the new suburbs east of Seattle two years
ago, a man stood up and shouted, ``Ron Sims, you are nothing but
bought and sold to special interests!''
</P>
<P>
   Sims shot back: ``There hasn't been a member of the Sims family
bought and sold since my great-grandfather was a slave. And this
member of the Sims family isn't for sale today.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter describes Sims as angry in a public debate, he
will challenge the characterization. ``That's code,'' he said. ``A
black man who is angry is a lethal label in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING ON THE RECORD, NOT RACE
</P>
<P>
   When Sims is unsure of himself, he turns to the friend who
served as best man at his wedding, Norm Rice, now 58.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways Rice set the standard for how a nonwhite politician
could govern in the Pacific Northwest. In two terms, he become one
of Seattle's most successful mayors. Under Rice, the city rebuilt
its downtown and improved its schools, the job and housing markets
boomed, crime plummeted and tax revenue rolled into city coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Going from mayor of the state's biggest city to governor seemed
a logical next step for Sims in 1996. But he faced a formidable
primary opponent in Gary Locke, then the King County executive.
</P>
<P>
   A big question mark was race. Neither man had mentioned the
subject in earlier campaigns. But this would largely be a contest
between an Asian-American and an African-American.
</P>
<P>
   How much attention should be drawn to a candidate's race?
</P>
<P>
   Rice's supporters were divided on that question, but Rice wanted
to run on his record at the helm of the good ship Seattle. He
believed that when race was brought up directly, even in the
context of defeating bigotry, it could backfire, because then
people would be asked to vote for a black man instead of a mayor
who happened to be black. ``I won't go there,'' he told an aide.
</P>
<P>
   LETTING RACE PLAY A ROLE
</P>
<P>
   Gary and Mona Lee Locke were married in 1994. She was a novice
in the nuances of politics, but as a filmmaker and former
television reporter, she knew how to use television to tell a
story. And rather than play down his Chinese background, she
advised her husband, he should use it.
</P>
<P>
   For Locke, it was a logical decision, part of his political
evolution as he reached beyond his base of support to a statewide
electorate less familiar with him. ``You can't hide your race,'' he
said. ``My hair, my eyes, my skin color: people look at me and know
I'm Asian.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gary Locke who was introduced to voters in 1996 was now
married, visibly happy and even openly affectionate with his new
wife. And suddenly he was calling himself ``a person of color.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether speaking to apple farmers in Yakima, Rotarians in
Spokane or suburban moms in Bellevue, he had a simple refrain when
he brought up his family history: ``I am Chinese, but I am
thoroughly American.''
</P>
<P>
   His self-description went to the heart of old white fears about
the Chinese in America: that their true allegiance was to the
ancient nation across the Pacific. He emphasized his biography the
entire campaign, first for the Democratic nomination, when a black
mayor, Rice, was his main opponent, and then in the general
election, when he faced Ellen Craswell, a white Republican and
Christian conservative of the far right.
</P>
<P>
   Locke crushed Rice in the primary. The Seattle mayor won only
two small counties, far away from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Then Locke beat Craswell by nearly 20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   LEGACIES AND LATITUDES
</P>
<P>
   Locke's first year as governor was euphoric. President Clinton
put him under the spotlight in a State of the Union speech. The
governor and his wife went to China, where they were mobbed,
attracting more attention than Mel Gibson, who was making a movie
there.
</P>
<P>
   While Locke was gathering high approval ratings as governor,
Sims was learning the job that Locke had given up, touring the
housing developments and strip malls of a fast-growing King County.
</P>
<P>
   Rice left politics after his second term as mayor, at the end of
1997. He is now the director of the Federal Home Loan Bank in
Seattle. When he talks about the governor's race, he attributes his
loss to no one but himself; he just ran a weak campaign, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when asked what the campaign had taught him about racial
politics today, this normally gregarious man struck a different,
more cautious note. ``I think that if people have a choice between
an African-American and an Asian-American, they will probably
choose the latter,'' he said. ``Whether people want to admit it or
not, there is a hierarchy of race.''
</P>
<P>
   In four years, Sims may run for governor. There is no way to
know how voters would react. If he told his racial story, would he
win as Locke had? If he went the race-neutral route, would he lose
as Rice had?
</P>
<P>
   A POLITICIAN GETS PERSONAL
</P>
<P>
   On this January day, Sims' next stop is a much bigger audience,
more than a thousand students at Bainbridge Island High School.
</P>
<P>
   There he tells a story not about his family's past but about the
present, and perhaps about the future. He is married to a woman
from the Philippines, he tells them, and what an eye-opener that
has proved to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told my friends I was in love, they said, `You know
those Filipino women carry knives in their purses.' And when we
married, boy, did we get it from all sides _ her family and my
family. We were outcasts.''
</P>
<P>
   He has now been able to see America from an immigrant's point of
view, he says, and his wife, Cayan Topacio, has come to understand
how a native-born black sometimes has to strain for respect. Their
12-year-old son looks more black than Asian, and in watching how
people react to him, Topacio says, she has learned something about
the attitudes of her adopted country. Blacks are treated different
from Asians, she says, ``in little everyday ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims ends his second talk with a request. ``You kids are told
all the time to be tolerant,'' he says. ``Well, don't be tolerant
of me because I'm African-American. That really bugs me. Either
include me or exclude me.''

<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ With the Republican National Convention two weeks
away, Gov. George W. Bush began trying to build excitement about it
Monday in his playful, teasing manner, saying for the first time
that he was closing in on his selection of a running mate and
letting his advisers dribble out details about the five-day trip he
would make to the event.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday morning in Little Rock, Ark., where
he campaigned before heading here, Bush said that he could no
longer pretend he was not busily winnowing the field of vice
presidential possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of saying the list is shrinking and growing are
over,'' Bush said, with a broad smile, referring to the coy refrain
he has been using to answer questions about his deliberations.
``I'm getting closer to a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor shed no light on what that decision would be,
but the possible timing of it was made clearer in the details that
his advisers released about the trip Bush would make to
Philadelphia, where the four-day convention begins on Monday, July
31.
</P>
<P>
   Karen P. Hughes, the director of communications for the Bush
campaign, said the governor would leave Austin on July 28 and
arrive in Philadelphia on Aug. 2, the day before he formally
receives his party's presidential nomination and makes his
acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes also said Bush would probably introduce his running mate
in Austin, which suggested that the announcement would come just
before Bush was scheduled to leave town, perhaps sometime in the
middle of next week. But she added that nothing was confirmed, and
that Bush still had not decided when he would announce his running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   The route that Bush will take to the convention, making stops
along the way, will begin in Arkansas, and then move on to
Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that the Republican presidential nominee has lost all
five of those states in the last two presidential elections, but
Bush believes he can prevail in each one. Bush's father won all but
West Virginia in winning the 1988 election.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said other states could be added to the trip.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference Monday, Bush also repeated a promise that
he and his advisers had already made: that this Republican
convention would not look, feel or sound like previous ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a convention that is going to have some new
wrinkles to it,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to plans to devote each night to a different
theme, to keep the oratory generally upbeat and to skip the
practice of devoting one night to attacks on the other party's
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Bush's advisers said Monday that immediately after
the convention the Texas governor would probably travel by train
for several days of whistle-stop campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats, whose national convention will
be in the middle of August, are working to make the spotlight that
these events throw on the political parties and their presidential
nominees last as long as possible. Vice President Al Gore is
expected to campaign by boat through key states in the Midwest
after the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   Before Bush's news conference in Little Rock, he unveiled a
modest proposal designed to cast himself as an especially
compassionate conservative, and he discussed it briefly at a
private social services agency where he was flanked by several
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that if he were elected president, he would direct the
Department of Health and Human Services to encourage states to set
up registries for the fathers of children born out of wedlock, but
he did not call for any new federal spending to be directed
explicitly toward that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Bush started such a registry in Texas in 1997, and he said it
served one of two benefits, either encouraging fathers to take
responsibility for their children, or making it easier, if these
fathers chose not to do that, to get their children adopted.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush campaigned in Arkansas and Wisconsin on Monday, he also
continued to raise money for the Republican Party, bringing in an
estimated $1.4 million at four events.

   BALTIMORE _ After peering at an African fertility headdress, a
noted Degas bronze and several oils depicting plump and rosy nymphs
cavorting in veils, Girl Scout Troop 1597 from Davidsonville, Md.,
paused before a painting called ``The Widow'' by George Bellows and
gazed at its pale, drawn subject.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was old rather than young and her eyes were as
intensely blue as her folded hands were bony. She was swathed in
solid black and her expression was anything but coy. What did the
scouts make of this haunting portrait? asked Dr. Miriam Arenberg
and Dr. Beth Williams-Plunkett, psychologists, during a tour of the
Baltimore Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``She isn't happy?'' one girl almost whispered.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hasn't been eating?'' another chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looks like she just lost a family member and is so sad she
can't eat,'' suggested Alix Surber, who, like most of the girls in
her troop, was 11 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes!'' Williams-Plunkett said. ``You see, usually, losing
weight is a sign that something is very, very wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it went on a Sunday afternoon not long ago when several
Girl Scout troops and more than 50 other girls and women attended a
program called ``Feast, Famine and the Female Form: Exploring Body
Image Through Art.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, part of a national campaign to prevent eating
disorders, warned its young participants about the pitfalls of
excessive dieting and taught them that women's bodies need a
certain amount of fat to be fertile. At one work of art after
another, the recurring theme was that despite culture's obsession
with thinness, beauty comes in all shapes and sizes.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be little doubt among psychologists that women,
men and even children are feeling worse than ever about the way
they look, especially about their weight. Several studies in the
mushrooming field of body-image research have documented growing
dissatisfaction with appearance and linked it, in part, to the
relentless parade of reed-thin figures in magazines, billboards,
movies and sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   Even denizens of the Fiji Islands are no longer immune to slim
envy, according to a recent Harvard study that showed an increase
in eating disorder symptoms among teen-age girls there after the
introduction of Western television.
</P>
<P>
   What elevates the issue above mere vanity is that having a poor
body image is now considered a reliable predictor of future eating
disorders, including anorexia, bulimia and binge eating.
</P>
<P>
   Although obesity is the greater concern numerically, anorexia is
the psychiatric illness with the highest mortality rate,
psychologists say. (An estimated 10 percent to 15 percent of all
children are overweight, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention; and the National Institute of Mental Health
estimates that 3 percent of young women have eating disorders.)
Because of the serious implications, the self-perceptions of young
women have become the focus of intense research and inspired a
variety of programs, like the museum tour, to challenge unhealthy
ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the programs use names like Free to Be Me, Go Girls and
Full of Ourselves, and their lessons are as politically charged as
those sassy handles suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cast eating disorders as a social justice issue and teach
weightism as a form of prejudice,'' said Dr. Catherine
Steiner-Adair, a clinical psychologist and director of education,
prevention and outreach at the Harvard Eating Disorders Center.
</P>
<P>
   Go Girls is a 12-lesson course promoting media literacy
developed by Eating Disorders Awareness and Prevention, a nonprofit
group in Seattle. It has been sold to dozens of high schools around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   It encourages girls to evaluate commercial images critically and
to protest offensive messages by writing to sponsors and boycotting
them. The effectiveness of the two-year-old program is being
evaluated by a team of research psychologists. Its developers also
sponsor the museum tour in Baltimore, which began as a yearly event
and is now a regular program because of demand.
</P>
<P>
   In the St. Paul, Minn., area, Dr. Dianne Neumark-Sztainer, an
epidemiologist, is seeking financing to expand a similar course in
media advocacy, Free to Be Me, which she ran last year in a dozen
Girl Scout troops.
</P>
<P>
   When she compared the attitudes of the fifth- and sixth-grade
scouts with those of their counterparts in a dozen other troops,
Dr. Neumark-Sztainer, who teaches at the University of Minnesota's
School of Public Health, found that the girls in the intervention
program were less likely to obsess about being thin.
</P>
<P>
   And recently, the Harvard Eating Disorders Center completed a
three-year study of 1,800 girls ages 8 to 14.
</P>
<P>
   The girls, from New England and Oklahoma, were surveyed before
and after a program called Full of Ourselves: Advancing Girl Power,
Health and Leadership. The four-month course was taught in physical
education classes, at lunch and in after-school programs. It
addressed, among other topics, the natural weight gains that occur
in puberty and ways to tell the difference between physical and
emotional hunger.
</P>
<P>
   Although the program's long-term effects remain to be seen,
preliminary results show that the girls who took the course
increased the self-esteem and willingness to defend victims of
teasing, Steiner-Adair said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we've known for years that anorexic chic is damaging to
girls, why haven't we removed it?'' Steiner-Adair said. ``From my
perspective, we cannot afford to wait for Hollywood and the fashion
industry to take on girls' poor body image.''
</P>
<P>
   But other recent research shows that blame for fat phobia can be
shared. Pressure from parents and peers to be thin and to look good
may be as big a culprit as the media in undermining developing body
images, said Dr. J. Kevin Thompson of the University of South
Florida in Tampa. And teasing _ especially by girls' fathers and
older brothers _ is emerging as a powerful influence on those who
feel bad about their bodies, Thompson and others said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Appearance is more important in our society than ever,'' said
Thompson, who is studying why some people internalize a culture's
thin ideals and others do not.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Body image disturbance became a subject of research about 15
years ago, within studies of eating disorders, but now is
considered a psychiatric illness of its own. Many people may covet
a supermodel's face and figure as they pass a magazine rack,
Thompson and others acknowledged. But when they become so
preoccupied with appearance that they spend more time grooming and
exercising than working and seeing friends, then clearly something
is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In the most extreme form of body image disturbance _ known as
body dysmorphic disorder _ people become reclusive and resort to
multiple plastic surgeries to correct flaws that are either
imagined or exaggerated. More commonly, body image disturbance
leads to depression, social anxiety and sexual dysfunction, said
Dr. Thomas F. Cash, a psychologist at Old Dominion University in
Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Cash, regarded as a pioneer in the field, has developed an
eight-step body image improvement program that can be used with a
therapist or alone. The program begins by analyzing how the problem
started and how it affects the patient's daily behavior. Then it
trains the patient to appreciate her body's functions and
sensations more than appearance; being able to give birth and enjoy
dancing, for example, have little to do with looking perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Cash says he is skeptical of the array of eating disorder
prevention programs that don't delve into the underlying issue of
poor body image. The programs, he added, have shown mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would argue that just giving people information on eating
disorders and its risks and consequences without actually helping
people change their at-risk behaviors and beliefs is unlikely to
have much impact,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though the museum tour in Baltimore was only an hour long, it
clearly echoed Cash's emphasis on function over form. Sometimes,
Williams-Plunkett and Arenberg had to persist to make their point.
At the fertility headdress, for example, it took several minutes
for Arenberg to train the scouts' attention on the sculpture's
hard-to-miss breasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not only large but very pendulous,'' Arenberg noted,
unable to coax any comments from the embarrassed sixth grade girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pendulous means sagging,'' Williams-Plunkett added brightly.
``And what is one of the most wonderful things a woman's body can
do for her?'' she pressed on. ``Having babies and feeding the
babies. But anorexic women can't have children or feed them because
they don't have the body fat.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the tour, the scouts sounded like seasoned
critics. Seated before Robert Colescott's huge modern painting ``At
the Bathers' Pool (Venus Is Still Venus),'' they noticed right away
that the four African-American nudes on the canvas were focused on
the only white nude. In Colescott's parody of beauty images, the
icon is a thin blonde with big breasts and legs so long she towers
above the other figures. The scouts quickly grasped the artist's
sardonic message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like they might be worshipping her,'' remarked Hilary
Loechel, one of the scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her hand's on her hip, like she's saying, I'm proud,'' added
Sara Klug.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' concluded Arenberg, ``this is a very graphic way of
showing whose standards of beauty dominate.''

WILL MILLER BE `HOWARD'S GHOST'? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, CALIF. _ Dennis Miller is clever, iconoclastic,
sometimes irritating, sometimes insightful, and always ready to
indulge a penchant for polysyllabic pontification.
</P>
<P>
   All of which may remind ``Monday Night Football'' devotees of a
certain broadcasting legend who forever will be identified with the
program. So when viewers tune in July 31 for Miller's debut on the
Hall of Fame preseason game between the Patriots and 49ers, should
they expect a contemporary version of Howard Cosell?
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday Night Football'' producer Don Ohlmeyer, who startled
the football world by anointing the comedian as a pigskin analyst
on the NFL's signature broadcast, insists not. But Miller himself
seems to identify with Cosell in at least one key respect: Neither
played the game, literally or figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my years of watching television, I thought he was one of
the five most riveting personalities I've ever seen,'' Miller told
TV critics gathered here for a semi-annual meeting. ``I would defy
anybody to say that most of their sports memories, most of their
most riveting ones _ `Down goes Frazier,' stuff like that _ it
comes from Cosell.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he found Cosell ``an alternatingly loutish
individual'' who was ``able to articulate the sensitivity of the
human condition in the next breath,'' adding that he was fascinated
by ``that juxtaposition of this incredible, almost narcissistic
figure with this guy who really got what it was like to be a human
being at the core.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact, too, that he said right up front, `I never
played the game.' I sort of think you can't fight that. We never
did. So you have to steer into the direction of the skid. And
Cosell seemed proud of his lack of playing bona fide sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond a shared lack of first-hand gridiron experience, Miller
displays a Cosellian indifference to the number of people who
simply don't like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm going to have the sort of career where some people
dislike me,'' he shrugged. ``As long as they come into the tent to
actively dislike me each week and register a Nielsen number, I'm
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer, for his part, was not eager to embrace comparisons
between Miller and Cosell, with whom the producer worked on the
original ``Monday Night Football.'' He argued that the country and
the sports media have changed beyond recognition from the era when
Cosell's outsized personality captivated and infuriated television
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howard was probably the most outspoken person in the media at
that time,'' said Ohlmeyer. ``And yet, as unique as he was, he
wasn't competing with 24-hours-a-day sports radio, with ESPN, with
Fox Sports, with all the sports that are on television.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by the new ABC team of play-by-play man Al Michaels (the
sole returning figure from last year), analysts Miller and Dan
Fouts, and sideline reporters Eric Dickerson and Melissa Stark,
Ohlmeyer insisted, ``Dennis isn't Howard and Dan is not Dandy Don
(Meredith) and Al is not Frank (Gifford). We are not trying to
re-create the past, we are trying to create something for the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   In another attempt at innovation, Ohlmeyer has requested
permission from the NFL to outfit players with cameras and
microphones, according to Daily Variety.

JOYCE'S ODD LITTLE PLAY WITH MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
  (For use on or after July 19, 2000 by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
Its creators call ``James Joyce's The Dead'' a play with music.
They might just as easily have dubbed it the ``Un-Musical.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title should have been the first clue that ``The Dead,''
despite its Broadway success and critical acclaim, isn't one of
those rock-your- foundation events. Where mega-musicals like ``The
Lion King'' and ``Phantom of the Opera'' are known for their size,
costumes and special effects, ``The Dead'' is positively intimate:
small cast, manageable sets, no stage-swamping production numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a show function like this one,'' says Richard
Nelson, ``The Dead's'' adapter, co-lyricist and director of the
production, which opens tonight at the Ahmanson Theatre. ``I'm
primarily a playwright, so for me it's the person who is the be-all
and end-all. Everything, even the dances, we knew would have to
come out of the character situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto Shaun Davey's music, which isn't likely to leave anybody
with ringing ears or leap off the Top-50 bins at Tower Records. At
one point audiences will see characters converse over the sound of
an on-stage violinist and a cellist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so un-Broadway,'' agrees Stephen Bogardus, who plays
Gabriel Conroy, the play's narrator and central figure. ``And it
really demands a lot from its audiences because the sound is a very
acoustical sound. It's not blown out of the speakers as people are
used to both in movie theaters and in Broadway shows.''
</P>
<P>
   That last remark draws an enthusiastic amen from Bogardus'
co-star, Faith Prince, who, despite her past participation in
several such big musicals, seems to be enjoying ``The Dead's''
quieter ambience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really noticed it last night,'' says Prince, who plays
Gabriel's wife, Gretta. ``I went to see `The Perfect Storm,' and I
was saying, `Oh my God, can they just, like, turn this !ital!down?'
It was just too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, you might say that a couple of hours spent watching a
fishing boat on the gale-tossed Atlantic is a far cry from spending
Christmas Eve in the Dublin living room of two spinster aunts,
circa 1904. And why wouldn't it be? The play's source material,
after all, sprang from the pen of James Joyce, the Irish author
known for cramming pages of minutia-like details into a single day
or event. ``The Dead'' was first a 50-page short story, the last in
the ``Dubliners'' collection. It later became the basis for
director John Huston's final film in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In the story _ which is largely unchanged from the the film and
novella _ Gabriel and Gretta are among those in attendance at a
Christmas party hosted by Gabriel's aunts Kate and Julia Morkham _
a gathering that includes tipsy guests, poignant toasts, a hint of
Irish nationalism and, yes, plenty of music. Characters sing and
dance for each other _ if not necessarily for the audience. The
play reaches its climax later in an expensive hotel where an
occurrence from the party causes Gretta to reveal an incident from
her past that her husband had not known about. That realization
causes a bit of psychological angst in Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have been together probably 10 to 15
years,'' says Bogardus. ``These people probably think they know
each other like the back of their hand. Then for this kind of
secret to come out ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's something she just put away,'' adds Prince. ``It
was tragic for her and, for whatever reason _ not to keep it from
him _ she just put it away, which I can totally relate to.''
</P>
<P>
   To Nelson, little revelations are part of human interaction, and
the relationship we're observing isn't on the brink of collapse.
``The Dead,'' Nelson reminds us, was a story first told by a
26-year-old man intent on exploring the exuberance and confusion of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the story we have is one about a long marriage,'' says
Nelson. ``It's rare to find in world literature a significant work
that's the story of a marriage that's been going on for a long time
and one that doesn't involve some melodramatic infidelity.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarer still is a small-scale musical from literary material that
manages to earn both critical plaudits and a steady audience.
Adapted and directed by award-winning playwright Nelson (``Two
Shakespearean Actors'', ``Goodnight Children Everywhere'') with
music by Davey, ``The Dead'' sold out its limited run off-Broadway
at Playwrights Horizon before moving to Broadway's Belasco Theatre
in January. The New York Times' Ben Brantley called it ``one of the
season's most astonishing and laudable accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogardus and Prince both performed in the New York production,
their paths overlapping for two weeks toward the end of the run.
They replaced Christopher Walken and Blair Brown, the production's
original Gabriel and Gretta.
</P>
<P>
   Bogardus had gotten a peek at an early version of the script,
back when he was under consideration for the role of Freddy Malins,
a part that eventually fell to Stephen Spinella. In the spring, the
producers again contacted Bogardus in Los Angeles. Walken was going
to be taking a three-week break, and they needed a replacement for
Gabriel on very short notice. The actor, who admits he ``couldn't
make sense'' of the version he had read a few months ago, paused
before signing on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was talking on the phone with Richard (Nelson), I told
him I was a little nervous about coming into a show that quickly,''
said Bogardus. ``He said that, unlike other directors who leave a
show once it opens, he would be there for me _ as he was for Faith
_ for all the rehearsals. Based on that, I said I'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't go entirely according to plan. The production
closed after two weeks, leaving Bogardus with a major case of
!italprojectus interruptus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just worked harder than at any time in my professional
career to learn this material and get into the show, and I realized
it wouldn't be until the last couple of shows that I would start
feeling really comfortable,'' he said. ``Then, when it ended after
only two weeks, it was sort of like unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come back here, and get eight weeks at the Ahmanson, I feel
like, `Ah, I'm going to be able to complete this journey.'''
</P>
<P>
   That his co-star is once again Faith Prince, with whom he had
previously worked in William Finn's ``Falsettoland,'' makes the
journey even more comforting. Both actors say the opportunity to
start anew gives them the chance to make the characters their own
rather than trying to duplicate the work of their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you replace, you tend to do what was,'' says Prince,
``but here we've gotten to examine it and come up with our take on
it, through Richard's eyes. It's been great fun to rework it and
make it our own.'' &QL;

   SCOTLAND: NATIONALIST STEPS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National Party, said he was
stepping down after 10 years in the post. The party, which
advocates full independence, had been gaining against the ruling
Labor-Liberal Democrat coalition in the new Scottish Parliament,
and the resignation was a surprise. Salmond, 45, said he expected
the nationalists to win the next election three years from now and
he feared that would ``lock'' him in for another decade.

JOYCE'S ODD LITTLE PLAY WITH MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
  (For use on or after July 19, 2000 by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
Its creators call ``James Joyce's The Dead'' a play with music.
They might just as easily have dubbed it the ``Un-Musical.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title should have been the first clue that ``The Dead,''
despite its Broadway success and critical acclaim, isn't one of
those rock-your- foundation events. Where mega-musicals like ``The
Lion King'' and ``Phantom of the Opera'' are known for their size,
costumes and special effects, ``The Dead'' is positively intimate:
small cast, manageable sets, no stage-swamping production numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a show function like this one,'' says Richard
Nelson, ``The Dead's'' adapter, co-lyricist and director of the
production, which opens tonight at the Ahmanson Theatre. ``I'm
primarily a playwright, so for me it's the person who is the be-all
and end-all. Everything, even the dances, we knew would have to
come out of the character situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto Shaun Davey's music, which isn't likely to leave anybody
with ringing ears or leap off the Top-50 bins at Tower Records. At
one point audiences will see characters converse over the sound of
an on-stage violinist and a cellist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so un-Broadway,'' agrees Stephen Bogardus, who plays
Gabriel Conroy, the play's narrator and central figure. ``And it
really demands a lot from its audiences because the sound is a very
acoustical sound. It's not blown out of the speakers as people are
used to both in movie theaters and in Broadway shows.''
</P>
<P>
   That last remark draws an enthusiastic amen from Bogardus'
co-star, Faith Prince, who, despite her past participation in
several such big musicals, seems to be enjoying ``The Dead's''
quieter ambience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really noticed it last night,'' says Prince, who plays
Gabriel's wife, Gretta. ``I went to see `The Perfect Storm,' and I
was saying, `Oh my God, can they just, like, turn this !ital!down?'
It was just too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, you might say that a couple of hours spent watching a
fishing boat on the gale-tossed Atlantic is a far cry from spending
Christmas Eve in the Dublin living room of two spinster aunts,
circa 1904. And why wouldn't it be? The play's source material,
after all, sprang from the pen of James Joyce, the Irish author
known for cramming pages of minutia-like details into a single day
or event. ``The Dead'' was first a 50-page short story, the last in
the ``Dubliners'' collection. It later became the basis for
director John Huston's final film in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In the story _ which is largely unchanged from the the film and
novella _ Gabriel and Gretta are among those in attendance at a
Christmas party hosted by Gabriel's aunts Kate and Julia Morkham _
a gathering that includes tipsy guests, poignant toasts, a hint of
Irish nationalism and, yes, plenty of music. Characters sing and
dance for each other _ if not necessarily for the audience. The
play reaches its climax later in an expensive hotel where an
occurrence from the party causes Gretta to reveal an incident from
her past that her husband had not known about. That realization
causes a bit of psychological angst in Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have been together probably 10 to 15
years,'' says Bogardus. ``These people probably think they know
each other like the back of their hand. Then for this kind of
secret to come out ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's something she just put away,'' adds Prince. ``It
was tragic for her and, for whatever reason _ not to keep it from
him _ she just put it away, which I can totally relate to.''
</P>
<P>
   To Nelson, little revelations are part of human interaction, and
the relationship we're observing isn't on the brink of collapse.
``The Dead,'' Nelson reminds us, was a story first told by a
26-year-old man intent on exploring the exuberance and confusion of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the story we have is one about a long marriage,'' says
Nelson. ``It's rare to find in world literature a significant work
that's the story of a marriage that's been going on for a long time
and one that doesn't involve some melodramatic infidelity.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarer still is a small-scale musical from literary material that
manages to earn both critical plaudits and a steady audience.
Adapted and directed by award-winning playwright Nelson (``Two
Shakespearean Actors'', ``Goodnight Children Everywhere'') with
music by Davey, ``The Dead'' sold out its limited run off-Broadway
at Playwrights Horizon before moving to Broadway's Belasco Theatre
in January. The New York Times' Ben Brantley called it ``one of the
season's most astonishing and laudable accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogardus and Prince both performed in the New York production,
their paths overlapping for two weeks toward the end of the run.
They replaced Christopher Walken and Blair Brown, the production's
original Gabriel and Gretta.
</P>
<P>
   Bogardus had gotten a peek at an early version of the script,
back when he was under consideration for the role of Freddy Malins,
a part that eventually fell to Stephen Spinella. In the spring, the
producers again contacted Bogardus in Los Angeles. Walken was going
to be taking a three-week break, and they needed a replacement for
Gabriel on very short notice. The actor, who admits he ``couldn't

</P>
<P>
   ``When I was talking on the phone with Richard (Nelson), I told
him I was a little nervous about coming into a show that quickly,''
said Bogardus. ``He said that, unlike other directors who leave a
show once it opens, he would be there for me _ as he was for Faith

</P>
<P>
   Things didn't go entirely according to plan. The production

!italprojectus interruptus.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``To come back here, and get eight weeks at the Ahmanson, I feel
like, `Ah, I'm going to be able to complete this journey.'''
</P>

   That his co-star is once again Faith Prince, with whom he had

GETTING `SOCIAL' ON PBS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Tonight' refers to Wed., July 19, 2000.) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Much has been made of how Ry Cooder ventured into Cuba in search of
musicians who hadn't been heard from for decades (a couple of whom,
in fact, had been thought dead) and rescued them from obscurity
with the recording of the hit CD ``Buena Vista Social Club.''
</P>
<P>
   But, to hear Cooder tell it, the resurrection of careers went
both ways. ``I wasn't doing anything, either,'' Cooder says with a
self-deprecating smile. The fruits of Cooder's inactivity, so to
speak, can be seen tonight on two area PBS stations, when Wim
Wenders' Oscar-nominated documentary ``The Buena Vista Social
Club'' premieres on television.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cooder had been busy before rediscovering the musicians
seen in ``BVSC.'' He had recently won a Grammy for ``Talking
Timbuktu,'' his collaboration with African guitarist Ali Farka
Toure. But his thirst for intoxicating world-music rhythms had
scarcely been slaked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had collected records over the years _ what I could find,''
Cooder recalls. ``They weren't easy to find. A lot of this music _
most of it _ never traveled outside of Cuba at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, Cooder had discovered the music on a cruise to
Cuba. ``In all these intervening years, I thought, `If I don't get
down there someday, I'm going to miss the boat because this
generation's dying off all over the world, and I'll never get close
to this stuff at all.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, serpentine contacts _ friends of friends _ rooted out
the musicians. Pianist Ruben Gonzalez, thought dead and then found
without a piano of his own, erroneously was thought to be too
arthritic to play the instrument. Ibrahim Ferrer was frustrated and
initially unwilling to participate because his career had never
taken off after having been stalled in the early '60s. Compay
Segundo, after a colorful career in the '40s and '50s, had been
dispatched to China to chop down trees as part of a labor exchange
program.
</P>
<P>
   You know the rest: ``Buena Vista Social Club'' sold 3 million
copies worldwide and won a Grammy; it also inspired both Wenders'
popular documentary that revealed the depths of their love for a
music long considered obsolete and a spate of equally soaring solo
recordings from many of the principle artists. In addition to
acclaimed releases by Segundo, Gonzalez and Ferrer (all packaged
very similarly to the original ``BVSC''), Barbarito Torres
(``Havana Cafe'') and Eliades Ochoa (``Sublime Illusion'') have
produced albums; recently, singer Omara Portuondo released a CD
under the ``BVSC'' imprimatur, and Gonzalez has another due soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular bunch is touring in various configurations all
the time now,'' Cooder says (Portuondo will appear in L.A. in
September). ``It's fair to say they could work every day for the
rest of their lives. And they seem to want to do that. They're
happy to be out _ they're going to Japan, they're going to
Australia, they've been to Europe a bunch of times.'' Creature
comforts don't really factor into the equation for the Cuban
musicians, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ibrahim moved into a better apartment _ the holes in the
street are still so big, the cab leaves you off at the corner, and
you have to walk down, but it is better than he had before,''
Cooder says. ''He may even get a phone some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't seem to be about (money) for them,'' he
continues. ``Compay, for instance, people know him wherever he goes
now, and he's so happy about that. He has so much fun being
recognized, so much fun being this great figure who walks out on
stage to a huge roar. This is what's changed the most, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   And for fans who have fallen under the spell of Cuban music, has
Cooder got a Web site for you: Descarga.com, a Brooklyn-based
outlet for far more Latin music than any local megastore could hope
to stock. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``Buena Vista Social Club.'' &QL; 
What: Oscar-nominated documentary on Cuban musicians rediscovering
their muses. &QL; 
Where:KCET and KCVR. &QL; 
When: 8 tonight on KCET and 9 tonight on KVCR. &QL;

   This is the season of the ``beach read,'' and crime novels by
Northwesterner Ridley Pearson are finding their way onto many a
towel spread at water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   Other writers might aspire to have their work on library shelves
or in handsome homes, but having his work right there amid the
sunscreen, the sand granules, the cold drinks and the hot rays is
just fine with the 47-year-old crafter of high-adrenaline page
turners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more of a storyteller than a writer. I'm the first to
admit that,'' Pearson said in an interview. ``I like to write in as
smooth and literary a fashion as I can, but, first and foremost, I
want to entertain you. I want you to forget there's a clock on the
wall. I want you to forget there's laundry in the washer. So having
my books taken on vacation and being considered a `beach read' is a
real compliment. It is certainly better than having what you write
considered a `doorstopper.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson's latest is a heart-stopper at times but never a
doorstopper. ``Middle of Nowhere'' (Hyperion, 375 pages, $23.95)
zings with high-tension narrative electricity, tantalizing twists
of plot, hard-edged realism straight from the headlines, plus such
a welcome return appearance by his two signature characters that
this is Pearson's first hardback to make the national best-seller
lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm doing a little jig today,'' he said, although
the dance was too subtle to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson's Lou Boldt, the knight-errant of a Seattle homicide
lieutenant, is back on the case, assisted by Daphne Matthews, the
Seattle police psychologist of stunning good looks and sharp-witted
insights. Their intense partnership is tested from without and
within, as Boldt's marriage again suffers from this flawed
loyalist's total immersion in work.
</P>
<P>
   Boldt has no choice in ``Middle of Nowhere.'' Seattle police are
staging a sickout, this ``blu flu'' decimating the force and
inviting a rash of thefts and assaults that has the tense Emerald
City teetering on the edge. Few officers remain on the job, and
some who do are subjected to attack, including Boldt, with fellow
officers among the suspects. The threat of retaliation hangs in the
Puget Sound air, along with precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   A police sickout in New Orleans provided some of the impetus for
``Middle of Nowhere,'' as did news reports of prison inmates
getting paid to work as telephone solicitors (a discovery that
satisfied Pearson's pledge, after being interrupted during dinner
by a telephone solicitor, that ``I now know who the next book's
villain will be!''). But the Sun Valley, Idaho, writer _ the first
American to receive the Raymond Chandler Fulbright Scholarship at
Oxford University _ had a larger theme in mind when he started the
novel.
</P>
<P>
   As Pearson stressed, ``Despite these books being seen as genre
fiction, it's still the intent of most writers in this field to
tell a good story and have it be more than some surface cop chase
seen on TV. I always try to start my books with a concept. `Middle
of Nowhere' was to be a story about loyalty and trust, actually the
loss of loyalty and trust, and how that affects the principal
characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, I seized on wanting to isolate Lou Boldt,
professionally, emotionally, and the vehicle I came up with was the
`blu flu.' So I came to Seattle police and wanted to talk to some
isolated officer, and I was led to a gay African American woman _
you probably can't get much more isolated than that _ and she was
marvelous. I put what she told me into Boldt and his situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson is a stickler for realism in his 13 novels, right down
to the latest high-tech innovations (triangulation to track the
user of an analog cell phone in his new novel). The Brown
University graduate's reputation for accuracy has earned him many
fans in blue uniforms, as has his uncanny ability to have his
novels foreshadow upcoming headlines, which often break almost upon
publication.
</P>
<P>
   That started in 1988 when ``Undercurrents'' led to two murder
convictions in Washington after prosecutors linked up with the
oceanographer cited in the acknowledgements of Pearson's novel, an
oceanographer whom the writer had consulted on similar crimes for
his book. This strange prescience has continued in the wake of four
other Pearson novels, with such subjects as high-tech arsons,
illegal adoptions and the deaths of foreign stowaways in cargo
containers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a weird thing,'' Pearson admitted. ``People ask if
I'm psychic, and of course I'm not. It may be nothing more than I
get interested in little things from reading papers so thoroughly.
I read a small item about a cargo container being found in Houston
with human waste and food, and I thought there's my story (``The
First Victim'' in 1999). Halfway through the writing, there was a
container found with dead stowaways in California; three weeks
before publication, there was one found in Tacoma and later more in
Seattle. It is awfully coincidental.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson is a soft-spoken, erudite and earnest fellow, so dead
serious about writing that he devotes 65 hours a week to the task
(but then he also spent eight years writing fiction without earning
a penny).
</P>
<P>
   He has gentlemanly manners and many enthusiasms, including fly
fishing, tree climbing and public service (volunteer teaching at a
nearby alternative high school). He is also a confirmed family man
whose writer's Web site (www.ridleypearson.com) includes a
heart-tugging account of the pilgrimage that he and his wife,
Marcelle, made to China last year to adopt tiny Storey, who joined
a big sister named Paige.
</P>
<P>
   Music has always had a part in Pearson's life, and he plays bass
guitar in the Rock Bottom Remainders, the much-noticed garage band
that includes some of the country's best-selling authors (Stephen
King, Amy Tan, Dave Barry, Barbara Kingsolver) and has raised
$400,000 for charity.
</P>
<P>
   His recollection of his first meeting with other band members is
vintage Pearson: ``I thought it would be little old me with all of
them _ these guys are going to have egos the size of New York, and
I would cower in the corner. But they were all like brothers and
sisters, so normal, so wickedly bright and all so funny. We all
feed off each other. Some of my best friends now have come from
that band _ Dave Barry was even the best man at my wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Remainders hit the road again this fall for gigs in Denver,
Boston and Washington, D.C. It will be a time of considerable
change for Pearson. The writer and his family are moving to St.
Louis, although they will still spend summers in Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
   And after many disappointments from busted Hollywood deals, it
seems likely that Lou Boldt will finally be making it onto the
screen for a series of TV movies on the Arts &AMP; Entertainment
Network. Pearson hopes the two Boldt films a year will be shot in
Seattle, with Richard Dreyfuss probably in the title role (even if
Ed Harris looks more like Pearson's vision of Boldt).
</P>
<P>
   Whoever plays Boldt on film will probably never top what
happened when Pearson met Don Cameron, a veteran homicide sergeant
with Seattle police (since retired) whom the writer had admired and
gotten to interview with the assistance of a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   As Pearson recalled, ``I was buzzed into the homicide office,
and I stopped dead in my tracks _ Cameron looked that close to the
Lou Boldt I had imagined. I had an interview with him in an
interrogation room, and at its close, I said, `If I've stumbled or
gagged in this interview, please forgive me. It's just that you
bear an uncanny resemblance to my character.'
</P>
<P>
   ```I know,' Cameron responded, `I am Lou Boldt, Ridley. I've
read all those books.'''

`TRUE WEST': REPLACEMENTS BROLIN AND KOTEAS LEAVE PLAY FLAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You loved the play. Now see the cartoon!
</P>
<P>
   Thus might an honest advertising writer, driven to desperation,
describe the newly recast revival of Sam Shepard's ``True West'' at
the Circle in the Square Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Two very brave actors, Josh Brolin and Elias Koteas, have taken
over from the production's original stars, Philip Seymour Hoffman
and John Reilly, with results that can most kindly be described as
flattening. What was once a playwright's dream made flesh, a
production in which theatrical exaggeration seemed truer than life
itself, is now a simple comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   When Matthew Warchus' staging of this 1980 study in fraternal
friction opened in March, it was hard to imagine anyone improving
on it. Hoffman and Reilly, largely known for their work in film,
delivered a priceless lesson in symbiotic stagecraft, alternating
in the leading roles of diametrically different brothers who by
degrees turn into each other.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which actor was Austin, the straight-arrow
screenwriter, and which was Lee, the slovenly renegade, you never
doubted the familial attraction and repulsion that kept them locked
in a psychological (and sometimes literal) stranglehold. Something
was definitely going on beneath the skins of these overgrown boys _
who, by the way, didn't look close to identical _ that made the
evening's conclusion deliciously inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Your heart aches for Brolin and Koteas, actors of the same
generation and cinematic background as their predecessors, who have
been placed in the painful position of tampering with near
perfection. For the time being Brolin is Austin, and Koteas is Lee,
with the reversal of parts scheduled for July 26, and they are as
unmixable as oil and water.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lee's grotesqueness and Austin's blandness have been scaled
up. Koteas evokes one of the homicidal yokels from the horror movie
``The Hills Have Eyes,'' while Brolin brings to mind John Davidson,
the eternally clean-cut singer. The actors seem stuck on these
heightened surfaces, composites of traits applied from the outside
rather than arrived at from within.
</P>
<P>
   That the staging remains essentially the same generates an
impression of neophyte dancers following a chart of ballroom steps
before they have found their own rhythms. When Brolin anxiously
hitches up his pants or compulsively dries a dish, it is with the
conscientious air of someone who has remembered to do so. He can
get away with this self-consciousness only in the inhibited
Austin's early scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Koteas takes a more flamboyant approach. Wearing a short
raincoat of the type favored by flashers, this Lee sits and walks
with his legs wide apart. His gestures are correspondingly large
and loopy, and he often tucks his lips over his teeth, perhaps to
conjure the image of the brothers' toothless father. The actor
courts the audience energetically, like a hillbilly clown.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting performances are commensurately larger, too, with
the unctuous movie producer Saul Kimmer (Philip LeStrange,
replacing Robert Lupone) as bizarrely silky as Liberace. Celia
Weston, the one original member of the cast, has broadened the
reactions of the brothers' mother without destroying the
character's essential spirit of bewilderment. She is now easily the
best thing in the show.
</P>
<P>
   It is never a good sign when you can separate actors from their
gestures, unless the playwright is named Bertolt Brecht. Brolin and
Koteas convey the comic sense of Shepard's play but none of its
troubling emotional sensibility. And without the fear beneath the
laughter, ``True West'' just isn't very funny.
</P>

MIDEAST PEACE TALKS INTENSIFY, BUT UNCERTAINTY ABOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ As the Camp David peace summit meeting moved
closer to a supposed deadline of President Clinton's departure for
Japan on Wednesday morning, the White House remained officially
committed to reaching ``an agreement'' before then and talks
shifted into high-drive for a crucial 48-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   But some American, Israeli and Palestinian officials began
lowering expectations Monday for a breakthrough, even suggesting
that additional summit meetings may be needed. And the White House
left ample room for interpretation of its goal, since ``an
agreement'' could include anything from a more modest declaration
of principles to a full-blown accord between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Although American officials had previously said quietly that
Clinton's itinerary could be modified, the White House continued to
declare Monday that he had no intention of delaying his trip to a
Group of 7 meeting in Okinawa or of sending Vice President Al Gore
in his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is to complete the process before the president
goes,'' Joe Lockhart, Clinton's spokesman, said. Later, he added:
``You will know we are following the schedule when you see the
president walk up the steps of the plane, wave and the door
close.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Middle East experts, however, including some officials
on all sides, find it hard to imagine that the Palestinians'
leader, Yasser Arafat, could modify a well-documented personal
history of pushing things to the wire. And in Arafat's case, that
could mean an ultimate deadline not of Wednesday but of Sept. 13,
by which he has pledged to declare a state.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts envisioned the leaders taking a break of a couple
of weeks before reconvening for a continued summit meeting. But
others said that this would be highly risky because it would expose
what has been a completely secret, blacked-out negotiation to the
leaks, misinformation, disinformation and political pressures of
Israel and the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's feasible to do that, to break off and then return,'' said
a senior Israeli official. ``But I'm not sure it's a good idea to
let the energy dissipate. The rumors and false assumptions could
lead to terrible results.''
</P>
<P>
   Yitzhak Herzog, Israel's Cabinet secretary, who is in
Washington, said: ``It's clear that both parties must seize the
moment, not only the moment, but literally the day. We should be
thinking of Wednesday as a once-in-a-lifetime chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Israelis have been putting out the word that Prime
Minister Ehud Barak ``is not going to stay forever at Camp David,''
and expressing frustration that, in their view, Barak has taken
``giant steps'' toward Arafat while the Palestinian leader has
remained unyielding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinians are not showing flexibility and are not going
the extra mile,'' said Yuli Tamir, Israel's dovish immigration
minister who is serving as an Israeli spokeswoman in Washington.
``I think they are pushing Barak to cross his red lines, and I
think they are making a mistake. He will not change his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has professed to be more optimistic than he was
at the start of the summit last Tuesday, Barak is ``more on the
pessimistic side,'' Avraham Burg, the speaker of Israel's
Parliament, told Israel Radio on Monday. Other Israeli ministers
and lawmakers who spoke to the prime minister expressed a similar
impression.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, who voiced unusual optimism late last week, on
Monday hit a peak of frustration, although it may have been
short-lived. One Palestinian official who is not inside Camp David
said that the Israelis seemed to be retreating on expected
concessions and that the Palestinians have told the Americans that
they do not plan to stay beyond Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one senior Palestinian negotiator, Abu Mazen, who is the
Palestine Liberation Organization's senior official after Arafat,
faces a personal deadline. His son, Tarek, is getting married in
Ramallah on Thursday, and the whole Palestinian peace team is
invited and planning to attend.
</P>
<P>
   With Wednesday looming, the pace and intensity of the
negotiations have quickened, and the teams worked well into the
morning until about 5 a.m. before breaking and resuming midday. All
three leaders are night owls, known to thrive in the post-midnight
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian officials outside the talks say that a
kind of high-tension fatigue is setting in. Lockhart said, ``Coming
back continually to the same issues with the same people, that kind
of environment is not always the best for the warm and fuzzies.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel Radio reported Monday night that while key differences
remain on the thorniest issues of Jerusalem and the right of return
of refugees, progress has been made on some relatively minor issues
like water and the environment. Side talks are being held at a
community college in Emmitsburg.
</P>
<P>
   But an American official there said that the side talks could
get only so far without knowledge of the parameters of a core
agreement, and Israeli and Palestinian participants who have
longstanding professional relationships have been crafting and
re-crafting individual paragraphs about civil affairs and economic
relations. Rather than twiddle their thumbs, some Palestinian
officials involved in the side talks have opted instead for long
shopping afternoons at the Pentagon City mall in Virginia where
many are staying, the American official said. (Some have been
seeking wedding presents for Tarek Abbas, Abu Mazen's son.)
</P>
<P>
   Barak summoned a former director-general of the Foreign Ministry
from Israel, Reuven Merhak, who is an expert on Jerusalem. He has
been stationed at Emmitsburg since arriving. But Israeli analysts
took his arrival as a sign that Barak wanted to have close by an
analyst who has thought through all the solutions for sharing the
holy city, including what Burg referred to recently as ``shrinking
and expanding'' Jerusalem _ annexing Jerusalem suburbs in the West
Bank to Israel while relinquishing Palestinian neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The news blackout has held remarkably well through seven days,
which most take as a good sign that no one wants to blow up the
process. Inside Camp David, though, the delegations have ample
access to American newspapers and 60 or 70 television channels,
Lockhart said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I work for a large bureaucratic
organization. It is a great company, and the only problem is that
the raises are not based on merit. I know of several people who
received ``needs improvement'' on their review and were given 5
percent increases, while others received ``meets job requirements''
(two rankings better) and received only 3 percent. Why would a
company do this? C.W.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: One of the best ways to create dissatisfaction,
dissension and distrust is to have a random pay increase system,
but your company does one better, it actually rewards poor
performers and punishes better performers.
</P>
<P>
   It is very difficult to find an acceptable explanation for this
type of system. It is possible that the merit ratings are only part
of the raise system, and other factors, such as tenure or
performance on key projects, are entered into the equation. Even if
there is a decent explanation for your company's practices, the
larger problem, however, is that there is far too much secrecy,
confusion and ambiguity surrounding the raise process itself.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the more likely explanation is that in this large
bureaucratic organization, the pay increase policies have evolved
into a confusing, cumbersome, clunky mess, with different managers
applying different standards and subsequently inconsistent
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning up the pay increase policy is probably on someone's
list of things to do. Perhaps a discussion with your manager or the
human resources director will help get this policy out of the
``needs improvement'' category.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am moving out of this area, and the pay levels where I am
going are lower than what I have been making here. I don't want to
price myself out of the market, and I was thinking of telling
possible employers that my pay is lower than what it really is.
What do you think? S.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: If you want those possible employers to become probable
employers, you should give them accurate information regarding your
current level of pay if they ask for it. When you provide this
information, you can add a comment about the pay differential
between the areas, noting that you are comfortable with the pay
being offered in the new locale.
</P>
<P>
   Most employers understand that there can be a drop in pay when
people relocate to an area with a lower cost of living. In fact, if
you indicate that your pay level at your present job is lower than
what it actually is, the potential employer may wonder why you are
not earning more.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, when the potential employer takes references on
you, your salary level may be discussed. If you have diminished
your pay, you have also diminished your credibility and the
likelihood of your being hired.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about your pay, give the potential employer accurate
numbers. You can add a sentence or two explaining the difference in
pay between the two areas, along with information regarding your
high level of interest in making this move. After all, it sounds
like you are making a move that will pay on in many other important
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a salesman, and I can sell anything. I was recently
downsized from the metal industry because of a merger, and I took a
car salesman job for the time being. I did not finish college, I'm
38 years old, and I do not want to go back to school. The lack of a
college degree comes up every time I apply somewhere. How do I get
around this in a resume so that I can at least get the interview
and sell myself? L.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: As a successful salesperson, you know the importance of
packaging and persistence, and those are two key factors that may
initially help you. In a word, you need to take more of a sales
approach.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, you have a proven product, namely yourself.
Although the customers may question the lack of one feature, i.e. a
college degree, you have clear proof that this product runs
extremely well without one. At the same time, you need to be
absolutely sure that the objection is actually the lack of a
degree, and not something else. The fact is that many companies
jump at the opportunity to hire a professional salesperson, whether
that individual is degreed or not.
</P>
<P>
   From the packaging standpoint, take another look at your resume
and make sure that it is representing you well. In sales parlance,
it is your brochure.
</P>
<P>
   From the persistence standpoint, if you mailed a brochure to a
potential customer, you would probably follow up with a phone call.
You should do likewise after submitting your resume.
</P>
<P>
   The tenacity shown by a sales applicant during the hiring
process can cause him or her to be seen as a good buy rather than a
good bye.

GROUP OF PRIESTS WILL URGE VOTERS TO SUPPORT CANDIDATES WHO OPPOSE
ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
  By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A national organization of Roman Catholic priests will announce
a campaign Tuesday to urge voters to make opposition to abortion
their first priority in choosing candidates to support in the
elections this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, Priests for Life, will make its case with
advertisements in newspapers and on television, according to its
national director, the Rev. Frank A. Pavone of the Archdiocese of
New York. The organization has scheduled a news conference Tuesday
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Although Priests for Life will not endorse candidates or support
a particular party, it will aim part of its message at politicians
who support abortion rights, to try to persuade them to reconsider,
Pavone said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, he said, draws its inspiration for the
campaign from a statement adopted by the nation's Catholic bishops
in November 1998. That statement, titled, ``Living the Gospel of
Life: A Challenge to American Catholics,'' described abortion and
euthanasia as grave threats to civil society, and said political
leaders have a moral obligation to combat them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the scripts for three television commercials the
organization plans to film, one calls for Pavone to quote from the
bishops' statement, urging lawmakers who support abortion rights to
``consider the consequences for their own spiritual well-being, as
well as the scandal they risk by leading others into serious sin.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the script, the commercial is addressed to abortion
rights supporters generally, and does not name any specific
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In the script of another commercial, addressed to voters, Pavone
calls abortion ``the most important issue'' of the political
season.
</P>
<P>
   Pavone said the commercials may be broadcast by late August. He
also said the organization wants to speak not just to Catholics,
but to non-Catholics as well, urging all to be informed about the
election. ``I want the public to understand abortion as it is, as
an act of violence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded nine years ago, Priests for Life has about 6,000 priests
and 40,000 lay people as members, said Pavone, who was given
permission to become its national director by the late Cardinal
John O'Connor, archbishop of New York. He said it has an annual
budget of $4 million, raised through donations.
</P>
<P>
   Its advisory board includes such prelates as Cardinal Alfonso
Lopez Trujillo, president of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for
the Family, Archbishop Charles J. Chaput of Denver and Archbishop
John F. Donoghue of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Priests for Life's plans have drawn the attention of Americans
United for the Separation of Church and State, of Washington, whose
executive director, the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, said that if the
organization singled out specific races or candidates with its
message, the advertisements would violate what the government
allows religious organizations to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's clear that it's a specific, unlawful intervention'' in
a political race, Lynn said, ``we will report it to the Internal
Revenue Service.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony DeStefano, Priests for Life's executive director,
said that the organization would steer clear of such involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been very thorough, not only in consulting our own law
firm, but legal experts in the pro-life movement and in the
church,'' DeStefano said. ``We're on very, very solid ground. We're
not going to be endorsing or attacking any candidates by name,
period.''

CYBER-QUANDARY ASIDE, CONGRESS APPROVES TAX ON MOBILE PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the debate over taxing goods and services sold over the
Internet, a vexing issue has been which jurisdiction's taxes to
apply: The place where the product is shipped? Where it is used?
Where the bill is sent?
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of taxing sales over the Internet have said it can be
impossible to tell where a customer is in cyberspace and, thus,
taxes cannot be applied.
</P>
<P>
   But thorny as that issue has been made to appear, Congress last
week found a way to solve it for that most portable of devices, the
cellular telephone. And there was no dissent.
</P>
<P>
   By voice vote and with White House support, both houses approved
legislation specifying that each cell phone will have a ``primary
service area'' for the purpose of state and local taxes. Users pay
between $4 billion and $7 billion annually in state and local cell
phone taxes, the industry estimates, and sorting out those taxes
has been costly for the companies.
</P>
<P>
   While a customer simply gets a single line on the bill listing
state and local taxes, the cell phone provider must track calls
made as that customer's phone is used in different cities and
states so that taxes can be paid to each jurisdiction, said Chris
Putala, a vice president of the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association, an international group representing the
wireless industry.
</P>
<P>
   For most cell phones the primary service area will be the
address where bills are sent. But in other cases, like phones
issued by national corporations to employees in many locations, a
primary service area will be declared for each phone and will
ordinarily be tied to the area code.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Cowell, executive direct of the E-Fairness Coalition, a
group of merchants advocating uniform application of sales taxes
regardless of whether a sale takes place in a store, by telephone
or online, said the bill's passage made it clear that the Internet
taxation issue could be resolved.

ARMSTRONG, PANTANI TRADE BARBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COURCHEVEL, France _ The war of the roads turned into a war of
the words Monday when Lance Armstrong decided he'd heard enough
criticism from Italian rival Marco Pantani, whom he referred to as
``Elephantino.''
</P>
<P>
   The rift began after last Thursday's Tour de France stage when
the two cyclists reached the summit of Mont Ventoux in the Alps and
Armstrong let Pantani cross the finish line first. No big deal,
said Armstrong; Pantani had ridden a strong race and it was the
``gentlemanly'' thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   But when printed reports said that Pantani had been handed the
win, he felt insulted. He claimed he was stronger than Armstrong at
the summit and won the stage on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Pantani seemed to backpedal after his stage win
Sunday, saying he held Armstrong ``in high esteem,'' the Texan had
heard enough.
</P>
<P>
   A news conference was called Monday, the Tour's day off, for
Armstrong to address the media and talk about his overall lead,
which is more than seven minutes. But it didn't take long for
questions about his relationship with Pantani to come up, and it
didn't take long for Armstrong to light into his rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, in English we say _ oh, I won't say what we say _ but
it's unfortunate that Elephantino is showing his true colors,''
Armstrong said. ``I felt like it was a gift on the Ventoux. And I
also feel like it was a mistake to give the gift. He's a great
racer and a great climber, but after the last few days, his actions
and words are very disappointing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pantani, who often races with a bandanna over his bald head and
wears a gold earring, calls himself ``The Pirate,'' but the French
press had dubbed him ``The Elephant'' (``Elephantino'') for his
large, Dumbo-like ears.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nickname Armstrong liked saying with a snicker Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me that's his official name, because I can't say my name
is, say, `Big Tex,' '' said Armstrong. ``A nickname has to be given
to you by other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, I don't want to make a big issue of this,'' he said in
a gross understatement, ``because Elephantino is here to win stages
and I'm here to win the Tour de France.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I feel pretty comfortable where we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johan Bruyneel, director of the US Postal Service team that
Armstrong represents, said that he told Armstrong it wouldn't hurt
to let Pantani win the stage, since Pantani was 10 minutes behind.
It could even help in later stages, Bruyneel said: ``He could be
more like an ally.''
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy backfired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mistake, and it won't happen again,'' Bruyneel said.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Pantani were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Hamilton of Marblehead, Mass., gave some insight as to how
cyclists spent their day off: ``We had breakfast, got driven down
the mountain, went for a ride for a couple hours, got driven up the
mountain, had lunch, took a short nap, had a massage, saw the
chiropractor, visited with a few friends from Boston.'' It was a
change of pace after racing more than 100 miles every day. ``Well,
for the first time I did miss having my laptop computer with me,''
said Hamilton . . . The Tour will observe a moment of silence
before Tuesday's stage in memory of the 12-year-old boy who was
struck by a car and killed last Friday. Even though the roads are
mobbed with miles of the publicity caravan, cyclists, press cars,
and sponsors' cars, it was the first time since 1988 that a
spectator has been killed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   To demonstrate the pitfalls of blatant prejudice and
discrimination, (beginitalic)X-Men (enditalic)takes us back to the
political sensibilities of the '50s - the 1650s.
</P>
<P>
   The movie starts with a full-blown witch hunt, as a
McCarthyesque figure (Bruce Davison) calmly tells the U.S. Senate
that all mutants must be rounded up and registered. Instead of
bursting into uncontrollable laughter, the extras in the gallery
nod approvingly.
</P>
<P>
   In the same 10 minutes, the movie compares the U.S. government
to Nazi Germany, then supplies a mob waving racist signs to drive
the point home.
</P>
<P>
   Wow. I thought this was supposed to be a movie about a comic
book.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if the filmmakers had stuck to cartoons,
(beginitalic)X-Men(enditalic) might have been better. But probably
not. Unlike the Marvel comic about superpowered mutants, the movie
has a profound case of the stupids.
</P>
<P>
   Example: All the world's leaders are gathering in New York for a
giant conference (this is pounded into our heads with news
reports), but the X-Men literally need a psychic to figure out that
this is the target of their archenemy, Magneto (Ian McKellen, who
does his best though forced to wear a very funny hat).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, despite the world's supposed hatred of mutants,
Professor X (Patrick Stewart) is able to operate a school for
mutant children out in the open, simply by hanging a ``school for
the gifted'' sign out front. Yeah, that ought to fool them.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it's not really clear how much the mutants are being
hounded. The only evidence we have is a guy who kicks Wolverine
(Hugh Jackman) out of a bar. Given that criterion, I might be a
mutant.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, all the silly politics just seem out of place.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the comic was created in the 1960s by Stan Lee, who drew on
the protest-torn era for material. But 40 years later, the same
themes just don't work, especially in what should be a fun
shoot-'em-up.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie fails there, too. The fight scenes are
(beginitalic)Matrix (enditalic)Lite, giving the distinct impression
that the actors spent a lot of time hanging from wires in front of
blue screens. Everybody's floating all over the place, and it just
looks silly. The famous X-Men jet leaves the hangar just once,
maybe because it resembles a plastic toy.
</P>
<P>
   The story is pretty simple: Magneto plans to make war on humans,
and the X-Men try to stop him. In case you miss something, don't
worry, Stewart's character explains everything about three times.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pointless romance between Wolverine and Rogue (Anna
Paquin), whose Southern accent fades in and out throughout the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   There also are too many characters, and they aren't given
anything to do. That's what happens when you use the first movie to
set up an inevitable sequel.
</P>
<P>
   The telepathic Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) does little more than
coo over the beds of various injured X-Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Storm (Halle Berry) spends much of the movie standing around
with a cool haircut. Her big line comes when she fights Toad (Ray
Park of Darth Maul fame).
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what happens to a toad when it's struck by
lightning?'' Storm asks. ``The same thing that happens to
everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the matter of the powers of the X-Men, which don't
seem to click on when needed. As a result, they spend much of the
movie as punching bags for the evil mutants.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, you start rooting for the appearance of
Nightstick Man, who just bonks everybody on the head and is done
with it.
</P>
<P>
   But where's the political message in that?

<P>
   Prozac has never been just any drug.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after arriving on drugstore shelves 12 years ago, Eli
Lilly's antidepressant transcended simple pilldom, becoming instead
a cultural icon.
</P>
<P>
   Hailed as a wonder drug one minute, cast as evil incarnate the
next minute, the green and white capsule has generated multitudes
of lawsuits, and garnered more attention than some presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because Prozac treats the ills of the mind, not the
complaints of the body, it has also served as a kind of public
Rorschach test, a screen upon which Americans project deeply rooted
attitudes about illness, character, biology and free will.
</P>
<P>
   So, perhaps predictably, as the drug edges into adolescence and
Lilly's exclusive patent on the medication nears expiration, Prozac
is once more causing a stir.
</P>
<P>
   More or less at the center of the newest squall are two
psychiatrists, Dr. Joseph Glenmullen, the author of a recently
published book, ``Prozac Backlash'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), and Dr.
David Healy, author of ``The Antidepressant Era'' (Harvard
University Press, 1998). They claim that Prozac and its chemical
cousins are often indiscriminately prescribed and have more serious
and more frequent side effects than the public is aware of or than
the package labeling indicates.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their assertions are old ones, in particular the notion
that the drugs cause some people to become suicidal or violent, an
accusation that Lilly and other antidepressant manufacturers deny
and that has so far failed to persuade juries in product liability
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But Glenmullen, who is on the staff of the Harvard University
Health Services, and Healy, a lecturer in psychological medicine at
the University of Wales College of Medicine, raise new fears. They
suggest that Prozac and similar drugs, like the antipsychotic
medications of the 1950s and 1960s, might pose a significant risk
of neurological side effects, that long-term use of the drugs might
cause brain damage and that future generations might look back on
the antidepressants and other psychiatric drugs, in Glenmullen's
words, ``as a frightening human experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people have been lulled into thinking that they have
no side effects and no risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The contentions of Glenmullen, Healy and other critics, however,
have themselves drawn harsh criticism from scientists, psychiatric
clinicians and mental health groups, who view them as alarmist and
overblown.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists whose studies are cited in ``Prozac Backlash''
to support its thesis said that the author never contacted them
about their work and they strongly disagreed with his conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   And many psychiatrists said they worried that the new dispute
would discourage people with depression from seeking needed
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the statements that Glenmullen makes are simply
outrageous,'' said Dr. Frederick Jacobsen, a psychopharmacologist
in Washington. ``He trashes any benefit of the drugs and
selectively quotes studies in a very biased way.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Prozac and its later-arriving relatives are
dangerous drugs runs counter to the experience of most
psychiatrists and researchers. They see the medications _ which
enhance the availability in the brain of serotonin, a
neurotransmitter believed to be involved in depression _ as useful,
and sometimes lifesaving, tools for treating a variety of
psychiatric disorders.
</P>
<P>
   In their view, the antidepressants have both advantages and
limitations. The drugs, called selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors or SSRIs, are far less lethal in overdose than the older
generation of so-called tricyclic antidepressants, making them more
difficult for depressed patients to use in suicide attempts. And
they lack some annoying side effects of the earlier drugs, like dry
mouth, constipation and weight gain.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 30 percent to 40 percent of patients given the newer
antidepressants receive no benefit from them, a weakness they share
with earlier medications. Studies indicate the drugs may be less
effective than tricyclics for severe depression. And the
medications, like all drugs, have side effects of their own,
including loss of libido and other sexual difficulties, which occur
in anywhere from 36 percent to 75 percent of patients, and a host
of other, mostly mild, adverse reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Their long-term side effects, if any, are less clear. No
scientist can offer an ironclad guarantee that Prozac and its
counterparts _ or for that matter, any other potent drugs _ are
absolutely safe when taken continuously for long periods.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what is known, scientists say, suggests that the medications
are more benign in their long-term impact on the brain than many
other psychoactive drugs. And 12 years of widespread use have
convinced most researchers and clinicians of the antidepressants'
basic safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SSRIs are not innocuous,'' said Dr. Matthew Rudorfer,
associate director for treatment research at the National Institute
of Mental Health's Division of Services and Intervention Research,
``and they should not be used casually. But it's a vast
overinterpretation to say that they are dangerous and should be
avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenmullen and Healy said they were not opposed to the use of
Prozac or similar drugs, and that they prescribed them regularly in
their own practices. But they deplore their use for people whose
complaints are very mild and they criticize physicians who place
patients on the drugs for long periods with little or no
supervision, a trend that has increased under managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly estimates that 38 million people worldwide have taken
Prozac since it was introduced in 1988. And 10.3 million new
prescriptions for the drug were written in 1999, says IMS Health, a
market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people with only mild to moderate symptoms whose
functioning is not compromised,'' Glenmullen said, alternative
approaches, like psychotherapy and exercise, ``are preferable forms
of treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenmullen also educates readers of his book about the
withdrawal effects _ including nausea, vertigo, flu-like symptoms,
mood swings and irritability _ that can result if newer
antidepressants are stopped too abruptly. (Prozac, which leaves the
body more slowly than other SSRIs, is an exception). And both he
and Healy criticize the pharmaceutical companies, which they say
influence medical research and often minimize adverse side effects
in an effort to make their products look good.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is difficult to find scientists or clinicians who support
the more extreme suppositions of Prozac's critics.
</P>
<P>
   Glenmullen and Healy argue that neurological side effects _
including muscle spasms, facial tics, Parkinson's diseaselike
symptoms, extreme agitation and even tardive dyskinesia, a
disabling movement disorder _ are more common in patients taking
newer antidepressants than the labeling on the drug packaging
indicates, and that their occurrence augurs serious problems to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Such side effects are frequently produced by older medications
used to treat psychosis. But Glenmullen said it took decades for
doctors to recognize the extent or severity of the reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we this time want to ignore the early warning signs of
these effects with serotonin boosters?'' he asks in ``Prozac
Backlash.'' ``Even if disfiguring tic disorders turn out to be
infrequent, with tens of millions of people having been on
serotonin boosters, hundreds of thousands could be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   But other scientists say it is misleading to compare
antipsychotic drugs, which directly act on the neurotransmitter
dopamine, with the antidepressants, which affect dopamine only
indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If SSRIs do in fact cause tardive dyskinesialike syndromes,
and that's far from proven,'' said Dr. William Wirshing, a
professor of psychiatry at the University of California at Los
Angeles and an expert on neurological problems caused by
antipsychotic drugs, ``they do at a rate so low that it's
indistinguishable from background noise in the untreated general
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some neurological side effects are reported in patients
taking Prozac and similar antidepressants, researchers and
clinicians say that in their experience the reactions are
infrequent; some are so rare that many psychiatrists never see them
in years of practice. In many reported cases patients have used
other medications, making cause and effect difficult to determine.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists said that in their views ``Prozac Backlash''
also blurred distinctions between newer antidepressants and many
other types of drugs. In a discussion of possible long-term effects
of Prozac and similar drugs, Glenmullen drew analogies to cocaine
and MDMA (the recreational drug known as ecstasy), which are known
to cause brain damage, and diet drugs like Redux, which was pulled
off the market in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Glenmullen said research was scant on how Prozac and other SSRIs
affected nerve cells in the brain with long-term use, but he argued
that findings on the effects of ecstasy and other drugs offered
reason for concern about the antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely we already know enough to indicate these drugs should
be prescribed far more cautiously than they typically are today,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. George Ricaurte, an associate professor of psychiatry at
Johns Hopkins University and a leading expert on ecstasy's effects
on the brain, said that MDMA and newer antidepressants ``are two
entirely different classes of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The toxicity produced by MDMA is not produced by Prozac and
related drugs,'' Ricaurte said. ``Quite the contrary, they prevent
the toxicity of MDMA and related drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Efrain Azmitia, a professor of biology and psychiatry at New
York University and an authority on serotonin, said he regarded the
newer antidepressants as ``remarkably effective and in a way,
remarkably safe,'' because unlike many drugs their mechanism of
action had ``a more physiological flavor, more in harmony with the
body's natural rhythms,'' offering the possibility that ``you're
not going to all of a sudden see something appear that you didn't
see at two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenmullen, asked about other scientists' disparate views, said
that in his book, ``I'm very careful to be really clear about when
I'm talking about SSRIs versus other classes of drugs'' and his
point was that ``we badly need more research.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the issues raised by Prozac skeptics, the most difficult
for many people to sort out is the accusation that the drug is
linked to suicide, an association that began in 1990 when a Harvard
University researcher, Dr. Martin Teicher, reported on six patients
who ``developed intense, violent suicidal preoccupation'' shortly
after starting Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Teicher's report was followed by a few other case descriptions
from other researchers. Some scientists offered hypotheses about
how such an effect, if it existed, might occur.
</P>
<P>
   One theory centered on an infrequent reaction to Prozac and
other medications, a state of agitation and restlessness known as
akathisia. In some cases, researchers suggested, akathisia may be
so uncomfortable that it sets off suicidal thoughts, or intensifies
existing suicidal impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Other investigators proposed that in rare cases the drugs might
paradoxically produce a drop in serotonin levels. Lowered serotonin
levels have been associated in some studies with suicide and other
forms of violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the public arena, the suicide question also created a
commotion. Of the more than 100 lawsuits filed against Lilly, many
have been dismissed, and some _ the drug company will not say how
many _ have been settled out of court. Two have come to trial, with
both resulting in jury verdicts in favor of the pharmaceutical
company. In one case Lilly paid the plaintiffs an undisclosed
amount.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, however, most scientists had lost interest in
the issue. Several larger studies _ which compared Prozac to other
antidepressants or to dummy pills, including a reanalysis of
Lilly's clinical trial data _ concluded that subjects on Prozac
showed no increase in suicidal acts or feelings; some reported that
the drug reduced suicide risk. In 1991, a Food and Drug
Administration advisory committee concluded that there was no
persuasive evidence for a suicide link, allaying many people's
fears.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus of most researchers was that, in any case,
disentangling the effects of the antidepressants from the effects
of depression itself, a disease that has a high rate of suicide,
was difficult or impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would always be a needle in a haystack,'' said Dr.
Rudorfer, of the National Institute of Mental Health. For its part,
Lilly said there was no data supporting the idea that Prozac
increased suicidal risk. ``On the contrary,'' said Dr. Steven Paul,
a psychiatrist who is a vice president at Lilly Research
Laboratories, ``all the available data supports the fact that
Prozac reduces suicidal risk in depressed patients.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In reviving the issue, Glenmullen and Healy, like earlier
critics, focus on Lilly's role in lawsuits and research. They
reprise, for instance, accusations that the FDA's inquiry was
tainted by some scientists' drug company ties. And they criticize
the larger studies of Prozac and suicide, citing problems in
methodology, and pointing out that they were carried out by
scientists financed by Lilly or working for the company. They also
recycle excerpts from internal Lilly memos, retrieved by lawyers
for plaintiffs in earlier lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Healy recently published a study in which 20 normal volunteers,
who told researchers they had no history of depression or other
psychiatric problems, were alternately given Zoloft, an SSRI, and
reboxetene, another antidepressant that has not been approved for
use in the United States. Two of the volunteers, Healy reported,
became acutely suicidal while taking Zoloft.
</P>
<P>
   Healy said that compared with the normal suicide rate in Great
Britain, the healthy volunteers on Zoloft showed a 2,000-fold
increase in suicide risk. He believes the same is true for other
SSRI's. ``My estimates are that Prozac alone has led to 25,000
people committing suicide'' who would not have otherwise, Healy
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Zoloft study, published in a British journal, Primary
Care Psychiatry, is controversial. Critics said its methodology was
flawed _ for example, they said, the study included no placebo
control, the subjects were employees of the hospital where Healy
practiced, and no medical records or other independent sources were
evaluated to confirm the subjects' reports about their psychiatric
histories.
</P>
<P>
   To conclude that Zoloft made the subjects suicidal, said
Wirshing of UCLA, ``is ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Celeste Torello, a spokeswoman for Pfizer Inc., which
manufactures Zoloft, Prozac's closest competitor, said the drug's
``safety and efficacy has been proven time and again, in more than
180 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients
worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some researchers whose early reports on the suicide
issue were cited in ``Prozac Backlash'' said they did not agree
with the way the issue was characterized in the book.
</P>
<P>
   One is Dr. Anthony Rothschild, a professor of psychiatry at the
University of Massachusetts in Worcester and the author of a 1991
report of three patients who developed akathisia and became more
suicidal on Prozac. ``Akathisia can occur,'' Rothschild said, ``and
in some people, who have a previous propensity to feel suicidal and
are still suffering from depression, this can sometimes push them
over the edge. But is it common? No. Can it be easily recognized
and treated? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Teicher, author of the original suicide report, said he
viewed the risk for suicide as something ``that clinicians need to
be aware of but it's generally not a huge problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Teicher, who along with others holds the patent on R-fluoxetene,
a refined version of Prozac that Lilly has licensed and is testing
in clinical trials as a potential successor to the drug, speculated
that patients who became suicidal on Prozac and other drugs in the
early 1990's might have done so as a result of the higher doses
prescribed by physicians. Lilly's exclusive patent on Prozac
expires in December 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Glenmullen has written to the FDA requesting that stronger
warnings about akathisia and suicides be added to labels for
antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal agency, a spokesman said, is satisfied that
current warning labels, which mention both akathisia and suicidal
thoughts as having been reported since the drugs reached the
market, are sufficient. The agency said it had no plans to begin
another official investigation into the issue, although it would
review any new data that emerged, as it does routinely on topics of
public concern.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the message for anyone contemplating taking Prozac,
Zoloft, Paxil, Luvox or other antidepressants, scientists said, may
be simply that drugs have side effects, and the decision to take
medication always involves the weighing of benefit against risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should really be on any type of medication for long
periods of time unless they have to,'' said Azmitia, of NYU. ``But
some people really can't function unless they are on these drugs.''

OIL TYCOON QUITS DUMA, SAYS HE'LL OPPOSE PUTIN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Accusing President Vladimir V. Putin of trying to
create a dictatorship in Russia, media and oil tycoon Boris
Berezovsky said Monday he would resign his seat in parliament and
go into opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Once a staunch Putin ally, Berezovsky is often described as one
of the most powerful men in Russia. His dramatic announcement means
Moscow may be in for another round of bitter political fighting
after months of relative calm.
</P>
<P>
   His move came shortly after prosecutors opened several
high-profile criminal cases against some of the country's leading
businessmen. It also came amidst a Kremlin campaign to make
Russia's powerful provincial leaders more subservient to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin. Putin left
Monday for an Asian tour that will take him to China, North Korea
and ultimately Japan, where he will attend a summit meeting of the
Group of Eight industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky called the Kremlin's crackdown on Russia's governors
and on big business a threat to the country's fragile democracy.
``I don't want to participate in the destruction of Russia,''
Berezovsky, 54, told a packed news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely,'' he
said, quoting 19th century British statesman Lord Acton. ``Russia
has no chance of surviving under an authoritarian model.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would formally resign from the State Duma, the lower
house of Russia's parliament, when it meets Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his lofty rhetoric, several analysts said Berezovsky's
real motive may have been self-preservation. The controversial
tycoon's business dealings have repeatedly come under scrutiny by
Russian law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   After the attack on Putin, analysts said, any crackdown against
Berezovsky or his business empire would look like political revenge
and be more difficult to pull off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berezovsky is scared by Putin's latest moves. Now if he is
prosecuted it will appear political,'' said Yevgeny Volk, a
political analyst at the Heritage Foundation in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Markov, a Moscow-based political analyst, said Berezovsky
_ whose media holdings include Russia's largest television station,
several newspapers, and radio stations _ could mobilize the
nation's business leaders into a fierce and organized opposition to
the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berezovsky can offer a platform for all those who are unhappy
with what the Kremlin is doing,'' Markov said.
</P>
<P>
   By resigning his seat in parliament, Berezovsky would give up
the immunity from prosecution that Russian legislators enjoy. But
analysts said this was meaningless. If prosecutors come after
Berezovsky with the Kremlin's backing, they said, lawmakers would
quickly vote to strip his immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, a longtime Kremlin insider and one of Russia's
wealthiest men, is one of the so-called ``oligarchs,'' a group of
politically-connected moguls who used their government ties to
build fortunes under former president Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, he amassed a huge financial empire in media, oil,
aluminum, and aviation. He also emerged as one of Russia's most
ruthless and cunning political infighters. He was a key member of
the so-called Kremlin ``Family,'' a circle of bureaucrats and
businessmen around Yeltsin who helped Putin get elected in March.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Putin pledged to establish a
``dictatorship of law,'' create a level playing field for business,
and to eliminate the oligarchs ``as a class.'' Many were skeptical,
since Putin himself was widely seen as a creation of the tycoons,
who sought to protect their wealth.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, however, prosecutors have launched
investigations into some of Russia's most powerful firms. Among
them are the largest oil company Lukoil, the biggest automobile
manufacturer Avtovas, the metals giant Norilsk Nickel, and the
independent media holding Media-Most.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky called the probes ``a deliberate campaign aimed at
destroying big business'' in Russia. ``There is no reasonable
motive behind this, simply a desire to concentrate power,'' he
said. He called for an amnesty for all business dealings in the
chaotic decade since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who wasn't sitting with arms folded during those
years has willingly or unwillingly broken the law,'' he said. ``And
those sitting in the Kremlin are in the same situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky had come under scrutiny earlier over an estimated
$600 million allegedly embezzled from Russia's national airline
Aeroflot. He has denied any wrongdoing, and a criminal case against
him was dropped in November. Berezovsky said he met with
prosecutors last week as a possible witness to a fraud case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is a rational person,'' he said. ``If he thinks it is to
his advantage to put Berezovsky in jail he will put Berezovsky in
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized Putin's plan to make Russia's elected
regional leaders more beholden to the Kremlin. Putin wants to strip
the governors of their seats in the upper house of parliament, and
thus of their immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who claims the regional leaders flaunt the law and run
their provinces like personal fiefdoms, also wants the power to
remove elected governors who violate the law.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have assailed the changes as undemocratic, but some
analysts said that Berezovsky's stance is rooted in his close ties
to many governors whom he helped get elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berezovsky is above all a good power broker. He is strongest
when there are many independent competing centers of authority,''
said Markov. ``The Kremlin's plan to create a strong, central,
unitary state threatens Berezovsky's political future.''

<P>
   Prozac has never been just any drug.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after arriving on drugstore shelves 12 years ago, Eli
Lilly's antidepressant transcended simple pilldom, becoming instead
a cultural icon.
</P>
<P>
   Hailed as a wonder drug one minute, cast as evil incarnate the
next minute, the green and white capsule has generated multitudes
of lawsuits, and garnered more attention than some presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because Prozac treats the ills of the mind, not the
complaints of the body, it has also served as a kind of public
Rorschach test, a screen upon which Americans project deeply rooted
attitudes about illness, character, biology and free will.
</P>
<P>
   So, perhaps predictably, as the drug edges into adolescence and
Lilly's exclusive patent on the medication nears expiration, Prozac
is once more causing a stir.
</P>
<P>
   More or less at the center of the newest squall are two
psychiatrists, Dr. Joseph Glenmullen, the author of a recently
published book, ``Prozac Backlash'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), and Dr.
David Healy, author of ``The Antidepressant Era'' (Harvard
University Press, 1998). They claim that Prozac and its chemical
cousins are often indiscriminately prescribed and have more serious
and more frequent side effects than the public is aware of or than
the package labeling indicates.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their assertions are old ones, in particular the notion
that the drugs cause some people to become suicidal or violent, an
accusation that Lilly and other antidepressant manufacturers deny
and that has so far failed to persuade juries in product liability
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But Glenmullen, who is on the staff of the Harvard University
Health Services, and Healy, a lecturer in psychological medicine at
the University of Wales College of Medicine, raise new fears. They
suggest that Prozac and similar drugs, like the antipsychotic
medications of the 1950s and 1960s, might pose a significant risk
of neurological side effects, that long-term use of the drugs might
cause brain damage and that future generations might look back on
the antidepressants and other psychiatric drugs, in Glenmullen's
words, ``as a frightening human experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people have been lulled into thinking that they have
no side effects and no risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The contentions of Glenmullen, Healy and other critics, however,
have themselves drawn harsh criticism from scientists, psychiatric
clinicians and mental health groups, who view them as alarmist and
overblown.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists whose studies are cited in ``Prozac Backlash''
to support its thesis said that the author never contacted them
about their work and they strongly disagreed with his conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   And many psychiatrists said they worried that the new dispute
would discourage people with depression from seeking needed
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the statements that Glenmullen makes are simply
outrageous,'' said Dr. Frederick Jacobsen, a psychopharmacologist
in Washington. ``He trashes any benefit of the drugs and
selectively quotes studies in a very biased way.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Prozac and its later-arriving relatives are
dangerous drugs runs counter to the experience of most
psychiatrists and researchers. They see the medications _ which
enhance the availability in the brain of serotonin, a
neurotransmitter believed to be involved in depression _ as useful,
and sometimes lifesaving, tools for treating a variety of
psychiatric disorders.
</P>
<P>
   In their view, the antidepressants have both advantages and
limitations. The drugs, called selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors or SSRIs, are far less lethal in overdose than the older
generation of so-called tricyclic antidepressants, making them more
difficult for depressed patients to use in suicide attempts. And
they lack some annoying side effects of the earlier drugs, like dry
mouth, constipation and weight gain.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 30 percent to 40 percent of patients given the newer
antidepressants receive no benefit from them, a weakness they share
with earlier medications. Studies indicate the drugs may be less
effective than tricyclics for severe depression. And the
medications, like all drugs, have side effects of their own,
including loss of libido and other sexual difficulties, which occur
in anywhere from 36 percent to 75 percent of patients, and a host
of other, mostly mild, adverse reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Their long-term side effects, if any, are less clear. No
scientist can offer an ironclad guarantee that Prozac and its
counterparts _ or for that matter, any other potent drugs _ are
absolutely safe when taken continuously for long periods.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what is known, scientists say, suggests that the medications
are more benign in their long-term impact on the brain than many
other psychoactive drugs. And 12 years of widespread use have
convinced most researchers and clinicians of the antidepressants'
basic safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SSRIs are not innocuous,'' said Dr. Matthew Rudorfer,
associate director for treatment research at the National Institute
of Mental Health's Division of Services and Intervention Research,
``and they should not be used casually. But it's a vast
overinterpretation to say that they are dangerous and should be
avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenmullen and Healy said they were not opposed to the use of
Prozac or similar drugs, and that they prescribed them regularly in
their own practices. But they deplore their use for people whose
complaints are very mild and they criticize physicians who place
patients on the drugs for long periods with little or no
supervision, a trend that has increased under managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly estimates that 38 million people worldwide have taken
Prozac since it was introduced in 1988. And 10.3 million new
prescriptions for the drug were written in 1999, says IMS Health, a
market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people with only mild to moderate symptoms whose
functioning is not compromised,'' Glenmullen said, alternative
approaches, like psychotherapy and exercise, ``are preferable forms
of treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenmullen also educates readers of his book about the
withdrawal effects _ including nausea, vertigo, flu-like symptoms,
mood swings and irritability _ that can result if newer
antidepressants are stopped too abruptly. (Prozac, which leaves the
body more slowly than other SSRIs, is an exception). And both he
and Healy criticize the pharmaceutical companies, which they say
influence medical research and often minimize adverse side effects
in an effort to make their products look good.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is difficult to find scientists or clinicians who support
the more extreme suppositions of Prozac's critics.
</P>
<P>
   Glenmullen and Healy argue that neurological side effects _
including muscle spasms, facial tics, Parkinson's diseaselike
symptoms, extreme agitation and even tardive dyskinesia, a
disabling movement disorder _ are more common in patients taking
newer antidepressants than the labeling on the drug packaging
indicates, and that their occurrence augurs serious problems to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Such side effects are frequently produced by older medications
used to treat psychosis. But Glenmullen said it took decades for
doctors to recognize the extent or severity of the reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we this time want to ignore the early warning signs of
these effects with serotonin boosters?'' he asks in ``Prozac
Backlash.'' ``Even if disfiguring tic disorders turn out to be
infrequent, with tens of millions of people having been on
serotonin boosters, hundreds of thousands could be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   But other scientists say it is misleading to compare
antipsychotic drugs, which directly act on the neurotransmitter
dopamine, with the antidepressants, which affect dopamine only
indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If SSRIs do in fact cause tardive dyskinesialike syndromes,
and that's far from proven,'' said Dr. William Wirshing, a
professor of psychiatry at the University of California at Los
Angeles and an expert on neurological problems caused by
antipsychotic drugs, ``they do at a rate so low that it's
indistinguishable from background noise in the untreated general
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some neurological side effects are reported in patients
taking Prozac and similar antidepressants, researchers and
clinicians say that in their experience the reactions are
infrequent; some are so rare that many psychiatrists never see them
in years of practice. In many reported cases patients have used
other medications, making cause and effect difficult to determine.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists said that in their views ``Prozac Backlash''
also blurred distinctions between newer antidepressants and many
other types of drugs. In a discussion of possible long-term effects
of Prozac and similar drugs, Glenmullen drew analogies to cocaine
and MDMA (the recreational drug known as ecstasy), which are known
to cause brain damage, and diet drugs like Redux, which was pulled
off the market in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Glenmullen said research was scant on how Prozac and other SSRIs
affected nerve cells in the brain with long-term use, but he argued
that findings on the effects of ecstasy and other drugs offered
reason for concern about the antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely we already know enough to indicate these drugs should
be prescribed far more cautiously than they typically are today,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. George Ricaurte, an associate professor of psychiatry at
Johns Hopkins University and a leading expert on ecstasy's effects
on the brain, said that MDMA and newer antidepressants ``are two
entirely different classes of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The toxicity produced by MDMA is not produced by Prozac and
related drugs,'' Ricaurte said. ``Quite the contrary, they prevent
the toxicity of MDMA and related drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Efrain Azmitia, a professor of biology and psychiatry at New
York University and an authority on serotonin, said he regarded the
newer antidepressants as ``remarkably effective and in a way,
remarkably safe,'' because unlike many drugs their mechanism of
action had ``a more physiological flavor, more in harmony with the
body's natural rhythms,'' offering the possibility that ``you're
not going to all of a sudden see something appear that you didn't
see at two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenmullen, asked about other scientists' disparate views, said
that in his book, ``I'm very careful to be really clear about when
I'm talking about SSRIs versus other classes of drugs'' and his
point was that ``we badly need more research.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the issues raised by Prozac skeptics, the most difficult
for many people to sort out is the accusation that the drug is
linked to suicide, an association that began in 1990 when a Harvard
University researcher, Dr. Martin Teicher, reported on six patients
who ``developed intense, violent suicidal preoccupation'' shortly
after starting Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Teicher's report was followed by a few other case descriptions
from other researchers. Some scientists offered hypotheses about
how such an effect, if it existed, might occur.
</P>
<P>
   One theory centered on an infrequent reaction to Prozac and
other medications, a state of agitation and restlessness known as
akathisia. In some cases, researchers suggested, akathisia may be
so uncomfortable that it sets off suicidal thoughts, or intensifies
existing suicidal impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Other investigators proposed that in rare cases the drugs might
paradoxically produce a drop in serotonin levels. Lowered serotonin
levels have been associated in some studies with suicide and other
forms of violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the public arena, the suicide question also created a
commotion. Of the more than 100 lawsuits filed against Lilly, many
have been dismissed, and some _ the drug company will not say how
many _ have been settled out of court. Two have come to trial, with
both resulting in jury verdicts in favor of the pharmaceutical
company. In one case Lilly paid the plaintiffs an undisclosed
amount.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, however, most scientists had lost interest in
the issue. Several larger studies _ which compared Prozac to other
antidepressants or to dummy pills, including a reanalysis of
Lilly's clinical trial data _ concluded that subjects on Prozac
showed no increase in suicidal acts or feelings; some reported that
the drug reduced suicide risk. In 1991, a Food and Drug
Administration advisory committee concluded that there was no
persuasive evidence for a suicide link, allaying many people's
fears.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus of most researchers was that, in any case,
disentangling the effects of the antidepressants from the effects
of depression itself, a disease that has a high rate of suicide,
was difficult or impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would always be a needle in a haystack,'' said Dr.
Rudorfer, of the National Institute of Mental Health. For its part,
Lilly said there was no data supporting the idea that Prozac
increased suicidal risk. ``On the contrary,'' said Dr. Steven Paul,
a psychiatrist who is a vice president at Lilly Research
Laboratories, ``all the available data supports the fact that
Prozac reduces suicidal risk in depressed patients.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In reviving the issue, Glenmullen and Healy, like earlier
critics, focus on Lilly's role in lawsuits and research. They
reprise, for instance, accusations that the FDA's inquiry was
tainted by some scientists' drug company ties. And they criticize
the larger studies of Prozac and suicide, citing problems in
methodology, and pointing out that they were carried out by
scientists financed by Lilly or working for the company. They also
recycle excerpts from internal Lilly memos, retrieved by lawyers
for plaintiffs in earlier lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Healy recently published a study in which 20 normal volunteers,
who told researchers they had no history of depression or other
psychiatric problems, were alternately given Zoloft, an SSRI, and
reboxetene, another antidepressant that has not been approved for
use in the United States. Two of the volunteers, Healy reported,
became acutely suicidal while taking Zoloft.
</P>
<P>
   Healy said that compared with the normal suicide rate in Great
Britain, the healthy volunteers on Zoloft showed a 2,000-fold
increase in suicide risk. He believes the same is true for other
SSRI's. ``My estimates are that Prozac alone has led to 25,000
people committing suicide'' who would not have otherwise, Healy
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Zoloft study, published in a British journal, Primary
Care Psychiatry, is controversial. Critics said its methodology was
flawed _ for example, they said, the study included no placebo
control, the subjects were employees of the hospital where Healy
practiced, and no medical records or other independent sources were
evaluated to confirm the subjects' reports about their psychiatric
histories.
</P>
<P>
   To conclude that Zoloft made the subjects suicidal, said
Wirshing of UCLA, ``is ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Celeste Torello, a spokeswoman for Pfizer Inc., which
manufactures Zoloft, Prozac's closest competitor, said the drug's
``safety and efficacy has been proven time and again, in more than
180 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients
worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some researchers whose early reports on the suicide
issue were cited in ``Prozac Backlash'' said they did not agree
with the way the issue was characterized in the book.
</P>
<P>
   One is Dr. Anthony Rothschild, a professor of psychiatry at the
University of Massachusetts in Worcester and the author of a 1991
report of three patients who developed akathisia and became more
suicidal on Prozac. ``Akathisia can occur,'' Rothschild said, ``and
in some people, who have a previous propensity to feel suicidal and
are still suffering from depression, this can sometimes push them
over the edge. But is it common? No. Can it be easily recognized
and treated? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Teicher, author of the original suicide report, said he
viewed the risk for suicide as something ``that clinicians need to
be aware of but it's generally not a huge problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Teicher, who along with others holds the patent on R-fluoxetene,
a refined version of Prozac that Lilly has licensed and is testing
in clinical trials as a potential successor to the drug, speculated
that patients who became suicidal on Prozac and other drugs in the
early 1990's might have done so as a result of the higher doses
prescribed by physicians. Lilly's exclusive patent on Prozac
expires in December 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Glenmullen has written to the FDA requesting that stronger
warnings about akathisia and suicides be added to labels for
antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal agency, a spokesman said, is satisfied that
current warning labels, which mention both akathisia and suicidal
thoughts as having been reported since the drugs reached the
market, are sufficient. The agency said it had no plans to begin
another official investigation into the issue, although it would
review any new data that emerged, as it does routinely on topics of
public concern.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the message for anyone contemplating taking Prozac,
Zoloft, Paxil, Luvox or other antidepressants, scientists said, may
be simply that drugs have side effects, and the decision to take
medication always involves the weighing of benefit against risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should really be on any type of medication for long
periods of time unless they have to,'' said Azmitia, of NYU. ``But
some people really can't function unless they are on these drugs.''

ARMSTRONG RESPONDS TO PATANI'S CRITICISM BY MOCKING HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COURCHEVEL, France _ An unsuspected feud between Lance Armstrong
and Marco Pantani burst into public view Monday as the American
leader of the Tour de France angrily criticized the Italian star
climber.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference on the second of two days off
during the race, Armstrong used a mocking nickname for Pantani;
said he was disappointed in him and added that he had made an error
in allowing the Italian to win a daily stage on Mont Ventoux last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Far ahead of chasers Thursday, the two neared the finish line
and Armstrong slowed enough to let Pantani finish first.
</P>
<P>
   Observers called the move the gracious act of a champion, but
Pantani thought otherwise. In little-noticed comments _ except,
obviously, in the camp of the U.S. Postal Service team _ in the
French sports newspaper l'Equipe, Pantani said: ``When Armstrong
said faster, faster to get me to accelerate, he was trying to
provoke me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Armstrong thinks the Tour is over, he's wrong. In any case,
he hasn't finished with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian won another climb Sunday and then told the news
media from his country that he felt insulted by Armstrong's action
on the Ventoux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pantani does not need Armstrong to give him a victory,'' he
said, speaking of himself in the third person as he habitually
does.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about this at his news conference, Armstrong said:
``Elefantino, it's unfortunate he's showing his true colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Elefantino, or Dumbo, is a nickname Pantani carried for years
because of his big ears. He now prefers to be called Il Pirata, the
Pirate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Marco and have a lot of respect for him,'' Armstrong
said. ``I felt like it was a gift on the Ventoux and I also feel
like it was a mistake to give the gift. On the Ventoux, the
strongest man should win. I know that now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great rider, a great champion and a great climber, but
he wasn't the best man on the Ventoux. In the last few days, his
actions, his words are very disappointing to me. I thought he had
more class than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, the overall leader of the Tour, who is 9 minutes 3
seconds ahead of the sixth-placed Pantani, was asked what he
thought of the Italian's chances before the Tour ends in Paris on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elefantino has tomorrow,'' Armstrong said, referring to the
last of three days in the Alps. ``It's probably the last day for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Alps, the last big test is a time trial, a discipline
in which Pantani does not usually shine. The race against the clock
is scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong promised to do his best to spoil Pantani's last
chance. Saying that he would like to win the stage himself, the
Texan agreed that he would have extra motivation on the climb to
Morzine on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to Pantani's criticism, Armstrong said, ``I'd be
lying if I said it wouldn't be in the back of my mind tomorrow.''

BUSH SAYS HE'S GOING TO TAKE ARKANSAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Needling his opponent and his opponent's
boss, Texas Governor George W. Bush came to Bill Clinton's former
stomping grounds and declared Monday, ``I'm going to win this
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton carried Arkansas by substantial, 20-point
margins in both 1992 and 1996, Vice President Al Gore is lagging
behind Bush by about 10 points, according to two recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, Bush's purpose in coming here was to talk about an
initiative called ``caring fathers, safe children,'' which would
encourage states to create paternity registries. These databanks
would allow courts to terminate parental rights more easily and
hand over children for adoption if the fathers can be quickly
found, Bush said. If fathers do not sign up within 30 days of a
child's birth, they will automatically lose their rights, Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way to encourage responsibility on behalf of dads on
one hand, but on the other hand, if fathers refuse, for whatever
reason, to be responsible, expedite adoptions,'' Bush said during a
panel discussion at the Centers for Youth and Families.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would not provide new funding for the initiative, and 21
states already have registries in place. Arkansas, for example,
instituted one in 1989 when Clinton was governor.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's visit, his third this year, allowed him to gloat a
bit about chances of carrying the state, as well as to raise
$600,000 for the Republican party during two afternoon
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I'm going to carry the state is because people
understand what my philosophy is, it's a shared philosophy of local
control, strengthening the military, peace and an economic plan
that recognizes and rewards entrepreneurship in this country,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush allowed that voters here probably still like Clinton, but
said Clinton is not running this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton carried this state twice, and I suspect he's
still a popular figure in the state of Arkansas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are going to make up their mind, not based on
President Clinton, they're going to make up their mind based on
George W. versus the vice president,'' said Bush, whose own state
borders Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's political analysis was backed up by Arkansas' Republican
governor, Mike Huckaby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore doesn't connect with Arkansas voters and George Bush
does,'' he said. Huckaby said voters are looking for ``character,
honor and integrity'' in their candidate, and ``there's no way a
person who has embraced eight years of a Clinton presidency'' could
provide that.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, however, have not given up on retaining the
Razorback state. And a spokesman for the Democratic party
questioned Bush's prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush also said he was going to beat John McCain in New
Hampshire on the same day he lost to him by nearly 20 points,''
said DNC press secretary Jenny Backus.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas governor told Republican donors that he planned to
return ``as many times as necessary in order to declare victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would return to Arkansas as he makes his way from
Austin to the Philadelphia convention in about 10 days. The
governor and his entourage will travel from Texas to Arkansas,
Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, and West Virginia to Pennsylvania, said
Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes cautioned, however, that Bush's vice presidential
selection may cause the list to be altered for a stop in the
running mate's home state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he is getting closer to making a decision and that the
announcement could come as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting closer to a decision,'' he said. ``It used to be
the list would grow and shrink. Now it's just shrinking.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite his best efforts to avoid answering questions about
the selection process, Bush publicly acknowledged for the first
time Monday that one fellow Republican is not on his list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Governor Huckaby on the short list?'' he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Bush, who paused and then added that ``he's a good
man and a good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Bush has traveled to states with governors who
have been frequently mentioned as potential vice presidential
candidates. Last week, Bush spent time with Governors Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania, Christie Todd Whitman of New Jersey, and George
Pataki of New York. Monday night Bush traveled to Wisconsin, where
he met with Governor Tommy Thompson.

ONLINE BOOK-BUILDING: A CHAPTER HERE, A CHAPTER THERE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: N.Y., Mich.)   By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Frommer's guide to France may be made up of chapters and
maps, but most readers know it as an indivisible and coherent
whole: a book.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, that book and a few hundred others will take a new
form on the Internet. They will be sold in component parts _
chapters, maps and even paragraphs _ that can be mixed and matched.
Readers will be invited to create customized books by picking
pieces of content a la carte from an array of already-published
guides.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers will have the option of receiving their books
electronically or ordering them printed, bound and delivered to
their door.
</P>
<P>
   The customization is possible because of a deal announced last
month between an online service called iUniverse and IDG Books, the
publisher of the Dummies guidebooks, Frommer's travel guides and
Cliffs Notes. With IDG's permission, iUniverse is creating a
digital system that enables pieces of every guidebook to be
assembled on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership is one of the first steps toward a new editorial
marketplace that some publishers and technology companies have been
envisioning since the dawn of digital media. And it is the latest
challenge to the traditional definition of a book.
</P>
<P>
   Under this model, books have not only turned into streams of
electronic bits that are downloaded to hand-held devices or printed
on demand. They have also turned into databases _ pools of digital
information that people can extract and combine on their own terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine that you are going on a trip,'' said Patricia
Schroeder, president of the Association of American Publishers and
the former congresswoman. ``You may want a couple chapters of a
travel book, a couple chapters of a cookbook,'' she said, adding
that readers probably would not want to carry each of those books
for just a few chapters.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine going into a bookstore and asking to buy only those
chapters. ``They are going to look at you,'' she said, ``and say,
`What?' ''
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, that request is not so crazy. ``The online
world is uniquely suited to providing this kind of highly targeted,
highly customized information,'' said David Sidman, director of new
publishing technologies for John Wiley &AMP; Sons. Four years ago,
Sidman helped to develop tools that enabled scientific journals to
be delivered online, article by article. Today, he said, selling
content this way ``represents a tremendous new revenue opportunity
for publishers of all kinds.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel books, textbooks, cookbooks and how-to guides will be
some of the first books chopped into interchangeable parts,
according to officials at publishing and software companies
experimenting with the concept. In fact, some publishers are
already offering bits and pieces of content for downloading to
handheld devices like Palm organizers. And although no one is
talking about chopping up narrative books, like novels, anthologies
of short stories could be distributed this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so close we can just smell it,'' Schroeder said. ``This
is all going to be very doable, very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   But before pages and chapters will be available for the picking,
several hurdles need to be cleared. For example, turning books into
what the industry calls ``disaggregated content'' could destabilize
the economics of publishing, something that most established
publishers are loath to do. What happens, they ask, if people stop
buying whole books in favor of a few popular chapters? A publisher
could cannibalize its own business if readers decided to buy a few
chapters for $5 rather than the entire book for $20.
</P>
<P>
   John Kilcullen, chief executive of IDG Books, does not think
that will happen. Although he has not yet set prices for the
material that will be available this fall, he said some chapters
might be given away as promotional materials and other prices might
be set proportionally, so that a 25-page chapter of a 100-page book
would cost about 25 percent of the book's list price. Other
sections, he added, could cost almost as much as the book itself,
particularly if they are in high demand.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, authors might not be thrilled about having their work
sold in pieces or packaged with the work of others. Many recent
contracts include broad provisions for electronic rights,
publishers say, but few mention the possibility of selling pieces
for mixing and matching. Some agents and publishers are already
gearing up for new negotiations over modular content.
</P>
<P>
   William Gladstone, the founder of Waterside Productions, an
agency representing many authors in the series of Dummies books, is
encouraging writers to sign contracts that permit publishers to
sell content in pieces. He is betting that writers will earn more
royalties that way. ``I would advise them to be cooperative,'' he
said.

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ President-elect Vicente Fox of Mexico has
wasted no time initiating a much-needed dialogue over U.S.-Mexican
immigration issues. More than seven million Mexican immigrants now
live in the United States, a number equal to 7 percent of Mexico's
current population. And we get an additional 130,000 legal Mexican
immigrants and 150,000 illegal ones annually. What Fox wants to do,
however, is radical.
</P>
<P>
   He proposes that the United States immediately provide 250,000
visas a year to Mexican nationals, accommodating much of the desire
to move here, and that within 10 years, our countries share an open
border, with free movement of people and goods.
</P>
<P>
   This would be good for the Mexican economy, reducing labor
market pressures, and pleasing to many Mexican immigrants in the
United States, who maintain an interest in Mexican politics and are
increasingly powerful there. But it would be far less likely to
benefit the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Mexico wage gap is among the largest between contiguous
countries. A manufacturing worker in the United States earns four
times the salary of a Mexican factory worker and 30 times that of a
Mexican agricultural worker. These differences ensure that an open
border would increase the number of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many more people would immigrate, but the
Puerto Rican experience may be instructive. Puerto Ricans are
American citizens who can move freely within the United States, and
the differences in economic opportunities between Puerto Rico and
the mainland are quite large. Not surprisingly, about 25 percent of
Puerto Rico's population moved to the United States in the last 50
years. Even if the Mexican migration response were only half that
of Puerto Rico, total Mexican immigration to the United States
could conceivably be 12.5 million, compared with the current 7
million.
</P>
<P>
   The new immigrants would probably resemble the Mexican
immigrants already here, whose poverty rate exceeds 33 percent.
Research that I conducted with my Harvard colleagues Richard
Freeman and Larry Katz showed that the large-scale immigration of
low-skill workers during the 1980s and 1990s, by increasing the
pool of low-skill workers, reduced the relative wage of native
workers with less than a high school education by 5 percentage
points. This group's wages would be further eroded under Fox's
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Some may say that Mexican immigrants take jobs that Americans do
not want, but a more sensible statement is that Mexican immigrants
take jobs that Americans do not want at the going wage. The service
sector remains alive and well even in those parts of the country
that have not been penetrated by heavy immigration. It just costs
more to have a manicured lawn in New England than in Southern
California.

   Almost 30 percent of the immigrants now living in this country
are of Mexican origin. (In 1920, after decades of heavy
immigration, the three largest groups _ Germans, Italians and
Russians _ together made up only a third.) Numbers like these slow
assimilation because a large immigrant group can maintain its
separate identity, culture and language far into the future. It is
unfashionable to view the melting pot as desirable, but is
balkanization good for the United States?
</P>
<P>
   The free movement of people is not the same thing as the free
movement of goods. And, as we will surely relearn in the next
economic downturn, the United States offers public services that
are far more expensive to maintain when there are many immigrants
who are poor and have low job skills.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should begin to reflect more seriously on its
huge income disparity with Mexico, and the onset of democracy there
suggests that it may be time to think about a Marshall program to
introduce permanent prosperity. But enacting Vicente Fox's
proposals now would limit the economic opportunities available to
America's less advantaged and would cause a higher level of
immigration than the United States could comfortably sustain.

 By LEAH RABIN    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ The history of the Middle East is marked by
bloody wars and breakthroughs for peace. But breakthroughs do not
occur by chance. Rather, leaders who recognize the futility of war,
leaders who have peered into the faces of victims who will not
return, are prerequisites for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Intimate knowledge of the pain of war must also be coupled by
the courage to conduct a process that will not always be accepted
by everyone, or more accurately, will engender formidable
controversy. Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat were such leaders. And
so was my husband, Yitzhak Rabin, may his memory be blessed.
</P>
<P>
   No one will forget the day on the White House lawn, sun blazing,
when Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat shook hands, a symbolic act
that set the peace train on its track. The handshake was wrenching
for both leaders, but it broke down the barriers of mistrust and
fear.
</P>
<P>
   Brokered by President Clinton, the Oslo agreements infused the
spirits of the people with hope and established a new reality of
dialogue built on cooperation and mutual respect. The three lethal
bullets that killed my husband were intended to kill not merely the
life of one man, but to deter other leaders from traversing the
road to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak, how it must feel to stand at Camp
David, in the shadow of the first agreement between Israel and the
Arab world. Again, Israel has hope. Again leaders in the Middle
East are prepared to travel a complicated road, ready to sacrifice
for peace. The people of Israel wait.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud, you are walking in the footsteps carved by Menachem to
complete the way paved by Yitzhak. We pray for your success in
forging an agreement that will benefit both sides despite the
complex situation that confronts you. We trust your keen sense of
security and obligation to the future of the state, your
flexibility and creativity.
</P>
<P>
   As a mother and as a widow, I know that peace is made for the
future. In so many families the unyielding fight for peace passes
from generation to generation. Please find support in these words
from my daughter, Dalia Rabin-Pelossof, a member of the Knesset:
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel's youth who wept for my father have become your
soldiers of peace. They spread over the country and illuminated
your path with burning support and gave you a mandate, a mandate
for peace. Do not let your spirit waver in the face of those who
have abandoned the ship of peace. Come back to us with a strong and
fair agreement. We are behind you, we stand by you and we will be
there at your side upon your return. Amen, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Arafat, during the most painful time in my life and in
the life of my nation, you came to comfort me. You stood in my home
and you hugged my children. You mourned with me and with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   You have the power to bring the mourning to a close, to fulfill
the dream of your nation and of mine. My personal dream was to
stand beside my husband and witness the end of a conflict that
bitterly divides our peoples; to see the face of Yitzhak when peace
shifted from paper into the living rooms of ordinary citizens. My
dream will never come true. Unfortunately, reality teaches the
harsh lesson that dreams are not always completely fulfilled, but
my quest for peace is not dulled, just reshaped.
</P>
<P>
   Do not let the courage that I know you possess or your will to
end the suffering of your people be diminished. President Clinton
stands at your side, dedicated to the cause, an honest and devoted
broker. Ehud Barak and the people of Israel are reshaping their
dream. Be flexible, reshape your dream and the dream of your
people. You and Ehud Barak are the two brave and courageous leaders
who can make peace happen.
</P>
<P>
   Do not miss this opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   (Leah Rabin is the widow of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin of Israel.)

 UNDATED: he said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another hurdle involves technical barriers. If a book is going
to be chopped into digital pieces for mixing and matching, those
pieces need to be technologically compatible with parts of other
books. And to make those pieces searchable across databases,
companies will have to establish a standard means to identify the
piecemeal content. Right now, books have one standard tag _ their
International Standard Book Number, or ISBN _ that enables them to
be cataloged and purchased quickly at the checkout counter. But
their chapters, paragraphs, charts and graphs have no such numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Until standards are set, publishers are faced with ``a rat's
nest'' of problems, said James Lichtenberg, president of
Lightspeed, a consulting company for the educational publishing
industry. They must figure out how to build databases that
integrate their own products, as well as those of partners. They
have to decide how to slice their content and how to label it.
``You have to have very clear definitions,'' Lichtenberg said,
``things like `this means a photograph,' `this means a map.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the progress so far has come from the realm of education
and research. College professors, after all, have been mixing
chunks of editorial content for decades by assigning ``course
packs'' that are typically compilations of photocopied pages from
magazines, anthologies and nonfiction books.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with advances in copyright protection software and the
recent drive to create electronic books, many publishers have
embraced the idea of selling individual chapters from multiple
academic books.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw-Hill was one of the first to do so; it created a database
called Primis enabling professors to choose from 180,000 pages of
material spanning 20 disciplines (www.mhhe.com/primis). For
example, a professor can build a book that includes ``Notes of a
Native Son'' by James Baldwin and see that the selection adds $1.75
to the cost of the book. Other building blocks cost more, like 83
pages of ``The Turn of the Screw,'' by Henry James, priced at
$8.55.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are usually dependent on the popularity of the items and
how much McGraw-Hill may have to pay for reprint permissions, said
Ginny Moffat, vice president for marketing and custom publishing at
McGraw-Hill Higher Education. Features like color pages bump up the
costs, too.
</P>
<P>
   Another large textbook company, Taylor &AMP; Francis, will soon be
offering a database for building books. It announced last week that
it had signed a deal with Versaware, a publishing-technology
company that has developed its own customization system. The books
could be delivered to students over the Internet as files for
printing or downloading to handheld devices, said Harry Fox,
Versaware's chief executive. Or they could be printed and bound
nearby, then shipped to the college bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Manish Chopra, a graduate student at the University of Michigan,
is one reader who says he would appreciate the chance to buy books
in pieces, rather than whole. He recently visited a Borders
bookstore to find ``Consulting Demons,'' a book on corporate
consulting by Lewis Pinault. A friend had recommended that he read
the early chapters, which dealt with recruiting tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book was like $30 hardcover,'' Chopra said, ``and I was
like, I don't know if I want to buy it, because I was only
interested in the first four chapters.'' Instead, he stayed in the
bookstore, spent several hours reading the chapters, and put the
book back on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   If he had been given the chance to buy those chapters for a few
dollars, he said, he would have done so. ``It's always the case
that you don't need all the information,'' Chopra said. But if you
could buy it in pieces, he said, ``that would be a great tool.''

What with real estate prices soaring, the average high-tech office
worker is getting shoved into spaces smaller than ever, reports
Wired magazine. Once upon a time, the standard office cubicle was 8
by 8 feet. Cubicles today are as small as 5 by 6 feet. For
comparison purposes:
</P>
<P>
   _ The average Porta Potti is 11.7 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   _ The average casket is 15.2 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   _ The average Silicon Valley cubicle is 30 square feet.

   &UR; Marianne Gingrich &LR; , Newt's ex-wife, is writing a tell-all book
about their marriage. Her proposal, which is circulating among
possible publishers, says she wants ``to describe what I saw in the
rise to power and in Newt's eventual demise. I can reveal what went
on in strategy meetings when we decided to take on the
establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the personal dirt? ``It was one of the uglier
situations of a wronged woman in Washington,'' an editor who has
seen the proposal told MSNBC's  &UR; Jeannette Walls &LR; . ``If Marianne
decides to really spill the beans on Newt, it could be very, very
embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. A quick check of the Macy's registry Monday, July 17,

   When American athletes show up for the Olympics, they'll have to
submit to random drug testing, reports the New York Times, and sign
pledges to wear the official sponsor's clothes to awards ceremonies
if they win.
</P>
<P>
   The certified clothes for the awards ceremonies are by Adidas,
which has a two-year contract with the Olympics. ``In the past,''
Adidas'  &UR; Susan Halliday &LR;  told the Times, ``you'd have Coca-Cola do
a year of the Games, and then they're gone. '' Adidas, she said,
``is about long-term contracts and commitment.''

   _  &UR; Rama Lama &LR;  is reading a biography of  &UR; Billy Wilder  &LR; that
reveals that the director used to write ``cum deo,'' ``from God,''
on the first page of every one of his screenplays. After ``Lost
Weekend,'' which won a best-picture Oscar, he wrote on the first
page of ``Sunset Boulevard,'' ``I'll take it from here.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; David Margolick &LR; , who says he got great response to a query
for his last book, ``Strange Fruit,'' is working on a new one about
the June 22, 1938, heavyweight championship fight between
 &UR; Joe Louis &LR;  and  &UR; Max Schmeling &LR; . The fight, which was at Yankee
Stadium but was broadcast nationwide by radio, had significance
because Louis was black and Schmeling, a German, was considered an
example of the master race.
</P>
<P>
   Margolick wants to hear from people who either attended the
fight, listened or rushed out to celebrate Louis' first-round
victory. He's at 315 W. 86 St., No. 14F, New York, NY 10024, or

<P>
   Situated on the jagged coast of Finland nearly 400 miles north
of Helsinki, Oulu must rank as one of the world's most improbable
technology boom towns.
</P>
<P>
   There is no daylight from December through mid-February. Parking
lots provide electric warmers to keep car engines from freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Except for forests and lakes, there isn't much within 100 miles
of Oulu. The most notable town to the north is Rovaniemi, which has
built its economy on the assertion that it is the true home of
Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy to come to Oulu,'' wrote Ilpo Okkonen, the author
of a picture book about the city. ``All you have to do is set out
from somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as unlikely as it may seem, this town of 100,000 people is
home to hundreds of electronics companies. Driven in part by Nokia,
the Helsinki company that is the world's biggest manufacturer of
mobile telephones, Oulu thrives as a center for research on
wireless data communications.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia employs nearly 5,000 people here, most of them working on
third-generation mobile services that offer high-speed electronic
commerce and even full-color video communications.
</P>
<P>
   But the city has also become a hotbed for start-ups. There are
companies here that make wireless networks for underground mines,
wireless tickets for buses and ski lifts, wireless automation
systems for factories and wireless encryption systems to protect
data sent over the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure how all this ``mobile commerce'' will
develop, but the phenomenal success of ordinary mobile phones has
attracted a flood of venture capital. Finnair now makes 15 daily
round-trip flights between Oulu and Helsinki, and most are packed
with business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The city's half-dozen hotels are routinely booked solid, but
rarely with tourists. A handful of American technology companies,
like Tellabs and Mentor Graphics, have offices here as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, all of us venture funds are loaded with money,''
says Juha Mikkola, a partner in Eqvitec Partners, a venture-capital
firm in Helsinki that has invested in several Oulu companies. ``All
we need is more good entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Until about 10 years ago, Oulu was best known as a former
trading center for black tar. Those days are long gone: The demand
for tar, used in waterproofing, collapsed with the demise of big
wooden ships in the 19th century. Local shops still honor the
heritage by selling tar liquor and tar candy, however, which taste
about as good as they sound.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the city's rebirth stems from its large pool of skilled
technical people. The University of Oulu, financed mainly by the
Finnish government, draws 13,000 students and has programs in
electronics, engineering and information technology. Most of the
students come from northern Finland, and about two-thirds stay in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   The government also set up the Technical Research Center, which
now employs about 2,900 researchers who work on advanced wireless
technologies and optical electronics. About half of the center's
revenue comes from work for private companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, long before the boom in cellular telephones,
Nokia set up a small branch here. Then Nokia was a conglomerate
that dabbled in a variety of electronics as it searched for new
opportunities. Researchers in Oulu provided some of the company's
early work in wireless military equipment for the Finnish
government, which gave it a base for jumping into mobile telephones
in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Oulu's abundant technical talent has also made it a haven for
local entrepreneurs. One was Lauri Kuokkanen, who was posted here
by Nokia and then quit in 1976 to start LK Products, a company that
made radio-frequency filters.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ``serial entrepreneur,'' Kuokkanen went on to
start at least three other companies, including a company called
Solitra. The man he recruited to run Solitra, Juha Sipila, recently
sold it to an American company called ADC, reaping tens of millions
of dollars. Today he is an investor in at least 15 other local
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask how Oulu suddenly became such a big success,'' says
Kuokkanen, who is 68. ``We just did our daily work, and it
gradually grew bigger and bigger. It's been happening for the last
25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that work happens at Technopolis, an industrial park
that is home to about 130 companies. Researchers and ideas shuttle
between business and academia, much as Stanford University fueled
the growth of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is quite a strong internal network of people there who
all studied in the same area about 20 years ago,'' says Vesa
Sadeharju, a partner at SFK Finance, a venture-capital firm in
Helsinki that has invested in about 10 Oulu start-ups. Last month
SFK was bought for an undisclosed amount by one of Europe's biggest
venture-capital firms, the London-based 3i Group.
</P>
<P>
   Companies based at Technopolis employ more than 10,000 people,
but thousands more work off-campus at companies such as Sonera,
Finland's biggest telephone company, and Polar Electro Oy, which
makes electronic heart-measurement products.
</P>
<P>
   Many are start-ups that rent as little as a single room but
obtain access to high-speed phone lines, administrative services
and expertise at the university and the Technical Research Center.
CCC Oy, for example, a small company started in 1985, developed
software under contract for Nokia and then developed its own
products. Today it has about $20 million a year in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are digging into more exotic areas as well. At the
Wireless Internet Laboratory, part of the Technical Research
Center, Petri Mahonen is experimenting with virtual-reality glasses
that would allow mobile-phone users to browse the Internet in
color.
</P>
<P>
   His team has also installed miniature wireless-computer servers
into devices such as coffeepots and toy race cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main idea is not that people want to run their coffeepots
over the Internet,'' Mahonen says. ``The point here is to think
about using the Internet for unusual new purposes and to see how
small and how cheap you can produce a wireless Internet server. It
turns out they can be quite small and cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Silicon Valley, Oulu remains a rustic outpost.
There are few shopping malls or movie complexes, and the streets
are filled with creaky old cars. The city's main attractions are
bicycle paths and footbridges, which crisscross the waterways and
lakes.
</P>
<P>
   When spring arrives in mid-May, nights gradually disappear into
a two-month-long stretch of daylight, and the region becomes a
haven for outdoor sports and recreation. One evening early last
month, in-line skaters and bicyclists stayed out until 11 while
salmon fishermen drifted in the golden rays of the late-night sun.
By July, people are playing midnight golf and tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day I left work at 3 p.m. and drove about 150
kilometers to go fishing,'' says Pertti Huuskanen, the president of
Technopolis. ``I fished for several hours, and I used my mobile
telephone to read and answer my e-mail. I got back by about 11:30,
before it was completely dark.''

 By JOHN MARKOFF  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In the beginning, as it were, the Web was made possible by a
simple innovation known as Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML.
Through this language, which arranged text, images and buttons in a
World Wide Web browser, information could be read by computer users
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite its power, HTML has flaws, the most obvious being an
inability to make distinctions between the presentation of computer
data and the data itself. HTML, in other words, deals only with the
``appearance'' of information. This is why the Web is sometimes
called a ``fancy fax machine'' _ great at doling out documents on
request but poorly designed for direct information exchanges
between computers on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Now, inevitably, the next generation of Web language, called XML
(for Extensible Markup Language), is emerging, and many software
designers can barely contain their excitement over its potential to
establish a real Internet lingua franca.
</P>
<P>
   By not only transmitting information but also interpreting what
that information means, XML, the brainchild of a Sun Microsystems
engineer, will greatly enhance a wide range of Internet companies
and applications, from automated industry supply chains to a new
class of Internet programs that users can gain access to at the
office, at home or on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like there's been this collective `Aha!' experience in
the community over the simplicity of this technology,'' said Howard
Katz, an XML software developer in Vancouver, British Columbia.
``It just feels right.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand the difference between HTML and XML, consider a
document containing, say, baseball statistics, like those printed
in newspapers. As it travels through cyberspace, the document
contains separate bracketed ``tags'' embedded in the text, which
offer instructions to a browser, like Microsoft Explorer or
Netscape Navigator, on either the display of the information (HTML)
or its meaning (XML).
</P>
<P>
   The HTML tags display the information in neat columns and
boldface the names of the players and their teams. The XML tags, by
contrast, describe what each category of information is: player,
team, batting average, home runs, runs batted in. The genius of XML
is that each information category can have its own ``vocabulary,''
making it possible to easily identify and exchange information.
</P>
<P>
   XML designers are starting to use the language like a data glue
to hook together entire industries. For example, a computermaker or
a group of PC companies might automate their supply chains, using
the Web to link parts suppliers directly to their factories.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, XML may become the most crucial component underlying
the next big leap on the Internet. Microsoft has already moved
rapidly to build e-commerce tools based on its version of XML,
known as Biztalk.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is apparently preparing for an even more
significant committment to XML. In late June, Microsoft introduced
its new software strategy based on what its co-founder, William H.
Gates, is calling Next Generation Windows Services.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to create a new Internet operating system that will
shift an array of applications from the hard disks of personal
computers onto the Net. A range of software and services, from word
processing and spreadsheet programs to data storage and other
peripherals, will be on powerful network computers accessible
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Computer users will thus be able to gain access to the power of
their computers whether they are in their office, at home or
traveling with a wireless connection to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Microsoft's new Internet strategy is XML, which
the company will use to rapidly connect its applications and make
them work across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a bitter pill for Sun Microsystems, one of
Microsoft's chief rivals. XML was first envisioned by Jon Bosak, a
Microsystems software engineer, who saw that HTML would not be
useful for turning the World Wide Web into what he calls an
``industrial strength infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   One of a small group of professionals who understood the true
power of an arcane publishing language known as Standard
Generalized Markup Language, or SGML, Bosak began pestering the
World Wide Web Consortium, the MIT-based group that designs
standards for the Web, with his notions in 1996. He came away with
the consortium's blessing to explore a way to bring the power of
SGML to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   He had become a believer in SGML after using the language to
single-handedly transfer the 150,000 pages of Novell's Netware
documentation from print to an online system.
</P>
<P>
   Between August and November 1996, Bosak, with the help of two
other SGML experts, Tim Bray and C.M. Sperberg-McQueen, created XML
as a scaled-down version of SGML, intended for use on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Their solution was, in principle, very simple. They used HTML's
tags (which are offset by brackets within the code), to describe
what a particular piece of information is, rather than what it
looks like.
</P>
<P>
   In an article written last year for Scientific American, Bray
and Bosak described the difference between the two languages with a
simple example: shirts. XML, they wrote, would ``label the parts of
an order for a shirt not as boldface, paragraph, row and column _
what HTML offers _ but as price, size, quantity and color.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach has been quickly grasped by everyone _ software
developers, Internet start-ups, corporate giants such as Microsoft
and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``We unleashed it on the world at the end of 1996, and it was
like hurling ourselves at a door that was unlatched,'' Bray said.
</P>
<P>
   Will the resulting technology offer a level playing field based
on a set of standards that all companies can use? It's not clear.
Sun, which created the Java programming language, has been slow in
popularizing the XML standard even though Bosak conceived it.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of Microsoft's intense antitrust battle and the
conflicting industry views over whether the company is an imitator
or an innovator, it will be quite a twist if Microsoft becomes the
biggest beneficiary of the technology.

 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In the beginning, as it were, the Web was made possible by a
simple innovation known as Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML.
Through this language, which arranged text, images and buttons in a
World Wide Web browser, information could be read by computer users
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite its power, HTML has flaws, the most obvious being an
inability to make distinctions between the presentation of computer
data and the data itself. HTML, in other words, deals only with the
``appearance'' of information. This is why the Web is sometimes
called a ``fancy fax machine'' _ great at doling out documents on
request but poorly designed for direct information exchanges
between computers on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Now, inevitably, the next generation of Web language, called XML
(for Extensible Markup Language), is emerging, and many software
designers can barely contain their excitement over its potential to
establish a real Internet lingua franca.
</P>
<P>
   By not only transmitting information but also interpreting what
that information means, XML, the brainchild of a Sun Microsystems
engineer, will greatly enhance a wide range of Internet companies
and applications, from automated industry supply chains to a new
class of Internet programs that users can gain access to at the
office, at home or on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like there's been this collective `Aha!' experience in
the community over the simplicity of this technology,'' said Howard
Katz, an XML software developer in Vancouver, British Columbia.
``It just feels right.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand the difference between HTML and XML, consider a
document containing, say, baseball statistics, like those printed
in newspapers. As it travels through cyberspace, the document
contains separate bracketed ``tags'' embedded in the text, which
offer instructions to a browser, like Microsoft Explorer or
Netscape Navigator, on either the display of the information (HTML)
or its meaning (XML).
</P>
<P>
   The HTML tags display the information in neat columns and
boldface the names of the players and their teams. The XML tags, by
contrast, describe what each category of information is: player,
team, batting average, home runs, runs batted in. The genius of XML
is that each information category can have its own ``vocabulary,''
making it possible to easily identify and exchange information.
</P>
<P>
   XML designers are starting to use the language like a data glue
to hook together entire industries. For example, a computermaker or
a group of PC companies might automate their supply chains, using
the Web to link parts suppliers directly to their factories.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, XML may become the most crucial component underlying
the next big leap on the Internet. Microsoft has already moved
rapidly to build e-commerce tools based on its version of XML,
known as Biztalk.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is apparently preparing for an even more
significant committment to XML. In late June, Microsoft introduced
its new software strategy based on what its co-founder, William H.
Gates, is calling Next Generation Windows Services.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to create a new Internet operating system that will
shift an array of applications from the hard disks of personal
computers onto the Net. A range of software and services, from word
processing and spreadsheet programs to data storage and other
peripherals, will be on powerful network computers accessible
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Computer users will thus be able to gain access to the power of
their computers whether they are in their office, at home or
traveling with a wireless connection to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Microsoft's new Internet strategy is XML, which
the company will use to rapidly connect its applications and make
them work across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a bitter pill for Sun Microsystems, one of
Microsoft's chief rivals. XML was first envisioned by Jon Bosak, a
Microsystems software engineer, who saw that HTML would not be
useful for turning the World Wide Web into what he calls an
``industrial strength infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   One of a small group of professionals who understood the true
power of an arcane publishing language known as Standard
Generalized Markup Language, or SGML, Bosak began pestering the
World Wide Web Consortium, the MIT-based group that designs
standards for the Web, with his notions in 1996. He came away with
the consortium's blessing to explore a way to bring the power of
SGML to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   He had become a believer in SGML after using the language to
single-handedly transfer the 150,000 pages of Novell's Netware
documentation from print to an online system.
</P>
<P>
   Between August and November 1996, Bosak, with the help of two
other SGML experts, Tim Bray and C.M. Sperberg-McQueen, created XML
as a scaled-down version of SGML, intended for use on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Their solution was, in principle, very simple. They used HTML's
tags (which are offset by brackets within the code), to describe
what a particular piece of information is, rather than what it
looks like.
</P>
<P>
   In an article written last year for Scientific American, Bray
and Bosak described the difference between the two languages with a
simple example: shirts. XML, they wrote, would ``label the parts of
an order for a shirt not as boldface, paragraph, row and column _
what HTML offers _ but as price, size, quantity and color.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach has been quickly grasped by everyone _ software
developers, Internet start-ups, corporate giants such as Microsoft
and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``We unleashed it on the world at the end of 1996, and it was
like hurling ourselves at a door that was unlatched,'' Bray said.
</P>
<P>
   Will the resulting technology offer a level playing field based
on a set of standards that all companies can use? It's not clear.
Sun, which created the Java programming language, has been slow in
popularizing the XML standard even though Bosak conceived it.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of Microsoft's intense antitrust battle and the
conflicting industry views over whether the company is an imitator
or an innovator, it will be quite a twist if Microsoft becomes the
biggest beneficiary of the technology.

CELTICS WIDOW FAILS TO APPEAL PHYSICIAN'S ACQUITTAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Reggie Lewis medical malpractice case formally came
to a close Monday as a judge dismissed Donna Harris-Lewis's appeal
of the May jury verdict clearing Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. of
negligence in her late husband's death.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the lawsuit that made front-page headlines when it
was filed four years ago ended with a whisper: Harris-Lewis missed
a filing deadline required to continue her appeal, prompting
Mudge's attorney to file a motion that the appeal be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, noting that Harris-Lewis's lawyer offered no
opposition, Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith granted the
request. His ruling came ten days shy of the seventh anniversary of
Lewis's death on July 27, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis accused Mudge, Lewis's chief cardiologist at
Brigham and Women's Hospital, of failing to diagnose her husband
with the heart condition that caused the Celtics star's fatal
collapse as he was shooting baskets at a Brandeis University gym. A
first trial ended in a hung jury last year.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his office Monday, Neil Rossman, Harris-Lewis's
lawyer, said he had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   But in May, when Rossman filed the notice of appeal for
Harris-Lewis, he said he did so ``to protect her appellate rights
and give her time to evaluate her options.'' At the time, he
offered no indication of the legal grounds on which she might base
her appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The filing of a notice of appeal, the first procedural step
necessary to appeal to the state Appeals Court, does not guarantee
that a full appeal will take place. But it does protect a
litigant's right to pursue an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The next step would have been for Harris-Lewis and her attorney
to order a transcript of the retrial, which ended in early May
after four weeks of testimony and five days of jury deliberations.
After reviewing the transcript, they would have had the option of
filing a full appeals brief that outlined the legal errors they
believe took place at trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Harris-Lewis missed a deadline last month to continue the
process, meaning that her appeal period had lapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's lawyer, William J. Dailey Jr., did not return a call for
comment.

SOME TRUTHS ARE APPARENTLY MORE ALIEN THAN OTHERS
</HEADLINE>
  By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Some days I believe aliens really
did land at Roswell in 1947, just as the conspiracy theorists
claim.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But instead of our government secretly recovering
microprocessors, fiber optics and other gizmos from the crumpled
spacecraft (and, uh, giving it all to Bill Gates and the Japanese
to sell to the rest of us), I think the co-pilot and a flight
attendant or two managed to survive the crash and slip into the New
Mexico night.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I figure, these aliens have lived quietly among
us, but sometimes they get a hankering for the adrenaline rush they
used to feel while hurtling through outer space with their heads
stuck out the window. So, for kicks and giggles, they dress up as
humans and sneak into Earth's major news events.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it sounds wiggy, but hear me out.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, during the closing arguments in the
class-action suit against Big Tobacco, attorney Jim Johnson gamely
told a jury that his client, R.J. Reynolds, cannot afford to pay a
cent in punitive damages. ``Like many individuals,'' he said.
``Reynolds is living from paycheck to paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that: An industry with more than $123 billion in
revenues and $9 billion in earnings last year, and its CEOs
apparently are subsisting on Oodles of Noodles. Yikes.
</P>
<P>
   I'm just guessing, but I'd wager that, in a former life,
attorney Johnson reminded folks to fold up their trays and bring
their seats into an upright position prior to intergalactic
landings.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Strom Thurmond, the universe's senior
statesman.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after George W. Bush confided to the NAACP
convention last week that ``there's no escaping the reality that
the party of Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of
Lincoln,'' his campaign aides trotted out ol' Strom.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, borrowing from a Harry Truman campaign slogan, had just
mocked Republicans for their ``do-nothing-for-the-people
Congress.'' Thurmond stepped up to the mike and joked, ``Mr. Gore,
I knew Harry Truman. I ran against Harry Truman. And, Mr. Gore, you
are no Harry Truman.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Thurmond bolted from the Democratic Party in 1948 and
ran against Truman on the segregationist Dixiecrat ticket. Thurmond
didn't carry the mantle of Lincoln or even Roosevelt, but the hood
of Nathan Bedford Forrest.
</P>
<P>
   As Washington Post reporter Michael Powell and others have
pointed out, Thurmond was riled up by Truman's integration of the
armed forces. ``All the laws of Washington and all the bayonets of
the Army cannot force the Negro into our homes, our schools, our
churches and places of recreation,'' Thurmond bellowed on the
stump.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, he had people sign an oath of allegiance to racial
segregation before they could vote in the Dixiecrat primary. Over
the years, though, his crusade has been dressed up as a battle over
state's rights or, as the Strom Thurmond Institute at Clemson
University portrays it, ``New Federalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, The Post asked the Bush campaign why it risked having
Thurmond revive memories of his white supremacist days, for which
he's never apologized. ``We are in a day when people make light of
their past,'' responded Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer, who said only
humorless Democrats had complained. (Can't you hear it? ``Please
return your trays to their upright position.'')
</P>
<P>
   All of this calls to mind a glowing foreword Thurmond wrote a
few years ago for a book by Philip J. Corso, a former Army officer.
</P>
<P>
   In the foreword, Thurmond said Corso ``has many interesting
stories to share with individuals interested in military history,
espionage and the workings of our government.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Thurmond, the book was titled ``The Day After
Roswell,'' and it detailed Corso's claims that he'd helped our
government secretly recover microprocessors, fiber optics and other
gizmos from a crumpled spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's staff hurriedly explained he had no clue the book
was about woo-woo aliens when he wrote the foreword.
</P>
<P>
   For that, he expressed regrets.
</P>

 &HT;    AS TIME RUNS DOWN ON SUMMIT, CLINTON PRESSES FOR PEACE DEAL
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ With time running out before his planned
Wednesday departure for Tokyo, President Clinton hunkered down with
Israeli and Palestinian leaders Monday for a seventh straight day
of Camp David peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   With no outward signs of a peace agreement in sight, White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said negotiators from both sides would
likely be working into the morning Tuesday in an effort to strike a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties understand the schedule here,'' Lockhart said.
``The pace and the intensity has quickened.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid speculation that Clinton could delay his departure for the
G8 summit in Okinawa to shepherd the parties the final painful
steps toward a peace accord, the White House sought to use his
schedule as a deadline to force negotiators into the vice of
decision-making that would make or break a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who said Sunday that no agreement was in view, was
still hopeful that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak would resolve the issues at the core of
their 52-year bloody dispute by the time Air Force One is slated to
take off Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect that when the president leaves,'' Lockhart said,
``the parties will have wrapped up their business.''
</P>
<P>
   With the two sides still reportedly far apart on key issues,
though, Lockhart declined to rule out the possibility that the
president might postpone his departure for Japan, where he is to
meet with his counterparts in the so-called Group of Eight big
democratic powers _ Britain, Japan, Germany, Italy, France, Canada,
the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I know is that the president intends to get on a plane
Wednesday morning to go and fulfill his requirements as an
important leader in the G8,'' Lockhart said. Leaving open the
prospect that Clinton's departure could slip, though, he said,
``You'll know that we're following through on the schedule when you
see the president walk up to the top of the steps and wave and the
door close.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has some leeway.
</P>
<P>
   He's scheduled to arrive in Tokyo Thursday afternoon for a
bilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   If he postponed that meeting _ there's little on the agenda _
Clinton could depart Thursday morning and still arrive in Okinawa,
the southernmost island in the Japanese archipelago, by Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The G8 summit is to begin in Okinawa Friday afternoon. Clinton
is scheduled to preside over a memorial service there Friday
morning for the Americans and Japanese killed there during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began the day Monday meeting with Barak, then held
strategy sessions with his top Mideast aides throughout much of the
afternoon in preparation for an evening meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations on core issues such as territory and security,
the future of Jerusalem and the question of Palestinian statehood
stretched deeper into the night, parties to the talks were
beginning to show signs of wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   The White House released a photograph Monday showing U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, with dark circles under her
eyes, holding the hand of Arafat as the two listened intently to
his interpreter while strolling through the darkness of the
presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Albright appeared to be steadying the aging Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult coming continually back to the same issues with
the same people,'' said Lockhart. ``That kind of environment is not
always the best for the warm and fuzzies.''

SOME ACCUSE TOBACCO INDUSTRY OF TARGETING MINORITY TEENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEGAN SCOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the US smoking rate continues to drop, Latino and
African-American teenagers are turning to cigarettes at an
increasing rate, drawing bitter accusations from public health
officials that the tobacco industry is targeting minority teens as
their customers of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Although Massachusetts teenagers are bucking the national trend
and smoking less than they didi in 1993, state officials are so
concerned that they've launched their first anti-smoking campaign
aimed specifically at African-American and Latina girls.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials across the country are particularly incensed
over advertisements for Virginia Slims cigarettes that depict
glamorous young African-American and Hispanic women under the
slogan, ``Find Your Voice.'' Although maker Philip Morris is
phasing out the slogan after complaints that smoking damages vocal
chords, state officials say such ads help fuel smoking among young
minority women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco industry is really increasing their advertising to
. . . minorities, particularly women,'' said Massachusetts Public
Health Commissioner Howard Koh. ``The tobacco industry has also
inflitrated every culture. These ads are powerful. They tell
society, particularly children, what's considered attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the rate of smoking among black high school girls
increased 54 percent from 1991 to 1997, twice the growth rate of
white students, according to a 1998 Surgeon General's report. Among
Latino high school girls, the smoking rate increased by about 37
percent. Those jumps reverse a decline in minority smoking during
the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the numbers are more encouraging. Smoking
among African-American high school students of both genders
declined 6.8 percent between 1993 and 1999, according to state
figures, while, among Latino high school students, it declined 2.6
percent. Figures for girls alone were not available.
</P>
<P>
   But Koh and other state officials say minority women are
particularly vulnerable, turning to tobacco as a way to deal with
depression, loneliness and stress. According to a 1997 Youth Risk
Behavior Survey, 30 percent of Latina girls under age 16 in
Massachusetts smoke cigarettes. Among African American girls, ages
16-18 in Massachusetts, 16 percent are smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco industry officials say they're being made a scapegoat.
They deny that they are stepping up advertising in minority
publications, or that they are trying to attract underage smokers
of any race or ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal with all our cigarette advertising is to reach only
adult cigarette smokers,'' said Tom Ryan, spokesman for Philip
Morris USA, the largest cigarette maker. ``We recognize (that) with
the right to manufacture and market cigarettes comes a
responsibility to help prevent kids from smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   As proof, Philip Morris is suspending future placement of
cigarette advertising in any publication whose readers younger than
age 18 constitute 15 percent or more of the total readership or is
read by more than 2 million people younger than 18. The company has
already dropped advertising in Elle, Mademoiselle, Sports
Illustrated and People.
</P>
<P>
   But activists and public health officials say tobacco companies
are masters at subtly recruiting young smokers _ the cartoon
character Joe Camel once pitched Camel cigarettes _ all the while
claiming to abhor the idea.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Virginia Slims ads, for instance, depicts a beautiful
young African woman with colorful fabrics on her head, accompanied
by text written in an African tongue. A second depicts a young
Hispanic woman looking slyly at the camera with text urging readers
to ``dance around naked.'' These ads appeal to African-American and
Latina girls, say activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco companies know that historically African American
teenage girls smoke at much lower rates than there Caucasian
counterparts,'' said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids. ``In years past, the advertising themes focused
on thinness. The thinness theme simply didn't work in those
communities. Now Philip Morris is trying to associate freedom and
independence with their products.''
</P>
<P>
   But Philip Morris spokesman Ryan said his company has nothing to
apologize for except the original ad campaign's slogan, ``Find Your
Voice,'' which is now being phased out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our marketing for Virginia Slims is . . . intended to appeal
to adult women who choose to smoke,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Virginia Slims controversy, a 1998 state survey found
that 52 percent of storefront cigarette advertising in
Massachusetts targets minority. Often, the ads featured a minority
female as the central character.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health
responded with the ``Keep It Fresh'' campaign, intended to raise
awareness among several ethnic groups about tobacco industry
tactics to attract smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic females are the target for the future,'' said Gregory
Connolly, director of the Massachusetts Tobacco Control Program.
``It's profit. It's business without a consciece.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep it Fresh, the first anti-smoking campaign in Massachusetts
aimed specifically at Latina and African American girls, promotes
healthier living through a series of road shows demonstrations. On
Monday, Brendan Fehr of the WB television show ``Roswell'' appeared
with campaign participants at Six Flags New England in West
Springfield, Mass. to promote the anti-smoking message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society feels that every woman should be skinny and beautiful
and every woman wants that,'' said Christine Ortiz, 17, who is
entering MIT in the fall. ``The tobacco industry knows that and
targets females through that image.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz is part of the truth campaign, a caravan organized by
teenagers who travel the country spreading an anti-tobacco message.
The campaign includes specific components devoted to
African-American and Latino youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows (teens) read Vibe and (tobacco industries) are
all over those magazines,'' said another caravan participant,
Chikira Cotten, 17, from West Nyack, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But John Singleton, spokesperson for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, the
second largest U.S. cigarette manufacturer, said the critics are
way off base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is that we will only advertise in magazines where
at least two-thirds of readership is 18 and over,'' Singleton said.
The ads ``are not by any means run predominantly in minority
publications.''

JOYCE'S ODD LITTLE PLAY WITH MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
  (For use on or after July 19, 2000 by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
Its creators call ``James Joyce's The Dead'' a play with music.
They might just as easily have dubbed it the ``Un-Musical.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title should have been the first clue that ``The Dead,''
despite its Broadway success and critical acclaim, isn't one of
those rock-your- foundation events. Where mega-musicals like ``The
Lion King'' and ``Phantom of the Opera'' are known for their size,
costumes and special effects, ``The Dead'' is positively intimate:
small cast, manageable sets, no stage-swamping production numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a show function like this one,'' says Richard
Nelson, ``The Dead's'' adapter, co-lyricist and director of the
production, which opens tonight at the Ahmanson Theatre. ``I'm
primarily a playwright, so for me it's the person who is the be-all
and end-all. Everything, even the dances, we knew would have to
come out of the character situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto Shaun Davey's music, which isn't likely to leave anybody
with ringing ears or leap off the Top-50 bins at Tower Records. At
one point audiences will see characters converse over the sound of
an on-stage violinist and a cellist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so un-Broadway,'' agrees Stephen Bogardus, who plays
Gabriel Conroy, the play's narrator and central figure. ``And it
really demands a lot from its audiences because the sound is a very
acoustical sound. It's not blown out of the speakers as people are
used to both in movie theaters and in Broadway shows.''
</P>
<P>
   That last remark draws an enthusiastic amen from Bogardus'
co-star, Faith Prince, who, despite her past participation in
several such big musicals, seems to be enjoying ``The Dead's''
quieter ambience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really noticed it last night,'' says Prince, who plays
Gabriel's wife, Gretta. ``I went to see `The Perfect Storm,' and I
was saying, `Oh my God, can they just, like, turn this !ital!down?'
It was just too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, you might say that a couple of hours spent watching a
fishing boat on the gale-tossed Atlantic is a far cry from spending
Christmas Eve in the Dublin living room of two spinster aunts,
circa 1904. And why wouldn't it be? The play's source material,
after all, sprang from the pen of James Joyce, the Irish author
known for cramming pages of minutia-like details into a single day
or event. ``The Dead'' was first a 50-page short story, the last in
the ``Dubliners'' collection. It later became the basis for
director John Huston's final film in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In the story _ which is largely unchanged from the the film and
novella _ Gabriel and Gretta are among those in attendance at a
Christmas party hosted by Gabriel's aunts Kate and Julia Morkham _
a gathering that includes tipsy guests, poignant toasts, a hint of
Irish nationalism and, yes, plenty of music. Characters sing and
dance for each other _ if not necessarily for the audience. The
play reaches its climax later in an expensive hotel where an
occurrence from the party causes Gretta to reveal an incident from
her past that her husband had not known about. That realization
causes a bit of psychological angst in Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have been together probably 10 to 15
years,'' says Bogardus. ``These people probably think they know
each other like the back of their hand. Then for this kind of
secret to come out ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's something she just put away,'' adds Prince. ``It
was tragic for her and, for whatever reason _ not to keep it from
him _ she just put it away, which I can totally relate to.''
</P>
<P>
   To Nelson, little revelations are part of human interaction, and
the relationship we're observing isn't on the brink of collapse.
``The Dead,'' Nelson reminds us, was a story first told by a
26-year-old man intent on exploring the exuberance and confusion of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the story we have is one about a long marriage,'' says
Nelson. ``It's rare to find in world literature a significant work
that's the story of a marriage that's been going on for a long time
and one that doesn't involve some melodramatic infidelity.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarer still is a small-scale musical from literary material that
manages to earn both critical plaudits and a steady audience.
Adapted and directed by award-winning playwright Nelson (``Two
Shakespearean Actors'', ``Goodnight Children Everywhere'') with
music by Davey, ``The Dead'' sold out its limited run off-Broadway
at Playwrights Horizon before moving to Broadway's Belasco Theatre
in January. The New York Times' Ben Brantley called it ``one of the
season's most astonishing and laudable accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogardus and Prince both performed in the New York production,
their paths overlapping for two weeks toward the end of the run.
They replaced Christopher Walken and Blair Brown, the production's
original Gabriel and Gretta.
</P>
<P>
   Bogardus had gotten a peek at an early version of the script,
back when he was under consideration for the role of Freddy Malins,
a part that eventually fell to Stephen Spinella. In the spring, the
producers again contacted Bogardus in Los Angeles. Walken was going
to be taking a three-week break, and they needed a replacement for
Gabriel on very short notice. The actor, who admits he ``couldn't
make sense'' of the version he had read a few months ago, paused
before signing on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was talking on the phone with Richard (Nelson), I told
him I was a little nervous about coming into a show that quickly,''
said Bogardus. ``He said that, unlike other directors who leave a
show once it opens, he would be there for me _ as he was for Faith
_ for all the rehearsals. Based on that, I said I'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't go entirely according to plan. The production
closed after two weeks, leaving Bogardus with a major case of
!italprojectus interruptus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just worked harder than at any time in my professional
career to learn this material and get into the show, and I realized
it wouldn't be until the last couple of shows that I would start
feeling really comfortable,'' he said. ``Then, when it ended after
only two weeks, it was sort of like unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come back here, and get eight weeks at the Ahmanson, I feel
like, `Ah, I'm going to be able to complete this journey.'''
</P>
<P>
   That his co-star is once again Faith Prince, with whom he had
previously worked in William Finn's ``Falsettoland,'' makes the
journey even more comforting. Both actors say the opportunity to
start anew gives them the chance to make the characters their own
rather than trying to duplicate the work of their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you replace, you tend to do what was,'' says Prince,
``but here we've gotten to examine it and come up with our take on
it, through Richard's eyes. It's been great fun to rework it and
make it our own.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Hospital benefits from fewer antibiotics
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hospitals usually prescribe antibiotics to save lives, but a
Utah hospital has dramatically reduced the death rate among its
patients by prescribing fewer of them.
</P>
<P>
   Using a computerized ``antibiotic assistant'' to advise doctors
on which antibiotics to use and when to administer them, the LDS
Hospital in Salt Lake City cut its use of antibiotics in half over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   It is an experiment being watched closely by other hospitals not
only because it is saving lives and money but also because it
promises to help curb the hospital-acquired infections that cause
88,000 deaths a year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``During that period we have seen the mortality rate among
patients taking antibiotics decline by more than 50 percent,''
University of Utah medical professor John Burke on Monday told the
International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said the 520-bed hospital's reduced use of antibiotics not
only resulted in significantly lower costs per patient but went
hand in hand with shorter stays in the intensive care unit and an
overall reduction in the length of patients' hospital stays from 16
to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors, especially those working in hospitals, have
traditionally overprescribed antibiotics _ often using them to
prevent infections in patients undergoing surgery or using
broad-spectrum ``antibiotics of last resort'' in situations where
another drug might be more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said the computerized ``assistant'' _ which provides
bedside terminals for consultation _ has made it possible for
doctors to know more about patients' risk of infection before
prescribing antibiotics, but also to determine which drugs are most
closely associated with constantly changing patterns of resistance
in the hospital.

A LOOK AT THE OTHER CENTRAL FIGURE IN THE FAMOUS CASE OF OSCAR
WILDE 
</HEADLINE>
  By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I am true Love, I fill the hearts of boy and girl with mutual
flame,'' Lord Alfred Douglas wrote in 1892, when he was 22. ``I am
the Love that dare not speak its name.'' And oh, he was dangerous,
pouty lipped, sweet voiced, capable of ruining the thing he loved
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Hyacinthus, whom Apollo loved so madly, was you in
Greek days,'' Douglas' lover, Oscar Wilde, wrote to him.
</P>
<P>
   And of course Douglas, or Bosie, as he was called, has gone down
in history as the man who ruined Wilde. In 1895 Wilde was convicted
of ``gross indecency'' and imprisoned because of his homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   But 20-year-old Douglas Murray, who is ending his second year at
Magdalen College, Oxford, thinks that Lord Alfred, who died in
1945, has gotten a bad rap. Murray is the author of ``Bosie,'' a
new biography of Douglas (Talk Mirimax Books/Hyperion, $27.95).
</P>
<P>
   Wilde ``was not sent to prison for Douglas,'' Murray said. ``He
was prosecuted for his relationship with rent boys,'' he added,
using a term for male prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bosie spent the two years Wilde was in prison defending Wilde,
writing articles to newspapers,'' Murray said. ``He petitioned
Queen Victoria for the release of Wilde.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who has been called the youngest biographer in England
by British newspapers, was speaking on the telephone from Magdalen,
Lord Alfred's former college. He said he had uncovered hundreds of
letters that had not been seen by previous biographers. And he
added that he has drawn a more balanced portrait of a man who has
been portrayed as the epitome of spite and manipulativeness.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas was born in 1870 into a noble Scottish family, the son
of the famously nasty Marquess of Queensberry. He met Wilde, by
then the successful author of ``The Picture of Dorian Gray,'' in
1891. Wilde was bloated, awkward, a married father of two sons. He
was soon besotted, although their sexual relationship seems to have
been brief. Bosie taunted Wilde by taking other lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Bosie and his father had a hysterical dislike for each
other. ``You impertinent jackanapes,'' his father wrote him.
</P>
<P>
   And after Bosie received a letter from his father condemning his
homosexuality, he wrote back, trying to infuriate him, ``What a
funny little man you are.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Douglas who urged Wilde to sue for libel after his father
delivered a card to Wilde that the Marquess later testified was
meant to read, ``For Oscar Wilde _ Posing as a sodomite.'' Wilde
lost, but that trial led to the one that resulted in his
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   While in prison Wilde turned on Douglas himself, writing the
famous ``De Profundis,'' a long diatribe against Bosie. Although it
contained some of his finest prose, the letter also took Bosie to
task for slights like failing to serve him lemonade when he was
ill.
</P>
<P>
   When Wilde, broken in body and spirit, was released in 1897, the
two men reunited. Apparently they did not resume a sexual
relationship but rented a villa in Italy, pursuing their writing
and influencing each other's work, Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Bosie's mother threatened to cut off his allowance if he
didn't leave Wilde. Bosie agreed, but only after his mother
promised to give Wilde money. When Wilde died in 1900 from injuries
suffered in a fall in prison, Bosie mourned him desperately and
paid for his funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Murray was born in West London. His father is a civil servant,
his mother a teacher. His older brother is a lawyer. At 8 he began
singing in the St. Margaret's Church choir. He went on to the Royal
Academy of Music, then won a scholarship to Eton. Murray said he
was 14 when he came across ``De Profundis.'' He went on to read
Douglas' poetry and was entranced by it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he explained, he planned to write about Douglas'
poetry but discovered how autobiographical it was and decided to
write his life instead. After Eton, when he was about 17, he said,
he began researching and writing the book. At the time he was
teaching at a school near Aberdeen, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas' executor, Sheila Colman, who, with her husband, looked
after Douglas in his final months, made his papers available to
Murray. After he finished the manuscript, Murray said he sat on it
for a year. Then, in his second term at Oxford, he was introduced
to Belinda Harley, a literary agent, who quickly sold it.
</P>
<P>
   In writing Douglas' biography, Murray had to contend with
Douglas' malice and his anti-Semitism. ``The effort of spending
time on him was only partly possible because he was such an
interesting and variable character,'' Murray said. ``The fact that
he changed so much, that fascinates me.''
</P>
<P>
   After Douglas left Wilde, he renounced homosexuality, converted
to Roman Catholicism and married Olive Custance. The marriage
failed. ``Bosie and Olive got on each other's nerves,'' Murray
said. ``But in later life, they saw each other every day. He was
absolutely distraught when Olive died.'' They had one son, Raymond,
who was institutionalized at 24 for schizophrenia. Douglas fought
for custody of his son, but it was denied because of his
relationship with Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Douglas became a carbon copy of his father. He
denounced Wilde, calling him talentless. He became so litigious,
Murray said, that ``at one point in the 1900s he couldn't stand in
court for one case because he was running in four cases at the same
time.'' In 1923 Douglas accused Winston Churchill of engaging in
war profiteering with Jewish friends and helping to blow up Lord
Kitchener.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said Douglas taunted Churchill, saying, ``If you honestly
believe you're not guilty, then why haven't you sued me?''
Churchill did sue and won, and Douglas went to prison for six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas ended his life penniless, his talent exhausted, living
in a basement apartment in Sussex. When he applied to the state for
a pension, it was denied because of his past.
</P>
<P>
   But in his 1938 memoir, ``Without Apology,'' he seemed to have
achieved some understanding of his life. In one passage he referred
to Wilde's last work, ``The Ballad of Reading Gaol'': ``The thought
that has only recently occurred to me is a terrible one. Did my
father really love me all the time, as I certainly loved him before
he turned against me, and was he only doing what Oscar says in his
great ballad all men always do, killing the thing he loved? Didn't
we all three, Wilde, my father and I, do it, more or less?''

 &HT;    Anti-germ agents may give germs the last laugh, some experts
fear
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For fussy parents and compulsive cleaniks everywhere, Tufts
University microbiologist Stuart Levy has some startling advice:
Cleanliness is not next to godliness.
</P>
<P>
   Soap and water are fine, but in a world of scrubbing bubbles and
lemon-scented disinfectants, a small but growing body of research
suggests that Americans could use a little more dirt. In fact, Levy
says, a sparkling, germ-free household may contain the seeds of the
country's next public health nightmare and endanger the health of
the children parents are trying to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few years we have seen an explosion of household
products that contain anti-bacterial compounds,'' Levy told the
International Conference on Emerging and Infectious Disease in
Atlanta on Monday. ``When we started looking at these products in
the mid-'90s, there were only a handful of them. Now there are over
700 of them. We are having trouble finding any households that
don't use them.''
</P>
<P>
   The tidal wave of bacteria-inhibiting products _ once limited
largely to household cleansers _ has exploded to include
chemical-impregnated bathroom tissue, soap, toothbrushes, towels,
mattresses, pillowcases, chopsticks, cutting boards, plastic
refrigerator containers, fabrics and even plastic toys.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, a former president of the American Society for
Microbiology, says that unlike traditional disinfectants _ alcohol,
bleach and hydrogen peroxide _ most of the new products that
promise to control germs contain a persistent anti-bacterial,
anti-fungal agent called triclosan, which marketers claim provides
the ``lasting protection'' that consumers want.
</P>
<P>
   Triclosan has been used effectively as a broad-spectrum
disinfectant in hospitals for at least 30 years, but Levy says the
rapid proliferation of its uses in the household may pose serious
risks to public health.
</P>
<P>
   He says the chemical's persistence and the host of products in
which it is being used provide an ideal opportunity for the
emergence of bacteria that are resistant, not only to triclosan,
but to commonly used antibiotics. In the pursuit of cleanliness,
American consumers may be contributing to the already serious
threat of antibiotic-resistant microbes.
</P>
<P>
   In laboratory tests, the levels of resistance that have emerged
in mutant bacteria that survive a dose of household disinfectant
containing triclosan have been low. But health experts say they
don't know what may be happening in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association is concerned enough to have
asked the Food and Drug Administration to require manufacturers of
triclosan products to prove that they really do inhibit bacteria.
And Swedish authorities, who have found the chemical in mother's
breast milk, are considering tighter controls on its use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying that these products are dangerous, but we've
only used them widely for about five years, so the time to look is
now,'' says Levy. ``The bandwagon for these products is just
getting bigger. The public doesn't really know what they do and
don't do, and increasingly the public doesn't have a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry says the public is, in fact, choosing
anti-bacterial products in droves, with sales of $400 million of
anti-bacterial hand soaps alone last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society is increasingly concerned about the very real
threat of disease caused by bacteria,'' said Ed Kavanaugh,
president of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association.
``Anti-microbial products are an essential part of good hygiene
routine. Anti-bacterial personal care products provide an extra
measure of protection for consumers at home and doctors and nurses
in hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   But Levy, the founder of the Alliance for the Prudent Use of
Antibiotics, fears that the rapid growth of anti-bacterial
household products is chillingly similar to the mistakes doctors
and hospitals have made in the past 50 years with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive and inappropriate use of prescription antibiotics
since the development of penicillin in the 1940s had led to the
emergence of disease-causing bacteria resistant to all major
classes of the drugs. A small but growing number of deaths in
hospitals are now due to germs for which effective treatments no
longer exist.
</P>
<P>
   Levy says it is ironic that public concern about these so-called
superbugs is at least partly responsible for the sudden increase in
germ-fighting agents in the home and the marketing ``craze'' that
is fueling it. And that a germ-free household is not only futile
but may impair the long-term health of children growing up in those
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies suggest that the development of asthma, allergies,
eczema and other disorders is most prevalent among children reared
in ``excessively clean'' environments that prevented routine
exposure to a wide variety of bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dirty environment is actually essential for the normal
maturation of the human immune system,'' Levy says. ``Parents who
are really concerned about the health of children need to be asking
themselves, `How clean?' And in most cases, the answer is
`soap-and-water clean, not chemically clean.'''

CLINTON ALREADY IN TROUBLE WITH JEWISH VOTE, LEADERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whether or not Hillary Rodham Clinton screamed an
anti-semitic slur at a campaign aide 26 years ago, it tells much
about New York politics that she has denied the claim with such
uncommon heat and with the direct assistance of her husband, the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Several Jewish leaders here said Monday they doubt the
allegation will have much impact on the first lady's Senate
campaign, in part, they said, because she is in trouble with many
Jewish voters already.
</P>
<P>
   Of a half-dozen local rabbis and Jewish leaders interviewed,
none thought reports of the alleged slur would change anybody's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent rabbi in Queens, who asked not to be identified,
called the report ``absurd,'' and said, ``No one has called me in
outrage about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Anti-Defamation League released a statement:
``Mrs. Clinton's public record shows no evidence of anti-Semitism
and we do not believe her to hold negative views about Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a wariness of Mrs. Clinton lingers. As the Queens rabbi
noted, ``Many people do not trust her. They really don't know what
she thinks about Israel especially. Jews like to know these things.
It helps them feel more secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's opponent in the Senate race, Rep. Rick Lazio,
sought to tap into this distrust. Calling the report ``a serious
allegation,'' he said, ``I don't know who to believe. New Yorkers
don't know who to believe. And therein lies a good deal of the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The flurry began late last week, when Internet columnist Matt
Drudge quoted from a new book about the Clintons by Jerry
Oppenheimer, a former National Enquirer editor.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer reports that, in 1974, after Bill Clinton lost a
race for Congress, Hillary, then his girlfriend, called campaign
aide Paul Fray a ``f------- Jew bastard.'' Fray is not Jewish,
though his paternal grandmother is.
</P>
<P>
   New York's main tabloids, the Daily News and the Post, picked up
the story Saturday, and cited Fray, his wife Mary Lee, and _ the
next day _ one other campaign worker, Neill McDonald, as confirming
the story. TV newscasts were fast to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton then took the unusual step of summoning reporters
to her house in suburban Chappaqua to deny and denounce the tale in
no uncertain terms.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, President Clinton rallied to her defense, took time out
from the Middle East summit at Camp David to make two phone calls
to the Daily News, one to its publisher, Mortimer B. Zuckerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there and (Hillary) never said it,'' the president was
quoted as saying in Monday's edition. ``In 29 years, my wife has
never, ever uttered an ethnic or racial slur against anybody. ...
She might have called him a bastard. ... But I've never heard her
tell a joke with an ethnic connotation. ... It's not in her.''
</P>
<P>
   As anyone in New York politics knows, if a story like this were
proved true, or were widely believed to be true, the results could
be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Just 12 percent of New York state's voters are Jewish _ 600,000
out of 5 million in the 1998 Senate race _ but they can be crucial
in a close election, and Clinton-Lazio is as close as they come.
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of Jews tend to vote Democratic, but the first
lady is not doing nearly that well.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls, taken well before this flap, show Jews favoring
her over Lazio, 54-34. This may seem a healthy margin, but the rule
of thumb is that Democrats must attract at least two-thirds of the
Jewish vote, to win a statewide contest.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Alphonse D'Amato won three Senate elections, in part
because he pulled away as much as 40 percent of the Jewish vote. In
his last race, two years ago, he lost to Charles Schumer in part
because he lured only 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has long cut a controversial profile among Jews.
Much of it dates back to a comment early in her husband's
presidency, advocating a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions about her deepened last November, when, on a trip to
the Middle East, she sat nonchalantly at a forum while the wife of
PLO chairman Yasir Arafat claimed Israelis have fired poison gas at
Palestinian children. Then, while saying goodbye, she gave Mrs.
Arafat a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton waited 24 hours to denounce Arafat's remarks,
saying that the simultaneous translation she heard was milder than
the official version she read later. (Reporters who were along on
the trip, and listened to the same translation, dispute this.)
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent these stories may have an effect,'' one
executive of a Jewish organization said, ``it will be within the
context of the Arafat incident. But most of those who worry about
the Arafat incident aren't going to vote for her, anyway.''

 &HT;    BellSouth unit seals deal in Colombia
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _While speculation continues about consolidation of
global telecommunications, BellSouth on Monday completed a little
consolidating of its own.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal valued at about $414 million, BellSouth-controlled
Celumovil announced consummation of its purchase of Cocelco, a
combination that establishes the first nationwide wireless carrier
in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Celumovil, which has revenue of $213 million and 466,000
subscribers, provides wireless service in the east side of
Colombia, including Bogota and Cartagena. Celumovil has acquired
Cocelco, which operates in the west of the country, including the
cities of Cali and Medellin. Cocelco, which has more than 200,000
subscribers, last year had revenue of about $85 million.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two companies will offer service in areas where 41
million people live.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, BellSouth, which has poured billions into Latin
America, said it is investing an undisclosed amount to become
majority owner of Celumovil, holding 50.4 percent. In May,
BellSouth paid $295 million for a 33.8 percent interest. The
Atlanta-based regional telecom company has investments in 11 Latin
American countries, most commonly as a wireless provider. Its
extensive presence in the region is rivaled only by Spain's
Telefonica, which owns primarily land-line phone systems.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the WorldCom-Sprint merger, the ambitious
Telefonica has _ like BellSouth _ been among those mentioned in
speculation about a range of combinations in the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, Telefonica failed to merge with KPN Telecom,
a Dutch company in which BellSouth has a stake. Telefonica's
aggressive chief executive, Juan Villalonga, is reportedly under
pressure to resign for certain alleged improprieties.

 &HT;    Profits fall, but beat forecasts
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Georgia-Pacific Group reported a 3 percent drop in
second-quarter profit on less demand and lower prices for building
products.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific reported quarterly net income of $206 million,
or $1.20 a share, down from $212 million, or $1.20 a share, in the
period one year ago. Sales were up sharply to $5.45 billion from
$3.81 billion due to recently acquired tissue and distribution
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The results beat Wall Street expectations that Georgia-Pacific
would earn $1.16 a share in the latest quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Improvement in the Atlanta-based company's pulp and paper
operations helped offset the weakened housing supply sector.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific's containerboard and packaging segment reported
operating profits of $141 million, compared with $76 million a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The group's pulp and paper segment reported operating profits of
$148 million, compared with $26 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Unisource Worldwide, the company's new paper distribution
segment, contributed operating profits of $41 million.
</P>
<P>
   But profits in the building products segment dropped to $173
million, compared with $364 million a year earlier. The
distribution segment of building products recorded operating profit
for the quarter of $7 million, down from $35 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the six months, Georgia-Pacific reported total sales of
$10.83 billion, up from $7.16 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Total profit for the first half of the year was $400 million, or
$2.30 a share, compared with $311 million, or $1.76 a share, a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific Group's results exclude the company's timber
business. The Timber Co. reported net income of $34 million, or 42
cents per share, compared with $49 million, or 57 cents per share,
in the prior period. That excludes a one-time, after-tax gain of
$50 million from the sale of timberlands in the 1999 period.
</P>
<P>
   For the six months, Timber Co. reported net income of $74
million, or 91 cents a share, compared with $96 million, or $1.11 a
share, excluding the one-time gain.

 &HT;    Georgia-Pacific to buy Fort James in $11 billion deal
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Georgia-Pacific made another move to stabilize its
boom-or-bust business Monday, announcing an acquisition that would
make it world's largest maker of tissue products.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting its share of the tissue market would give
Georgia-Pacific a reliable growth vehicle as the company tries to
become less dependent on surges in the paper and housing markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based forest products giant plans to buy rival Fort
James for $11 billion. Fort James shareholders would get $29.60 in
cash and up to 0.2644 share of Georgia-Pacific Group stock for each
share of Fort James they own. Georgia-Pacific would assume $3.5
billion of Fort James's debt.
</P>
<P>
   Known mostly for its building products muscle in North America,
Georgia-Pacific would become a global powerhouse in tissue. The
move would knock Kimberly-Clark out of the top spot and
giveGeorgia-Pacific well-known consumer brands such as Brawny paper
towels and Quilted Northern bathroom tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major step forward for Georgia-Pacific to a less
cyclical business, and this moves our (products) dramatically
closer to the customer,'' said Chairman and Chief Executive Pete
Correll.
</P>
<P>
   Like other forest products companies, Georgia-Pacific is prone
to wild swings in prices and demand. Although the paper side of the
business is enjoying an upswing from a major crash several years
ago, the building products side is taking a hit with the slowing
housing market.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific said the Fort James acquisition will help brace
earnings because tissue manufacturing is more predictable than
paper and lumber businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Fort James and Georgia-Pacific together would have about half
the tissue market in North America. Its next biggest rivals are
Kimberly-Clark, maker of Scott tissue, and Procter &AMP; Gamble, maker
of Charmin.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal also would give Georgia-Pacific its first
foothold overseas, principally in Europe. That signals a dramatic
shift in strategy by Georgia-Pacific's chairman, who has repeatedly
said the company did not have the expertise or the breadth to take
on international acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the domestic synergies drove this deal, but suddenly
we find ourselves the owner of the second-largest tissue producer
in Europe, the No. 1 in France... I think we owe it to ourselves
and shareholders to look at this as a new platform of growth,''
Correll said.
</P>
<P>
   But recent shifts in strategies are worrying some analysts. Not
long before Georgia-Pacific acquired paper distributor Unisource
Worldwide last year, company management said it wasn't interested
in growth outside its building products business, noted analyst
Mark Connelly of Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Unisource deal worked out well but left many investors
guessing as to the real strategic direction at G-P,'' said
Connelly, who downgraded Georgia-Pacific from ``buy'' to ``hold''
after the Fort James deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Now) they are picking up a major high-end consumer product
business that survives by going head-to-head with Procter &AMP; Gamble
every day,'' Connelly said. ``It's a business that G-P brings
little expertise to.'' Georgia-Pacific said it will sell plants
that make about 250,000 tons of tissue to help alleviate antitrust
concerns. The company will also get rid of ``non-strategic''
assets, which will be identified in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific also plans to cut $500 million in annual pretax
costs as a result of the deal. The acquisition is expected to add
to earnings after it's completed in the second-half of 2000,
excluding costs for goodwill, the company said. The companies have
agreed to a breakup fee of $125 million. If one of the companies
pulls out of the deal, that company would pay the fee.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the company's shares fell nearly 9 percent on
concern that it's paying too much for Fort James, whose costs have
risen on higher raw-material prices. The company's profits also
have been hurt by manufacturing problems stemming from the merger
of James River and Fort Howard, which created Fort James in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are buying a big, busted consumer-products company,''
said Mark Wilde, an analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, who has a
``market perform'' rating on Georgia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Investors Service said it may cut its ``Baa2'' ratings
on the companies' debt because the acquisition would increase
Georgia-Pacific's debt by about $6 billion.

 &HT;    Delta set to add Colombia service
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's shaping up as a busy fall for Delta Air Lines in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based carrier announced Monday it will start flights
between Atlanta and Bogota, Colombia, on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   That will be in addition to three other routes from Atlanta to
Mexico and South America that Delta already is set to launch:
Santiago, Chile, on Nov. 1; Leon, Mexico on Oct. 1; and Los Cabos,
Mexico, on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Delta subsidiary Atlantic Southeast Airlines also is starting
regional jet flights between Atlanta and Monterrey, Mexico, on
Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The new routes continue Delta's 2-year-old effort to build
service to Latin America, a region where it previously had no
significant presence. The strategy hinges on drawing travelers from
the eastern United States through Delta's Atlanta hub. Most
Latin-bound traffic flows through Miami, where American has a hub.
</P>
<P>
   When all the announced new flights are added, Delta will serve
15 destinations in Mexico, Central America and South America from
Atlanta, up from four at the beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Bogota flights are allowed under a new U.S.-Colombia air
treaty that allows seven more weekly round trips by a U.S. carrier.
The U.S. Department of Transportation designated Delta in a
preliminary decision. The DOT picked Delta over Continental
Airlines, which proposed serving Cali, Colombia, from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serving Colombia is an integral part of our strategic plan to
expand Delta's overall Latin America presence and to compete more
aggressively in the region,'' said Scott Yohe, senior vice
president-government affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America still accounts for only 3 percent of Delta
revenue, and the airline remains well behind American and
Continental in passenger volume and destinations. But Delta
executives say the region produces a 15 percent profit margin,
higher than the margins achieved by its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation is that Delta has focused on flying to national
business centers rather than tourist destinations, and more of its
passengers travel on higher, less restrictive fares.

 &HT;    Georgia-Pacific to buy Fort James in $11 billion deal
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Georgia-Pacific made another move to stabilize its
boom-or-bust business Monday, announcing an acquisition that would
make it world's largest maker of tissue products.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting its share of the tissue market would give
Georgia-Pacific a reliable growth vehicle as the company tries to
become less dependent on surges in the paper and housing markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based forest products giant plans to buy rival Fort
James for $11 billion. Fort James shareholders would get $29.60 in
cash and up to 0.2644 share of Georgia-Pacific Group stock for each
share of Fort James they own. Georgia-Pacific would assume $3.5
billion of Fort James's debt.
</P>
<P>
   Known mostly for its building products muscle in North America,
Georgia-Pacific would become a global powerhouse in tissue. The
move would knock Kimberly-Clark out of the top spot and
giveGeorgia-Pacific well-known consumer brands such as Brawny paper
towels and Quilted Northern bathroom tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major step forward for Georgia-Pacific to a less
cyclical business, and this moves our (products) dramatically
closer to the customer,'' said Chairman and Chief Executive Pete
Correll.
</P>
<P>
   Like other forest products companies, Georgia-Pacific is prone
to wild swings in prices and demand. Although the paper side of the
business is enjoying an upswing from a major crash several years
ago, the building products side is taking a hit with the slowing
housing market.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific said the Fort James acquisition will help brace
earnings because tissue manufacturing is more predictable than
paper and lumber businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Fort James and Georgia-Pacific together would have about half
the tissue market in North America. Its next biggest rivals are
Kimberly-Clark, maker of Scott tissue, and Procter &AMP; Gamble, maker
of Charmin.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal also would give Georgia-Pacific its first
foothold overseas, principally in Europe. That signals a dramatic
shift in strategy by Georgia-Pacific's chairman, who has repeatedly
said the company did not have the expertise or the breadth to take
on international acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the domestic synergies drove this deal, but suddenly
we find ourselves the owner of the second-largest tissue producer
in Europe, the No. 1 in France... I think we owe it to ourselves
and shareholders to look at this as a new platform of growth,''
Correll said.
</P>
<P>
   But recent shifts in strategies are worrying some analysts. Not
long before Georgia-Pacific acquired paper distributor Unisource
Worldwide last year, company management said it wasn't interested
in growth outside its building products business, noted analyst
Mark Connelly of Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Unisource deal worked out well but left many investors
guessing as to the real strategic direction at G-P,'' said
Connelly, who downgraded Georgia-Pacific from ``buy'' to ``hold''
after the Fort James deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Now) they are picking up a major high-end consumer product
business that survives by going head-to-head with Procter &AMP; Gamble
every day,'' Connelly said. ``It's a business that G-P brings
little expertise to.'' Georgia-Pacific said it will sell plants
that make about 250,000 tons of tissue to help alleviate antitrust
concerns. The company will also get rid of ``non-strategic''
assets, which will be identified in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific also plans to cut $500 million in annual pretax
costs as a result of the deal. The acquisition is expected to add
to earnings after it's completed in the second-half of 2000,
excluding costs for goodwill, the company said. The companies have
agreed to a breakup fee of $125 million. If one of the companies
pulls out of the deal, that company would pay the fee.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the company's shares fell nearly 9 percent on
concern that it's paying too much for Fort James, whose costs have
risen on higher raw-material prices. The company's profits also
have been hurt by manufacturing problems stemming from the merger
of James River and Fort Howard, which created Fort James in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are buying a big, busted consumer-products company,''
said Mark Wilde, an analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, who has a
``market perform'' rating on Georgia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Investors Service said it may cut its ``Baa2'' ratings
on the companies' debt because the acquisition would increase
Georgia-Pacific's debt by about $6 billion.

BELICHICK, UPSET BY SOME PLAYERS' CONDITIONING, IMPOSES FINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Bill Belichick may be tougher than Pete Carroll,
but so far the new coach is getting a dose of what the old one did
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   The new Patriots czar was irate over the conditioning of his
team in general and a handful of players in particular. For that,
he took action that may have sent a strong message.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick failed second-year safety Tony George on his running
test and made him sit out practice. George, who is diabetic,
couldn't finish the grueling running test Sunday; as it turns out,
George's blood sugar was low.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick levied fines Sunday that totaled close to $30,000, and
there were more prices to pay Monday. Tackle Ed Ellis, who had been
booted off his Barcelona Dragons team in NFL Europe, was cut
outright, saving the Patriots $472,000 on the salary cap, as was
former University of Massachusetts tight end Kerry Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick publicly humiliated George, receiver Martinez
Williams, second-year guard Derrick Fletcher, and backup
quarterback John Friesz by keeping them out of both sessions,
morning and afternoon. He had the four ride stationary bikes for
what seemed an eternity and then do laps around the field while the
rest of the team practices. When the process was repeated in the
hotter, more humid afternoon session, Fletcher looked ready to
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The return as a team was no better than average,'' said
Belichick. ``We have too many guys who are overweight and too many
guys who are out of shape, too many guys who haven't paid the price
at this point in the season. I talked to the team about that. I
talked to the team last night. Basically it's a situation where you
can't win in this league with 40 good players when the other team's
got 53. You need 53 to match with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a great display of reverse psychology, Belichick added, ``I
guess I haven't done a good job getting through to the players on
what they need to do prepare for a football season. Obviously I
have to do a better job at that to respond to the challenges that
are immediately ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Said safety Larry Whigham, ``He's pissed off right now. A couple
of guys are overweight. I was a couple of pounds overweight and he
was cursing me out. The running is not a big deal for the skilled
guys because we run. Tony didn't pass because he's a diabetic. He
was low on sugar he was ahead of the pack but he did it 19 times
and he couldn't do it the 20th. If you don't practice, you get
fined $3,000 for not practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fine money, however, was for players being over
their assigned weights. The players union allows a team to fine
players $50 for every pound over the assigned weight per day.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's running test is more grueling than the one used by
Carroll the past three years. Linemen are told to run 40 yards in
six seconds 20 times, with 30-second breaks in between. Fletcher
couldn't do it, and the 6-foot-6-inch, 350-pound guard from Baylor
was struggling mightily when he was running laps. Linebackers,
tight ends, fullbacks, and quarterbacks must run 50 yards in seven
seconds 20 times, while defensive backs, wide receivers, and
tailbacks must run 60 yards in eight seconds 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   George was scheduled to take another running test Tuesday. His
agent, David Canter of Team Sports, said he plans to appeal the
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony had it passed until his diabetes kicked in,'' said
Canter. ``I've advised Tony to speak to Coach Belichick about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Friesz has no idea when he will be back on the field. He said
that he failed a similar running test with the Seattle Seahawks in
1994 but was reluctant to elaborate, saying, ``We're not supposed
to talk to the media about these things. I'd like to defer for my
own well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   But Friesz did say he'd never missed a practice in his career
until Monday. Asked if he was upset about that, Friesz said, ``Of
course.'' Friesz seemed embarrassed about having to run around the
field. ``That's the implication that's tried to come across,
sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick even found reason to be unhappy with the weather. He
thought the morning session was too cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a couple of hot days to where they can be pushed in
training camp,'' he said. ``This isn't really indicative of the way
it is in preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked when the players who failed would be allowed back on the
field, Belichick said, ``It's not a question of being allowed, it's
a question of being ready. They'll have to show that they're
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he will not ``put the season in reverse'' to wait for
players to get into shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a player comes on the field four days into practice, it's
a higher level the fourth day of practice than the first day,''
said Belichick. ``When I think they're ready, I'll put them out
there. I thought that I had told the team in minicamp what I
expected and what I had to do. Most of the players I have no
problem with. There were too many players who didn't get the
message, who didn't respond the way I think they need to respond to
play in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   How many players?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than what it should be,'' said Belichick. ``It
shouldn't be any at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is probably correct; so why aren't some players
getting the message? The tough talk apparently hasn't worked. Fines
may hit some of the younger players hard, but veterans don't
necessarily respond to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we showed signs of picking up the system,'' said
Belichick. ``We were functioning as a team. The players who are out
there are working pretty hard making progress and improving. We
don't have enough people out there and some of the ones out there
aren't ready to go like they need to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not May, it's July. That's where we are, so we'll work
from here. The clock's running. Games are on the schedule; nobody's
going to move them. We're going to be there and so are the
opponents we play. We'll see where everybody is. We have a certain
time frame to work in. It's not the offseason anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing when a guy comes off an injury. It's another
when a player has a full opportunity and he can't go. You look at
Max (Lane), who couldn't do much in the offseason expect rehab his
knee. He's ahead of most of the people out there. It's a compliment
to him. They're not at a level he's at.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the players in question were those who hadn't been
big on strength and conditioning, Belichick said, ``It's a little
of everything. I haven't added it up. Too many guys not practicing
and too many guys overweight. We're moving on. Whoever can keep up
will keep up. We're not waiting for anyone.''

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ From his corner office in Canada
Place, a sparkling steel and glass high-rise, the premier of
British Columbia has a harbor view of Burrard Inlet, a sheltered
patch of sea water framed by mountains, but stained by history.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in 1914, Canadian officials detained a ship loaded with
376 Punjabi immigrants. After two months at anchor, the ship and
almost all its passengers were sent back to India, a reflection of
Canadian laws that then excluded virtually all immigrants from
India and that denied Indians living here the right to vote, run
for office or become lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the spot from here,'' mused the new premier, Ujjal
Dosanjh, rising from his chair to inspect the view from his new
seventh floor office. Born in a dusty village in Punjab in 1947,
the year that India won its independence and that Canada granted
long-resident Asians full citizenship rights, including the right
to vote, Dosanjh (pronounced doh-SANJ) is Canada's first provincial
premier of color.
</P>
<P>
   Dosanjh, the province's former attorney general, is the leader
of the province's New Democrats. When he was sworn in as premier,
the celebration featured samosa pastries and turbaned musicians
playing sitars.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of an Indo-Canadian to the leadership of Canada's
third-most-populous province reflects Canada's rapidly changing
ethnic nature.
</P>
<P>
   In another measure of Canada's embrace of its Asian immigrants,
Adrienne Clarkson, an ethnic Chinese refugee from World War II Hong
Kong, became Canada's governor general, or head of state, last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eastern Canada's two founding peoples may be the English and
the French,'' said Peter Newman, an author and journalist who lives
on a boat here. ``Well, in Vancouver the two founding nations are
now the Indians and the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   News media attention has traditionally focused on the roughly
350,000 ethnic Chinese living in this province, sometimes giving
this city the nickname ``Hong-couver.'' But the province's 250,000
Indo-Canadians are increasingly visible as a political and economic
force and are rapidly entering the Canadian mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Hanomansing, a 38-year-old Indo-Canadian reporter for CBC
television, is being groomed to become the network's national news
anchor. Baltej Dhillon has become the first Mountie allowed to wear
a turban. A 17-year-old Indo-Canadian girl from Ontario will lead
the nation's high school debating team next winter. And an
Indo-Canadian novelist from Montreal recently won a British
Commonwealth book prize for the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto at the Royal Ontario Museum, crowds are flocking this
summer to a new show, ``The Arts of the Sikh Kingdoms.'' And in
Ontario a leadership candidate for the nation's largest
conservative party, the Canadian Alliance, was photographed wearing
a Sikh head covering as he sought votes in a temple.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Canada's roughly half million residents of Indian origin
are Sikhs, a religious group centered in Punjab, a northern state
near Pakistan. As links grow, Punjabi state ministers regularly
visit here, and in September, Dosanjh is to lead a British Columbia
trade mission to his birth state.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada's House of Commons there are now five Indo-Canadian
members, including Gurbas Malhi, an Ontario Liberal who bills
himself ``the first turban Sikh elected in North America.'' The
other Liberal Sikh, Herb Dhaliwal of Vancouver, is federal minister
of fisheries and oceans. The other three Sikh members of Parliament
are from the Canadian Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In Dosanjh's leadership race, news analysts complained that
before the vote, the New Democratic Party became stacked with
Sikhs. Party membership rose by 75 percent in just three months, to
24,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are Sikhs in Reform, Liberal, Conservative and NDP, but
it is wrong for people to join more than one party,'' said Dave
Hayer, a Punjabi newspaper publisher who is running for the Liberal
nomination in Surrey-Tynehead, a new provincial assembly district
created to accommodate the huge inflow of Sikh immigrants here.
</P>
<P>
   Hayer incarnates the Sikhs' two most salient faces _ a concerted
push into the establishment, and a taste for political battle. The
pin on his blazer is a reminder that Hayer recently completed his
term as president of the local Rotary Club, the first Indo-Canadian
to hold the post. But his main job, as assistant publisher of The
Indo-Canadian Times, North America's largest Punjabi newspaper,
fell into his hands after his father, Tara Singh Hayer, was shot to
death in his wheelchair on Nov. 18, 1998. The police have
identified as a suspect a 39-year-old trucker who leads a Sikh
temple in Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Hayer's killing is a sequel to the political radicalization
that split the Sikh diaspora after Indian troops occupied their
holy site, the Golden Temple in Amritsar, in 1984. The following
year, an Air India plane from Canada blew up off Ireland, killing
all 329 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of Canada's obliviousness to the Indians in its
midst, Canada's prime minister at the time, Brian Mulroney, sent a
telegram of condolence to India's prime minister, although almost
all of those killed were in fact Canadian citizens. The Mounties
have said that suitcase bombs sent from Vancouver had destroyed the
Air India plane near Ireland, as well as another Air India plane
damaged the same day at Narita Airport in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, a Sikh radical attacked Dosanjh, one of
the few Sikh moderates who dared to speak openly against extremism.
Attacked from behind with an iron rod, Dosanjh's hand was broken as
he tried to defend himself, and he needed 80 stitches to recover
from head wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Dosanjh and others believe that the radicalism has ebbed.
Moderates have won control of Vancouver's largest temples. The
provincial government is curbing community development grants that
once were channeled to radical Sikh temples. And the federal
government is moving to curb Punjabi hate-radio transmissions that
have been broadcast to Vancouver from neighboring Washington state.
Journalists who closely follow Canada's 15-year-old investigation
into the Air India bombing predict that charges will be filed this
fall against a group of Vancouver-based Sikhs.
</P>
<P>
   As the popular image of Sikh violence ebbs, the election of
Dosanjh came about with little discussion of race. After three
months on the job, his approval rating in a survey of provincial
voters by Angus Reid Inc. was 64 percent. ``It is a real tribute to
British Columbia that we have accepted diversity as much as we
have,'' Dosanjh said. ``My approval rating tells me that people
don't see color.''

CISCO BUYS INTO WORLD OF INTERACTIVE TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Seeking to speed up delivery of interactive
television to the masses, Cisco Systems Inc. said Monday it is
paying $100 million to buy a 3.9 percent stake in Liberate
Technologies, a California company headed up by Massachusetts
expatriate, Mitchell T. Kertzman.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's entry into the world of interactive television is viewed
by analysts as a significant endorsement in the nascent technology
that has lately garnered a lot of buzz, but has yet to prove itself
in the mass market.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to combine television with the Internet, allowing
viewers, for example, to chat with other people watching the same
show, gather statistics on the sports event they are watching, get
real-time stock quotes, play along with a game show, download a
video game or movie, or click to get more information on a product
being advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics question whether people will want to interact with a
medium that has essentially been a passive form of entertainment.
But analysts say that results from recent market trials have been
encouraging and that the technology is slated to grow into a $25
billion-a-year industry by the year 2005, according to estimates by
Forrester Research. The money is expected to come from advertisers
and viewers who will pay for premium services, such as movies and
games on demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love to click on their television,'' said Josh Bernoff,
principal analyst with Forrester. ``There is not lots of empirical
evidence now to show that.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, about 5 million viewers in America will
be able to interact with programs and commercials on TV, Bernoff
said. That is projected to grow to 65 million viewers by the end of
2005.
</P>
<P>
   Driving that growth are cable and satellite television companies
seeking additional sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much in the cable companies' interest to put this
technology in your house, because every time you click, they get
revenue,'' said Bernoff.
</P>
<P>
   Both Liberate and Cisco are in a position to win big if
analysts' projections hit their marks. Liberate, which is based in
San Carlos, Calif., sells software that cable companies can use to
build a platform for interactive content, and Cisco, based in San
Jose, Calif., sells the networking equipment that links the
television to the Internet. Liberate, in its last fiscal year ended
May 31, collected $28 million in revenue from companies such as
MediaOne, Comcast, and Cox Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our software is the foundation upon which they build their
applications and content,'' said Kertzman, Liberate's chief
executive, known in Massachusetts for having founded PowerSoft
Corp. in Concord and then selling the company to Sybase Inc. for
nearly $1 billion in 1994. Kertzman said interactive television is
much more prevalent in Europe, where Liberate software is deployed
in about 200,000 set-top boxes. ``In the US, we're still in the
early stages of this. But you're going to see the beginnings of
real deployment by the end of the year,'' said Kertzman.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has not been kind to Kertzman this year. After
hitting a high of $128.53125 at the end of December, shares in
Liberate have dropped 74 percent. The company, which lost $80.8
million last year, suffered greatly in the technology selloff of
March as investors fled startups with skimpy sales and high costs.
</P>
<P>
   Because the interactive television market is so embryonic, no
single company has emerged as the premier player. Microsoft Corp.,
seen as Liberate's primary rival, is expected to come out with a
similar software package later this year. With Cisco's entrance,
analysts expect the market for interactive television to heat up
considerably given Cisco's marketing muscle and industry clout.
</P>
<P>
   Liberate's stock fell 43.75 cents to close at $33.6875 Monday on
the Nasdaq Stock Market. Cisco's stock, also traded on the Nasdaq,
climbed $1.375 to close at $69.625.

<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Ernie Els could make history at the
British Open this week, but he does not want to.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing second at the Masters and tying for second at
the U.S. Open, Els could become the first player to finish second
in three consecutive majors.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing first, however, is what Els has in mind. After winning
the Standard Life Loch Lomond tournament in Scotland last Saturday,
Els has moved up to No. 3 in the world ranking, and he heads into
the first round Thursday as one of the favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the course as well as anybody,'' Els said of the Old
Course at St. Andrews, one of golf's most historic settings. ``I'm
not going to read the papers, so you can write what you want. I
just want to go in there with my game plan, and I know there's one
guy you have to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   That guy would be Tiger Woods, the world's No. 1 player, who
will enter the tournament as the overwhelming favorite. But Els has
enough experience and confidence to not be intimidated by Woods
should they both find themselves in contention come Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Els and Woods opened the year with a memorable duel at the
Mercedes Championships in January, with Woods defeating Els on the
second hole of a sudden-death playoff. That set the tone for the
way Woods would gain the upper hand on Els _ and everyone else _
for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Els would love another crack at Woods, particularly at a major
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best player in the world by far,'' Els said. ``Any
course, if he's on his game, he's going to bring that course to its
knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I'm playing well, and I've said in the past that if
I'm playing well I can play with him. I know he's going to do well.
I've just got to stick to my guns. Let's play four days and see
what happens. He'll probably win, but let's see. Everybody has a
fair chance on Thursday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EASYGOING SURROUNDINGS
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere at St. Andrews was low key Monday, yet many
players were on the course for practice rounds. It was a calm day
by weather standards at St. Andrews, with moderate winds and
afternoon temperatures around 60 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Many American players have been in Scotland since last week,
giving them a lot of time to recover from jet lag. David Duval,
Phil Mickelson and Tom Lehman played in the Loch Lomond event.
Woods, Mark O'Meara and Lee Janzen practiced in Ireland before
coming to St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the early scouting report on the course: The fairways
and greens are hard and fast. Expect to see many bump-and-run
shots, with players intentionally landing their approach shots
short of the green and allowing the ball to run up onto the putting
surface. Players will also putt from well off the putting surface,
instead of chipping onto the green and rolling the ball well past
the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I played here, you could stop the ball much
quicker on the green,'' Vijay Singh, the reigning Masters champion,
said. ``I played with Seve Ballesteros Monday. He said he has never
seen the golf course this hard. I have been putting from 10 or 15
yards off the green. The practice green is almost as hard as
concrete. You have to get used to that. If you don't, then you are
not going to contend.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SNEAD REFLECTS
</P>
<P>
   Sam Snead, who won the 1946 British Open at St. Andrews, played
a few holes on the course Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still love to practice, and at home I play a little,'' said
Snead, who is 88 years old.
</P>
<P>
   After winning in 1946, Snead did not return to defend his title
at the 1947 British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost me $2,000 to come over in 1946, and I won the
tournament and got $600,'' Snead said. ``They said, `You coming
back to defend next year?' I said, `You're kidding.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A DETERMINED FALDO
</P>
<P>
   John Daly won the last British Open at St. Andrews in 1995, but
Nick Faldo won at St. Andrews in 1990. Faldo, who has begun to
regain his form after a lengthy slump, believes he can win again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have the drive, the enthusiasm and the dedication,''
Faldo said Monday. ``Maybe it will happen one more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Faldo won the 1990 British easily, by five strokes over Payne
Stewart and Mark McNulty, who tied for second place. Of Faldo's six
major championships, the 1990 British Open was one of his finest
performances, and just arriving at St. Andrews on Monday brought
back fond memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feel-good factor here,'' Faldo said. ``Things have
started to turn around the last couple of months. I think I'm
putting the pieces back to the jigsaw of what it takes to win
tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MISSING THE MARK
</P>
<P>
   Many players on the PGA Tour failed to qualify for the British
Open at local qualifiers in Scotland on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Those who failed to make the field included Brad Faxon, Len
Mattiace, Greg Kraft, Gary Nicklaus, Tom Pernice, Franklin Langham,
Harrison Frazar, Glen Day, Rich Beem and Rory Sabbatini.

AGRICULTURE TAKES ITS TURN IN THE GENOME SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a scientific first, and a coup for science in Brazil, a team
of more than 200 researchers there has for the first time
deciphered the complete DNA sequence of an organism that causes a
plant disease.
</P>
<P>
   Though other genome-sequencing efforts _ for example, in humans
or the laboratory staple fruit fly _ have attracted more attention,
the Brazilian target, an odd little bacterium known as Xylella
fastidiosa, distinguishes itself as the first to be decoded of the
countless nasty species that together cost farmers and foresters
many billions of dollars each year. This particular organism can
cause diseases in oranges, grapes, almonds, plums, peaches,
alfalfa, oaks, elms and other plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is quite thrilled,'' said Dr. Andrew Simpson, a
molecular biologist at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in
Sao Paulo, Brazil, and one of the team leaders. ``It's probably the
biggest ever scientific project in Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   The team has been feted by the president of Brazil and serenaded
by orchestras, and a new scientific prize was invented just to be
given to the team. It was an achievement for developing nations'
science as well, Simpson said, as this was the first complete
sequence to come from outside the United States, the United Kingdom
or Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium of scientists unveiled the full genome sequence
of this bacterium in the current issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said xylella's genome has already begun teaching
biologists lessons about how pathogens evolve and about the
destruction they cause. By revealing exactly which proteins this
bacterium enlists to build itself and live its life, the complete
sequence has also begun pointing the way toward methods for curbing
this particular strain of the bacterium that attacks orange trees.
</P>
<P>
   The report contains surprises, including the presence of genes
thought to be peculiar to animal pathogens and a complete lack of
some genes thought to be essential to plant disease organisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be the standard against which all subsequent
studies will be compared,'' said Dr. Edwin Civerolo, a plant
pathologist with the USDA's Agricultural Research Service at the
University of California at Davis. ``It gives you the basis for
designing novel and unique strategies for dealing with the disease,
things we'd never thought of before.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most surprising is that all this insight has come from
an organism about which almost nothing was previously known.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Collmer, a plant pathologist at Cornell University,
called the new study ``a big deal,'' adding: ``This is a complete
parts inventory for the bacterium. It's a remarkable demonstration
of the power of genomics to give you an instant insight into an
organism like this that was previously a black box. It's a
revolutionary first step to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have typically sequenced the genomes of organisms
that had already been intensively studied. But researchers said the
new work illustrates the power of genome sequencing as the first
step, rather than the last, in the path of knowledge, particularly
for organisms whose biology is largely a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   While designated a single species, Xylella fastidiosa is made up
of numerous strains, each of which specializes in victimizing a
different kind of plant. Researchers in Brazil, financed in part by
the $4 billion a year orange juice industry, studied a strain that
attacks orange trees after being injected into the plant by insects
known as sharpshooter leafhoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Once injected, xylella lives hidden in the plant's circulatory
system, a network of water-conducting tissues known as the xylem.
Hard to observe or collect and happiest inside a leafhopper or a
plant, the bacterium is fastidious and hard to grow in the
laboratory _ hence its name, fastidiosa. So though the diseases
caused by xylella can be severe _ in California, vineyards lose
tens of millions of dollars each year to the bacterium _ little was
known about the biology of this bug.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been learned now that the sequences of xylella's 2,800
genes are in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said one of the biggest surprises was finding genes like
those in animal pathogens, in particular three that were very
similar to those in the bacterium that causes meningitis in humans,
genes that help bacteria to gain a foothold in their host.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody suspected they'd be in these bacteria,'' said Simpson,
who said the finding suggests that there may be common themes in
disease-causing bacteria, irrespective of who the bacteria are
attacking.
</P>
<P>
   Other curious interlopers are the 83 genes from viruses that
came in, infected the bacterium and left their DNA behind. These
viruses also left DNA they had stolen from bacteria that cause
diseases in animals, including humans. Simpson suggested that such
wholesale importation of genes from other pathogens might be what
turned xylella from benign to disease-causing.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also discovered that xylella has a penchant for
sequestering iron, something that may explain the anemic, yellowing
leaves symptomatic of the disease. One possibility for curbing the
disease, said Simpson, was changing irrigation regimes to decrease
the amount of iron available in these plants.
</P>
<P>
   Any hint of a cure will be welcomed as farmers have few weapons
against this class of diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take, for example, citrus canker,'' another bacterial disease
of orange trees, Collmer said. ``It's the year 2000 and they handle
that by burning the orchard. That is a brutal indicator of just how
much at the mercy we are of these bacteria.''
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising discovery, however, has been what is not
there. All other disease-causing bacteria share a complex of genes
that allows them to inject specialized proteins that determine what
kind of host species a bacterium can successfully attack. But while
this system has been considered fundamental to causing disease,
xylella wreaks havoc just fine without it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact xylella's sequence is small, a mere one-thousandth the
size of the human genome, and 24 bacteria (not causing plant
disease) had already beat it to the finish line with little fanfare
in their respective countries. But researchers said xylella's
completion was worth a bit of hoopla as it marks not only the
revelation of a new genome, but the entry of a surprising new
player in a field dominated by developed nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This enabled them to launch a genomics industry in Brazil,''
Collmer said. ``I think they should celebrate.''

   GENERALMILLS-PILLSBURY (Minneapolis) _ They grew up side by side
on the banks of the Mississippi River, two 19th-century milling
companies that competed head to head and made this city the flour
capital of the world. Their decades-old signs still face each other
across the river in symbolic combat _``Gold Medal Flour,'' from
General Mills, on the west bank, and ``Pillsbury's Best'' on the
east. On Monday, though, General Mills and Pillsbury said they were
uniting to create a food giant with more than $12 billion in annual
sales. The merger would bring together such well-known brands as
Cheerios, Wheaties, Hagen Daz, Yoplait yogurt, Hamburger Helper,
Jolly Green Giant vegetables and Pillsbury bakery items, though not
all these products will remain within the new company's stable. By

   GENERALMILLS-PILLSBURY (Minneapolis) _ They grew up side by side
on the banks of the Mississippi River, two 19th-century milling
companies that competed head to head and made this city the flour
capital of the world. Their decades-old signs still face each other
across the river in symbolic combat _``Gold Medal Flour,'' from
General Mills, on the west bank, and ``Pillsbury's Best'' on the
east. On Monday, though, General Mills and Pillsbury said they were
uniting to create a food giant with more than $12 billion in annual
sales. The merger would bring together such well-known brands as
Cheerios, Wheaties, Hagen Daz, Yoplait yogurt, Hamburger Helper,
Jolly Green Giant vegetables and Pillsbury bakery items, though not
all these products will remain within the new company's stable. By

LAWSUIT SAYS USOC IGNORED POSITIVE DRUG TESTS FOR SOME MEDALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ American athletes have won medals in the Olympics after
testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs in Olympic
qualification trials, a former senior official of the U.S. Olympic
Committee said in a lawsuit against the committee filed Monday here
in federal district court.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Dr. Wade Exum, who served nine years as director
of the committee's Drug Control Administration, charged that the
Olympic committee has essentially ignored test results that would
otherwise have led to sanctions against athletes. This was a
strategy, he asserts, that encourages athletes to use illegal drugs
to improve their performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The USOC has thrown roadblocks in the path of anti-doping
enforcement,'' Exum says in a 31-page complaint that seeks
compensation for what he describes as wrongful termination, in
part, because he is black. ``In recent years absolutely no sanction
has been imposed on roughly half of all the American athletes who
have tested positive for prohibited substances.''
</P>
<P>
   Exum, who was dismissed last June 5, further claimed that he
uncovered ``scores'' of athletes who tested positive for
testosterone, an illegal substance that is especially popular among
track and field athletes, but never became aware of any sanction by
the Olympic committee. He also said that athletes continue to use
``synthetic testosterone'' without fear of punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Blake, the chief executive of the Olympic Committee, said
in a statement that upon quick review of the lawsuit, he found the
complaint to be ``without merit,'' adding that committee lawyers
would offer a proper response in time.
</P>
<P>
   Blake also criticized Exum for filing the lawsuit less than two
months before the opening of the Olympics in Sydney, Australia, a
time frame that would result in ``unwarranted allegations,''
tarnishing the reputation of athletes and their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Exum, 51, a physician and a psychiatrist who was hired
by the Olympic committee in 1991, nor his lawyer was available for
comment. The lawyer, John W. McKendree, was out of town, and Exum
said in a statement that he would have nothing to say publicly
about the lawsuit before a news conference, scheduled for Friday.
Last month, Exum made similar accusations in a letter made public
by his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, Exum declined to mention any athletes by name or
sport. But his allegations paint a particularly harsh picture of a
drug enforcement system designed to do anything but enforce
regulations. His charges suggest American athletes who use illegal
substances have nothing to fear from Olympic authorities and that
anytime he tried to intercede to improve the system, he was
undercut by superiors who brushed aside his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   He also repeated a familiar concern raised by other critics of
the United States drug-fighting efforts over the years, that by
paying two laboratories to analyze urine samples for possible drug
use, the Olympic committee engages in a conflict of interests that
removes any incentive for lab directors to develop better tests or
technologies that might discourage drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The overall result, he claimed, has led to ``arbitrary and
capricious results with improperly lenient treatment for certain
athletes presumed positive for performance enhancing drugs and with
most athletes receiving such light punishments, or no punishments,
as to encourage the use of prohibited performance enhancing drugs
or doping methods.''
</P>
<P>
   As a further consequence of the Olympic committee's problems
fighting illegal drugs, he said, his efforts have ``lost
international credibility'' and his own reputation has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to allegations about drug-testing procedures, Exum
charged that many of his problems working for the Olympic committee
reflected his race, which he claimed was the sole reason he was
denied promotion to Chief Medical Officer. Four times, he said,
control over the budget for his activities was controlled by white
administrators, one of whom, James Page, had been banned for life
from the national and international governing bodies of skiing for
his role in an athlete's drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Exum said all four of his white superiors were variously
promoted over him or given authority over the committee's Sports
Medicine and Drug Control functions despite the fact none of them
had a medical degree or expertise in drug-fighting strategies. Exum
said that he, on the other hand, was often criticized for not being
``a team player,'' which led him to conclude that his ``race and
color'' cost him any opportunity to advance.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit makes eight charges against the Olympic committee,
including misrepresentation, wrongful termination and racial
discrimination.

 &HT;    Bush to hit the road before convention
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Gov. George W. Bush continued playing the
vice presidential guessing game Monday, telling reporters on the
campaign trail that he would launch his pre-convention trip in
President Clinton's home state but declining to say when or where
he will announce his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not made a final decision,'' Bush said. ``When I do, I
will let you know _ maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by Andy Card, manager of the Republican National
Convention, Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and U.S. Rep. Asa Hutchison
and U.S. Sen. Tim Hutchison _ brothers and Arkansas Republicans _
Bush refused to say who is on his short list.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Times reported Monday that Bush had narrowed the
list to four candidates, Sens. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Fred
Thompson of Tennessee and Govs. Frank Keating of Oklahoma and Tom
Ridge of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into those kind of details,'' Bush said
when asked how many people remain on his list.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to picking a running mate, Bush is working on travel
plans leading up to the Republican National Convention, which opens
July 31 in Philadelphia. Campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes said
current plans, subject to revision, call for Bush to leave Austin
for Arkansas on July 28 for a trip that will include stops in
Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia before arriving in
Pennsylvania on Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The states on the trip are critical ones that Republicans have
not carried since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Monday in Little Rock, Bush visited the Centers for Youth and
Families to pitch his ``Caring Fathers, Safe Children'' initiative,
which would direct the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
to encourage states to establish and publicize paternity
registries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's credentials as a family-friendly candidate took a hit
Monday when Business and Professional Women, a Washington-based
organization, reacted harshly to a memo written in 1998 by Bush
adviser Don Willett.
</P>
<P>
   Willett, challenging the proposed wording of a gubernatorial
proclamation honoring the women's group, said in the memo that he
questioned the existence of a ``glass ceiling'' that limits women's
advancement in the business world. He also likened day care to
placing children ``in the care of rented strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Shaffer, chief executive officer of Business and
Professional Women, said the comments ``trivialize the survival
issues of America's working families.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is the Bush campaign's mantra of compassionate
conservatism?'' she asked. ``Issues like child care, equal pay for
equal work and eliminating sexual harassment need more than lip
service from our national leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said Willett's comments were his
own and do not reflect Bush's attitudes on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush appreciates the concerns of working women and
recognizes their vital contribution to the work force,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Business and Professional Women is a nonpartisan, nonprofit
organization. The group has a political action committee that
endorses and makes campaign contributions to candidates, who
generally are Democrats.

 &HT;    Campaign funds to be posted on Internet
 &HT;    By Gaiutra Bahadur
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's now much easier for Texans across the state
to follow the money, along a cybertrail.
</P>
<P>
   Starting today, political campaign finance reports filed
electronically with the Texas Ethics Commission will be posted on
the Internet, making them more widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Texas joins a group of about 20 states that mandate electronic
disclosure of contributions and expenses by candidates and
lawmakers, according to the California-based Center for
Governmental Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Watchdog groups hailed the online database's debut, officially
at midnight today, as a victory for open government.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, members of the public and the news media outside of
Austin had to make a special trip to the capital city or pay for
copies of the reports to be mailed to them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, campaign finance reports are available in three formats: on
paper, on computer diskette and at http://www.ethics.state.tx.us,
the ethics agency's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The information is available for every candidate, officeholder
and political action committee _ unless they have filed an
affidavit stating they don't have access to a computer to file
their reports electronically or they have raised or spent less than
$20,000 in a year. Statewide officeholders and candidates must file
their reports electronically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important step forward in making information
available to everyone in all parts of Texas,'' said Suzy Woodford,
the state's executive director of the group Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
   However, some open government advocates said the victory was not
complete, since the specific addresses of contributors will not be
available online or on computer diskette.
</P>
<P>
   ``In concept, we thought it was a very good thing,'' said Craig
McDonald, director of the nonprofit, Texans for Public Justice.
``It has computer age promise, but it's going to have carbon paper
impact ...''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerry Madden, R-Richardson, one of the architects of the
law that excluded contributor addresses from online disclosure,
said that privacy was a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think somebody who donates to a campaign should
immediately have their information available to all these mail-out
groups,'' he said. ``The question was 'how do we protect the
average person on their donations?' and help them avoid harassing
solicitation letters, be they political or otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   In a controversial ruling in March, Attorney General John
Cornyn, responding to a question from the Ethics Commission, said
addresses should also be excluded from computer diskettes.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said that ``there's no privacy issue at stake,'' since
the addresses are available on paper, and that it ``is nearly
impossible to tell who a donor is,'' without more information than
a name.
</P>
<P>
   Texans for Public Justice, which does not advocate online
postings of addresses, will file a formal request with the ethics
commission to make addresses available on computer diskettes. If
the request is denied, the group plans to sue the commission,
McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Cornyn's opinion stands,'' he said, ``if electronic
disclosure is undermined by his opinion and rendered almost
ineffective, we have no choice but to go to court.''

APING WALL STREET PROS, ONLINE INVESTMENT CLUBS GAINING
POPULARITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brittany Christ had bounced between three 401(k) plans in 12
years. She had been through a raft of Fidelity funds and bought
shares in Intel, Oracle and Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   She had even kept up with the latest books on investing. But it
was the Web that finally inspired her to form the Dart Throwin'
Monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Christ, 30, who works for Verizon
Communications in St. Petersburg, Fla., whipped together the
investment club in a few months by recruiting members in an online
chat room at Motley Fool, a Web site devoted to investor education.
</P>
<P>
   After enlisting a soldier, a lawyer, a software engineer, a
fireman, a toy store manager, another telecommunications worker and
``two administrative types,'' Christ and the eight other Dart
Throwin' Monkeys (more on that later) turned to Bivio, a new
Internet company based in Boulder, Colo., that offers services for
investment clubs, to build a private site where they could
communicate, store minutes from their meetings and keep tabs on
which member was worth what, when.
</P>
<P>
   The Dart Throwin' Monkeys could not be confused with the
Beardstown Ladies. After all, some of the Ladies, affable elders
from Beardstown, Ill., who created a cottage industry around their
investment club in the mid-90s before an accounting error deflated
their returns, say they still do not even have computers.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Monkeys are a new breed, taking advantage of a new crop
of Internet companies offering one-stop shops for investment clubs
at no cost. These companies merge communication tools with software
engines that handle complex administrative bookkeeping functions
and compile tax returns. And although sites like Motley Fool have
long provided a forum for investment club members, the new sites
take the clubs one step further.
</P>
<P>
   Bivio and another fledgling company, Actifunds of Cambridge,
Mass., also act as digital matchmaking services for people who want
to form clubs. Bivio, which opened in December has already signed
up 1,700 clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investment clubs, in contrast to mutual funds or the brokerage
industry, are a cottage industry,'' said Robert Brooker, chairman
of Actifunds, which is completing its seed round of financing
before it opens shop. ``That's why we look at the total amount of
assets in investment clubs, we believe about $10 billion, as just
the beginning of the growth.''
</P>
<P>
   A third Internet venture, Foliofn, which began in May, lets
investors cheaply assemble mutual fund-like portfolios and plans to
expand its services to accommodate investment clubs. And message
board sites, operated by prominent Internet companies, are paying
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investment club space is an important space,'' said Bryan
Burdick, the top executive at Silicon Investor, a stock chat site
that is a unit of Go2Net. ``We think it's a natural fit for the
Silicon Investor community.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, more than 36,000 domestic clubs with an estimated
$1.5 billion in assets are members of the National Association of
Investors Corp., a 49-year-old nonprofit organization that has been
the main resource for investment clubs until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are craving ways to bring other people into their
investing experience, that's why the stock discussion sites are so
popular,'' said Ion Yadigaroglu, 30, co-founder and chief executive
of Bivio. Two years ago, Yadigaroglu formed his own club, named
Cosmic Returns Into the Far Horizons. It was an epiphany for
Yadigaroglu, an astronomer who grew up in the United States and
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent time at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif.,
studying astrophysics, and having had Jeff Skoll, eBay's first
employee, as one of his roommates, the Internet was on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent '92 to '97 in Palo Alto, so you couldn't avoid the
Internet, you couldn't avoid being involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is so enthusiastic about his new online
venture. Bivio's software application that matches new users to
existing members has led executives of the nonprofit group to
question whether online solicitations run afoul of Securities and
Exchange Commission regulations.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the notion of connecting people who might not all
contribute equally. In such cases, an investment club might be
subject to regulation as a mutual fund, according to SEC rules.
Membership interests in a club are considered securities ``if
members invest and expect to make a profit from the entrepreneurial
and managerial efforts of others,'' the agency's Web site says, as
opposed to sharing in stock picking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got an investment club and you advertise for
members, you're selling securities,'' said Robert O'Hara, a vice
president of National Association of Investors Corp. ``The SEC
frowns on that kind of activity. We have 117 chapters around the
country, and they are not allowed to advertise that they have clubs
looking for members.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has not made any direct comment on Bivio or the concept
behind it, but one former official said she did not see a problem
in the online migration of clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural evolution that clubs would move online and do
most of their organizational work online,'' said Nancy Smith, a
securities lawyer and former director of the SEC Office of Investor
Education and Assistance, who now works for Foliofn.
</P>
<P>
   There is reason for the National Association of Investors Corp.
to see Bivio as something of a threat. While the association
primarily considers itself an educational organization, it does
sell accounting software. Bivio gives it away. Even so, Phyllis
Pawlovsky, a former president of the New York chapter of the
association, sits on Bivio's advisory board and thinks the two are
complementary.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``As a member of both organizations, I feel that both do their
share in increasing investment opportunities for the little guy,''
she said. ``NAIC teaches you how to evaluate companies. Bivio lets
you do it online and join an online community.''
</P>
<P>
   A more pressing question might be whether these companies can be
profitable. Bivio makes money by directing its users to third-party
services advertised on its site, like an online broker called
Buy-and-Hold.com, and then sharing the revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these companies are indeed successful at creating a
compelling proposition for community investing and then use that to
extend relationships with the online brokerages, then it would
indeed be very valuable,'' said Andrew Goldfarb, who runs the
Boston office of the venture capital firm Jafco Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Offline or online, the intent of investment clubs now seems
about the same as it ever was: to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Christ had read Suze Orman, the personal finance empowerment
guru, and Peter Lynch, the former manager of Fidelity Magellan, and
the Beardstown Ladies' best sellers. Still, she did not feel like
she knew that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself between a beginner and a novice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Monkeys have ponied up a total of $985 after their
first round of monthly dues, about $30 to $50. Now, they are
weighing the merits of Kmart versus Target and Oracle versus Sun
Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Web aside, they still do some things the old way. Christ
picked from a Florida-focused Motley Fool board, so her club could
meet once a month in person. And the Monkeys prefer to pay for
National Association of Investors Corp.'s accounting software,
rather than totally entrust their bookkeeping to the free tools
offered by an untested dot-com.
</P>
<P>
   So what about that name? Christ explains that another member
lifted it from the 1973 best seller ``A Random Walk Down Wall
Street,'' by Burton Malkeil. In the book, Malkeil, a Princeton
professor, says a blind-folded primate tossing darts at the
business section of a newspaper could outperform the average
investment professional.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Malkeil actually wrote of a dart-throwing
chimpanzee. But whatever the animal, the Monkeys are confident they
can hit the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can do better than the experts on Wall Street,''
Christ said.

FREED HOSTAGE FEARFUL FOR FATE OF HUSBAND, SON, 16 OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines _ Looking shellshocked and disoriented as
tears of relief melted into a smile, an ailing German housewife _
released by Muslim rebels Monday after 85 days in the jungle _ took
her first wobbly steps of freedom at a military airbase here. She
said she hoped the remaining 18 captives, including her husband and
son, would soon follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling very happy to be released, but not 100 percent,
because the others are still hostage,'' said Renate Wallert, 56.
Wallert, who was suffering from high-blood pressure, chronic
anxiety, and other ailments after 12 weeks of captivity, was helped
out of a helicopter and leaned on an official's arm as she
staggered forward in a pair of yellow rubber beach thongs.
</P>
<P>
   She was the first Western hostage freed by the rebels, a
bittersweet gift for her 34th wedding anniversary since her husband
and 25-year old son were still captive.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough in the hostage crisis that has dragged on for
three months _ punctuated by a failed military rescue, a rotating
team of negotiators, and a month-long hiatus in talks _ raised hope
that a deal as being cut so that the rest of the captives might
soon walk free.
</P>
<P>
   Wallert was one of 21 people snatched from a SCUBA diving resort
on the Malaysian island of Sipidan on April 23, Easter Sunday. The
group was transferred by boat to a jungle redoubt on Jolo Island in
the Philippines' Mindanao region, a base for Abu Sayyaf, a
breakaway faction of Muslim separatists.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers demanded $1 million for each hostage and an
independent Muslim state. The government tried a military assault
instead, spurring the rebels to move the hostages and leaving talks
in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike two larger separatist groups with a clearer ideology who
have conducted a protracted guerrilla struggle, the Abu Sayyaf has
operated like bandits, taking hostages and demanding ransoms since
the death of their charismatic founder in December 1998. Earlier
this year they abducted 41 Filipinos, including schoolchildren, and
killed three of those hostages.
</P>
<P>
   All three groups operate in the mostly Muslim southern region of
Mindanao in this heavily Roman Catholic nation, with three million
to four million Muslims among 72 million people. Mindanao enjoyed
centuries of self-rule before Spanish colonization, but today it is
one of the country's poorest regions
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf had earlier released two Malaysian hostages, both
Muslims, but the prospects of freedom for the others looked slim
after the rebels refused to release Wallert when she became ill, or
a pregnant South African who miscarried a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia said from the outset that it would pay for the release
of its nationals and opened back-channel negotiations, infuriating
Manila. When the second Malaysian was released Friday, chief
Philippines negotiator Robert Aventajado said Malaysia had offered
to invest in development programs in the impoverished region, but
he denied that any ransom was paid. Other officials said privately,
however, that no one has ever been released by Abu Sayyaf without a
payment of some kind.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Jawa Selamat, the Malaysian hostage freed Friday, said
rebel chief Galib Andang, known as ``Commander Robot,'' had said
all hostages might be released soon. The rebels still hold two
Germans, seven Malaysians, two French, two Finns, two South
Africans, two Filipinos and a Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a German magazine reporter and three members
of a French television crew were abducted, as well as 13 Filipino
evangelists who went to the rebel camp to pray. In May, armed men
seized a group of German reporters and released them only after
$25,000 ransom was paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sorting out the demands as to which are doable and
which are not,'' Aventajado said Sunday. ``We are addressing the
root cause of the problem, which is poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Andang, the rebel leader, revised his demands to include
government assistance for projects to improve people's livehlihood
on Jolo, including developing an orange plantation on land he
controls turning it into a cooperative, Aventajado said. Other
negotiators said Abu Sayyaf was no longer demanding a Muslim
homeland, but still wanted the ransom money.
</P>
<P>
   Major General Guillermo Ruiz Ruiz, who went with Aventajado to
retrieve Wallert, said she was trembling and had covered her face
with her scarf when she was released from her captors' Jeep and
turned over to officials at a location outside the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was crying. She didn't actually know what was happening
until Secretary Aventajado identified himself and assured her she
was safe,'' said Ruiz, security adviser for the negotiating team.
``She didn't know if they were planning to kill her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz said Wallert's mood brightened on the helicopter ride from
Jolo to Zamboanga, and that she snapped pictures out the window of
``the beautiful islands'' and of the negotitators who secured her
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   On April 28, a spokesman for Abu Sayyaf threatened to behead the
hostages if their demands were not met. On May 3, they moved the
hostages after Philippines troops fired into the camp. The hostages
were moved nearly 10 times, carrying Wallert on a stretcher each
time. A Finish hostage wrote a letter recently saying they were
near suicide from despair.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the others, Wallert said, ``They are very sad all
the time. They are sitting, waiting for release.''
</P>
<P>
   Clad in blue batik beach pants and a green shirt, she was flown
Monday evening to Manila and on to Germany to be reunited with her
other son.
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Gloria, a fellow at the Ateneo Center for Social Policy
and Public Affairs in Manila and co-author of a newly-released book
on the Muslim rebels, described the Abu Sayyaf as ``loose,
reckless, heavily-armed . . . and linked to corrupt soldiers and
businessmen.'' She called the group ``a long-term security problem
for governments in southeast Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Abu Sayyaf is not truly pushing for an independent Islamic
state,'' she said. ``This is a group that doesn't know what it
wants. They are making money off a political cause.'' She said the
group collected $50,000 from ransoms and payments demanded from the
foreign media covering the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine government and European countries with nationals
among the hostages have maintained a strict no-ransom stance, and
Aventajado insisted that no money had been paid for Wallert's
release. ``It was a goodwill gesture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Abu Sayyaf had been offered immunity from
prosecution, Ruiz refused to answer directly, saying, ``I guess
later on that could be taken up. . . . It will depend on the
negotations.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the Philippine army said about 100 suspected
members of a larger Muslim rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front, killed 21 Christians, including a pregnant woman, in a
mosque in another part of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
   The group denied the accusation, saying it would never desecrate
a mosque, and suggested that the military was involved in the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Marites Danguilan Vitug, co-author with Gloria of ``Under the
Crescent Moon: Rebellion in Mindanao,'' said the hostage crises,
along with renewed fighting between the government and Liberation
Front, has ``opened very old anti-Muslim sentiment among
Christians. . . . That's a very painful division now.''

TO ITS RESIDENTS, WACO MEANS MUCH MORE THAN BRANCH DAVIDIAN CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (National Journal) 
 By ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ For this friendly industrial city of 100,000,
whose name has become synonymous with both governmental and
religious excess, Friday's swift verdict by an advisory jury in the
Branch Davidian civil case brought neither surprise nor relief.
</P>
<P>
   Waco just wants to forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really want it all to just go away,'' said Bill Buzze, a
music shop owner, over a lunch of Whataburgers and iced tea a few
blocks from the federal courthouse where the case was heard.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by brass horns and big bass drums, Buzze said, ``It's
gone on too long, cost too much money and hurt too many people.''
</P>
<P>
   It took the five-person panel just over an hour to decide that
the federal government had no liability in the 1993 raid, standoff
and fire that killed nearly 80 followers of David Koresh and four
agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Because the jury's role was merely advisory, the presiding
judge, Walter S. Smith, will issue a final decision sometime next
month in the $675 million wrongful death lawsuit brought by
survivors and relatives of the Branch Davidians killed at the
sect's Mount Carmel compound in Elk, near here.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the seeming finality of the jury's decision, Waco
residents sense that their deeply religious community on the banks
of the Brazos River will be forever marked by the violence at Mount
Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will always be on Waco, the stigma,'' said Inez
Bederka, who also works in the music shop. ``People are still
putting Waco down real hard these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outside world just won't treat you fair after a thing like
that,'' Bederka said. The only good news to come out of the Branch
Davidian case was that, after all the publicity, she said, ``at
least people know we don't have horses and cows wandering in the
streets down here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a shame that something bad like that had to happen
before people heard about Waco,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Buzze, 58, complained that since the standoff seven years ago,
visitors have acted differently toward Waco residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``People weren't curious about us before, but now when they call
us they just want to talk about Koresh and the standoff, and
whether or not we have any more religious nuts with guns here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chamber of Commerce has a tough job now,'' he said. ``They
have to reassure people that we're not going to shoot them if they
come down to visit.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Jack Stewart, president of the Chamber of Commerce, bristles at
the notion that Waco has become a symbol of excessive force by the
federal government or religious zealotry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people refer to Waco in that way they're talking about an
episode that didn't even occur here. That doesn't describe Waco,
the family-oriented community, the wonderful people, the thriving
businesses. That's Waco,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   He prefers that people think of Waco as the site of a Raytheon
aircraft modification plant or as home to M&AMP;M Candies, the makers
of Skittles and the Milky Way bar, rather than the place where
guns, government and God collided seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said that residents are generally aware of the verdict,
but that it is difficult to characterize their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not new news to us. We've been living with these
events a long time,'' he said. ``We view the verdict as part of the
process. Mostly, people just want to get on with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the events at Mount Carmel, Buzze said, Waco was known
primarily for its 200 churches, its many Baptists, and Baylor
University _ a Baptist institution _ which together earned Waco the
nickname Bethlehem on the Brazos.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a good place to raise a family, to leave your bicycle
laying in the yard and your doors unlocked. This is a nice place to
live, but now people think Waco is where crazy people do crazy
things,'' he said. ``Now that it's over maybe the town can get back
to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though Waco residents want to put the events of Feb. 28 through
April 19, 1993, behind them, outsiders fascinated by the tragedy
continue to visit the wreckage of Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, David Combs of Paw Paw, Mich., toured the memorial
grove of crepe myrtle trees and the chapel recently erected where
the Branch Davidians' home once stood, even though he said he had
had a hard time getting directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't even want to tell you where the compound is,''
Combs said, as he surveyed the grounds with his wife, Judy. ``The
folks in Waco kept asking us: `What do you want to go out there
for? There's nothing there.'''.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out over the burned-out hulk of a school bus, a tangle
of charred concrete and wire, and a battered motorcycle propped up
among the weeds, Combs said he understood the way Waco residents
felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to be on the map for this,'' he said. ``They
don't want to be remembered for what happened here. It's too
awful.''

SKECHERS-LAGEAR-GREENBERGS) 
 By KRUTI TRIVEDI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Greenberg, the founder and president of the trendy shoe
company Skechers, is so determined to get his company's message out
that he follows a written outline when he recites a list of recent
feats.
</P>
<P>
   Skechers (pronounced SKETCH-ers), he says deliberately and
between glances at the crumpled bit of paper in front of him in the
company's booth last month at the Fashion Footwear Association of
New York exposition, is now the third most popular brand among
teen-agers, after Nike and Adidas. Company sales, he adds, jumped
40 percent last quarter compared with a year earlier. And as
retailers are becoming choosier about which shoe brands to stock,
both Lord &AMP; Taylor and Athlete's Foot have just signed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a Gap of footwear,'' Greenberg, 37, said, ``I
believe that Skechers would be that company.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg's dogged focus shows as much about his ambitions as
about his determination to leave behind what many analysts see as a
nagging past.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Skechers USA Inc., based in Manhattan Beach, Calif.,
seems to be something of a find. As the shoe business slowly
revives from its recent slump, the small, 8-year-old family-run
company is leading the charge. Its winning formula is simple:
Skechers makes lower-priced versions of popular shoes like the
latest high performance Nikes and dress loafers by Kenneth Cole.
And its stock has been among the market's best performers this
year.
</P>
<P>
   That meteoric rise, however, followed a steep decline after
Skechers' initial public offering in June 1999 _ a sign, analysts
say, of concern that the company has some uncomfortable parallels
with the last Greenberg family project, L.A. Gear Inc., one of the
retailing industry's most spectacular collapses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greenbergs are going to have to prove that Skechers is not
L.A. Gear,'' said John Shanley, a senior vice president at Security
Van Kaspar who once followed L.A. Gear.
</P>
<P>
   It was Robert Greenberg, Michael Greenberg's father, who founded
L.A. Gear and is widely blamed for its implosion. And while Michael
Greenberg founded Skechers _ as a distributor for Doc Martens
footwear _ and is its public face and spokesman, his father is the
company's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Greenberg sold everything from wigs to roller skates
before he stumbled on the idea that would make him famous: a
modestly priced hybrid of performance and fashion shoe that women
could wear while doing aerobics. L.A. Gear's revenues shot up from
$70.6 million in 1987 to $900 million in 1990, making it the third
largest in the country, after Nike and Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   But in a path that is almost unheard of for companies that flirt
with the billion-dollar mark, L.A. Gear fell apart almost as
quickly as it had grown. The stock, which hit a high of $50.125 in
1990, had tumbled to $11 by 1992. The company eventually filed for
protection under Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say L.A. Gear expanded too quickly. While the company
had been successful with stylish aerobic shoes, by 1991 it was
offering customers 500 different styles of shoes and apparel. The
expansion was poorly timed, occurring as the strongest growth in
the shoe industry was in men's athletic shoes _ a market that L.A.
Gear, perceived as a women's and children's shoemaker, never could
capture. The result was a retailer's nightmare: crate-loads of
inventory in the still-weak economy of the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Legal problems also plagued the operation. L.A. Gear signed a
marketing deal with Michael Jackson in 1989 in an attempt to win
over men; when that strategy failed, the company entered a lengthy
breach-of-contract suit and counter suit tussle with Jackson. Both
Nike and Reebok also fought legal battles with L.A. Gear, claiming
that the company had illegally used their patented technology. All
the suits were eventually settled.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Greenberg and five other executives were the subject of
five shareholder securities fraud suits filed in 1990 and 1991. The
class action suits contended that members of the L.A. Gear
management team had issued public documents containing ``materially
false and misleading statements'' about the company that led to
L.A. Gear's stock becoming ``artificially inflated,'' according to
the settlement papers. The defendants eventually settled for a
total of $29.8 million without admitting or denying guilt.
</P>
<P>
   After losses began to mount and the company's credit line was
cut, Robert Greenberg was forced to sell a 30 percent minority
stake worth $100 million of preferred stock to Trefoil Capital
Investors, an investment fund founded by Roy Disney, nephew of the
late Walt Disney, and cede much of his control of the company. The
Trefoil team eventually ousted him in January 1992 and dismissed
Michael Greenberg, then an L.A. Gear national sales manager, soon
after.
</P>
<P>
   Trefoil bailed out in late 1997, after failing to turn the
company around. Under PCH Investments, which currently controls the
company, L.A. Gear entered and emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in 1998 a much more modest operation.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Greenberg insists that his family was unfairly
disparaged over L.A. Gear's tumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get that company to $900 million by accident,'' he
said. If given the chance, he added, his family could have saved
the company.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the inevitable comparisons with L.A. Gear,
Skechers officials say their company is closely monitoring its
growth, will license rather than make apparel and is just as
popular with men as with women.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Greenberg founded Skechers _ street slang meaning
frenetic teen-agers _ in 1992, just months after leaving L.A. Gear.
He convinced his father and David Weinberg, a former L.A. Gear
executive whom he describes as a ``member of the family,'' to join
his company in October 1993. Three of his brothers are currently
vice presidents at Skechers; a fourth manages the Skechers Sport
brand of sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sales grew steadily, as the Greenbergs capitalized
on the shoe industry contacts they made in their years at L.A. Gear
to make sure that Skechers displays were given prime retail space.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, were wary. When Skechers went public in June
1999, the company had reduced its offering price and the number of
shares it offered. Even so, the stock lost value in its first day
of trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a company prices at $11 and then opens trading at $10.50,
that's generally kind of a sign of weakness,'' said Omar Sacirbey,
a senior editor at The IPO Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Robert Greenberg declined to comment for this article. But Lloyd
Grief, a close acquaintance of the family and president of Grief &AMP;
Co. of Los Angeles, the investment bank that took L.A. Gear public
in 1986, said, ``I think he was stunned with his stock's original
reception.''
</P>
<P>
   Investor fears seemed justified when, just as its predecessor
had, Skechers ran into both inventory and legal troubles. Soon
after the initial offering, the company reported losses for the
third quarter of 1999, the period that is generally the strongest
in the shoe industry because of back-to-school sales. The company
had too many shoes in the retail channel and floundered when its
platform sneakers fell out of style, problems eerily similar to
those that had plagued L.A. Gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have that kind of situation, especially when it comes
so soon after doing a public offering, institutions are very
wary,'' said Harry Katica, vice president for research at
Prudential Securities, one of Skechers' underwriters.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in December, a group of shareholders sued, contending that
the company had misled investors by not disclosing in its initial
filing that it was having legal problems with R. Griggs Group.
Griggs, the maker of Doc Martens shoes, sued its former business
partner five days after the offering, saying that Skechers had
pirated its designs for men's boots. Skechers stock, which had been
heading steadily downward, fell to its all-time low of $3.25 in
January, after the company announced that two more shareholder
suits had been filed. A total of five suits have now been filed;
the consolidated lawsuit is pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawsuit is completely frivolous,'' Michael Greenberg said
in a prepared statement. ``Skechers vehemently denies violating any
of the security laws and believes all disclosures were made on a
timely basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Greenbergs' luck may be beginning to change. In March,
the company settled with Griggs and announced that 1999 net sales
rose almost 14 percent from 1998, to $424.6 million, despite the
unusually poor third quarter. The following month, the shares
finally regained their initial public offering price. Then, in May,
Skechers announced a blow-out first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   All this good news has led many analysts to believe that
Skechers may indeed be able to step out from behind the L.A. Gear
shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Skechers, with its 900 different styles, is doing a good job
executing its strategy of being ``everyone and everything'' in
footwear, said David Turner, an analyst at Ferris, Baker Watts.
</P>
<P>
   The company's newest styles, like its Energy brand gym shoes,
have reignited interest among teen-agers. They have gone from being
on the ``uncool'' list last fall to the ``cool list'' this summer,
said Kevin Ume, president of element Holdings Inc., a marketing
firm that specializes in research on the buying habits of
teen-agers. During the back-to-school sales season, Skechers will
even be displayed at the high visibility area in Lady Foot Lockers
where the mall meets the store, a coveted spot usually reserved for
Nike.
</P>
<P>
   And right behind the teens are the investors, who seem willing
to forget the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skechers has not been on our coverage list but in the last
couple months it's just popped up,'' said Allison Boswell,
president of Allison Boswell Consulting, a group that surveys shoe
buyers. ``They were considered one of the top three fashion trend
setting brands. They were also named as a brand that would be
expected to have very high back-to-school increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Greenberg notes with a broad smile that the company's
stock is well above its initial price: shares closed Monday at
$16.375, a record high.
</P>
<P>
   Such successes are seen as vindication by the Greenbergs, who
are dreaming big again. ``I think Wall Street understands one
thing, and that's show me the numbers and deliver,'' Michael
Greenberg said. ``I think they're getting on board.''

GORE ATTACKS BUSH'S RECORD IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. - Vice President Al Gore has been crisscrossing
the country in recent weeks, hailing the Clinton-Gore
administration's handling of the blossoming economy, and promising
to continue to bring ``progress and prosperity'' to the nation if
he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as a new national poll suggested the presidential race
may be tightening, Gore ratcheted up that rhetoric and went on the
attack. He accused the Texas governor of doing harm to his own
state's economy, by allowing its surplus to shrink significantly
over the last year. Bush, he said, could not be trusted with the
economic future of the entire nation.
</P>
<P>
   Using charts to illustrate his arguments, Gore said the Texas
surplus had shrunk from $6.4 billion to about $350 million over the
last year, and blamed a tax cut Bush signed into law for the drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of all this is to show you that the same thing
he's done to the surplus in Texas would be done, and more, to the
surplus we have in our nation,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett said the Texas surplus, which he put
at $1.1 billion, was ``more than enough to address the state's
needs.'' He, in turn, said the Vice President was ill-equipped to
steward the economy for the next four years since he, unlike Bush,
``had never developed or signed a budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas will have to dip into its $1.1. billion surplus this year
to the tune of about $600 million, Gore aides said, to make up for
shortfalls in Medicaid funding and to pay the cost of housing more
prisoners than expected. Without the tax cut Bush signed into law,
Gore said, the state's surplus would still have been healthy enough
to cater to those needs, and to help improve the state's lagging
record on children's welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett countered that the Clinton-Gore administration had also
dipped into its surplus, and that Gore had ``a credibiilty deficit,
for attacking us for something his own administration does.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane scoffed at that argument. The
difference between Bush's economy and the administration's economy
was obvious, he said: nationally, the surplus had only increased in
recent years, whereas Bush was presiding over a decline.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has previously said Bush was less qualified to be
president because the Texas governor was constitutionally weak, was
asked how he can, at the same time, hold Bush responsible for the
declining surplus in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bush, while short on constitutional authority, has had
the power and platform set priorities for his state, and that
instead of making children's health care and poverty high
priorities, ``his priority was a special interest tax break.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Bush told a television interviewer that if the race
for president came down to his record as Governor, he would win a
``landslide'' victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for a response to that, Gore replied, ``The people in the
other 49 states vote in this election.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget fracas provided a stark contrast to Gore's other goal
Monday: rallying his troops. In visits to a group of Democratic
National Committee State directors, and to his young campaign staff
in their new headquarters, Gore sought to inspire his supporters to
fight for a cause which he described as bigger than all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would ``win this battle,'' even as aides pointed to
internal campaign polls that suggested a tightening race.
Meanwhile, a new CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll showed the two virtually
tied among likely voters, 48 percent for Bush and 46 percent for
Gore, largely based on the Democrat's gains among women and
independents. Bush had led in the same poll in late June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand very well how hard the challenge is, and how hard
the work is,'' Gore told the DNC State Directors. ``I just wanted
to say that this is really all about - it's not about me, and it's
not about you...it's about the people of this country.''

ADVERTISING: IT WILL BE HARD TO ESCAPE FROM ABC'S FALL LINEUP
CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ ABC will begin a promotion campaign for its
fall lineup that seems intent on all but stalking viewers, forcing
them to be aware of ABC shows in almost every waking moment of
their lives _ when they withdraw cash from an ATM machine, shop in
the supermarket or use the urinal at the local bar and grill.
</P>
<P>
   And if the network does not find you in those places, it may
leave a message about its new comedy, ``Madigan Men,'' starring
Gabriel Byrne, waiting on your telephone answering machine when you
get home.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, part of the Walt Disney Co., is the network that has
promoted itself for several years with ads described by Madison
Avenue as ``the yellow campaign,'' after the predominant color of
the TV and print pitches. For the 2000-2001 season, ABC is changing
its theme from ``America's broadcasting company,'' used during the
1999-2000 season, to ``ABC . . . definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the ``yellow'' ads, which sought to create an
identity for the entire network as well as encourage viewership of
specific shows, were derided, but they have eventually gained
widespread recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Among the elements of the new campaign are a tie-in with KFC
restaurants, where yellow ABC promotions will be wrapped around 7
million buckets of fried chicken; floor ads in supermarkets with
yellow ABC squares on the linoleum promoting shows; and yellow
placards on ATM machines with Regis Philbin of ``Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire'' using lines like, ``It's a shame you can't withdraw
more.''
</P>
<P>
   But surely the parts of the campaign, created in-house, that
will draw most attention are the decision to call viewers at home
in the 10 biggest cities, leaving messages to watch the ABC Friday
night lineup of comedies, and the plan to display pictures of Norm
MacDonald of the comedy ``Norm'' behind urinals in New York and Los
Angeles, with catchy copy phrases like ``Another fine use of the
color yellow.'' Meanwhile, a motion-activated device will crank up
his voice uttering invitations to watch his series between comments
appropriate to the locations like, ``Hey, watch your shoes!''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Cohen, the executive vice president of marketing and
advertising for ABC, said the network believed the yellow campaign
had made ABC ``the most recognized brand in television.'' The new
campaign is designed to reinforce the playful image of ABC's
promotions, he added, as well as what he called ``our uniqueness.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ABC has placed ads on tops of taxi cabs and in the
sand on beaches as well as in unexpected places like candy bowls at
restaurants, bus benches and pizza boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The urinals ads are the work of the Los Angeles based company
Zoom Media, which has been posting ads and promotions in bathrooms
for 10 years. Zoom sells ads in about 15 cities in the United
States and Canada, with signs in stalls in women's bathrooms and
behind urinals in men's rooms. (ABC is sticking to men's rooms, at
least for the moment.) The ads are mainly aimed at young adults
ages 18 to 35, and thus are concentrated in places like bars,
nightclubs and health clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ABC plans on running the urinal ads only in New York and Los
Angeles, Cohen said, starting about four weeks before the new
episodes of ``Norm'' appear, which is now expected to be in
October.
</P>
<P>
   As for the plan to call viewers at home to push ``Madigan Men,''
Cohen said that ABC would use a form of technology that only
activates when it reaches an answering machine. Thus if someone
actually picks up the phone, the lines will go dead _ just the way
your average movie stalker might do.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that does not qualify as overt harassment, Cohen and
his partner, Michael Benson, the senior vice president of
advertising and promotion, defended the plan by saying that they
would be, in Cohen's words, ``sensitive to consumers' comments, if
we get that kind of feedback.'' He specified he meant feedback in
the form of calls and e-mails from viewers, not comments from
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see it as harassment,'' Cohen said, adding that it
was merely another step in the aggressive ``brand campaign that got
us noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson said of the overall campaign, ``We like to find unique
ways to talk to people.''

LAST STROGANOFF RETAINS VITAL ASSET: FORCE OF CHARACTER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By WAYNE LEE GAY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Baroness Helene de Ludinghausen sits on a
bench in the Kimbell Art Museum, surrounded by millions of dollars
worth of paintings, sculpture and decorative items that belonged to
her ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few feet of her are late medieval icons, pre-Columbian
and antique Chinese artifacts, and priceless paintings by
Botticelli, Poussin, Watteau and Van Dyck. There is also a lavishly
decorated, 11-foot-long, fine-print contract from 1692, in which
Czar Peter the Great grants immense privileges, as well as a
tax-free status, to one of his favorite subjects, de Ludinghausen's
great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, Grigory
Stroganoff.
</P>
<P>
   Baroness de Ludinghausen, 58, is the ``last of the
Stroganoffs,'' the scion of the Russian aristocratic family that,
for 500 years _ from the late Middle Ages until the Russian
Revolution in 1917 _ controlled a significant percentage of
Russia's land and answered only to the czar. A cross section of the
family's monumental artistic investments _ second only to the
collection of the imperial family _ is on display through Oct. 1 at
the Kimbell Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Although her ancestors lost claim to the land and art when they
fled Russia during the revolution, de Ludinghausen displays the
personality that kept her family on good terms with the rulers of
Russia through five centuries.
</P>
<P>
   She is a working woman who doesn't live a life of privilege. De
Ludinghausen studied hard while growing up in Europe and the
Americas, and works at one of the most prestigious commercial
establishments in the world, the fashion house of Yves Saint
Laurent in Paris. Instead of aristocratic aloofness, she radiates
warmth and the conviviality of a natural-born politician or
salesman.
</P>
<P>
   From her ancestors, she says, ``I think I got a great love and
respect of everything beautiful. And I have a sense of fairness
toward people. I don't like people to be treated badly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stroganoffs first surface in history as a merchant family in
the early 15th century, and they earned the Renaissance era's
equivalent of megabucks when they discovered and mined salt in
northern Russia _ much like the Texans who made fortunes in
petroleum early in this century.
</P>
<P>
   The first Russian conquests in Siberia were financed and
directed by members of the Stroganoff family, who hired the
infamous Cossack outlaw Yermak to lead an army of mercenaries into
the frontier region. The gratitude of Czar Ivan the Terrible, who
granted monumental privileges in gratitude for their help, taught
the Stroganoffs a lesson they never forgot; they maintained firm,
friendly relations with the imperial family through the centuries,
always ready to help out with their now immense private wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew how to change, how to diversify,'' de Ludinghausen
says. By the end of the 16th century, the family employed around
6,000 workers in agriculture, mining and fur-trading, and owned 8.5
million acres in Siberia. The Stroganoff school of icon painting,
the last great flowering of medieval-style religious art, emerged
under their patronage, reflecting the wealth and the religious
devotion of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the Russian aristocracy, the Stroganoffs became
westernized during the 18th century. They learned to speak French
and built a palace in St. Petersburg, where a French chef invented
the mixture of sauce and meat immortalized in recipe books,
restaurants and grocery-store frozen food sections as ``beef
Stroganoff.''
</P>
<P>
   A Russian vernacular proverb says, ``Richer than the Stroganoffs
you'll never be.'' The immensely wealthy family collected, with
genetic good taste, a remarkable collection of international art.
</P>
<P>
   And, although thoroughly entrenched in the ruling class, members
of the Stroganoff family constantly advocated reform of the sort
which, if their advice had been followed, might have averted the
Bolshevik Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   De Ludinghausen's grandfather died before the revolution; her
mother, Xenia Ludinghausen-Wolff, escaped from Russia in 1919 on a
ship provided by the queen of Italy, sailing through the Black Sea
with her siblings, members of the imperial family, and her mother,
Princess Sonia Vasilichikovich.
</P>
<P>
   There were no Swiss bank accounts for the Stroganoffs; they left
their property and their fabulous collections in Russia. A few
members of the aristocracy managed to transfer their wealth, or had
extensive holdings in the west, but the heirs of the Stroganoffs
had to work for a living.
</P>
<P>
   And they were not the villains that postrevolutionary propaganda
depicts, according to Stephen R. de Angelis, an American cultural
historian currently living in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a jaundiced view that we have of a corrupt, profligate
society,'' he says. ``You wouldn't have any of the greatness of
Russia without these people. Look in the St. Petersburg phone
directory of 1908. It's full of listings for charitable
organizations, for the homeless, for hospitals, for homes for unwed
mothers, all of which were supported by the Romanoffs and the
aristocracy.''
</P>
<P>
   De Ludinghausen's father, Baron Andre Ludinghausen-Wolff, was an
aristocrat whose family had moved to Russia in the late Renaissance
_ hence the Franco-German surname. De Ludinghausen herself was born
in Paris in 1942, during the Nazi occupation, but spent most of her
childhood in Brazil, where her father worked for an American
corporation. She finished her high school education at the Kent
Denver School, a private girls' school in Denver, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard that American high school would be easy,'' she
says. ``But it was the hardest school I ever went to. All the girls
in my class were motivated. They had a tremendous sense of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   After completing her college education in Switzerland, she went
to work for an antiques dealer in Paris _ where, one day, renowned
fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent overheard her speaking in her
husky voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me, ``Is this your voice or do you have a cold?' ''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Saint Laurent apparently liked the voice, and the person behind
it, for he hired her shortly thereafter as an international
representative for his ready-to-wear line. Two years later, when
she was just 28, he made her director of the haute couture salon in
Paris, where she replaced a woman 40 years older. Because of her
youth, she had to work hard to gain the confidence of the
clientele.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be scary for a woman to come up those stairs to the
salon,'' she says. ``I make her feel comfortable. I tell her that
our clothes are so beautifully made that they will make her look
the best she can look.''
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Deroche, public relations director for the salon,
extols the baroness' style. ``She's a strong professional,''
Deroche says. ``Cheerful and dynamic. And she has extremely good
taste.''
</P>
<P>
   And a sense of humor too. When asked how she felt the first time
she walked past a frozen food case and saw the packaged beef
Stroganoff, she says, laughing, ``I've had beef Stroganoff that I
didn't like. But I wish that I could earn royalties on the name.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, she met her future husband, Robin Smyth-Ryland, an
English gentleman farmer and fox-hunting enthusiast from
Warwickshire, at a cocktail party in Manhattan. Fluent in French,
Russian, English and Portuguese, and at home in England, France,
the United States or Brazil, de Ludinghausen always considered
herself Russian, though she never visited Russia until after the
fall of communism in 1991. Then, steeped in the history of her
family, she made her first visit to Russia and vowed to preserve
her family's artistic heritage.
</P>
<P>
   She established the Ludinghausen Foundation, based in New York,
because many of its supporters are American, and Americans, she
says, are better at setting up foundations than the French. She
began leading tours to St. Petersburg, Russia, soliciting
contributions and turning over any profits from the tours to the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 300 people have visited St. Petersburg under her
guidance. On one very moving occasion, she returned to the city of
the Stroganoff salt mines, Solvychegodsk, where, as the first
representative of her family to visit the city in over 200 years,
she was greeted by an official contingent, schoolchildren in folk
costumes and traditional gifts of bread and salt.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she has formed strong opinions about what should
happen in modern Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a monarchist,'' she says, meaning that she
would favor eventual restoration of a crowned head of state in
Russia. And she wants a return to centralized, authoritative rule
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like order and discipline,'' she says. ``There's not much of
that there, now. Russia needs to clean up, in every sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to start helping people. I tell them that they are
the new aristocracy, but they are acting like thieves. Freedom
doesn't mean just doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   De Ludinghausen's sense of organization _ and her extroverted
personality _ paid off with the organization of the Kimbell
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Penelope Hunter-Stiebel, the New York-based curator who
organized the exhibition for the Portland Art Museum in Oregon and
the Kimbell, was at first reluctant to take on an additional
project.
</P>
<P>
   But a meeting with de Ludinghausen in St. Petersburg persuaded
her to become involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a modern, working woman who has not lost one iota of
the Stroganoff heritage,'' Hunter-Stiebel says. ``Her vision is
clear. She is direct and forceful. To the core of her being, she is
Russian.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was de Ludinghausen's attitude about what the exhibition
should be that finally swayed Hunter-Stiebel.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said that this is not about how rich her family was,''
Hunter-Stiebel says. ``She said that she wanted the exhibition to
be a window on Russian culture, so that Americans can understand
Russia.''

THE TRANSFORMATION OF MISS RIO GRANDE VALLEY

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I drive past the pale taupe house in Haltom City, Texas, which
abuts Fort Worth on its northeast side. Surely this unassuming,
low-slung residence can't be a renowned training center for a
legion of Miss Texas contestants. But once out of the car, I hear
confirmation. The house is leaking the unmistakable sound of a ``My
Fair Lady'' metamorphosis in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a minute, Jennifer. Stop there. Now, you know there is an
`r' in `your,' '' exhorts Mary McMullin, with a perfect blend of
cajoling and care. McMullin has been affiliated with the Miss Texas
pageant for 34 years, in a hyphenated position as executive
director-groomer-coach-trusted confidante to many very compliant
contestants. McMullin's refrigerator door acts as a casual trophy
case for her past successes, as evidenced by the picture of a
beaming Tatum Hubbard, 1998's Miss Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, Jennifer Sharlow,'' McMullin intones, a
no-nonsense interrogator. ``Your platform issue is alcohol
awareness. Please talk to us about that. And while you're at it,
what is the state flower?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bluebonnet, ma'am,'' Sharlow responds, unblinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state tree?'' McMullin probes.
</P>
<P>
   Pause. A furrow creeps across a young forehead rarely creased by
life's worries. Finally, a broad smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pecan,'' Sharlow announces confidently.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sharlow comes across the one word that needs more
pronunciation guidance than others. ``Now, Jennifer,'' McMullin
reminds her acolyte. ``Remember, there isn't an `i' in `Texas.'
It's TEX-as.''' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, ma'am, `Tex-as.' `Tejas.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's an endearing touch that Sharlow throws in the Spanish name
for her beloved home state. Such is Sharlow's adoration of all
things Lone Star, and the Miss Texas competition, that she will
work overtime to deliver the name of the state with chest-thumping
pride and proper-vowel diction. ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one-year-old Jennifer Sharlow, the proud Miss Rio Grande
Valley (one of numerous regional pageants open to any state
resident), knows going in that the odds are stacked against her
even making the top 10. She's a first-year Miss Texas contestant
competing against 57 regional title holders, many of whom will
arrive with more experience and financial backing.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that matters for such a greenhorn as Sharlow. Just
stepping on the klieg-flooded stage at Will Rogers Memorial Center
Auditorium in front of a live audience will be a pageant summit,
culminating years and years of preparation, personal
consciousness-raising, working out, and, of course, some hair
spray.
</P>
<P>
   If one accepts the cliche that a beauty pageant can represent an
Emerald City escape hatch from a small-town existence, well,
Jennifer Sharlow's hometown, in size anyway, certainly qualifies.
Brock, a hamlet half an hour west of Fort Worth with a population
of around 1,000, has no movie theater or McDonalds, and makes do
with one country store, more serious necessities being available at
the Parker County seat of Weatherford. And Sharlow, in her
unfettered warmth and fervent desire to ``do right by others'' is
the archetypal small-town loyalist. Such is Sharlow's homespun
geniality that she could seamlessly fit into Thornton Wilder's
``Our Town.'' She's the kind of woman who has already made plans to
give her future husband the silver cross ring she received on her
16th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Mary McMullin's Thursday-night training session, Sharlow
is a long way from Main Street, Brock. She is central-casting
ingenue, her chestnut hair falling gently about her white T-shirted
shoulders. Sharlow's first instinct is to smile, and hers is a
panorama of Chiclets teeth forming the essential facial gesture of
every Miss Texas contestant. As for Sharlow's laugh, it's an
abundant creation.
</P>
<P>
   It is T minus 11 days before Sharlow's nail-biting Miss Texas
personal interview, a grueling 12-minute session in which a
tribunal of seven judges will grill her on her chosen ``platform''
social issue of alcohol awareness. This subject hits a personal
chord for Sharlow. Her hands begin to wag and her cafe-con-leche
eyes brim with moistness as she wrestles with the sorrow over her
four friends killed by a drunken driver in a now infamous 1998
accident on the road to Brock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make eye contact with the judges when you talk about this,''
gently counsels coach McMullin. ``And just remember to be concise
and summarize.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes ma'am,'' Sharlow gulps. ``Of course, the accident affected
my life,'' Sharlow says in a voice heavy with emotion. Then, in a
more pageant-ready tone: ``And, of course, I completely support
Mothers Against Drunk Driving. The more you talk about this issue,
the easier it is to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   With the substance of Sharlow's platform behind her, it's time
for the style. The interview demands just the right business suit,
flattering with not the least whiff of frivolity. Her selection is
a double-breasted, cobalt-blue outfit, off-the-rack from Dillards.
Matching blue pumps lend Sharlow even more just-so integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we are not going for a sexy look here but just
something classic, perfect for church or a date,'' observes
McMullin sagely.
</P>
<P>
   Sharlow disappears behind a wall in Mary McMullin's pantry to
begin phase two of this late June evening's training session. She
soon emerges in a blinding magenta swimsuit that is cut as a hybrid
bikini-gym workout suit. As she circles around a sofa, Sharlow has
to balance on heels, suck in her stomach, avoid letting her
shoulders roll forward, and, as always, flash a smile so broad it
must make her cheekbones sore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, that's it, use those heels,'' exhorts McMullin.
``Jennifer is a natural walker. She was born pretty, tall and slim.
Jennifer, use that posture to show, what are they called, those
six-pack abs. You've earned it.'' Indeed, Sharlow has come by her
form thanks partially to 12 weeks of oatmeal for breakfast, roast
beef and spinach for lunch, and grilled chicken for dinner.
Naturally, her choice of salad dressings has been ``no fat.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes Sharlow all of five minutes to switch from her
iridescent swimsuit into an evening gown. Now she's ready for her
talent training, and her song needs work.
</P>
<P>
   Sharlow is a beloved regular at Weatherford's Shady Grove
Baptist Church, where her uncle is the minister. Her Miss Texas
talent is belting out the gospel-soaked ``Go Light Your World.''
The pageant stage will hardly be foreign to Sharlow, who is the
lead singer in ``The Sharlows,'' her family's gospel trio.
Sharlow's voice is a low and sultry contralto, communicating a
cleansing message with a premium on soul, not saccharine
preachiness.
</P>
<P>
   As Sharlow's voice fades out on her song, McMullin offers
several pointers. Sharlow needs a barrette to keep a pesky lock of
hair from tumbling into her eyes. Then, while singing, she must
gaze downward in order to catch the eye of every judge. But when
she mentions ``Jesus,'' Sharlow should look heavenward. Most
important, Sharlow should canvass the entire stage, as if she owns
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes, ma'am,'' Sharlow eagerly assures McMullin. ``I've been
practicing that.'' ___ &QC; 
(MORE).MDUL/ nn
</P>
<P>
   The level of hard-core training and commitment Sharlow has
invested in the pageant is emblematic of the seriousness of the
women who pursue the Miss Texas crown. Everyone associated with
``The 2000 Miss Texas Scholarship Pageant'' would emphasize with
black eyeliner that the contest is all about winning part of the
$2.5 million in available cash and matching scholarship monies,
plus other prizes.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the academic boost from the Miss Texas organization
does little to calm the pageant's hard-core detractors. There will
always be those who hold that beauty pageants are about as deep as
a varnished nail, full of homogenized visions of molded femininity
e-nun-ci-a-ting their consonants too crisply, reflexively switching
on 1,000-watt smiles.
</P>
<P>
   But these jabs at beauty pageants ignore the quiet revolution
for new respectability. The two most familiar measures of aesthetic
appeal, the ``physical fitness in swimsuit'' and ``evening wear''
segments, only count for 15 percent of the contestant's final score
each. Much more significant is the 30 percent weight for the
personal interview and the 40 percent assigned to ``talent.'' The
latter category now produces Broadway-caliber displays of singing
and tap, theater and dance, while the personal interview compels
the candidates to speak cogently on such hard social issues as AIDS
awareness, suicide prevention and high school violence.
</P>
<P>
   For Sharlow, the Miss Texas competition acted, at the very
least, as an informal finishing school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This pageant gave Jennifer enormous help just in presenting
herself, how to talk in front of people, to just learn what best
works for her,'' says Don Sharlow, her father. ``I mean she grew up
a lot just in the short time she was in the Miss Texas contest.''
___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Julia E. Sharlow, Jennifer's always-beaming mother, recalls when
her 9-year-old daughter began following the Miss Texas and Miss
America pageants.
At that tender age, Sharlow scrounged up some kind of
Glinda-the-Good-Witch gown, tamed her recalcitrant locks and
competed in the Miss Future Parker County title. Pretty soon,
Sharlow would snare all the local titles _ ``Miss Parker County
Peach Princess'' and ``Miss Parker County Peach Queen'' _ growing
quite accustomed to posing for a picture next to a basket of Parker
County's finest fruit crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never put Jennifer up to doing any of the pageants,''
recalls Julia Sharlow. ``And while she lost some of those early
ones, I'm so proud that she always congratulated everyone,
especially the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Freud would have spotted Sharlow as a budding pageant
participant just by looking at her collection of every conceivable
Barbie doll ever manufactured with a crown. As a teen-ager, Sharlow
was the very model of ``yes ma'am, no sir'' decorum. She was a
cheerleader. And, yes, she was homecoming queen and was voted
``most lovable, dependable and spirited'' by her Brock High School
class. Naturally, her favored drink is Diet Dr Pepper. This
all-American wholesomeness comes through everywhere, even in the
recipes for ``sunshine carrots'' and ``apple crisp'' that she
submitted for the Miss Texas cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   The product of a very close middle-class family (Sharlow's
father is the ombudsman for the Texas Workers Compensation
Commission, her mother is a painter and art teacher), Sharlow is
responsible for her college tuition, making the Miss Texas
scholarship prizes that much more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Sharlow watched every penny spent in her bid for the Miss Texas
title. ``Oh yes, I was up at 6 a.m. gluing more beads and feathers
onto this,'' she says, grimacing as she pulls out a somewhat
wilted, feather-bordered mask needed for the ``masked ball''
evening-wear portion of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Sharlow's costume formula is often do-it-yourself, occasionally
starting with something off-the-rack from Goodwill Industries,
before adding a row of $5 beads, and, presto, a formal outfit is
born. For $50 at Whatchamacallit, Sharlow unearthed a pageant-ready
pleated pants suit studded with white pearls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love getting a good deal. I can't live without the `75
percent off take an extra 20 percent off' sale at Foley's
Department Store,'' Sharlow wrote in the pageant's telephone
book-thick official directory of contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Paging through the same directory, Sharlow exclaims: ``Look, if
you win you get all-year dry cleaning and carwashes _ whoo, now
wouldn't that be great?'' ___ &QC;

COMMENTARY: REPORTS FROM AN ALTERNATE REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Arkansas that Bill and Hillary Clinton used to live in does
not seem to have been part of normal reality. It's more of a
parallel universe, like the one the wizards inhabit in Harry Potter
books, only uncharming.
</P>
<P>
   Revisit the Arkansas of the '70s and '80s, as we have been
forced to do on a regular basis for the last eight years, and it
appears that the entire state consisted of only about 100 extremely
talkative people, all of them either emotionally disturbed or
teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the planet has moved on since the days when Bill
Clinton was an Arkansas pol, but that little world stays in place,
chewing on bitter herbs and drinking from the Well of Recovered
Memories. This week it spit out another new recollection, via Jerry
Oppenheimer's ``State of a Union,'' a book about the Clintons'
marriage that reports that Hillary used an anti-Semitic epithet in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   This is a very big week for Clinton literature. Today marks the
unveiling of Joe Eszterhas' ``American Rhapsody,'' a book that
answers the oft-posed question ``What does the writer of the movie
`Basic Instinct' make of the Monica Lewinsky affair?'' Eszterhas
offers several new anecdotes about Sharon Stone, takes the reader
on a pretend-journey through the sexual reveries of important
Republicans, and claims that Steven Spielberg would have produced
his screenplay about a fictional president who practices bestiality
if only he had not been afraid of upsetting the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   But we digress. The anti-Semitism charge comes from Paul and
Mary Lee Fray, two of the chattiest charter citizens in the
Razorback version of ``The Land That Time Forgot.'' The Frays
figure prominently in just about every Clinton tome ever written
except ``It Takes a Village.''
</P>
<P>
   Fray ran Bill Clinton's unsuccessful congressional campaign in
1974 while his wife was delegated to give Hillary hints about nail
polish and accessorizing. On the night that the campaign ended in
defeat, the two couples had a knock-down-drag-out fight that has
become one of the great set pieces of Clinton legend. It ended
spectacularly when the enraged Mary Lee decided to enlighten
Hillary about Bill's other girlfriends, past and present.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Fray has helped inquiring reporters with stories
about Bill Clinton's womanizing, drug use among campaign workers
and rumors in Arkansas that Hillary was a lesbian. The anti-Semitic
angle never came up. But in the universe where the Frays dwell, the
past is process, and their latest recounting of the great fight
begins with Hillary storming into the campaign headquarters and
denouncing the stunned Fray as a ``(expletive deleted) Jew
bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   That would have been a terrible, ugly moment if Fray was
actually a Baptist with a Jewish father, as he told Oppenheimer. It
would be very bad even if Fray's Jewish lineage was confined to one
great-grandmother, as he told The Times this week. But you would
have to presume that Hillary, a self-absorbed 26-year-old, was
devoting an enormous amount of attention to the details of her
boyfriend's campaign manager's family tree.
</P>
<P>
   At an emotional press conference over the weekend, Mrs. Clinton
denied the Frays' charges, and her outrage seemed genuine, just as
it did earlier this year when Rudy Giuliani accused her of being an
enemy of religion. After years of dodging allegations about White
House cover-ups and health care screw-ups and questionable profits
on cattle futures, Hillary Clinton has enjoyed several
opportunities during her New York Senate campaign to deny
responsibility for things she actually did not do.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else has come forward with another example of Mrs.
Clinton ever having made an anti-Semitic statement, and friends of
the first lady went out of their way to recount instances in which
she'd angrily used salty language in a slur-free context. (``I
remember streams of obscenities!'' one overenthused.) A former
Arkansas campaign aide, meanwhile, jumped in on the side of the
Frays. In the end, the public will have to decide for itself
whether Hillary Clinton, one of the most politically correct people
on the planet, chose to express her anger 25 years ago by homing in
on the ethnicity of a guy's great-grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way to prove a negative. But if you buy this one,
I've got some information on the murder of Vince Foster by the
Israeli Secret Service that you'll really enjoy. (BOX)

   Sunday, July 2, and T minus six days till the crowning of the
new Miss Texas. Move-in day for all the pageant contestants to Miss
Texas-central at Fort Worth's Holiday Inn South. Some of the
pageant's competitors pull up in Corvette convertibles, their
trunks bursting with an Imelda Marcos quantity of trunks, garment
bags and little Victoria Secret's satchels.
</P>
<P>
   No such grand entrance for Jennifer Sharlow, who ambles up the
walkway in a beaded pewter-toned dress, her faux leopard-print bag
dangling by her side. Though it is 10 a.m., Sharlow has her
foundation, blush and mascara all photo-op ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this really is the big time,'' says Sharlow. ``Last
night, I didn't sleep much, just tossed and turned.'' Then, Sharlow
takes a quick survey of her surroundings, and the scope of the
competition begins to sink in. ``There sure are lots of pretty
women here,'' Sharlow says.
</P>
<P>
   The Holiday Inn's atrium greets Sharlow with a jungle of fellow
contestants in plum and fuchsia, turquoise and lime-green dresses.
Gratefully, Sharlow spots a familiar face, that of Julie Morphis,
Miss South Plains. They hug.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the pageant-contestant hug; there's method to this gesture.
Sharlow gently crosses her arms over the width of her compatriot's
shoulders. She never clutches at the hug's recipient, for fear of
crimping her outfit, nor does she allow her face to brush up
against the corresponding cheek lest an unwanted trace of lipstick
mar a pristine layer of makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love your style,'' says a fellow contestant to Sharlow.
``No, YOU look really pretty,'' Sharlow automatically responds.
Sharlow's ``thank you's'' are doled out as fast as she receives the
compliments.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy of move-in day doesn't seem to faze Sharlow, not even
the prospect of having to share a queen-sized bed with a fellow
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, I hope you don't accidentally kick each other overnight,
giving each other bruises,'' Sharlow's mother suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Sharlow dismisses that possibility with a laugh, then whips out
a can of hair spray, expertly forming a halo of maxi-hold around
her feathery new 'do. Now she is primed to meet the still-reigning
Miss Texas, Yanci Yarbrough. Yarbrough, the pride of Childress,
intercepts Sharlow, along with all the other contestants, after
they've signed their names (often dotting their ``i's'' with hearts
or flowers) to the official Miss Texas sign-in board.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Sharlow is locked in the empathetic force field of
1999's Miss Texas. ``Are you excited?'' asks Yarbrough, casting a
beatific look on Sharlow. ``It will be awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharlow's encounter with the reigning Miss Texas has fortified
her appetite. But with only 72 hours left before the swimsuit
competition, ordering lunch is a scene from the film ``Five Easy
Pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Could I please have the smoked chicken salad?'' Sharlow
requests sweetly. ``But could you hold the olives, the cheese, the
croutons and put the honey mustard dressing on the side?''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that the contestants' anxiety level about last-minute
weight gain will prevent them from eating properly (one
contestant's lunch: a banana and mineral water), the Miss Texas
organizers have stocked one of the Holiday Inn's rooms with food
stations supplied by Mrs Baird's Bakery, Oak Farms Dairy, Dr Pepper
and Albertson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chips and hot sauce, chips and hot sauce _ and a big ole'
piece of cheese cake,'' says Sharlow, predicting the food she will
gorge on once the competition is finally over. ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``And the winner is ... Miss Rio Grande Valley, Jennifer
Sharlow.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing her name called out, Sharlow's face melts into that
now familiar pageant contortion of incalculable joy and shock. At
first Sharlow can barely move. Then a visible ``Oh my gosh'' forms
across her trembling mouth. She is slowly absorbing that ineffable
moment of winning.
</P>
<P>
   First-time, long-shot Jennifer Sharlow has taken the ``Alpha
preliminary talent'' prize, beating out 37 other first-year Miss
Texas contestants. Sharlow clutches her blue-and-gold plaque that
marks her achievement and is soon swallowed by a swarm of sequined
and spangled fellow contestants basking in her reflected glory.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, surrounded by a parapet of arms, her face seems
to click into nostalgic playback mode. During the delivery of her
prize-winning song, she had subtly converted the entire audience
into her personal congregation. At one point, she had whispered
words of sermonlike wisdom before leading to a crescendo of
passion. She glided from side to side, imploring Jesus to ``light
your world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I said a little prayer because I was nervous, but I
just sang from my soul and did the best I could,'' says Sharlow.
</P>
<P>
   Sharlow's ``Alpha'' first-year award was only the beginning of
several minitriumphs in her Cinderella story. As the clock struck
midnight at the Miss Texas gala dinner, Sharlow was rewarded for
coming in 21st out of the 57 contestants. (The Miss Texas title was
awarded to Tara Watson, Miss Hurst-Euless-Bedford, in her fourth
stab at the crown.) In the end, Sharlow will take home an estimated
$1,450 in scholarship monies.
</P>
<P>
   All but bounding back to her parents, laden with Miss Texas
plaques, Sharlow is giddy: ``With these,'' Sharlow says, ``I just
paid for one semester of college'' at the University of Texas at
Arlington. ``You know, this week has not only given me some friends
for life, in addition to so much confidence, but, best of all, it
will be one of many things I will tell my kids and grandchildren
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharlow should also regale her future kin about the wonderful
quirk of Miss Texas pageant choreography that had her, in a blue
gown glittering like a constellation, in the front row as the
rumba-beat pageant finale concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The little girl from Brock, for whom just walking up to that
microphone and announcing ``My name is Jennifer Sharlow'' was a
thrill, stood holding up her arms in a victorious pose. In Jennifer
Sharlow's young Miss Texas history, this was the crowning moment.

SHEEP INFECTED WITH DISEASE, POSSIBLY SIMILAR TO MAD COW, TO BE
DESTROYED 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Federal agriculture officials plan to seize and
incinerate nearly 400 Vermont sheep in the coming days because four
of the group imported from Belgium have tested positive for a
disorder that may be similar to Europe's mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   Mad cow disease is not known to have ever passed from cattle to
sheep, except in the laboratory. But agricultural authorities
intent on sparing the United States the nightmare Europe has been
through said Monday they wanted to err far on the side of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is a really difficult situation for these
farmers,'' said Andrew Solomon, a spokesman for the federal
Department of Agriculture. ``But from our perspective, this issue
is about a lot more than three individual farmers. It's about
safeguarding American livestock and American agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done in this instance is to act with an abundance
of caution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But one owner, Linda Faillace, whose family tends a flock of
East Friesian sheep from Belgium and makes Three Shepherds cheese,
described the planned seizure as a turn toward ``Gestapo tactics''
based on questionable science. Her family and the other main owner,
Houghton Freeman, a philanthropist, are asking the government to
hold off on the seizures until further tests can determine whether
the sheep really had a dangerous transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy, or TSE, a family of diseases that turn the brain
spongy with holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we felt these animals had TSE, or if we felt there was the
science showing these animals have TSE, we would have handed them
over very quietly and been done with it long ago,'' Faillace said.
``We're trying to help American agriculture, not hurt it. But just
to have the sheep victimized by power groups and bureaucracy needs
to be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Amidon, the lawyer for Freeman, who owns about 230 sheep,
said he and his client were trying to figure out what their rights
were: ``We are looking into the teeth of the full force of the U.S.
government,'' Amidon said.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, an estimated 180,000 cows have been infected since
the 1980s with mad cow disease, apparently through feed that
included the rendered brains of animals that had the disease, and
more than 70 deaths have been attributed to a human version called
new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. At first seemingly confined
to England, mad cow disease has turned up in France, the
Netherlands and elsewhere, but never in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Faillace's husband, Larry, has a doctorate in animal
science and worked with an authority on mad cow disease at the
University of Nottingham in the early 1990s. They imported their
flock, which now numbers 120, from Belgium in 1996. The family has
abided by an Agriculture Department quarantine put on the sheep in
1998, selling sheep only to the federal government, which would
test, then incinerate them.
</P>
<P>
   But all the tests had been negative until now, agriculture
officials say. The tests turned up positive, they say, for some
abnormal prions, the infectious proteins believed to cause mad cow
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The quick testing run on the sheep cannot determine which exact
disease they had, however, and it could be that they suffered from
scrapie, a fatal disorder of the same family as mad cow disease
that has been appearing in sheep for centuries but not affecting
humans, said Linda Detwiler, senior staff veterinarian at the
Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said: ``We'd be concerned about scrapie as well,
because it could be an atypical strain or something we don't have
in this country. If it's an atypical scrapie, the results for us
would be the same'' _ death for the sheep.
</P>
<P>
   It will take two or three years to determine exactly which
disease the sheep had, she said, because generations of mice
infected with samples from the sheep must be bred to see how it
plays itself out.
</P>
<P>
   Detwiler noted that neither mad-cow disease nor scrapie have
been shown to cause infections through milk, so there would seem to
be little need to worry about the cheese products made from the
imported sheep's milk. And though a few of the progeny of the
imported sheep were sold for meat, all were believed to have been
very young, meaning they carried a smaller risk of infection,
agriculture officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture officials say the Belgian sheep could have caught
the disease by eating contaminated feed while they were still in
Belgium. But Faillace said she and her husband had checked the feed
records for the sheep carefully, and they were born after a ban had
taken effect on the suspect feed containing rendered animals. She
also questioned whether the federal tests were accurate, citing
some internal contradictions and saying new testing methodology had
been used.
</P>
<P>
   Detwiler said the sheep's owners would be compensated for their
loss, and would be paid as much as they would have gotten if they
had sold the sheep _ which produce 10 times more milk than their
American counterparts _ for breeding, rather than a slaughterhouse
price.
</P>
<P>
   But the owners appear unwilling to go along gently with the
plan, and Faillace, whose family has invested more than $2 million
in the operation and remains in debt, said they have been receiving
calls of support from dozens of allies.

1,500-METER CHAMP JENNINGS TAKES HIS FREE SPIRIT TO OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB PADECKY   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Usually, when an athlete wins and he wants
to thank someone, it's God, his parents or maybe a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon Gabe Jennings thanked the moon and the air.
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't guessed it, a hippie won the men's 1,500
meters Sunday at the U.S. Olympic trials and is going to the
Olympics. This is big news because even back in the '60s, when
everyone was thanking the moon and the air, hippies didn't make the
Olympic team. That's probably because all the exercise the hippies
ever got then was stepping in and out of the Volkswagen bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't claim to be a free spirit,'' said Jennings, a Stanford
sophomore, ``but you're welcome to.'' And then a few minutes later
he allowed that he was. That's Jennings, he refuses to be put into
any box, even when there is no box at all. Calling him a ``free
spirit'' may be limiting him in an odd way.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings sleeps on the roof of a student-run co-op house at
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   He walks around campus in a full-length orange-black-brown robe
native to Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   He was raised in a commune until he was 13.
</P>
<P>
   As Jennings ran his 1,500 Sunday a distinct drum beat was heard
throughout the race. His parents _ Jim, a philosophy and literature
teacher at Mendocino High School, and Suzanne, a children's fiction
writer currently at work on an anthology of women dealing with
pregnancy _ were beating the drums in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   And, Jennings was chanting to himself as he ran. Sometimes the
sounds are audible. Sunday he kept the chants _ rap he calls it _
to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes like this,'' Jennings said. He proceeded to produce a
beat that had no decipherable words but that had a basic and
charismatic pull to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling the cosmic energy flow through me,'' Jennings
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he admitted, some people will dismiss his views as weird or
totally contrary to the established ``norm'' of athletic society.
He is unperturbed. In his world, different is not wrong. Different
is just different. Different is allowing your mind to hitch a ride
to whatever curious thought comes your way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to release the cosmic energy,'' Jennings said. ``I do
that in a variety of ways. I run to the top of a mountain. I scream
at the top of my lungs. I go skinny-dipping. And sometimes what I
do doesn't have to be so dramatic. Take a deep breath. Look at the
reflection of light on leaves and trees.''
</P>
<P>
   All of that may sound like the musings of someone with an idle
and wandering focus. Ah, but that would be underestimating
Jennings. Idle has never been his mind _ he is at Stanford you
know. Idle also has never been his body.
</P>
<P>
   He ran a 4:02.81 mile as a high school senior. He is the
National Collegiate Athletic Association champion this year in both
the indoor and outdoor 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   And when Jennings took the lead in the 1,500 with 600 meters to
go Sunday, not surrendering it, finishing strong, looking like the
best of the best, he showed once again there was a heart of a lion
inside the philosopher king.
</P>
<P>
   So the evidence is there all right. Maybe being inside a mold is
not the best place to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``First thing I do when I wake up on race day,'' Jennings said,
``is to try to remember my dreams. When I go to sleep the night
before, I dream about the race. And when I wake up I dream about it
again. Today when I woke up I noticed my foot was tapping. That
doesn't happen very often. This was a good sign. I just knew this
was going to be a good day.'' As he relaxed in his Sacramento hotel
room, his dreams turned quiet.
</P>
<P>
   And then he started crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a happy cry,'' Jennings said. ``It warmed up my whole
body. It sent shivers down my spine. I let go of my ego. I felt
bigger than life. I felt reborn.'' And if you then expected
Jennings to say he levitated himself out of his hotel room and
floated over the Sacramento River while touching the hand of an
angel, you will have missed the point.
</P>
<P>
   This 21-year old man _ who has built a sweat lodge-tent on his
parents' Mendocino property, who believes in the spirit of man
above all else, who looks and acts like he was born 30 years too
late _ is going to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings has to be disciplined to do that. He has to be serious.
He is not a poof, a wild card, a verbal freak show, a mentalist who
can bend spoons.
</P>
<P>
   He is an Olympian. And his middle name is Harmony.

SLAIN WOMAN'S FAMILY SUES AAA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Melissa Gosule's car wouldn't start, her family
did what thousands of other stranded motorists have done: They
called the American Automobile Association, confident the nation's
best-known emergency roadside service would take care of things
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   They failed, her parents say.
</P>
<P>
   In a wrongful death lawsuit filed Monday against AAA, Gosule's
parents say their daughter was forced to turn to the stranger who
killed her after a tow truck driver dispatched by AAA left her in a
parking lot, promising to return four hours later.
</P>
<P>
   If AAA and tow truck driver John Cubellis ``had done their job,
this would never have happened,'' Gosule's mother, Sandra Glaser,
said Monday. ``Melissa would still be with us today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosule's parents filed the lawsuit against AAA and Cubellis,
alleging their inaction on the night of July 11, 1999 forced a
desperate Gosule to turn to Michael Gentile for help when she was
stranded near a Cape Cod traffic rotary.
</P>
<P>
   Gentile raped and stabbed Gosule, 27, and is serving a life
without parole sentence after his first-degree murder conviction in
May. Gosule's body was found in a shallow grave in Pembroke, eight
days after she disappeared from the Bourne parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, attorneys for AAA of Southern New
England insisted the company was not to blame for Gosule's death.
``AAA Southern New England thoroughly rejects any allegation that
it bears any legal responsibility for this tragic event and the
heinous conduct of the individual responsible for Ms. Gosule's
death.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gosules are also suing AAA under Massachusetts' consumer
protection law, alleging the not-for-profit corporation has engaged
in ``immoral, unethical and unscrupulous'' marketing tactics. Any
judgment would be tripled under the law.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit pointed to a letter AAA used recently in a direct
mail solicitation urging people to join. ``In today's world,
relying on strangers has become a scary (and sometimes dangerous)
thing to do,'' it read. ``Why depend on strangers when `family' is
there to help?''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Paris, the Boston attorney for Gosule's parents, said
that marketing campaign is exactly the kind of promise AAA failed
to keep when it came to Gosule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Gentile is behind bars, but he's not the only one who
should answer for Melissa's death,'' Paris said.
</P>
<P>
   Cubellis, who runs Cubellis Auto and Truck Repair in Buzzards
Bay, could not be reached for comment Monday. But last year, when
Gentile first faced charges, Cubellis told the Globe Gosule seemed
``fine and dandy'' when he saw her.
</P>
<P>
   Cubellis also said Gosule already had agreed to catch a ride to
Brockton with Gentile. ``She was in a public place, with public
telephones, and people passing by,'' Cubellis said then.
</P>
<P>
   On the day she disappeared, Gosule, a substitute teacher in
Boston public schools, returned to a parking lot at the Sagamore
Recreation Area after riding bike trails on Cape Cod, and found her
car wouldn't start.
</P>
<P>
   Gentile stopped shortly afterward and, according to the lawsuit,
Gosule used his cell phone to contact her mother and stepfather,
Peter Glaser, in Brockton around 6 p.m. Peter Glaser then called
AAA on its 24-hour emergency line.
</P>
<P>
   The agency called Cubellis at 6:20 p.m., but he did not arrive
until 7:45 p.m. at the Sagamore Recreation Area lot. Once there, he
allegedly told Gosule he was too busy to tow the car then, but
could come back around midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The parents allege Cubellis never tried to see if he could get
the car started, nor did he notify AAA he could do nothing for
Gosule for four hours. The AAA, in turn, the lawsuit claims, never
followed up with the Glasers to make sure the emergency help was
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Should they win damages, the family plans to donate some of it
to the Melissa Gosule Memorial Foundation to help combat domestic
violence and rape.

NEWT GINGRICH'S WIFE PLANS BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich, who was divorced in December from Newt
Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, has met with several New
York publishers to sell a proposed book about her life with him,
according to her agent, Edward Jay Acton.
</P>
<P>
   The book will describe Gingrich's role as a behind-the-scenes
partner in Newt Gingrich's rise and the intimate witness to his
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really wants to show how Washington has changed over the
last 20 years for women, especially because of the increased
attention from the media,'' Acton said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich married Newt Gingrich in 1981, when he was a young
Republican congressman. He had recently divorced his first wife,
Jackie, who had been his high school math teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Newt and Marianne Gingrich were separated in May 1999, after
Gingrich left office and it had been disclosed that he had been
having a love affair for the previous six years with an aide,
Callista Bisek. In August, Newt Gingrich, who is 56, plans to marry
Bisek, 33.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's proposed book will discuss her husband's affair, but
``this is not a get-Newt or a get-even book,'' Acton said.
Hopefully, Acton compared her book to ``What I Saw at the
Revolution,'' by Peggy Noonan, a speechwriter for President Ronald
Reagan. Gingrich has not yet sold the book, Acton said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, 48, will write the book in the first person with the
help of Katherine Johnson. Johnson has previously written
authorized biographies of the authors Anne Rice and Dean Koontz.
</P>
<P>
   Acton has represented primarily liberal authors, including James
Baldwin, Ralph Nader and Tip O'Neill, the former Democratic speaker
of the House. Gingrich, who remains a Republican, met her agent
through a friend, Susan O'Neill, Tip O'Neill's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was unavailable for comment. A spokesman for Newt
Gingrich's office said he declined to comment.

   MILTON, N.Y. _ Usually, when hail descends on the picturesque
apple orchards of the Hudson Valley, it strikes fitfully, creating
havoc on a farmer's field of Empires, say, but sparing his
McIntoshes. But this spring's hail was different.
</P>
<P>
   Two storms pelted newly formed apples with jagged balls of ice
on more than 7,000 acres, and as the apples have grown, the tiny
bruises have turned into ugly divots. Two thousand of those acres
were so badly hurt that farmers are abandoning them entirely this
season. In all, some 2.09 million bushels are expected to be lost
in what farmers say is the worst crop damage in memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was so strong that it drove the hail into the apples
like bullets,'' said Jeffrey D. Crist, a fourth-generation apple
grower who said he had no choice but to let the deformed apples in
his orchard here drop to the ground this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier times, apple farmers would curse Mother Nature and
hope for better luck next year. But a number of economic forces _
from depressed prices resulting from a worldwide glut of apples to
spotty insurance coverage to consumer demand for flawless fruit _
have pushed the Hudson Valley farmers to the brink. Many are
wondering aloud whether the 10-minute hail bursts in May and June
will be what finally breaks them _ and in the process altering an
austere landscape of gnarled trees and open sky forever.
</P>
<P>
   As the apple growers band together to ask the federal government
for direct cash assistance of $20 million to cover their losses,
they are talking as much about open space and suburban sprawl as
agriculture, speaking a language they know resonates with
politicians, tourists and the many owners of weekend houses here in
Ulster County, the second largest apple-producing county in a state
that produces more apples than any state other than Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen or so farmers met this month with Rep. Benjamin Gilman
in an orchard in Orange County south of Milton, a hamlet just west
of the Hudson about 70 miles north of Midtown Manhattan. The
growers evoked a potential consequence of their financial crisis in
apple-producing counties like Ulster, Orange, Columbia and
Dutchess, where a wave of new building has swept through in the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we just go home and call our Realtor or do we hang in
there?'' Roderick Dressel of Dressel Farms in New Paltz asked on a
crisp, breezy day that felt like fall. ``We're asking for a
one-time Band-Aid to keep our industry going, to preserve open
space and to prevent it from all going to traffic and septic
tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, 104 farms covered 11,629 acres in Ulster County. By
1996, the most recent year for which statistics are available, the
number of farms had fallen to 63 on 8,632 acres. The decisions now
being made by apple growers like Anthony Porpiglia could accelerate
the trend. Having lost 60 percent of his apple crop to the May 18
hailstorm in Ulster County, Porpiglia says he cannot borrow money,
even at the low interest rates available to farmers in a declared
disaster area. Instead, he is looking to one of his eight orchards
to make him whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our debt load is tremendous, and we don't want to get any
deeper,'' Porpiglia said. ``We have an orchard _ 35 acres in Ulster
Park in the middle of a development. We're thinking of selling it.
It's a valuable piece of land.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts in farming practices say that when more than a third of
the apples in an orchard are damaged, it does not pay to harvest
the remaining good ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really can't go through and pick only the good fruit,''
said Michael J. Fargione, an educator with Cornell Cooperative
Extension, a program of Cornell University that provides research
information and educational programs to farmers. ``The pickers are
paid based on volume and there's really no way to slow a picker
down so that he would turn over each piece of fruit and examine it.
Even a small ding is enough to have that fruit rejected by a
grocery chain.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture on
June 18 to declare large sections of the Hudson Valley a disaster
area, as well as some two dozen counties across the state where
heavy rains damaged a number of other crops. But the federal agency
has yet to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers say they would not be eligible for the low-interest
loans available through the disaster program anyway. Farmers must
first be turned down by their regular lenders to qualify for loans,
but banks are more than happy to lend to growers who have ample
collateral in the form of valuable land.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, farmers who carried hail insurance are having a
tough time collecting on their claims. The insurers argue that
hail-damaged fruit can still be used for the juice market. But the
juice market is so weak that the cost of harvesting the bruised
apples would exceed the price paid for the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cider market is $1.20 a bushel and it costs $4 a bushel to
pick it,'' said Russ Bartolotta Jr. of Klein's Kill Fruit Farms in
Germantown, N.Y., across the Hudson River in Columbia County, where
orchards were also devastated by hail. ``Economically, you're
committing suicide to go in there and try to salvage. You're going
to throw good money after bad.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Farmers say, too, that walking away from an apple orchard for a
season does not free them from maintaining it. ``You still have to
mow and trim the orchards and spray so certain insects and fungus
don't get in there,'' said Bartolotta, who estimates that 90
percent of the apple crop was ruined on his family's 320 acres of
orchards. ``There are things you have to keep doing so next year's
crop won't be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   A few factors have made apple farmers in New York State
particularly vulnerable to setbacks like hail damage. The apple
industry has suffered from depressed prices in recent years, the
result of a worldwide overproduction of apples and exports of cheap
apple-juice concentrate to the United States from China. In
addition, an important export market for the United States _
Southeast Asia _ wilted after the economic crisis there. And the
continuing consolidation among retailers has strengthened the hand
of stores in demanding lower prices from farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The apple farmers now find themselves in the role of activists,
organizing meetings, faxing fact sheets, collaring any politician
who will listen. When Gilman, a Republican, came for his tour here,
there was a table set up alongside the orchard with the evidence:
tree branches from other farms bearing pockmarked fruit. Crist
counts 150 of his 600 acres of apples a complete loss.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation is pending in Congress that would provide $115
million to apple farmers nationwide to compensate them for market
losses and crop damage from 1999. Last month, President Clinton
signed the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000, a $15 billion
relief package for producers of a variety of crops that will, among
other things, reduce the cost of crop insurance. But how much of
that money will eventually make its way to the Hudson Valley, where
Hurricane Floyd caused damage last fall, is uncertain. And none of
the money would offset the losses from this spring's hail.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Clarke, a 55-year-old apple grower whose family farm dates
to 1817, knows the global economics of apple production as well as
anyone, but he is now focused on his own finances. Still farming
alongside his 82-year-old father, Leonard Clarke, and bringing
along his 24-year-old son, Brad, Clarke has 60 acres of useless
apples outside his front door here _ half his apple crop.
</P>
<P>
   He says he will have to borrow $50,000 to $60,000 to maintain
his orchards, pay his bills and meet his payroll. ``We don't have
the reserve or cushion to say we're going to take it out of that,''
Clarke said. ``The business just hasn't been that good the last
four years. Ten minutes of hail is going to cost me about three
years of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other apple farmers in the Hudson Valley, Clarke is asking
for an emergency infusion of cash from the federal government,
assistance that Gilman said he would try to get. In asking for that
subsidy, Clarke is unabashedly tapping fears that open land north
of New York City is quickly disappearing to development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just at the very reaches of commuting from New York City
and as Orange County fills up and Dutchess fills up, there are
going to be more pressures on the land,'' he said. ``Are people
willing to pay to maintain open space? That's something that needs
to be debated.''

GEORGE P. BUSH STUMPS FOR HIS FAMOUS UNCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER WALSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ He is ranked No. 5 on People Magazine's Top 100
Eligible Bachelors list. He is part of a political dynasty: His
grandfather was president and his uncle is trying to be one. And
Monday, he was greeted by the media like a rock star.
</P>
<P>
   George Prescott Bush, the oldest son of Florida Governor Jeb
Bush and his Mexican wife, Columba, spoke to the Young Hispanic
Republican Association as part of his ``Countdown to Convention
Tour,'' where he campaigned on behalf of his uncle, Texas Governor
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While the young Bush's mission is to attract young voters and
Hispanics, he spent most of his time speaking to the more than 40
reporters and cameramen, who outnumbered the GOP attendees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he would come in and have lunch,'' said Noe Garcia
III, a board member of the association. ``There was so much media,
it was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a 24-year-old Rice University graduate, gave a two-minute
speech about his uncle's plans for tax cuts and health care reform.
He also said the Texas governor is trying to include minorities,
who traditionally vote for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republican Party is going to start representing
the emerging diversity of our country,'' he told the group. ``It's
impressive that the Republican Party is starting to make inroads in
this community, and it's up to us to continue this success.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, his uncle became the first Republican presidential
candidate to speak to the NAACP since his father had in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   George P. Bush, along with his sister and brother, was refered
to as one of ``the little brown ones'' when his grandfather
introduced him to then-President Reagan at the start of the
Republican national convention in 1988. Now he campaigns around the
country and stars in bilingual television commercials on behalf of
his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation definitely has a label of being apathetic, but
I think a lot of young people would disagree with that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign hopes the younger Bush will fire up young
voters to get to the polls, and his movie-star looks and suave
demeanor certainly help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good because it's a new audience that you get to,'' said
Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign. ``It's another
way to reach out to those who aren't typically involved in politics
and bring them in to the presidential election this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Oglinsky, a 23-year-old student at George Mason
University, said she was impressed with Bush and thought he was a
good representative of the campaign. But she added with a giggle,
``He's a definite hottie.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Viana, 20, from Florida International University, said
while he is attractive, his message is what will move the younger
generation to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a person like him to talk to young people like us to
let us know what's going on in the election process,'' said Viana,
who is a summer intern in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After his short speech, Bush shook a few hands before being
whisked away for interviews. He faced what one reporter described
as the ``rock-star media'' without a flinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``George P. Bush is very camera friendly and he is articulate
and intelligent and when people see him he can get his message
across,'' said the association's Garcia.

 &HT;    Charleston considering shutting down the bars earlier
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ After drunks from downtown Charleston bars
kept wandering into her backyard garden, Nina Liu installed locks
on her two gates.
</P>
<P>
   That problem ended. Now the 60-year-old art dealer is among
sleep-deprived downtown residents who are counting on city leaders
to clamp down on the racket and littering, the flower pot smashing
and other vandalism that they blame on the bar crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Charleston City Council is scheduled to consider final
approval tonight of an ordinance requiring the city's bars and
clubs to stop selling alcohol at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a rancorous debate here, similar to the Atlanta City
Council's deliberations on closing the city's bars and clubs two
hours earlier, at 2 a.m. instead of the current 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   A peek at Charleston illustrates how even this historic city,
known for its Southern hospitality and pleasant manners, isn't
above brawling over booze and its distasteful side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volume goes up when it gets to be 2 or 3 in the morning,''
said Bill Regan, the city attorney. ``They throw beer cans. They
yell. Quite frankly, they urinate.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, a spate of high-profile violence has spurred the
call for shortening bar hours. The momentum has been more gradual
in Charleston, where Mayor Joseph Riley last year threw his crucial
support behind curbing alcohol sales in bars after hearing
complaints from residents and business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, 57, Charleston's mayor for the past 25 years, describes
the early-morning noise and vandalism by people leaving bars as a
threat to residents' quality of life. He has the backing of
downtown hotels, restaurants and other businesses whose officials
have expressed dismay at the late-night rowdiness. Westin Francis
Marion hotel managing partner Steven Dopp called it ``a very
unpleasant, unsavory party scene that runs until 5 o'clock in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Charleston establishments can sell beer and wine all
night long. Complaints about the raucous behavior are coming from
areas such as upper King Street, the French Quarter and
Ansonborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the neighborhood have all tried sleeping in different
rooms of our houses, hoping it will be better,'' said Liu, a
resident of the French Quarter, an affluent section that
Charleston's police chief fears is growing as unruly as the
more-famous French Quarter in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason anybody has to go out and get drunk after 2
o'clock in the morning,'' Chief Reuben Greenberg said. ``The bar
owners are trying to New Orleans-ize Charleston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't anything like that,'' said Portside Cafe Uptown
owner Jeff Filosa, 40, helping mobilize bars and their patrons to
fight Charleston's ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council passed the ordinance last month on the first of
three readings, after the city suffered a courtroom setback in
March. A state circuit judge ruled a previous ordinance forcing
bars to close at 2 a.m. to be unfair because it applied only to a
one-block-wide area that included a cluster of establishments on
upper King Street.
</P>
<P>
   One of the establishments, the Trio Club, had sued to block the
ordinance, and the judge's ruling sent the City Council back to
deliberations. The new ordinance has reignited the debate in the
city's booming tourism area and has made elected leaders sensitive
to complaints about traffic, congestion and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened to Atlanta is happening to Charleston,''
said City Councilman Henry Fishburne Jr., whose downtown Charleston
district includes early-morning bars and people who are complaining
about them.
</P>
<P>
   Filosa, a former waiter and bartender, said turning off the taps
as early as 2 a.m. would hurt businesses such as his. He said it
also would unfairly crimp the night life of Charlestonians such as
college students and waiters and others who work late in the city's
burgeoning hospitality trade.
</P>
<P>
   If noise is bad now, the ordinance's opponents say it would be
worse if bars turned out customers at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is going to cause more of a problem rather than
spreading it out over the night,'' said Christina Couture, 30, a
Charleston restaurant manager who frequents A.C.'s Bar &AMP; Grill
after getting off work as late as 1:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Piccirillo, A.C.'s manager, said bar patrons are getting
unfairly blamed for early-morning problems. That's also the case
with College of Charleston students, said its president, Alex
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Though upper King Street is popular among College of Charleston
students, Sanders said they cause far less trouble than ``the
people I'd call freaks, people with purple hair, body piercing and
those 1,000-mile stares. We get credit for them being college
students.''
</P>
<P>
   King Street deli owner Howard Fine said he's not had any
early-morning trouble since last year's closing of Red Hot
Tomatoes. But he added, ``To me, 2 o'clock is plenty late.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some neighborhood bars that are not detrimental to
the city,'' said City Councilman Larry Shirley, who plans to offer
an amendment tonight allowing establishments to sell alcohol beyond
2 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   He defended ``most tavern and bar owners (as) good, hardworking
people,'' including some who lost substantial income when South
Carolina banned video poker machines July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe anybody is going to go out of business because
they are going to have to close at 2 o'clock instead of 3 or
whenever they close,'' City Councilwoman Anne Frances Bleecker
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she's open to amending the ordinance, but not killing
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sweep away the broken beer bottles,'' she said, ``but
it is the noise that has the quality-of-life impact on the people
who live here.''

IN DEFENDING HIS WIFE, CLINTON BROKE NEWS BLACKOUT ON SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a quiet Sunday morning in the middle of the
Middle East summit meeting when President Clinton picked up the
telephone at Camp David and tried to defuse a conflict that was
closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   For days, Clinton, acting as a presidential peacemaker, had been
discussing the complicated issues dividing the Palestinians and
Israelis. But when he dialed up Mortimer B. Zuckerman, publisher of
the New York Daily News, Clinton was pushing another aspect of his
final-year legacy _ the election of his wife to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   With six months to go in his presidency, Clinton sees his power
waning. But his clout is far from gone, especially in foreign
affairs, and Clinton showed that he can still grab a headline _ in
this case a screaming one that said in part, ``Prez Defends Hil on
Slur.''
</P>
<P>
   The president speaks regularly to Hillary Rodham Clinton about
her New York Senate bid, and on that particular morning the
campaign was reeling from allegations in the New York Post that
Mrs. Clinton had used an anti-Semitic slur three decades ago.
Clinton, during a lull in the summit meeting, decided to strike
back, going beyond a brief statement denying the allegation that
his aides had issued on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential aides said the telephone call to the newspaper was
his decision. Mrs. Clinton's aides also distanced themselves from
the president's action.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Clinton's call on Sunday was a rash act or a
well-thought-out counteroffensive coordinated with Mrs. Clinton, it
seemed to backfire. Remarks he made about the summit meeting
violated a news blackout that the White House itself had set, while
his attention-getting effort to snuff out a news story damaging to
his wife seemed only to add fuel to it.
</P>
<P>
   It was another example of Clinton, a man surrounded by dutiful
aides, acting on his own instincts, which have both served him and
failed him in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an extraordinary circumstance,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Monday, seeking to explain the
telephone call he learned of only after the fact. ``We live in a
world where the National Enquirer mentality has hijacked
journalism, and that has become an issue in New York. And these are
scurrilous and untrue charges, and the president wanted to set that
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at the end of the interview with the News, commented
briefly that he was more optimistic about the peace talks than when
they began last week. The remark itself was harmless but it was
uttered after officials had agreed to withhold any comment until
the talks were over. Lockhart said the comments were ``outside the
rules'' but warranted by the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Although no substance on the peace talks ever came up over the
telephone, the potential was there for the chat to interfere with
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly was not supposed to be an interview that dealt
with the peace process,'' a presidential aide explained Monday.
``It just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   White House stenographers usually listen in on Clinton's
telephone interviews and prepare instant, official transcripts. Not
this time. Aides only learned of the call after it took place and
scurried Sunday night to get from the Daily News a transcript of
the remarks dealing with the Middle East so they could release it
to the rest of the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that when he's trying to bring peace to the Middle
East, he had to take a break to ensure peace among Jews in New
York,'' said a Democratic strategist in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The president and Zuckerman know each other well. They have
traveled together to the Middle East, dined together and played
cards aboard Air Force One. Clinton, according to aides, considers
the Daily News friendlier than the Post, the other hard-nosed New
York tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In their Sunday morning conversation, according to two people
with knowledge of the call, Clinton told Zuckerman that there was
no truth to the allegations in the Post, which were based on a book
by a former National Enquirer reporter. The two men arranged for
the president to speak on-the-record to Michael Kramer, the paper's
managing editor.  &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Kramer is also well known to the president. His former wife, Kimba
Woods, had been one of Clinton's early picks for attorney general
before her name was withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kramer called Camp David early in the afternoon. Clinton called
back about 5:30 p.m., unleashing a vigorous defense of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there and she never said it,'' the president said,
according to the News' article, which was labeled an ``exclusive
interview.'' ``In 29 years, my wife has never, ever uttered an
ethnic or racial slur against anybody, ever. She's so straight on
this, she squeaks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton went beyond rebutting the facts. As both he and his
wife have done, the president framed the allegation as part of a
string of attacks by political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also appeared to implicate the campaign of Mrs.
Clinton's rival, Rep. Rick Lazio. ``The only thing they have left
is character assassination,'' he said of Lazio's campaign.

 &HT;    Hope burns eternal in former British Open champ Daly
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland - Behind amber sunglasses that Elvis might
have worn to play golf, John Daly, with a couple days of blond
beard stubble and fresh off his flight, took his official
pre-tournament posture Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a little bit of home here,'' said Daly, 34, who
secured a British Open title at St. Andrews in 1995 to shock the
golf world. ``I don't know. I just always feel good here. The
course, the people _ it's nice to be able to walk out of your room
and come to the golf course. Everything's just great about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And why not? St. Andrews represents the last time Daly existed
as any kind of a force in the game. His career has declined
dramatically since 1995, when he bombed drives over bunkers,
chipped masterfully, made putts from all over the famous property
and beat Costantino Rocca in a sudden-death playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago Daly was kissing the Claret Jug. Now, he's famous
for kissing off major championships. Last month, he ended the U.S.
Open at Pebble Beach with a 14 on his 18th and final hole and
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after St. Andrews, Daly has dropped another wife,
gone through another alcohol rehab and, once again, resumed
drinking. He has been off antidepressants since December.''I felt
like a (laboratory) rat,'' he said. Now, he longs to find the
prescription for victory. ``It (1995) was the last good year,''
Daly said, ``but I'm still here, the heart's still beating, and I'm
still fully exempt until 2005, so there's a lot of golf for me to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   If Daly can glue together his game for a week, it should be at
the Old Course, where he can drive as many par-4's as Tiger Woods
can and keep the ball in play. The key will leaving the pubs early
enough and making enough putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything just sets up good for me,'' Daly said. ``Hopefully,
the wind will blow. If this tournament turns into a putting contest
with no wind, I don't like my chances, but if it blows again, I
like my chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly draws a mob of reporters on the Old Course practice ground,
while other players look back over their shoulders, some shaking
their heads at the attention he still draws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I came in here in '95 last time, I had been
playing awful,'' Daly said. ``Scoring-wise, I was playing worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he feels he can contend, Daly said, ``I'm not
going to say it would be a miracle, but I think a lot of people
would love to see it, especially me. I wouldn't be here if I didn't
think I had a chance. Let's just put it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything's relative with Daly. If he only has a couple vices
working and hasn't been to court lately, it's a calm sea. If he
marries again, it will be for a fourth time. His use of alcohol
hasn't destroyed him. His weight, often outrageous, actually
appears to be slightly lower. ``I think the only trouble I have
right now is my golf game,'' he said. ``For the first time in my
life, I can work on that and worry about that, and I don't have to
worry about all this other crap that everybody else seems to worry
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly and Woods have little difference in length, except that
Daly's averages often are for only two rounds of a tournament. Daly
suggests that he flies the ball farther but that Woods is longer by
the time his ball stops rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their drivers, they are worlds apart, especially with the
putter. ``If I had his putter right now,'' Daly said, ``I'd be
awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Checking out a Golf Channel videotape of the 1995 British Open
recently, Daly noticed how open his putting stance was five years
ago. Since spotting the change, during practices at home, ``It
feels like I'm going to make everything. . . . The only way for me
to make a putt (before) was to decelerate and pull it.''
</P>
<P>
   As absurd as it is to compare Woods and Daly at this juncture,
when the world's best player is mentioned, the man who already has
the title loves to fantasize about playing against the man who
needs one for a career Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be cool for me and him to come down Sunday here, man,''
Daly said. ``I'd love it. I know he's going to be there. I don't
know where I'm going to be. Hell, I may be on a plane home, I don't
know, but I'm going to be enjoying myself.''

PUTIN VISITS CHINA IN HOPE OF STRENGTHENING A STRATEGIC AXIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ President Vladimir Putin of Russia arrived in
Beijing on Monday night on the first stop of an Asian tour intended
to revive his country's faded diplomatic role in the region and
build what could become a Chinese-Russian axis to counter American
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is expected to sign at least six accords with Chinese
leaders on Tuesday, including a joint statement with President
Jiang Zemin condemning American proposals for missile defense
systems over North America and Asia. Opposition to the American
plan has accelerated a relationship that Russia and China describe
as a ``strategic partnership'' intended to counter American power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The partnership is an effort to oppose hegemony and supremacy,
and one single country dominating the world,'' said Zhao Huasheng,
director of the Russian Studies department at the Shanghai
Institute for International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Putin travels to North Korea, where he is expected
to ask that country's leader, Kim Jong Il, to forgo its missile
development program. The United States has told Russia and China
that the proposed American missile defense system is intended to
counter threats posed by smaller, missile-armed states like North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Putin then stops in Blagoveshchensk, in eastern Russia, for a
conference on a region that is experiencing increased immigration
from China. He ends his tour on the Japanese island of Okinawa,
where he is due to arrive late Friday for the annual gathering of
leading industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
   China is by far Putin's most important stop. It will be his
first visit there since he was elected president in March. And it
follows eight visits by his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, who agreed
with Jiang in 1996 to establish the strategic partnership to build
a ``multi-polar world,'' a euphemism to describe opposition to
America's status as the world's sole superpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia shares a strategic partnership with China and puts
relations with Beijing among the highest priorities of its foreign
policy,'' Putin said in an interview with China's state television
last week.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not yet clear how warmly Putin will embrace the
Chinese worldview, Western analysts say the rapprochement between
the countries is taking on an increasingly anti-American cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one level, this is classic realpolitik balance-of-power,
but on another it has the appearance of a united front against the
United States,'' said David Shambaugh, a China specialist at George
Washington University and the Brookings Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang and Yeltsin had pledged to increase economic cooperation
between the two countries to bolster that partnership, but
bilateral trade has fallen far short of the targeted $20 billion a
year, stagnating at around $6 billion. Russian arms sales to China
account for much of that.
</P>
<P>
   Putin hopes to change this, though it will not happen overnight.
Russia's troubled economy presents a far less attractive export
market for China than the United States, Europe and Japan, and
Russian goods cannot compete in China against domestically
manufactured products or high technology imports from Japan and the
West. About the only things Russia can offer China besides arms are
commodities like natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Among the agreements Putin is expected to sign in Beijing is one
calling for a feasibility study for a gas pipeline from Russia's
Irkutsk region to China. That project has been talked about for
years with little progress, partly because China does not really
need more natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Another deal on the table during Putin's visit is Russia's sale
of a second pair of nuclear reactors for the Tianwan nuclear power
plant in eastern China. An initial two Russian reactors are
currently being built at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, weapons are likely to remain the strongest bond in the
two countries' economic relationship. China wants weapons to
modernize its military and Russia's overdeveloped arms industry is
begging for customers with cash. Already, China has bought advanced
fighter aircraft, submarines and Russian guided-missile destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has become even more important to China since Israel
bowed to American pressure earlier this month and canceled the sale
to Beijing of an early-warning radar system mounted atop a Russian
jet. Russia could supply China with similar technology.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's large delegation includes Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
and the director of Russia's arms exporter Rosvooruzheniye, Alexei
Ogarev. And China is expected to place additional weapons orders
during Putin's visit.
</P>
<P>
   China remains decades from developing a military force
sufficient to challenge the United States, but it is intent on
building a credible threat to Taiwan, over which Beijing claims
sovereignty. Though China has repeatedly threatened to recover
control of the island by force, it does not currently have the
military capability to do so.
</P>
<P>
   That military build-up is just one of the many areas in which
China and Russia's economic and political interests converge.
Russia not only offers China the hardware necessary to achieve its
goals in the Taiwan Strait, it acts as a potential diplomatic
counterbalance to any intervention by the United States, which
supports Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China, for its part, has stood by Russia in opposition to the
1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and in Moscow's brutal war against
separatists in Chechnya. Beijing sees parallels between those cases
and separatist movements in its own regions of Tibet and Xinjiang,
where it fears Western condemnation or even intervention if
conditions deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Putin first met Jiang earlier this month in Tajikistan,
bordering Xinjiang, where they signed an agreement to fight ethnic
separatism and terrorism in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those areas of common interest pale in comparison to the
American missile defense proposal, which both countries see as a
means of securing the United States military dominance in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, since this will affect both international security,
the security of Russia and China, I can tell you I expect that we
will have to have more consultations and discussions to find out
ways and means to eliminate or at least reduce this kind of
security threat,'' Sha Zukang, head of the Foreign Ministry's
Department of Arms Control and Disarmament, said last week.

   CHINA-DIVORCE-$ADV23 _ BEIJING _ The southern province of

in China, but men in Guangdong have taken marital

   GROWING PAINS FOR THE INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   Eds: The following two stories, about growing pains for the
Internet in a period of rapid worldwide growth, are suitable for
twinning or use as a series.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-HARDWARE _ WASHINGTON _ Even as the Internet is hailed
for expanding the horizons of millions of users and energizing the
world economy, there's concern it could become the victim of its
own success. Rapid growth of sites and users poses the very real
nightmare that this massive online structure,
</P>
<P>
   representing a $650 billion investment, could come crashing down
in gigantic cyber-traffic jams. (Glass, Cox News Service))

</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-SOFTWARE _ WASHINGTON _ WWW.any-site.com. To American
ears, this familiar pattern identifies a World Wide Web site on the
Internet. The system seems simple and settled, but a global battle
is being waged this summer over how addresses will be assigned to
keep pace with rapid Internet growth. The
</P>
<P>
   stakes are enormous. If plans to establish private control over
the Internet's address system founders on technical details and
political disputes, the global
</P>
<P>
   expansion of the online community could become gridlocked. But
if it succeeds, Americans will have to get used to having the
Internet governed by an international body that may be located in
Switzerland (Geewax, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-TAKEN _ Pity the late-arriving entrepreneur who decides
to take his business on line. Suppose a fisherman creates a fly
that catches trout like magic. He decides to create a Web site to
market it. But he'll find the waters are nearly fished out.

<P>
   VOTERS-SUBURBMOMS _ DATELINE TK _ Four years ago, ``soccer
moms'' gained almost mythical stature as the coveted voting bloc
that would reelect President Clinton or give Republican Bob Dole a
fighting chance. In a close presidential race in 2000 between Al
Gore and George W. Bush, the women's vote is all-important, but
</P>
<P>
   more difficult to define and to attract. So far, polls are
showing that more men are strong supporters of their choice, where
women tend to be more flexible _undecideds or soft supporters of
Gore or Bush. In addition to the gender gap, there is a
particularly large ``marriage'' gap. Clinton led Dole among married
women 53% to 43% in 1996; Gore trails Bush 42 percent to 50
percent. (Holmes, Cox News Service)

one local official, Sangpo is now a wired outpost. Its 4,800
residents boast private cars, cellular phones, about 100 personal
computers and a bustling Internet cafe. In 20 years, the village
has grown a sheepskin backyard business into a multi-million dollar
niche market. It now processes 5 million sheepskins a year, almost
half of China's total sheepskin imports. Technology has helped fuel
the growth. (Chao, Cox Washington Bureau). Art includes a 4-column

Luxuries usually strewn about the family room are becoming popular

TOP U.S. LAW FIRMS AGREE TO MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)   By KRUTI TRIVEDI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to increase their presence on both coasts and overseas,
two large U.S. law firms _ one in California and one in New York _
announced plans Monday to merge.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Pillsbury Madison &AMP; Sutro, based in San
Francisco, and Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam &AMP; Roberts, based in New
York, would create one of the nation's largest law firms, with more
than 860 lawyers in 16 offices. The merger would especially address
a weakness for Pillsbury, whose lawyers handle international
business, though only one is based abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes after similar deals among American and
international law firms during the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The combined firm, which will be called Pillsbury Winthrop, is
expected to have more than $400 million in revenue next year, which
would make it one of the top 20 firms in the United States in terms
of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two firms have a shared vision of creating a major U.S.
law firm in our core practice areas in which we match up very
well,'' said John Pritchard, the chairman of Winthrop, which, like
Pillsbury, specializes in mergers and acquisitions, finance,
complex litigation, and capital markets. ``We have a vision of
creating a strong national firm headquartered on both coasts and
globalizing that firm.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed combination, which the firms called a merger of
equals, is intended to bolster Winthrop's technology practice,
especially in the Silicon Alley area of New York, Pritchard said.
Pillsbury, which has 81 lawyers in its Silicon Valley office,
bulked up its technology law arm when it merged with Cushman Darby
&AMP; Cushman of Washington in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As for Pillsbury, the merger would increase the firm's
international presence, said Marina Park, Pillsbury's managing
partner. Though Pillsbury, which has 596 lawyers, is more than
twice the size of Winthrop, the majority of its revenue comes from
domestic clients. The firm's sole international office consists of
one partner based in Tokyo. Winthrop has offices in Tokyo, London,
Hong Kong and Singapore; more than half of the company's revenue
comes from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The partners of both firms will vote on the merger later this
year. Mary Cranston, the chairwoman of Pillsbury, would be
chairwoman of the combined firm. Pritchard would be vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Both firms have seen revenue drop in comparison with their
competitors, according to the rankings in The American Lawyer
magazine. Winthrop, which ranked 93rd in 1998, dropped to 100 in
1999. Pillsbury, ranked 44th in 1998, fell to 46th.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of their United States and international counterparts,
both companies have been searching for a partner for some time.
Pillsbury started seriously looking for a New York-based partner in
January 1999, after Cranston was named chairwoman. Winthrop has
been considering merging for two years.

   ``The key thing is to globalize our practices because our
clients are globalizing and, more importantly, our competition is
globalizing,'' Pritchard said. ``Almost every law firm in the

are really at the forefront of mergers.''

MIDEAST PEACE TALKS INTENSIFY, BUT UNCERTAINTY ABOUNDS

   THURMONT, Md. _ As the Camp David peace summit meeting moved
closer to a supposed deadline of President Clinton's departure for
Japan on Wednesday morning, the White House remained officially
committed to reaching ``an agreement'' before then and talks
shifted into high-drive for a crucial 48-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   But some American, Israeli and Palestinian officials began
lowering expectations Monday for a breakthrough, even suggesting
that additional summit meetings may be needed. And the White House
left ample room for interpretation of its goal, since ``an
agreement'' could include anything from a more modest declaration
of principles to a full-blown accord between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Although American officials had previously said quietly that
Clinton's itinerary could be modified, the White House continued to
declare Monday that he had no intention of delaying his trip to a
Group of 7 meeting in Okinawa or of sending Vice President Al Gore
in his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is to complete the process before the president
goes,'' Joe Lockhart, Clinton's spokesman, said. Later, he added:
``You will know we are following the schedule when you see the
president walk up the steps of the plane, wave and the door
close.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Middle East experts, however, including some officials
on all sides, find it hard to imagine that the Palestinians'
leader, Yasser Arafat, could modify a well-documented personal
history of pushing things to the wire. And in Arafat's case, that
could mean an ultimate deadline not of Wednesday but of Sept. 13,
by which he has pledged to declare a state.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts envisioned the leaders taking a break of a couple
of weeks before reconvening for a continued summit meeting. But
others said that this would be highly risky because it would expose
what has been a completely secret, blacked-out negotiation to the
leaks, misinformation, disinformation and political pressures of
Israel and the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's feasible to do that, to break off and then return,'' said
a senior Israeli official. ``But I'm not sure it's a good idea to
let the energy dissipate. The rumors and false assumptions could
lead to terrible results.''
</P>
<P>
   Yitzhak Herzog, Israel's Cabinet secretary, who is in
Washington, said: ``It's clear that both parties must seize the
moment, not only the moment, but literally the day. We should be
thinking of Wednesday as a once-in-a-lifetime chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Israelis have been putting out the word that Prime
Minister Ehud Barak ``is not going to stay forever at Camp David,''
and expressing frustration that, in their view, Barak has taken
``giant steps'' toward Arafat while the Palestinian leader has
remained unyielding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinians are not showing flexibility and are not going
the extra mile,'' said Yuli Tamir, Israel's dovish immigration
minister who is serving as an Israeli spokeswoman in Washington.
``I think they are pushing Barak to cross his red lines, and I
think they are making a mistake. He will not change his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has professed to be more optimistic than he was
at the start of the summit last Tuesday, Barak is ``more on the
pessimistic side,'' Avraham Burg, the speaker of Israel's
Parliament, told Israel Radio on Monday. Other Israeli ministers
and lawmakers who spoke to the prime minister expressed a similar
impression.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, who voiced unusual optimism late last week, on
Monday hit a peak of frustration, although it may have been
short-lived. One Palestinian official who is not inside Camp David
said that the Israelis seemed to be retreating on expected
concessions and that the Palestinians have told the Americans that
they do not plan to stay beyond Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one senior Palestinian negotiator, Abu Mazen, who is the
Palestine Liberation Organization's senior official after Arafat,
faces a personal deadline. His son, Tarek, is getting married in
Ramallah on Thursday, and the whole Palestinian peace team is
invited and planning to attend.
</P>
<P>
   With Wednesday looming, the pace and intensity of the
negotiations have quickened, and the teams worked well into the
morning until about 5 a.m. before breaking and resuming midday. All
three leaders are night owls, known to thrive in the post-midnight
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian officials outside the talks say that a
kind of high-tension fatigue is setting in. Lockhart said, ``Coming
back continually to the same issues with the same people, that kind
of environment is not always the best for the warm and fuzzies.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel Radio reported Monday night that while key differences
remain on the thorniest issues of Jerusalem and the right of return
of refugees, progress has been made on some relatively minor issues
like water and the environment. Side talks are being held in
Emmitsburg, Md.
</P>
<P>
   But an American official there said that the side talks could
get only so far without knowledge of the parameters of a core
agreement, and Israeli and Palestinian participants who have
longstanding professional relationships have been crafting and
re-crafting individual paragraphs about civil affairs and economic
relations. Rather than twiddle their thumbs, some Palestinian
officials involved in the side talks have opted instead for long
shopping afternoons at the Pentagon City mall in Virginia where
many are staying, the American official said. (Some have been
seeking wedding presents for Tarek Abbas, Abu Mazen's son.)
</P>
<P>
   Barak summoned a former director-general of the Foreign Ministry
from Israel, Reuven Merhak, who is an expert on Jerusalem. He has
been stationed at Emmitsburg since arriving. But Israeli analysts
took his arrival as a sign that Barak wanted to have close by an
analyst who has thought through all the solutions for sharing the
holy city, including what Burg referred to recently as ``shrinking
and expanding'' Jerusalem _ annexing Jerusalem suburbs in the West
Bank to Israel while relinquishing Palestinian neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The news blackout has held remarkably well through seven days,
which most take as a good sign that no one wants to blow up the
process. Inside Camp David, though, the delegations have ample
access to American newspapers and 60 or 70 television channels,
Lockhart said.

 &HT;    Florida's Graham stops in Hillary country
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK CITY _ His bag in the overhead bin several seats behind
him, Bob Graham asked U.S. Sen. Max Baucus of Montana if he could
pass it to him. Baucus was willing to do more for his fellow
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be happy to carry the bag of the future vice president,''
Baucus said. ``Can I carry your other bag?''
</P>
<P>
   Graham declined with a laugh. But there is one offer he's ready
to accept, if it is given, and that is to become Vice President Al
Gore's running mate. Said to be on Gore's short list, Graham, who
was considered for the job by Bill Clinton in 1992, said Monday
that the attention is more intense now than it was eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly a lot more media attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Jay Leno poking fun at his penchant for note-taking and
reporters probing every detail of his life _ he saw the Broadway
play Sinatra Sunday night with his wife, Adele _ Graham is trying
hard not to appear too eager for the job.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Ellis Island he signed autographs and posed
for photographs. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was there
with Graham to announce more money for restoration of Ellis Island,
stopped short of endorsing him but called Graham ``first rate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very fond of Sen. Graham. I have really admired him,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Ferraro, the former New York congresswoman who was
Walter Mondale's running mate in 1984, said if it were her
decision, ``He's at the top of my list.'' She said that with his
experience as governor from 1979 to 1987 and as senator, he is an
ideal candidate who ``understands the process''
</P>
<P>
   With Florida's 25 electoral votes, Ferraro said Democrats have
no choice but to compete there, and Graham could help the party win
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is a state where I think we can win even with Jeb Bush
there,'' she said. ``There is a large elderly population and
Democrats are right on issues that concern them. I think Graham
would be a big help.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's wife thinks all the attention is very exciting. ``I
think it's really nice that he's getting the kind of national
attention he's been gettiing,'' she said, although she wished Leno
has not made fun of Graham's notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, Graham has carried a small notebook with him,
jotting down everything from how much he weighs in the morning to
tidbits about people he's met walking through airports. And he
shows what he writes down to almost anyone who asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notebooks are very helpful,'' Adele Graham said in a
rebuttal to Leno. ``If I need to know something about a day, I just
ask him and he looks it up and he'll have whatever names and
addresses I need.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, she is taking all the attention her husband is getting
in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very good life now, `` she said. ``And whatever
happens we'll continue to have a very good life.''

   GENERALMILLS-PILLSBURY (Minneapolis) _ They grew up side by side
on the banks of the Mississippi River, two 19th-century milling
companies that competed head to head and made this city the flour
capital of the world. Their decades-old signs still face each other
across the river in symbolic combat _``Gold Medal Flour,'' from
General Mills, on the west bank, and ``Pillsbury's Best'' on the
east. On Monday, though, General Mills and Pillsbury said they were
uniting to create a food giant with more than $12 billion in annual
sales. The merger would bring together such well-known brands as
Cheerios, Wheaties, Hagen Daz, Yoplait yogurt, Hamburger Helper,
Jolly Green Giant vegetables and Pillsbury bakery items, though not
all these products will remain within the new company's stable. By

CLINTON PUSHES FOR MIDEAST PEACE DEAL 

</HEADLINE>
 TALKS-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ President Clinton sought Monday to wring a final
peace agreement out of the Israelis and Palestinians before he
leaves for Japan as talks entered a second week with the two sides
apparently no closer to a deal than when the talks opened.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview with the New York Daily News, Clinton said
``some progress'' had been made toward ending more than a half
century of hostilities between the two sides, although he confessed
that he is still not at all sure the negotiations will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, it's hard,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he vowed to press on even though he described his
negotiations with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat as ``the hardest thing I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some progress, but I can't say I know we'll
succeed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to depart for Okinawa, Japan, Wednesday morning to
attend the so-called Group of Eight economic summit. White House
officials said they were optimistic an agreement could be reached
before then that would lead to the settlement of competing claims
to Jerusalem and where the final borders of a Palestinian state
will be drawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect that when the president leaves the parties will have
wrapped up their business,'' White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``the pace and intensity (of the discussions) have
both quickened'' in anticipation of Clinton's departure and he
noted that the leaders had spent ``two straight, very long nights''
trying to work through remaining problems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to borders and the final status of Jerusalem,
several controversial issues have to be resolved. They include what
to do about more than 3 million Palestinian refugees who have been
driven from their homes since Israel became a state in 1948, and
the 40,000 Israeli settlers who now reside in territory that is to
be returned to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But while Clinton and his aides continued to put a positive spin
on the talks, both Israeli and Palestinian officials were sounding
doubtful that the remaining obstacles could be overcome before
Clinton's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying it can't happen,'' said one Israeli official
familiar with the talks. ``But it will be very, very hard because
of the differences that remain.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg agreed with that
assessment, telling Israeli Radio that Barak had told him in a
telephone call that things are not going well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not really optimistic,'' Burg said in the interview.
``We have not reached the moment of truth, the moment of decision.
It is more on the pessimistic side than the optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Cabinet minister Yuli Tamir, who heads the offices of
immigration and absorption, told Israeli army radio that Arafat has
been reluctant thus far to give in on any of the key issues in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he continues to insist on the things that he insists upon,
there will be no agreement,'' Tamir said.
</P>
<P>
   But a Palestinian official said Barak has hardened his positions
because of public unrest back home and the fact that many in his
governing coalition have abandoned him. This official said Barak is
refusing to relinquish control over any key parts of Jerusalem,
which the Palestinians are intent on designating as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a position,'' he said, ``will not lead to peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Arafat also still considers Sept. 13 a hard deadline for
reaching an agreement. The Palestinian leader has said that he
intends to declare a Palestinian state on that date if there has
been no final peace settlement by then. The threat has been taken
seriously by Israel, which has countered that it would be forced to
annex part of the still-occupied territories as a security
precaution.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton convened the talks at the presidential retreat on
July 11, Barak was reportedly ready to relinquish control of up to
90 percent of the West Bank. Israel has already withdrawn
militarily from 40 percent of the territory and the Gaza Strip.
Barak was reportedly also ready to accept the return of thousands
of refugees to Israel and the West Bank, even though opponents of
such a move say it would create serious security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of dividing Jerusalem, however, is proving to be the
most difficult to resolve. Over the weekend, Barak summoned an
expert on Jerusalem to help in the talks. He has offered to redraw
the holy city's borders in order to include more Palestinian
territory. But Arafat is insisting that a Palestinian capital must
include parts of the old walled city in East Jerusalem.

 &HT;    Tobacco industry attempts to delay final judgment
 &HT;    By George Bennett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ There's nothing routine about a $145 billion punitive
damages verdict.
</P>
<P>
   So on Monday, less than three days after jurors ordered
cigarette makers to pay the largest civil penalty in U.S. history,
the tobacco industry began fighting back by questioning the
normally routine matter of signing a final judgment to close out
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big issue,'' Philip Morris attorney Dan Webb told
Judge Robert Kaye during a brief hearing on post-verdict matters.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye said he had expected to sign a formal order this week
wrapping up the trial, but would hear arguments before doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Webb maintains the nation's first class-action trial of the
tobacco industry isn't over and punitive damage money can't be paid
until courts decide case-by-case on the compensatory damage claims
of as many as 700,000 Floridians with smoking-related illnesses.
Such a process could take 75 years, Webb said Friday in the
immediate aftermath of the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies also want Kaye to slash the jury's damages
figure, which they say far exceeds their ability to pay. Florida
law prohibits a verdict that would bankrupt a company. During their
closing arguments, the five cigarette makers said they couldn't
afford more than $381 million in combined damages, or less than 0.3
percent of the jury's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers' attorney Susan Rosenblatt said Monday that plaintiffs
want a final judgment entered quickly so interest on the $145
billion can begin accumulating while the case is being appealed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ``big issue'' of the final judgment, Webb
said the industry is still awaiting a hearing on 64 pending motions
from the trial. Kaye and plaintiffs' attorneys tentatively agreed
those matters could be discussed in August.
</P>
<P>
   Once trial motions are disposed of, the industry has vowed to
appeal the class-action status of the estimated 300,000 to 700,000
sick Florida smokers. About two dozen other state and federal
courts around the U.S. have rejected such class-action suits,
generally finding smokers' circumstances and histories too varied
to be covered by a single court action.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt scoffed at Webb's scenario of hundreds of thousands
of additional tobacco trials. She suggested large numbers of
smokers with the same diseases could be grouped together to
determine their eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the nightmare they're presenting,'' Rosenblatt said.
``It's doable.''

   MANILA, Philippines _ Maria Luz Ochondra ran for her life a week
ago, pursued by an erupting volcano of garbage that roared, heaved
and then burst into flames as it buried the shantytown where she

and flames.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything got dark, and I passed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to, there was light, and I thought, `Thank God,
I'm alive.' But then I realized that I only had one of my children,
Bryan, the youngest. The others were dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Loosened by a week of monsoon rains, the huge garbage mountain
here _ the symbol of the nation's poverty _ had collapsed and
smothered hundreds of squatters who made their livings picking
through it with metal hooks for scraps of refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, rescuers still dug through hundreds of tons of muck,
working in one-hour shifts because of the rot, the poisonous gasses
and the stench of the decomposing bodies.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 bodies have been recovered. Residents estimate that up
to four times that number may have died, though a complete toll
will probably never be known.
</P>
<P>
   The people here knew that they were living in danger. This was
not the first garbage landslide that they had seen. But they say
they had nowhere else to go. They are homeless migrants who shift
from village to city, from one squatter colony to another, nibbling
at the edges of society.
</P>
<P>
   In a message of condolence, Pope John Paul II called the people
here ``among the poorest in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   They are a living metaphor, the local parish priest said, the
product of the overpopulation and urban migration that is a growing
disaster for poor countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the waste of the waste, they are the leftovers,''
said the priest, the Rev. Joel Bernardo, who lives among them in
this shantytown with the tragic name Promised Land. ``The next day
after the avalanche they were back to work in the garbage. They had
no choice. They had to live.''
</P>
<P>
   One-third of the 74 million people in the Philippines fall below
the poverty line, earning no more than $1 a day. For people like
Mrs. Ochondra, life at the edge of the dump, with its steady
income, can be considered a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my children were born here,'' she said, all boys, from 7
to 1{. The filth and the stench and the millions of flies that
cover everything was the only life that they had known.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Mrs. Ochondra, 35, joined a group of survivors who
arrive each day to watch the creaking backhoes in the hope that
their relatives' bodies might be found. They still tremble when
they tell their stories, and the sound of the collapsing garbage
mountain echoes in their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Like a plane landing, they say, like a clap of thunder, ``like a
big wave of surf crashing over you, only it's not water _ it's
garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ochondra could not even hear her own screams.
</P>
<P>
   People were running and screaming: ``Landslide, landslide!''
Some walked in circles in a daze. Cries for help could be heard
from under the shifting muck. The methane in the garbage exploded
into flame, ignited by cooking fires or broken electric lines.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ochondra's husband, Rogelio, 36, who was out buying bread,
ran to look for his family. But his house, he said, was already
``embraced by garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my wife,'' he recounted, ``and I asked her, `Where are
our kids?' And she said, `I wasn't able to save them, only
Bryan.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was as if he himself had died, Ochondra said. ``Not even one
more?'' he asked her.

<P>
   The Promised Land is a real mountain, 50 feet high and covering
74 acres, the main dump for 10,000 tons of garbage produced in
Manila every day. It began as a ravine, and the garbage was meant
as landfill for a planned housing project.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994, when the government closed a famous dump known as
Smoky Mountain as part of a beautification campaign, the garbage
kept coming, and a new mountain began to grow here. Many Smoky
Mountain scavengers moved here, too, skilled at their work and
ready to accept its unpleasantness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always smoke, there's always fire, even when it
rains,'' said Paz Calopez, who lives at the edge of the mountain.
``The garbage is always glowing, even at night, and you hear
popping sounds. We think it's batteries exploding. It smells worse
than a bathroom, especially when the bulldozers come through. Then
you really smell the smoke. You cannot breathe. Your eyes water.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the new mountain grew, a whole economy developed around
it, with middlemen buying and reselling the salvaged scraps and
shanty shops springing up to sell soap and shoes and bicycle parts
and school supplies and ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's raw capitalism working here,'' Bernardo, the priest,
said. ``And it really generates money. Millions of pesos revolve
through here every day.''
</P>
<P>
   In a complex system, he said, the owners of junk shops
specialize in particular commodities _ plastic bottles, cardboard
boxes, copper wire, aluminum, glass, broken toys and bits and
pieces of machinery. At the top of the hierarchy are those shops
that have contracts with large enterprises, particularly hotels, to
claim and recycle their garbage. The contractors prepay for those
truckloads and control the scavengers who pick through them.
</P>
<P>
   Most scavengers are poor farmers who have moved to the city for
survival. ``Now they are like peasants in the cities,'' Bernardo
said. ``Pockets of peasants in the slum. Urban peasants. And
similarly they work for landlords, the middlemen who support them
with cash advances and then put them in bondage, just the way they
were in bondage to their landlords in the countryside.''
</P>
<P>
   But as in the countryside, an even lower rung exists _ freelance
scavengers who cannot pay or do not have the connections to work
for the junk shops. They make their livings as gleaners, picking
through what is left when the choice material is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Some bold youngsters leap onto the trucks before they dump,
snatching what they can and often suffering serious injury. They
are known, Bernardo said, as ``jumpers.''
</P>
<P>
   The trucks dump garbage around the clock, and it is in the
deepest hours before dawn that the gleaners and the jumpers are
most active.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gil C. Calopez, 15, has been a gleaner for five years,
and he is proud of his ability to earn money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all sorts of stuff in there,'' he said. ``A lot of
times, we find watches, and all they need is a battery and they
start right up.''
</P>
<P>
   The best thing he ever found, Roberto said, was an ink roller
from an Epson printer. It earned him $3 at a junk shop, though he
is sure that he could have gotten more.
</P>
<P>
   Ochondra and his wife are both migrants from the island of
Samar, one of the poorest areas in the country, and in their own
way, they had lived a charmed life until now.
</P>
<P>
   But now, he said, all he has in his life is his missing sons.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Raymond and Ruel have been recovered and reburied.
The body of Ryan is still somewhere under the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back to where our house used to be,'' he said, ``and I
promised my children: `Don't worry. I'll try to get the three of
you so you can be together.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot sleep now. It's like I hear my sons calling: `Papa,
help me! Papa, help me!' You know, they used to play the Pokemon
cards. What fun they had!''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ochondra said she could not stop worrying about her lost
children. ``I know my sons miss me,'' she said. ``They can't really
sleep well at night unless they're beside me.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back now, she said, her life seemed to be filled with
premonitions of tragedy. She would wake at night and gaze at the
faces of her children and smooth their pillows.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night during the summer,'' she said, ``the mountain of
garbage would just light up, and I would say to my husband: `Look,
it's like candles are burning. It's like we are living in a
cemetery.'''

BUSINESS TYCOON SAYS HE WILL SEEK TO RALLY OPPOSITION TO PUTIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Boris Berezovsky, the archetypal Russian tycoon,
politician and, until lately, a force within the Kremlin itself,
said on Monday that he will quit his seat in parliament and try to
form an alliance of big business and regional politicians aimed at
curbing President Vladimir Putin's growing power.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky said that he is resigning on Wednesday because ``I do
not wish to take part in the dismantling of Russia and the
imposition of authoritarian rule.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the bluntest attack yet by a major figure on the popular
Putin, who has taken dead aim at Russia's business oligarchy and
its 89 regional governors in a bid to reimpose Kremlin control over
a virtually untamed political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It also carried considerable risk for Berezovsky, an unpopular
public figure and one of the very tycoons Putin's administration is
sizing up. His plan for a new anti-Kremlin movement drew catcalls
when he first hinted at it earlier this month, and most experts
give it scant chance of quick success.
</P>
<P>
   By resigning from parliament's lower house, the Duma, Berezovsky
also will surrender his immunity to prosecution just as the
government is threatening criminal action against other tycoons _
and after prosecutors questioned him last Friday in an inquiry
involving the Russian airline Aeroflot.
</P>
<P>
   In an afternoon news conference here, Berezovsky took pains to
suggest that he seeks to a create a new loyal opposition to a
president whose convictions and honesty he still admires. Were last
March's presidential election to be held today, Berezovsky said at
one point, he would vote for Putin again.
</P>
<P>
   But he also sounded like an angry and betrayed man, one who
blasted the Kremlin's attacks on his fellow tycoons as nothing more
than a bald attempt to usurp power for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Russia is facing a choice: whether we will follow the
Latin American model, with an authoritarian power and market
economy, or the European model with a liberal power and market
economy,'' he said. ``The only possible option,'' he said, is the
latter.
</P>
<P>
   Russia experts here and in Washington say the tycoon's
announcement shows how swiftly Berezovsky, who had an open door to
the Kremlin during former President Boris Yeltsin's final years in
office, has become estranged from Putin's administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any relationship between Putin and
Berezovsky,'' said Vyachaslav Nikonov, a top Russian political
analyst. ``Otherwise, Berezovsky wouldn't correspond with Putin by
sending him these open letters.'' Nikonov said that with
Berezovsky's access to the Kremlin cut off, he is now reduced to a
game of modest opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sending messages in different directions. One is to the
Kremlin, saying you guys are making a big mistake without me.
Message number two is to the governors: I'm your best friend. And
three is to the liberals: I'm your last hope for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Berezovsky, a 54-year-old former mathematician who
acquired immense riches by exploiting Russia's lawless capitalism
early on, seems an unlikely spokesman for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   He is widely assumed to have vast interests in Aeroflot;
AvtoVAZ, Russia's biggest automaker, and Sibneft, one of the
largest oil companies, among other concerns. He denies some of
those claims, but makes no bones about wielding great influence _
and even financial control _ over a media empire that includes
Russia's quasi-state television network, ORT, the Moscow business
newspaper Kommersant and the magazine Vlast, the Russian word for
``power.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is even richer: Berezovsky is widely believed to be
one of the Kremlin insiders who decided during Yeltsin's final days
in the presidency that Putin should be groomed to succeed him. ORT
played a major role in promoting Putin's election this spring.
</P>
<P>
   But then, experts still debate whether the Kremlin's assaults on
the governors and the tycoons are aimed at stabilizing Russia's
shaky democracy, as Putin says, or at aggrandizing the president's
power, as Berezovsky contends.
</P>
<P>
   Since being sworn in as president in early May, Putin has carved
Russia into seven administrative districts and installed his own
appointees in each one, moving swiftly to consolidate federal power
and patronage in a single place.
</P>
<P>
   He has also proposed to effectively abolish Russia's upper house
of parliament, which now consists of the 89 governors and their
appointees, and replace it with a more independent group of
legislators. Over Berezovsky's strident objections, the Duma seems
on the verge of doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's war on the tycoons began days after Putin's
swearing-in with a raid on the offices of Boris Gusinsky, who
controls a media empire that includes Russia's largest independent
television network.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has denied any involvement in that or moves since then
against a half-dozen other oligarchs in the oil, metals and auto
industries. But neither has he disavowed them, and it has become
apparent in the last week that the actions have his tacit approval,
if not his outright authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky revealed on Monday that federal prosecutors had
questioned him for two hours on Friday about allegations that up to
$600 million in proceeds from Aeroflot, the privatized Soviet
airline, had been laundered through Swiss banks. He insists that
the accusations are groundless and that, in any case, he is but a
witness in a case that centers on other people.
</P>
<P>
   But news reports quote prosecutors as saying Berezovsky, long
said to have a huge but hidden interest in Aeroflot, is a target of
the inquiry.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his news conference on Monday, Berezovsky said he had decided
to quit parliament in part because he did not believe it right to
side with his fellow oligarchs against Putin while having an
immunity from prosecution that they lack.
</P>
<P>
   The government's attack is ``no accident, not the initiative of
some over-zealous bureaucrat. It is essentially aimed at destroying
large independent businesses,'' he said. ``I do not want to enjoy
parliamentary immunity in such a case.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, noting that Berezovsky and other tycoons have
usually been major rivals in the last decade, offered a less
charitable assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to know that if these people want to get him, having
parliamentary immunity is not going to make any difference,'' said
Paul Saunders, director of the Nixon Center, a Washington-based
research organization that specializes in Russian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an opportunity to take a fairly high-profile,
dramatic step to once and for all make it clear to everyone that he
opposes what is happening.''

 &HT;    Falcons hope Shawn Jefferson is the deep threat they've needed
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. - One Sunday afternoon in the fall of 1998,
Shawn Jefferson was on the wrong sideline when the Falcons put it
together.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta pounded New England 41-10 that day in Foxboro Stadium.
For Jefferson, it was educational.
</P>
<P>
   When his agent called the first morning of free agencyin
February and said the Falcons were panting and ready to deal,
Jefferson knew what they were seeking, even before he agreed to a
four-year, $14.2 million contract later that day.
</P>
<P>
   They want Jeffersonto go deep. His new team was great at going
deep in 1998 but terrible last year.
</P>
<P>
   After the big Atlanta win in 1998, Pete Carroll, then New
England's coach, told the Pats, ``Don't be surprised if you see
that team in the Super Bowl,'' Jefferson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do what I'm supposed to do, I think I can help this team
get back to where it was,'' Jefferson said. On the Falcons' way to
Super Bowl XXXIII, running back Jamal Anderson got most of the ink
for his 1,846 rushing yards. But that bruising running attack set
up a great downfield passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta averaged 15.8 yards per completion and 8.8 per attempt,
and the Falcons were No. 1 or No. 2 in the NFL in most passing
categories.
</P>
<P>
   In the game against the Patriots, Atlanta averaged 15.6 yards
per attempt and 9.9 yards per completion.
</P>
<P>
   But last offseason, coach Dan Reeves released speedy wide
receiver Tony Martin, who had led the Falcons in `98 with 66
receptions and 17.9 yards per grab. Then, the Falcons averaged 13.3
yards per completion and a paltry 7.3 yards per attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the 6-foot, 180-pound sprinter Jefferson. He never has
caught more than 54 passes a season in nine years on the NFL. But
his per-catch averages the last four years have been the best of
his career 15.4 yards, 15.6, 22.7 and 17.5. Quarterback Chris
Chandler, who openly pined for Martin last summer, isn't
complaining. ``He's been outstanding. He's got even more (speed)
than I thought,'' Chandler said. ``He's got a great attitude, he's
a good route runner, has great quickness and has experience.'' Tim
Dwight, a sprinter himself, took over for Chris Calloway in the
middle of last season and will play plenty again. But team
officials want to try to keep Dwight healthy by reducing his
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight is 5 feet 8. ``That's why a guy like (6-foot-5 reserve
receiver Brian) Finneran can beat some guys deep,'' Chandler said,
``just because he can catch a ball over somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, the 11th of 12 children from a family in
Jacksonville's infamous Blodgett Homes housing project, never has
been the main man.
</P>
<P>
   He was a ninth-round draft choice of the Oilers in `91 but was
traded to San Diego. There, Martin was the primary receiver,
including the 1994 season when the Chargers went to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego cut Jefferson for salary reasons, Bill Parcells signed
him to a contract with the Patriots in `96, and he went to another
Super Bowl. But rookie receiver Terry Glenn was the star that
season.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson has been compared with Martin. Falcons wide receiver
Terance Mathis said to forget such comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret Tony and I have had the best relationship so
far,'' Mathis said. ``Now, Shawn and I are developing a good
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair that everybody keeps saying, `Is this guy going
to fill Tony's shoes, be the next Tony?' Shawn is his own person.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Reeves likes that person. ``We're using him some in the
slot, too,'' the coach said. ``The thing is, he's an extremely hard
worker, and that helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson knows no other way. In a 144-game career, he has
missed one game, because of a concussion. The co-owner of ``Any
Occasion Catering'' in Marietta, he also has been successful
investing for himself on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this league, you have to do things (all out),'' Jefferson
once told the Boston Globe. ``Any play could be your last. When I
walk away from this game, I don't want to be able to say, 'I could
have done this,' or, 'I could have done that.' ``

ECCENTRIC AND EXTREME, JENNINGS SEES `NO LIMITS, NO BOUNDARIES' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Gabe Jennings grew up in a wilderness
community in northern California where his home was one of the few
with indoor plumbing, electricity came from generators and
television was nonexistent. He never watched the Olympic track and
field trials or the Summer Games until four years ago, when his
family had moved to Madison, Wis., and he was a senior in high
school, working in a running-shoe store.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my first taste of the Olympics,'' Jennings said. ``I
remember dreaming about where I would be in four years. All kids
with aspirations do that. But it's one thing to dream. It's quite
another thing to make your dreams come true.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, using a punishing kick that began with 550 meters
left in the 1,500-meter race, Jennings surged to the front and
never relinquished his lead at the Olympic trials, winning in a
personal-best 3 minutes 35.90 seconds. He is also the collegiate
1,500-meter champion from Stanford who, at 21, is the most visible
symbol of an encouraging emergence of young American
middle-distance runners.
</P>
<P>
   He runs with shuffling strides, speaks in jazzy riffs, which
befits a music major, and is often referred to as a throwback to
the 1960s because of his counterculture nature. He has been known
to sleep on the roof of his co-op at Stanford, wear a flowing
Moroccan robe around campus and attend his classes in bare feet.
Last week, in an online column for Runners World magazine, he
ranted about everything from his training to his bowel movements.
He credited his victory here to the energy of a full moon and said
that his emergence from a bout of depression earlier this season
came from consorting with nature, which should not be surprising
for a guy whose middle name is Harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the earth, the wind, the trees,'' Jennings said. ``I
feel its spirit. It puts me in the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   He resists easy categorizing, however. The laid-back hippie
image is popular but incorrect. More accurately, he is a sort of
type-A Maynard G. Krebs, emotional, highly driven, wildly elated
over success and badly discouraged over defeat, which is the most
attractive and troubling aspect about his personality, according to
his coach, Vin Lananna.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings once injured the band of connective tissue that runs
down the outside of his legs from clasping bongo drums tightly for
hours. To become proficient enough to major in music at Stanford,
he played the keyboard six hours a day until he wrenched his back.
Wanting to run like a Kenyan, he began trying to train like a
Kenyan, logging more than 100 miles a week as a sophomore and
developing shinsplints. And he is the rare athlete to injure
himself by running too aggressively in a pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gabe is a man of extremes,'' Lananna said. ``He strives for
perfection. You worry about stuff like that. Every time, you might
not be able to be first or get the world record. There's a
difference between shooting for this and being devastated if it
doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Lananna, a native of Brooklyn, has decided to temper his young
runner's obsessive training but not to rein in his aspirations for
greatness. Stanford has become the epicenter for a revival of hope
for American distance running. Jennings' teammate Michael Stember
finished third in the 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Too much time is spent complaining that environmental, genetic
and sociological reasons prevent Americans from competing with
Africans and other runners, Lananna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finally coming to accept in the U.S. that the bar is not
going to get lower and we need to step up,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   That step will require a giant leap to the next rung of
international competitiveness. ``I feel reborn, ready to run with
the big guys,'' Jennings said. Despite his breakthrough performance
on Sunday, though, he is nearly 10 full seconds behind the world
record-holder and Olympic favorite in the metric mile, Hicham
el-Guerrouj of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm running for the silver medal now,'' he said today
after being told of el-Guerrouj's enervating training regimen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the success of Jennings is not so unlikely as it might
sound. He grew up in Forks of Salmon, Calif., on the Salmon River
in Klamath National Forest, where the family chopped its own wood
for heat and grew its own food in a garden. His parents, Jim and
Suzanne Jennings, were teachers at the community school. Once a
year, Gabe said, youngsters from three area communities
participated in what was called the River Olympics, which included
picnic events like three-legged races but also serious running
events. To train for the yearly competition, Gabe said he ran about
two miles to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad said, `If you want to be good, you've got to run to
school every day,''' Gabe said.
</P>
<P>
   The family moved to Wisconsin when Gabe was 13, first to
Jefferson, then to Madison, the capital, which has its own thriving
counterculture scene. He played quarterback in junior high, then
began running full time when the family moved to Madison, ``where
the whole city doesn't revolve around Saturday night football
games.'' He won nine state titles, ran a 4:02.81 mile and received
a scholarship to Stanford.

<P>
   ``People who know me don't see it as conflict,'' Jennings said
of his running and his lifestyle. ``The media tries to categorize
me, call me hippie, alternative. I work hard. My social life and
beliefs don't interfere with my running or get in the way of my
training.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, he said, he awakened to find his foot tapping
and realized it would be his day. He took his customary nap before
the race and awakened so overcome with happiness that he said he
began crying. ``I felt like I had already won the race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With his parents banging drums in the stands, Jennings crossed
the finish line first, took off his spikes and heard Lananna say,
``Jennings, put your shoes on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But coach, I already ran the race,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as he began the formal processing for the American
Olympic team at a local hotel, Jennings wore a gauzy shirt and
jeans and carried his slippers in his hand, the soles of his bare
feet as black as chimney soot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bourgeoisie lifestyle makes my skin itch,'' Jennings said.
``I feel a need not to fit the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Running for him seems as free as the wilderness that he grew up
in, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no limits,'' he said, ``no boundaries, no fields, no
courts to cage you in.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he did make one recent concession, he admitted, as a
friend approached and congratulated him on the shaving of his
goatee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to go a little more mainstream,'' Jennings said with a
laugh. &QL;

BUSH SUPPORTS LAW THAT BANS 
EXECUTION OF PREGNANT WOMEN 
 

</HEADLINE>

and PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle

<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Answering a question over which his
Democratic opponent had stumbled, George W. Bush on Monday said
that he supports a little-known federal law that prohibits pregnant
women from being executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a second life involved,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Republican presidential candidate is a strong
supporter of the death penalty, he added: ``No matter what your
position is on abortion or on the death penalty, you shouldn't put
a pregnant woman to death.''
</P>
<P>
   The question and the response were largely academic because few
pregnant women end up on death row and no executions in the United
States are carried out within the nine-month term of a normal
pregnancy. But the responses of the two presidential candidates
contrasted almost as sharply as their opposing views on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The question was initially asked of Vice President Al Gore on
Sunday by moderator Tim Russert during a discussion of abortion on
NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what you're talking about,'' Gore initially
replied when Russert asked him about the federal ban on putting
pregnant women to death.
</P>
<P>
   However on Monday, Gore said he had read the law.
</P>
<P>
   He said he supports it, even though he knows of no case in which
it would apply since it takes more than nine months for the death
penalty to be carried out, and that the condemned are not allowed
contact visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do support that statute because the principle of a woman's
right to choose governs in that case,'' Gore said at a news
conference in his campaign headquarters in Nashville, Tenn. ``I
don't know of any real case where that has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The provision was enacted in 1994 as part of a federal law that
expanded the death penalty to numerous federal crimes. The
legislation was signed into law by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't know what the circumstances would be in that
situation. I would, you know, it's an interesting fact situation,''
Gore added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush both support the death penalty, but they differ on
abortion. Gore supports abortion rights, and Bush opposes them.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter asked Bush about Gore's Sunday response while the
Texas governor was campaigning in Clinton's home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised that my opponent was unable to take a position
on that issue,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, Bush said he was narrowing his list of
prospective running mates but noted he still hadn't decided on a
vice presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   While in Little Rock, Bush visited a private, nonprofit agency
providing services to children and families. He said that, if
elected president, he would urge all the states to establish
paternity registries, similar to what some states, including Texas
and Arkansas, already have.
</P>
<P>
   Paternity registries help protect the rights of unmarried
fathers who want to claim responsibility for their children. But a
father who fails to register within 30 days of a child's birth can
have his parental rights terminated, which can allow an adoption to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, after a short, rousing speech encouraging campaign workers
in Nashville to jump whole-heartedly into his race, called a news
conference to attack Bush's record in dealing with Texas' budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the state's surplus had decreased from $6.4 billion in
1999 to $350 million (legislative leaders say $390 million) today,
Gore said: ``The same thing that he has done to the surplus in
Texas would be done, and more, to the surplus that we have in our
nation, just by taking the proposals that he has put out so far.``
</P>
<P>
   Gore's staff also distributed photocopies of a Washington Post
column written by one of Bush's top economic advisers, Harvard
economist Martin Feldstein.
</P>
<P>
   Gore used the column to point out that Feldstein had conceded
that Bush's Social Security plan would require the system to go
into a deficit for the first time in its 65-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, when the Social Security trust fund `runs dry,' his
words, they will start borrowing for the Social Security trust
fund. Read it for yourself in black and white,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bush's plan, which would give retirees 2 percentage
points of their Social Security payments to invest in the stock
market, would put the Social Security trust fund as much as $3
trillion in debt.

GEORGIA SENATOR UNDERGOES BRAIN SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia, a top Senate
Republican leader, underwent brain surgery for a cerebral
hemorrhage Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, which relieved pressure caused by the bleeding,
was performed by Dr. Gary Gropper at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta,
Coverdell's hometown. Gropper described the two-hour procedure as a
success but said it was still unclear whether the 61-year-old
senator would experience any lasting effects from the hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell is in serious condition and will remain in the
intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think over the next 48 hours we'll have a better idea how
he's doing,'' Gropper said at a hospital news conference where he
was joined by Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a heart surgeon who is a
close friend of Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell arrived at the hospital on Saturday evening after
severe headaches. Tests found the hemorrhage, in his temporal lobe,
and doctors ordered the surgery Monday after his condition
deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital spokeswoman, Nina Montanaro, said Coverdell did not
lose consciousness or suffer any seizures that she knew of before
the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The industrious and self-effacing Coverdell was elected to the
Senate in 1992 and quickly climbed the ranks of the Republican
leadership. He is secretary of the Republican conference, No. 4
among the leadership, and a confidant of the majority leader, Sen.
Trent Lott of Mississippi. Before coming to Capitol Hill, he was a
longtime minority leader of the Georgia Senate, chairman of the
Georgia Republican Party and director of the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell serves as Senate liaison to Gov. George W. Bush, the
presumed Republican presidential nominee, and had spent the last
few weeks preparing for the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia.

MARKET PLACE: INVESTOR'S DOUBLE TAKE ON GENERAL MILLS' PLAN FOR
PILLSBURY

 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In announcing that it would pay $10.5 billion for
Pillsbury, General Mills served notice Monday that it wanted to be
the king of convenience foods, an important area for time-pressed
consumers and the companies that want their business.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street turned the tables on General Mills, putting
pressure on the company to make the deal with Diageo, the owner of
Pillsbury, pay off. Concerns about the bite the acquisition will
take out of earnings for the foreseeable future caused investors to
push down General Mills' share price by $2.6875, or 7.4 percent, to
$33.625.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly distressing was the company's forecast of a 20
percent reduction in earnings for the next two years. While
investors had expected earnings of $2.20 a share in fiscal 2001,
they will get $1.73, estimated John McMillin, a food stocks analyst
at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock is down because when General Mills shareholders saw
that 20 percent hit, they felt like they needed one of Diageo's
stiffest drinks,'' McMillin said. With Pillsbury off its books and
a partial spinoff of Burger King under way, Diageo becomes a
company focused on its global liquor and beer businesses. Diageo's
American depository receipts gained 62.5 cents, to $36.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Sanger, chairman and chief executive of General Mills,
said the combination would make the company the fifth-biggest food
maker in the United States, with more than 80 percent of its
products in the convenience-food or quick-preparation categories.
He also predicted that it would add to earnings in 2004 through
product innovation, international expansion, a doubling of the
company's food-service business and savings from streamlining
production and purchasing. Sanger said he planned to keep all the
brands, except for the Pillsbury cake mixes and Green Giant canned
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Sacrificing some earnings along the way to a sound strategic
goal can be palatable to investors if a company is in a rapidly
growing industry. But in the food industry, where growth of 5
percent is respectable these days, the specter of diminished
earnings made investors uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to hearing that from Amazon, but that is not what you
want to hear from a food maker,'' said Daniel Peris, a stock
analyst with Argus Research who downgraded General Mills. ``When
investing in a food company, one is looking for stability.''
</P>
<P>
   General Mills is already a player in the cereal, cake mix,
yogurt and meal-preparation-mix areas of the supermarket, where its
brands include Lucky Charms, Betty Crocker, Yoplait and Hamburger
Helper. The merger will give it a presence in some other aisles,
with products like Green Giant frozen vegetables, Progresso soups,
Pillsbury ready-to-bake biscuits and Haagen-Dazs ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   The combination would seem to make a stronger company. But some
analysts and investors are concerned that fitting all those new
elements into the corporation will take up much of management's
attention _ maybe more than they bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   ``There remains skepticism about whether General Mills can
really use this acquisition to grow its top line,'' said Erika
Gritman Long, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. ``People are very
focused on what Pillsbury's been able to do. The data the company
gave was that it grew 1 percent, while the rest of the category
grew 4 percent. It has lagged its own category.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the deal represents the so-called second stage in
food-company consolidation. In the first stage, top companies like
Bestfoods and Nabisco were swept up for premium prices. Now, with
companies of similar size pairing off to improve their competitive
position against behemoths, the task gets more complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``These mergers of equals are going to require work,'' McMillin
said. ``I do think this will build a better General Mills, but they
are having to take a step back. There were people in the room today
at the analysts' meeting who were wondering, `Are they marrying the
girl next door just because she's the girl next door? Or were they
really dying to get their hands on the Doughboy?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sanger said he was enthusiastic about the Pillsbury lineup and
was convinced the market would share his enthusiasm once the news
was absorbed. There is a $642 million bet riding on that. Under
terms of the deal, General Mills has to pay just $4.5 billion in
cash, together with $5.4 billion in stock, if the share price
reaches $42.55 within a year after the deal closes in December. If
the price is $38 a share or lower, it pays $5.1 billion in cash,
along with the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bet that doesn't look too good out of the gate,''
McMillin said. ``But it's a creative way to share the potential
benefits down the road.''

 &HT;    Georgia Sen. Coverdell has surgery to stop cerebral bleeding
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett and Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., underwent two hours of
emergency surgery Monday to stop bleeding in his brain after
suffering a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, 61, was listed in serious condition at Piedmont
Hospital and was in the intensive care unit, where doctors said he
will remain indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors declined to predict Coverdell's prognosis for recovery,
adopting what they termed a ``wait-and-see'' approach during the
next 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to give the senator a little bit of time to
recover and get over all of this,'' said Dr. Gary Gropper, who
diagnosed Coverdell's cerebral hemorrhage and performed the
surgery. ``It's a serious condition. Any time that you have a
cerebral hemorrhage and you require my services, it's serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Coverdell's condition was life-threatening, Gropper
said, ``I think it's very serious and something we'll have to keep
a close eye on.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Coverdell's office received anxious words of
support from
</P>
<P>
   Senate colleagues, and staff members fielded calls from
concerned constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was rushed to Piedmont Hospital in an ambulance about
10 p.m. Saturday after complaining of severe headaches Doctors
performed tests Sunday but his condition worsened, prompting
doctors to operate at 11 a.m. Monday to stop the bleeding and
relieve pressure building inside Coverdell's skull.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of Coverdell's family, doctors and the senator's
staff released few details about the extent of the bleeding and the
specifics of the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's aides said he had worked part of the day Saturday,
but declined to offer any details about how and when he first
experienced symptoms, or when doctors diagnosed the cerebral
hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., who is a heart surgeon, rushed to
Atlanta on Monday to be with Coverdell's wife, Nancy, and field a
few questions about Coverdell's condition at a 3 p.m. news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family and others have obviously reached out and asked
that we don't go into too much interpretation and personal
details,'' Frist said. ``What's important is that we are at a
wait-and-see.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Gropper, doctors operated on a blood clot in one of
Coverdell's temporal lobes, a portion of the brain that controls
visual recognition, auditory perception, memory and emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Patients can and do recover from cerebral hemorrhages, but the
extent of recovery depends on how much bleeding occurred and in
what part of the brain, according to Dr. Laligam Sekhar, a
professor of neurosurgery at George Washington University Medical
Center in Washington. ``If the patient is diagnosed quickly enough,
then we can perform surgery to relieve the pressure by removing the
blood clot and stopping the bleeding,'' Sekhar said. ``General
recovery is excellent, although the person may still have some
effects as a result of the location of the hemorrhage.'' Doctors
said Coverdell suffered no pre-existing condition that they were
aware of that might have caused the hemorrhaging.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor Monday, senators called Coverdell a
dedicated and hard-working member of Congress and offered prayers
for a quick recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of a senator that works any harder, that has a
more indomitable spirit,'' said Sen. Trent Lott, R-Tenn., the
majority leader. ``Our thoughts and our prayers are with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who tapped Coverdell last year to
serve on his presidential steering committee, sent his ``love and
best wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We pray for a successful outcome to today's surgery and look
forward to his continuing service to Georgia and the nation,'' said
Bush. Coverdell served as Peace Corps director in the
administration of Bush's father, President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's staff reacted with shock and visible concern as the
severity of his condition became known. The senator was known for
frequently working 12-, 14- and 16-hour days, including weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just all praying and keeping him in our prayers,'' said
Heather Hammerstrom of Duluth, Coverdell's receptionist at his
Washington office. Gov. Roy Barnes, who served with Coverdell in
the state Senate, called Coverdell's family before the senator went
into surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prayerful and hopeful that Paul will recover,'' Barnes
said. ``I wouldn't be writing Paul off. Paul is a strong guy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda _ It was not the most conventional way for an
aspiring president of Uganda to warm up a crowd. But it seemed to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Nasser Ntege Sebaggala said at a rally downtown
recently, ``for welcoming me at the airport when I was coming from
jail in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd rose up in cheers remembering that day in February,
when Sebaggala, 52, a businessman and former mayor of Kampala,
arrived home after serving one year of a 15-month federal prison
term for passing bad checks in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers were uprooted along the route from the airport and
strewn on the road. He took six hours to travel a distance that
normally might last an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Sebaggala has become a political phenomenon in Uganda, despite
his obvious flaws. He is a convicted fraud. He is not
well-educated.
</P>
<P>
   His English is not only atrocious but comical. One of the
national newspapers cruelly ran a verbatim transcript of an
interview in English not long after he came home. His native tongue
is Luganda, the language of Uganda's largest ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   He is popular because of his flaws, not to mention a well-honed
populist touch. In the same way that some Americans may see a bit
of themselves in Bill Clinton's indiscretions, some Ugandans who
feel left behind in the nation's slow economic revival embrace the
entire package of Sebaggala. They actually like the idea that he
may have stolen $44,000 in one of the world's richest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Sebaggala,'' Mark Mukiibi, 25, a teacher, said at the
rally. ``He knows the people of the Uganda. He understand the
problems of Ugandans.''
</P>
<P>
   Mukiibi dismissed any suggestion that Sebaggala's stint in
prison might make it hard for him to run for president. ``That was
a very short time,'' he said. ``It was not even a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether Sebaggala can, in fact, translate that
popularity into the presidency. Early next year, Ugandans will
elect a leader for only the third time in 21 years. If he runs _
and he says he will _ Sebaggala will face President Yoweri
Museveni, who is his opposite in nearly every way.
</P>
<P>
   Museveni, in office since he fought his way to power in 1986,
graduated from Dar es Salaam University in Tanzania and is able to
make campaign speeches into little history lessons. His English is
flawless. He is a military man, while Sebaggala is a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Museveni's career was in many ways formed against the
dictatorship of Idi Amin in the 1970s, while Sebaggala's businesses
did quite well then.
</P>
<P>
   Museveni is often given credit for turning Uganda around after
the ravages of Amin and another dictator, Milton Obote. But many
people say Sebaggala's popularity is a reflection of the things
still undone in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty and unemployment are still high. Uganda's involvement in
the war in neighboring Congo is unpopular. Many people are tired of
Museveni after 14 years in office and would like the political
system, a so-called no-party state, opened up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much cynicism'' about Museveni, said Charles
Onyango-Obbo, the editor of The Monitor, an independent national
newspaper. ``They are just throwing Sebaggala in his face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People were laughing at him'' when he first returned home,
Onyango-Obbo said of Sebaggala. ``He couldn't speak proper English.
But it's made him terribly popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Sebaggala, one of 23 children in a Muslim family of several
wives, began his career as a sales representative of a dairy
company in the early 1970s. In 1973 he started a textile company
and became one of the leading businessmen in Kampala, as black
Africans took over the economy after Amin expelled the ethnic
Indian business class in the early 1970s. He was mentioned in
newspaper articles as Uganda's youngest millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, he beat the incumbent mayor of Kampala,
Christopher Iga, who was backed strongly by Museveni, in a vote
seen as a rebuke to the president. Soon after his election, he
attended a conference on garbage disposal in the United States and
ended up arrested in Boston. He was charged with passing eight
fraudulent traveler's checks worth $44,000 and was convicted in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In Uganda, trafficking in fake currencies and traveler's checks
became a way of life for a certain class of businessman as Museveni
liberalized the economy and foreign exchange in the late 1980s. But
Sebaggala, who opened a foreign exchange business in 1992, denied
that he had done anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview he said that among $2.5 million in deposits he
had made in the Bank of Boston were some bad traveler's checks that
a few customers had passed him without his knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say you can't put me as responsible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prison term only made his legend grow. He was released in
December 1999, and his homecoming was a national event. He made his
political ambitions clear as soon as he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am no longer a businessman,'' he said at the time. ``I am a
full-time politician.'' Then the next day: ``I have come not only
to liberate this country but to bring a revolution. If I am
arrested you should not demand for my bail, because most people
cannot afford the bail fee.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has campaigned around Uganda, at one point being
shot at by government soldiers in the town of Mbarara, in what the
government said was a mistake and Sebaggala says was an attempt on
his life. He was a strong supporter of a boycott of the referendum
held in June on whether to continue Museveni's ``no party'' system.
</P>
<P>
   For all his talk of revolution, Sebaggala is not proposing
anything especially radical. He wants a return to multiparty
politics. He wants to increase the use of irrigation in farming,
which employs more than 80 percent of Ugandans. He wants to attract
more foreign business, particularly technology companies. He says
he would expand education.
</P>
<P>
   He said many of his political ideas had come from his time in
the United States, which he said he admired very much despite the
prison term. There is one area especially in which he would like
Uganda to be more like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always when I am in campaign I mention your countrymen, like
George Washington,'' he said. ``You remember that they tried to put
him for a third term? He said it was enough and the young
generation should take over. What he did was great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give the example that the more than 40 presidents, they
relinquished power and have been buried in America. None of them
went into exile.''
</P>
<P>
   In Uganda, since independence from Britain in 1963, every
president has gone into exile. If all goes well, he would like to
make Museveni the first not to.

WHITE HOUSE TO PROPOSE BILL FOR REGULATING ELECTRONIC
SURVEILLANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN LABATON with MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House said on Monday that it would
propose legislation to set legal requirements for surveillance in
cyberspace by law enforcement authorities similar in some ways to
those for telephone wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates and civil liberties groups welcomed some
aspects of the proposal but said they remained alarmed about a new
FBI computer system that searches and intercepts private e-mail and
can easily capture communications of people not suspected of
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative proposal was made as the administration also
announced on Monday that it had eased export controls on encryption
technology, making it significantly easier for American companies
to sell software products to the European Union and eight other
trading partners that can be used to keep computer data and
communications secure.
</P>
<P>
   Both the electronic surveillance proposal and the export control
changes are part of a broader policy outlined in a speech on Monday
by John Podesta, the White House chief of staff. He said the policy
attempts to balance the privacy rights of computer users against
the needs of law enforcement to be able to monitor digital
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and federal regulators have done little work in the
area, even as the world has quickly come to rely heavily on
communications through cyberspace. More than 1.4 billion e-mails
now change hands every day.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's legislative proposal on electronic
surveillance attempts to fix the inconsistent patchwork of laws
that apply different standards to telephone, cable and other
technologies with a single standard for those systems and the
Internet. Until now, law enforcement agencies have been able to
monitor electronic communication with only modest court
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation would require that the same standards
that apply to the interception of the content of telephone calls
apply to the interception of e-mail. Specifically, it would require
law enforcement agents to demonstrate that they have probable cause
of a crime in order to obtain a court order seeking the contents of
a suspect's e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also give federal magistrates greater
authority to review requests by law enforcement authorities for
so-called pen registers _ lists of the phone numbers called from a
particular location and the time of the calls. The magistrates now
have no authority to question the request for such lists, which are
frequently used by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of the Internet, existing laws are ambiguous
about what standards apply for different kinds of surveillance.
Many limitations imposed on law enforcement in the context of
telephone wiretaps _ such as the requirement that such taps be
approved at the highest level of the Justice Department _ do not
appear to apply to e-mail surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Cable Act of 1984 sets a far harder burden for
government agents to satisfy when attempting to monitor computers
using cable modems than when monitoring telephones. That has proved
troublesome for law enforcement authorities as more Americans begin
to use high-speed Internet service through cable networks. The
Cable Act also requires that the target of the surveillance be
given notice and an opportunity to challenge the request.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to update and harmonize our existing laws to give
all forms of technology the same legislative protections as our
telephone conversations,'' Podesta said in a speech at the National
Press Club. ``Our proposed legislation would harmonize the legal
standards that apply to law enforcement's access to e-mails,
telephone calls and cable services.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he took his job as the top staff official at the White
House, Podesta was a law professor who wrote a book, ``Protecting
Electronic Messaging.'' He has spent months trying to broker a
compromise between the competing views of industry, privacy groups,
law enforcement agencies and lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said on Monday that they hoped the
proposal would break a logjam in Congress where a variety of
different measures have been introduced dealing with electronic
surveillance. The administration's proposal adopts some elements of
both Democratic and Republican bills.
</P>
<P>
   But congressional aides said there was too little time left in
the legislative session and that the matter would in all likelihood
remain unresolved until after the next Congress convenes in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the proposal would apply to
communications that either begin or end in the United States. It
would not apply to e-mail transmitted entirely outside of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy and civil liberties groups criticized the
administration's proposal because it would continue to permit the
government to use a new surveillance system that the groups say may
be used far more broadly than older technologies, enabling federal
agents to monitor an unlimited amount of innocent communications,
including those of people who are not the targets of criminal
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI surveillance system is called Carnivore, so named agents
say because it is able to quickly get the ``meat'' in huge
quantities of e-mail, instant messaging and other communications
between computers.
</P>
<P>
   It is housed in a small black box and consists of hardware and
software that trolls for information after being connected to the
network of an Internet service provider. Once installed, it has the
ability to monitor all of the e-mail on a network, from the list of
what mail is sent to the actual content of the communication.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus C. Thomas, section chief of the Cyber Technology Section
of the FBI, said the technology ws developed 18 months ago by FBI
engineers and has been used fewer than 25 times. Thomas said that
Carnivore has potentially broad capabilities and that he
understands the concerns of privacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can do a ton of things,'' he said. ``That's why it's
illegal to do so without a clear order from the court.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that most Internet service providers had cooperated with
requests to use Carnivore.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy groups and some Internet service providers have been
deeply critical of the use of Carnivore because, once installed on
a network, it permits the government to take whatever information
it wants.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the government has not said what it does with the
extraneous material it gathers that is not relevant to the
particular surveillance.

 WASHINGTON: particular surveillance.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The issue does not often arise today with the monitoring of
telephone conversations because when a law enforcement authority
wants to see a list of telephone calls made by a suspect, the agent
gets an order from a magistrate, presents the order to a telephone
company, and the company then turns over the list.
</P>
<P>
   In at least one instance, an Internet company did not cooperate
so readily with the government. In December, federal marshals
approached EarthLink _ a service provider with 4.2 million
subscribers _ with a court order permitting them to deploy a device
to register time, date and source information involving email sent
to and from a specified account.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned the device would record broader information, EarthLink
countered with a compromise: it would provide the government with
the requested information about e-mail senders and recipients,
according to Robert Corn-Revere, a lawyer for EarthLink, in recent
congressional testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Corn-Revere said that the government ultimately accepted the
compromise, but later became dissatisfied and wished to use its own
device. But a federal court rejected the company's request.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet companies have also been critical of Carnivore.
</P>
<P>
   William L. Schrader, chairman and chief executive of PsiNet, a
major commercial Internet service provider, said that the system
gives the FBI the ability to monitor e-mail of every person on a
given network. He said he would refuse to permit the government to
use the technology at PsiNet unless the agents could prove that it
could only sift out the traffic from a given individual that is the
target of a court order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I object to American citizens and any citizens of the world
always being subject to someone monitoring their email,'' said
Schrader, whose company serves about 100,000 business and more than
10 million users. ``I believe it's unconstitutional and I'll wait
for the Supreme Court to force me to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups, meanwhile, said that Monday's policy
announcement was an inadequate response to the growing controversy
over the deployment of Carnivore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's speech was camouflage to cover the mess that is
Carnivore,'' said Barry Steinhardt, an associate director of the
American Civil Liberties Union. ``In light of the public and
congressional criticism of Carnivore, we had hoped and expected far
more from an Administration that likes to tout its sensitivity to
privacy rights. Rather than glossing over Carnivore, Podesta should
have announced that the administration was suspending its use.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing growing concerns about Carnivore, Attorney General Janet
Reno said last Thursday that she would review whether the system is
being used consistent with privacy rights in the Constitution and
federal law. A subcommittee of the House is set to hold a hearing
next week on the system.
</P>
<P>
   While the civil liberties and privacy groups applauded giving
judges greater discretion to review certain kinds of requests for
surveillance, they were critical of other aspects of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, a research organization that studies privacy issues and
technology, criticized the administration for lowering the
standards for surveillance of cable modems rather than raising the
standards for telephone surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cable Act provides for one of the best privacy protections
in the United States,'' Rotenberg said. ``The question is whether
to harmonize up or harmonize down. Our view this harmonizes down.''
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials said the Cable Act never
contemplated that there would be broad use of cable modems for
e-mail traffic and that the standards used for obtaining warrants
for telephone surveillance should also apply to digital
communications through cable networks.

 &HT;    Coverdell's type of stroke less common but more serious
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The bleeding in the brain that sent Sen. Paul
Coverdell into emergency surgery Monday is the less common of two
types of injury arising from problems with circulation in the
brain. But it is often more serious.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the 750,000 strokes that occur each year in the
United States are ischemic, caused when an artery to the brain is
blocked by a blood clot or narrowed by deposits on the walls of the
blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell suffered the less common hemorrhagic stroke, the broad
name for several types of bleeding into the brain caused by slow
leakage or sudden rupture of a blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Hemorrhagic stroke accounts for 20 percent of strokes in the
United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hemorrhagic stroke is the deadlier of the two. Mortality with
hemorrhagic stroke is 50 percent, whereas the mortality with
ischemic stroke is around 20 percent,'' said Dr. Michael Frankel,
chief of neurology at Grady Health System and associate professor
of neurology at Emory University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the survivors (of hemorrhagic stroke), a significant number
of people remain with some disability,'' he added, stressing that
he was not familiar with the details of Coverdell's case. ``A
proportion of people can return to work and to their previous level
of functioning, but with them it is the exception, rather than the
rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke have similar symptoms _
weakness on one side of the body, difficulty speaking, balance
problems, confusion, sudden severe headache _ arising from the same
problem, the death of brain tissue. But the mechanics are deeply
different.
</P>
<P>
   The blockage that triggers ischemic stroke starves an area of
the brain of oxygen. In cerebral hemorrhage, bleeding into the
brain, or between the surface of the brain and the membranes lining
the skull, places pressure on brain tissue. The brain responds by
swelling; compression against the unyielding skull causes tissue
death.
</P>
<P>
   Cerebral hemorrhages tend to fall into two categories, Frankel
said. In one, accounting for about 15 percent of strokes, a small
blood vessel that has been overstressed by high blood pressure
tears or gives way, allowing blood to leak out and form a clot that
presses on nearby tissue. In the remaining 5 percent of strokes, an
aneurysm _ a balloon-like outpouching of the wall of one of the
larger arteries of the brain _ suddenly ruptures. That allows
uncontrolled bleeding into or around the brain that may, or may
not, form a clot over the aneurysm site.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid surgery can relieve increased pressure on the brain,
though brain tissue that has died cannot be revived.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery is usually necessary with aneurysms, Frankel said,
because the risk of a secondary rupture is so high: up to 50
percent of patients will have a second bleed from the same defect
within six months if the aneurysm is not repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the most common type of hemorrhage, a hematoma inside the
brain due to high blood pressure, surgeons can go in and take the
clot out,'' he said. ``More often, they will not take it out,
because going in can cause more damage than it will do good.''
</P>
<P>
   Though aspects of hemorrhagic stroke remain mysterious _ it
isn't known, for instance, exactly why some vessels deep in the
brain are particularly vulnerable to leakage _ some risk factors
are well-recognized.
</P>
<P>
   They include uncontrolled high blood pressure (consistently more
than 140/90); alcohol and drug abuse; use of anticoagulant
medications; increased age; and gender. Hemorrhage from aneurysm
rupture is slightly more common in women; deep intracerebral
hemorrhage is more often seen in men.
</P>
<P>
   Race is also a factor: African-Americans are at higher risk of
both types of stroke than whites, probably because they are more
vulnerable to high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to addressing the risk factors that can be
controlled, it is vital to be familiar with the symptoms of stroke
and to respond to them, Frankel said.
</P>
<P>
   In a study he co-authored recently, only one-third of metro
Atlanta residents could identify even one stroke symptom.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you or a family member experience weakness or numbness on
one side of the body, difficulty speaking, severe headache or any
of the other major symptoms, call 911 immediately,'' he said.
``Don't wait for the symptoms to go away. Treat this as you would a
heart attack: Get to the hospital.''

Cowboys ready to begin answering questions
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JODY GOLDSTEIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys had only two head
coaches over their first 34 seasons of existence. But when owner
Jerry Jones met the media Monday for his annual camp-opening news
conference, he had a new face beside him for the third time in
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Switzer lasted four seasons, Chan Gailey only two. But
this time, Jones stayed within the organization with a man he knows
well. Former defensive coordinator Dave Campo celebrates his 53rd
birthday today as he officially opens ``Camp Campo'' with the first
of two-a-day practices.
</P>
<P>
   How well Campo performs in his new role is one of the questions
the Cowboys will at least begin to answer over a five-week training
camp at Midwestern State University.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest questions involve the offense, which finished as
only the 16th-best in the NFL last year after losing receiver
Michael Irvin to what became a career-ending neck injury. The
Cowboys also lost longtime fullback Daryl Johnston to a recurring
neck injury, and he too retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect our coaches, with Dave's leadership, to step up and
add an element of leadership to take up some of the slack of not
having some of those veteran players around,'' Jones said. ``With
the coaching staff and veteran players we have now, we must
recognize that there's a void there and do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectations are to have a team that is real exciting
offensively, entertaining offensively. That's the focus. I believe
we have the talent on defense, but our challenge in this camp is to
really get this thing going offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo's tenure as defensive coordinator makes him the perfect
tutor for the offense, having spent his career studying offenses
and devising ways to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm well aware that offenses bring people into the stands, and
I'm well aware what offenses mean in this league,'' Campo said.
``There's no question that when you look around the league, the
team that scores the most points wins. So I'm excited to get over
there, and I really feel like I have a good knowledge of the type
of things you need to do offensively to make it hard on a defense.
You've got to know how to take advantage of your personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Other questions:
</P>
<P>
   1) How will Dallas handle life without The Playmaker? As a rule,
the Cowboys have struggled without Irvin in the lineup, be it
because of injuries or suspensions. But this time they're better
prepared after acquiring the speedy Joey Galloway in the offseason
to complement Rocket Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   2) Who will step up in place of cornerback Deion Sanders? Not
only did he defect, but he went to the division-rival Washington
Redskins, who have built an imposing team over the last couple of
offseasons. Former Brown Ryan McNeil has had four jobs in a
seven-year career, none more pressure-filled than taking Sanders'
former slot.
</P>
<P>
   3) Was it the offense or the quarterback? It was no secret Troy
Aikman wasn't comfortable in Gailey's offense, but now he's gotten
his wish. The Cowboys are returning to the basic packages that made
Aikman a perennial Pro Bowler and earned him three Super Bowl
rings. Now he needs to put up the numbers and prove he's still
capable.
</P>
<P>
   4) What's left in Emmitt Smith's legs? It has to be asked every
year of the 31-year-old running back, who has 3,592 carries over a
10-year career. His 1,397-yard 1999 season proved he's not ready
for the rocking chair, but wear begins taking its toll on all
athletes at some point.
</P>
<P>
   5) Can a big heart make up for small stature on an every-play
basis? Dat Nguyen had a knack for always being around the football
during his college days at Texas A&AMP;M and his Cowboys rookie season,
in which he played mostly in nickel situations. How will the 5-11
middle linebacker perform against his larger counterparts on a
regular basis? The Cowboys have penciled him in as the starter in
the position often referred to as ``quarterback of the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   6) How successful was the 2000 draft? Four of the Cowboys' 1999
draft picks are listed as likely starters this year. Besides Nguyen
at middle linebacker, Solomon Page is expected to start at right
guard, Ebenezer Ekuban will start at right defensive end, and end
Peppi Zellner could start on the left side (while Greg Ellis
continues to rehabilitate a broken leg).
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys didn't have a first-round pick this year, but there
are spots where rookies could make an immediate impact. Keep an eye
on defensive backs Dwayne Goodrich and Kareem Larrimore.
</P>
<P>
   7) Can the offense rebound? Aikman's displeasure and the loss of
several receivers to injury led to a floundering offense. James
McKnight should be back, as should Wane McGarity. Add Galloway,
Ismail and the emerging Jason Tucker, and there should be plenty of
talent.
</P>
<P>
   8) Will the Cowboys be more disciplined? Dallas led the league
in penalties last year, and this area will be emphasized in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   9) Can the Cowboys improve outside Texas Stadium? They didn't
win on the road after the season opener at Washington and are 6-18
in road games over the last three years. Couple that with a
schedule that has them packing their bags four times over the first
six weeks, and that improvement had better come quickly.
</P>
<P>
   10) The Cowboys beat the Redskins twice last year, but
Washington ran away with the NFC East title. The Redskins have
added the second and third picks of the draft and opened the bank
for Sanders, making them the preseason favorites for a repeat
division title and more.

GENERAL MILLS TO ACQUIRE IT PILLSBURY, ITS LONGTIME NEIGHBOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Britain) (See also GEN-MILLS-MARKETPLACE column) 
 &HT;     By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ They grew up together on the banks of the
Mississippi River, two 19th century milling companies that competed
head to head and made this city the flour capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their decades-old signs still face each other across the river
in symbolic combat _``Gold Medal Flour,'' from General Mills, on
the west bank, and ``Pillsbury's Best'' on the east. On Monday,
though, General Mills and Pillsbury said they were uniting to
create a food giant with more than $12 billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   The initial announcement came from Diageo, the British
conglomerate, that acquired Pillsbury more than a decade ago.
Diageo said early Monday that it had agreed to sell Pillsbury to
General Mills in a $10.5 billion deal, forming the fourth-largest
food company in the world. The merger would bring together such
well-known brands as Cheerios, Wheaties, Haagen-Dazs, Yoplait
yogurt, Hamburger Helper, Jolly Green Giant vegetables and
Pillsbury bakery items, though not all these products would remain
within the new company's stable.
</P>
<P>
   The planned merger comes during afrenzy of big food company
combinations, in which food makers are trying to bolster their
growth prospects through acquisitions and global power plays.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills and Pillsbury now saythey believe that Betty
Crocker and the Pillsbury Doughboy are a good fit and that
marketing and distributing their products together will yield huge
benefits. The companies also say they know each other well, and
their cultures are quite similar, which should make it a friendly
merger.
</P>
<P>
   Though many here worry about the job cuts that are sure to
follow, others are pleased that two companies that grew up together
on the Mississippi will remain in Minneapolis under the General
Mills name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that Pillsbury is being acquired by General
Mills,'' said Sharon Sayles Belton, the mayor of Minneapolis.
``They have a history of strong ties to the community. And I think
General Mills is going to grow. Short term there may be some job
losses, but long term there'll be growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason the concern here is muted is that ownership of
Pillsbury returns to Minneapolis after more than a decade in
London, where the company was controlled by Diageo.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies and their milling stories are really the
signature of Minnesota,'' said Nina Archabal, director of the
Minnesota Historical Society. ``To have these companies joined and
governed in Minnesota is a tremendous benefit to our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after starting out in the flour milling business,
General Mills and Pillsbury took widely divergent paths. They both
created premier brands, with Pillsbury staying closer to bakery
items and General Mills becoming a dominant player in the cereal
business. But they also strayed from their roots.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury acquired Burger King in 1967, helping make it into a
major player in the fast food business, before the two companies
were eventually acquired by Diageo, which specializes in liquor.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills also departed from the flour and ceral business,
gaining control over Izod/Lacoste, the retailers Eddie Bauer and
Talbots, Parker Brothers games and Red Lobster and Olive Garden
restaurants, all of which are now gone.
</P>
<P>
   Only in recent years, after a series of divestitures and
spinoffs, has General Mills sharpened its focus on cereal, bakery
items and yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   Though the company suffered during a period of competitive
price-cutting in the cereal industry in the early 1990s, General
Mills has been a strong performer in most of its businesses over
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently passed Kellogg's as the nation's leading
cereal maker, though the two are neck and neck, and its Yoplait and
Columbo yogurts give it supremacy in the category. General Mills
has also extended its product lines with Frosted Cheerios and Honey
Nut Cheerios as well as Go-Gurt, a squeezable tubed yogurt product
designed for children.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives have also tried to capitalize on health news
to promote their cereals, moving into organic food with the
purchase of Small Planet Foods Inc. They are working on creating
more convenience and instant foods for the growing number of
Americans who are eating on the go.
</P>
<P>
   Because of such innovation, General Mills has largely
outperformed other food companies in the past two years. Most are
facing slow growth prospects in a mature market with increasing
pressure from bigger and bigger retailers. General Mills,
meanwhile, has promised double digit profit growth and Wall Street
had cheered its plans, at least until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the company fell sharply Monday because some analysts
and investors worried that Pillsbury was going to be a drag on
earnings. While the company has a hot food service division and
some healthy profits in refigerated products like Pillsbury dough
items and Haagen-Dazs, canned vegetables and other frozen items
have been a drag.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe General Mills may have felt pressured to
make a deal and been forced to pay too heavily for Pillsbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``They paid a stiff price for this,'' said Art Cecil, a food
industry analyst at T. Rowe Price, which owns a large stake in
General Mills. ``I'd rather they not have done it. I thought Mills
was a great situation. They had great cash flow, innovative
management; it seemed a tidy situation. And now earnings are going
to be diluted by a fairly significant amount.''
</P>
<P>
   John McMillin, a longtime food analyst at Prudential, disagrees.
Though he says General Mills is going to have to do a lot to
convince Wall Street that this is a good deal, he believes the
company is moving aggressively to build a giant food portfolio
after more than a decade of trying to slim down and get out of
restaurant and nonfood businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Mills has been on a diet for most of the 15 years I've
followed it,'' McMillin said. ``But this deal with Pillsbury gives
them more growth opportunities, and growth is a rare commodity in
the food industry.''

</P>
<P>
   Executives at General Mills say that for antitrust reasons the
new company, which will be called General Mills, will divest itself
of Pillsbury's dessert business, which is second only to General
Mills'. The company will also sell its canned vegetable business,
but keep Green Giant frozen vegetables and meal starters, thereby
retaining the Jolly Green Giant icon.
</P>
<P>
   The company also hopes the Pillsbury Doughboy will fit in well
with marketing efforts that have kept Cheerios and even Betty
Crocker in the public spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the merger makes General Mills not just a much bigger
company, but one that is more diversified in the refigerated
section with ice cream to go with its yogurt and frozen vegetables,
breakfast offerings and more.
</P>
<P>
   Executives say that General Mills' marketing will help boost
Pillsbury brands that are growing at a slower pace than their
categories.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills brands, on the other hand, have been able to grow
faster than their categories, and that is a large part of the
growth story.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind these initiatives will be Steven Sanger, the
54-year-old chief executive at General Mills. Sanger, who took over
in 1995, has said that primary drivers in the food industry will
include increasing convenience (``driven by the pace of consumer
lifestyles,'') concerns about health, and international sales. He
also stresses creating products to be sold outside of supermarkets
and, eventually, the use of biotechnology to create more nutritious
foods.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, General Mills' strength in the past year has been in
marked contrast with Pillsbury's, which has been going through an
earnings slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills has long been considered the bigger and better run
company here in Minneapolis, and some Pillsbury staffers are
wondering what that will mean for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough day here,'' said Dorrese Bona, a 20-year
employee at Pillsbury, as she sat in her cubicle just hours after
the announced merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with changes comes opportunity. General Mills has some
good brands so we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees at Pillsbury were wondering Monday whether they would
be moving just outside of Minneapolis, to Golden Valley, Minn.,
where General Mills headquarters is located on a 50-acre campus.
But company officials said that they had run out of space in Golden
Valley, and Belton of Minneapolis said she was assured that many
Pillsbury employees would remain downtown, in a 40-story office
tower called the Pillsbury Center.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two companies have more than 6,000 employees in
Minnesota, most of them in Minneapolis. The General Mills
headquarters is suburban and breezy, but more corporate; Pillsbury
is urban yet relaxed, with Pillsbury Doughboy dolls on nearly every
desk and the halls decked with the Doughboy and the Jolly Green
Giant standing in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   Though some have called the General Mills corporate culture more
``button down'' and the Pillsbury culture more ``free-wheeling,''
several executives Monday said they were both relaxed and
welcoming, in a Minneapolis kind of way.

MOVIE STUDIOS SUE WEB SITE TO BAN DVD-CRACKING SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY HARMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the first day of a case that could test the limits
of Hollywood's control over its digital properties, lawyers for
eight movie studios on Monday urged a federal judge to stop a Web
site operator from distributing a software program that unscrambles
the encryption on DVD movie disks.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers asked the court to act before the studios suffer the
same fate as record companies, which have seen their
copyright-protected songs traded freely by millions of individual
Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   The studios are trying to show that Eric Corley, publisher of
2600, a computer hacker magazine and Web site, violated copyright
law by posting on his Web site _ and linking to other Web sites
that do the same _ a program that breaks the code called CSS, or
Content Scrambling System, on DVDs. Once the program, known as
DeCSS, is invoked, a movie can be copied and sent across the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat of world copying is here and the process has
begun,'' said Leon Gold, a partner with the New York law firm
Proskauer Rose LLP and lead lawyer for the studios. ``It will
become an avalanche unless this court acts.''
</P>
<P>
   A section of the federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act of
1998 makes it illegal for anyone to offer to the public a device
that is primarily intended to circumvent a technological barrier
controlling access to a copyright-protected work. But Corley's
lawyers argue that the law must be balanced against the First
Amendment concept of ``fair use,'' which allows consumers certain
freedoms with copyrighted works.
</P>
<P>
   The case will determine whether the new technology
``fundamentally means the end of fair use,'' Martin Garbus,
Corley's lead lawyer, said in his opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants have argued that DeCSS is legitimately used to
allow people who already own DVDs to view the disks on computers
running the Linux operating system, which they are unable to do
without descrambling the encryption.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Kaplan, the judge in the case, granted a preliminary
injunction in January requiring Corley to remove DeCSS from his
site.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he heard testimony from the studio's first witness,
Michael Shamos, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon
University.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan came down from the bench to view a laptop computer on
which Shamos showed first a DVD of ``Sleepless in Seattle'' and
then a copy of the DVD that he and an assistant had descrambled
with the DeCSS program and compressed with another program.
</P>
<P>
   Shamos said the practice of using DeCSS to copy movies is on the
rise. ``I believe as long as there's a DVD out there the people
ripping them won't stop until they've all been ripped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But on cross examination, Garbus sought to highlight how
difficult the process is to perform, noting that it took Shamos and
his assistant 20 hours to obtain the compressed, unscrambled
version of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you agree with me that this is very tough stuff?''
Garbus asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not fun,'' Shamos conceded.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE GROWTH OF TRASH-TALKING 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Earlier this week, Inger Miller and Chryste
Gaines sat under a sweltering tent, explaining how they had earned
their place on the Olympic team by finishing second and third,
respectively, in the 100-meter finals.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour earlier Marion Jones had smoked Miller and Gaines
to win the race going away.
</P>
<P>
   When Jones walked in, all lights shifted to her from Miller and
Gaines. Everyone tried their best to make nice.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable question came up about Jones possibly winning
five Olympic gold medals this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Jones forced a smile: ``If I had a penny for every time I was
asked that question, I'd be rich,'' she said. Gaines and Miller
glanced over and said in unison: ``You're not?'' Everyone including
Jones laughed. ``That may have been a bad choice of words,'' Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the mildest form all week of the sort of trash-talking
and sniping that punctuated the sprinting competition among
American runners. The normally stoic Michael Johnson has fired
salvos at Maurice Green and others as a guest columnist. He chided
Green for being less than mature, doubted whether Gaines would even
make the team and questioning Miller's consistency.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Miller said Johnson's braids must have been braided
too tightly.
</P>
<P>
   One can argue that Jones started it all by proclaiming that she
intended to win five gold medals in Sydney _ not five medals, but
five gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Jones, Miller, Green and Johnson, one wondered how
long this sort of wolfing had gone on between the runners? Have
they always talked and challenged and blustered, or is this just
more fallout from the dot-com generation of commodification?
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Green jumped into his car and said the talking is
nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been like this,'' he said. ``Media is just
bringing it out more.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice Coachman sat in her room Monday afternoon thinking about
the spate of trash-talking, contemplating whether trash-talking has
always been like this.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, she said, it has. In the 1948 Games in Paris,
Coachman, a high jumper, became the first African-American woman to
win a gold medal. She was also the only American women to win a
medal that year.
</P>
<P>
   But in the months before the Games, Coachman, who was also an
extraordinary sprinter, was a target, and a couple opponents had
public things to say about beating her. One competitor in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey Patterson,'' she said, referring to a friend and rival
who died in 1996. ``When I first met Mickey she was winning all
these 100-yard dashes and we met either in a meet or at a trial.
Anyway she was going around talking: `I'm going to be Alice
Coachman, she's not that tough. I'm going to beat her.' When I
arrived in San Antonio everybody told me how she'd been going
around talking about how she was going to beat me. I said that's
fine. She tried to beat me, but she couldn't beat me. But she was
the one that was talking about how she was going to beat me, just
like a lot of them are doing to Marion Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the extent of it then,'' Coachman added. ``Now it's a
little different now because money's involved. Everybody's trying
to win, if you don't win that money's not there. Most big companies
won't promote a person who's not a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Smith, the former sprinter who coaches Maurice Green, didn't
totally agree with Coachman. ''It's about `I can beat you'; it's
the same thing you did when you were a kid. I don't want people to
get the idea that it's money that makes athletes talk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Woman have always talked,'' Smith said. ``Before, the media
wouldn't print that. Now they're printing it because it's a
different slant.''
</P>
<P>
   The most peculiar aspect to the so called ``trash-calling'' is
not the athletes talking but the media reaction to the talking. The
same media that despises trash-talking as a signature of massive
cultural dysfunction also embraces it.
</P>
<P>
   Trash-talking becomes a commodity to be marketed like soft
drinks and outer wear. The athletes play into it like kids on the
playground surrounded by an inciting crowd, trying to incite them
into a brawl: ``Athletes are doing nothing new. It was always like,
`Man, I'll beat you.' `Oh, yeah? Watch. Come on out here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Only now, two reporters are standing there, and one
sensationalizes it, and it then becomes a competition between the
media as to who can put out the best sensationalized information to
draw the public's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Coachman wasn't really buying it. She thought there was
something demeaning, belittling about all the trash-talking over
the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Would she be any different if she were competing in the 1990s?
</P>
<P>
   Coachman laughed and said, ``I would have been talking-trash,
too, if money was involved.''

 &HT;    Covington mom in brawl at ball game faces hearing
 &HT;    By Andrea Jones
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA- A Covington, Ga., mother may face criminal charges in
connection with a Saturday fight at a girls softball game that
ended with hospital trips for a player and coach.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lawrence, a coach for her daughter's Girls of Summer team
and wife of a Covington police officer, is scheduled to appear in a
probable cause hearing Aug. 2 after two parents and an umpire filed
applications for her arrest Monday in Newton County Magistrate
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Covington police Capt. Willie Davis said the altercation began
when two 14-year-olds argued over a play at first base during a
tournament at Turner Lake Park. When umpire Steve Hodges stepped in
to separate them, Lawrence and opposing coach Debbie Pugh ran onto
the field and began arguing, police said. Pugh told police Lawrence
grabbed her throat, threw her to the ground and kicked her in the
head.
</P>
<P>
   Police said players and more parents _ about 40 in all _ rushed
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Crawford, mother of the Buford Bomber first baseman, said
Lawrence shoved her head into a pole while she was trying to get
her daughter off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Police and league officials broke up the fray and ejected both
teams from the park.
</P>
<P>
   Pugh sustained minor head injuries and was treated and released
from DeKalb Medical Center. The first baseman was treated for neck
pain and released from Newton General.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time metro parents have come to blows over
children's sports. Cherokee County banned nine adults from a park
after a brawl last year. Coweta County parks ban for life anyone
who fights at county-sponsored events.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hailey, the director of parks and recreation for Newton
County, said the fight never should have happened. ``We're supposed
to be out there for the kids, and it seems like some of us forget
that.''

COMMENTARY: LEBANON: SOUL ON ICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Visiting Beirut for the first time in 16
years, I was asked by Lebanese friends what my impression was. Two
things stand out _ one new and exciting, the other new and
troubling.
</P>
<P>
   What is new is the hardware _ the degree to which Lebanon has
been rebuilt since the civil war ended in 1989. Wow! A new airport,
new highways, new bridges, new offices.
</P>
<P>
   What is troubling is on the software side. Something has been
lost. The fast, freewheeling, entrepreneurial Lebanese spirit,
which sustained this country in time of war and brought people back
as soon as it was over, is deteriorating. Lebanon has always been a
country whose greatest natural export was its people. But the
Lebanese who tended to leave before were skilled workers and
merchants who went to the Persian Gulf or Africa to make money and
return. Now, Lebanon's brightest are leaving for good to the West
and Australia _ driven out by a sense that, as a friend's
14-year-old son put it, ``Lebanon is a place to grow up, but not to
stay.'' How will investors come when Lebanese won't stay?
</P>
<P>
   What's deteriorating Lebanon's software is the combination of a
dead-handed Syrian occupation, continued Lebanese-Lebanese
divisions that make merit-based governance impossible, and a
government leadership that lacks any strategy for bringing Lebanon
into the 21st century. Last week the government tried to raise
taxes on FedEx and DHL to the point that they were nearly ready to
leave Lebanon; if someone sends you a CD here you have to go to
customs personally to sign for it; last year computer imports worth
$2 million were held up because they contained chips from Intel,
which has a factory in Israel. All this in a country that lives on
selling services and brainpower.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years ago the Syrian occupation of Lebanon was on the
streets _ Syrian checkpoints, soldiers and tanks. That has largely
disappeared. But that's because the Syrian occupation has moved
from the streets into the heads of the Lebanese. As the world has
looked away, Lebanon has increasingly become a Syrian province.
Result: less political and press freedom and no major decisions
made without clearance from the Syrians. The number of Lebanese
politicians, statesmen or writers today who will dare to articulate
a distinctly Lebanese national interest, position or vision of the
future _ independent of Syrian interests _ is lower than ever. But
to blame the Syrians alone is unfair. For all their individual
brilliance, Lebanese still have not coalesced into a society that
can produce a coherent modern state and judiciary. They are still
hobbled by religious divides and feudal politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and '60s, Lebanon played a unique role in the Arab
East. Lebanon's fast and entrepreneurial software served as a
critical bridge between the Arabs and the world. But in the age of
globalization just being fast isn't enough. You also need good
governance, rules and the confidence of investors in order to
thrive. That's why Dubai is replacing Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lebanon is like a guy who sold bottled water in the desert for
many years,'' said a former minister. It was a great business. Then
the years passed, and Lebanon continued trying to sell bottled
water, only it found itself competing with full-service
supermarkets in every oasis.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest victims of the deterioration of Lebanon's
software could turn out to be Syria's new president, Bashar Assad.
Syria is desperately in need of a bridge into globalization. It has
no modern banking system or service sector. Lebanon is Syria's
natural bridge. But that bridge is eroding.
</P>
<P>
   The word on the street is that Bashar wants to follow the
``Chinese model'' _ keep tight political control while slowly
liberalizing the Syrian economy. Guess what? There is no Chinese
model. There is only a Chinese bargain: The Chinese leadership said
to its people, ``We will let you get prosperous and you will let us
stay in power.'' But this deal breaks down if incomes don't rise.
</P>
<P>
   With half of Syria on the state payroll and 700,000 unemployed,
the only way Syria is going to be China is if Lebanon is Hong Kong.
Syria needs to let, and help, that to happen. Hafez Assad thought
he had to occupy freewheeling Lebanon to maintain Syria's
stability. Bashar, his son, will have to unoccupy Lebanon if he
wants to maintain Syria's stability.

ABORTION ISSUE CASTING A SHADOW OVER BUSH'S V.P. SELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Fla., Okla., Neb., Tenn., Kan.)   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Gov. George W. Bush is asked what he is
looking for in a running mate, he talks about things like
preparedness to be president and compatibility. But he never
mentions one factor that several advisers say is hovering over the
entire process: abortion.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first presidential campaign, Republican advisers
say, in which the Republican candidate truly appears to be weighing
whether to pick a No. 2 who supports abortion rights. He has that
luxury because conservative stalwarts do not seem to mind. Many,
like Pat Robertson, are so eager to win back the White House that
they are willing to go along (albeit grudgingly) with just about
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bush's overtures to politicians who favor abortion
rights, namely Govs. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and George Pataki of
New York, has decidedly scrambled the selection of a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Several advisers to Bush said, for example, that they are
certain Ridge would be at the top of the list were it not for his
stand on abortion. Ridge is from an important state, has an
impressive resume and, perhaps most importantly, gets along quite
well with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But one after another, several Bush advisers expressed
skepticism that the Pennsylvania governor would be picked. Some
predicted that the governor would settle for someone who is safely
anti-abortion, like Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Sen. Chuck
Hagel of Nebraska or Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee. Bush is
expected to make a decision in the next week or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see it,'' said one Bush adviser who thinks Ridge
would make an ideal running mate in many ways _ except for the
risk. ``But why would you throw a monkey wrench into the gears of
your base?''
</P>
<P>
   He and other loyalists said they were especially worried that
choosing Ridge would infuriate the Catholic Church, which they
consider as much of a concern as the Christian Right.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have your No. 2 person not carrying out the dominant
position on the most difficult issue of the day would cause some
pause,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., who opposes abortion
rights. ``A bugle that doesn't sound a clear note doesn't rally the
troops.''
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News Poll released Monday found that of Bush's current
supporters, about a third of those surveyed said they would be less
likely to vote for him if he picked a running mate who backed legal
abortion. They would not vote at all _ or defect to Pat Buchanan,
the abortion foe who is seeking the nomination of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, in an interview, questioned Buchanan's potency. ``I don't
think he's going to be factor,'' he said, ``And he's not about to
push Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>

   Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said in an interview that an abortion
rights position should be ``no disqualifier'' for his brother. His
choice favors abortion rights: Colin L. Powell. (But Bush aides
said Powell has made his disinterest clear.)
</P>
<P>
   Former President Gerald Ford weighed in for Ridge, scoffing at
the idea that abortion foes would desert the party. ``Where are
they gonna go?'' Ford asked in an interview published Monday in the
New York Daily News.

<P>
   A minority of Bush advisers take issue with those who say Bush
is less inclined to take a risk. They argue that because Bush is
entering his convention ahead in the polls, he has more leeway to
pick a running mate who supports abortion rights. Some go as far as
to say that alienating conservatives who oppose abortion _ risky as
it would be _ could appear bold and entice not only to Republicans
who favor abortion rights but to swing voters and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who would say, `Good for Bush!''' said one
close Bush adviser who is pushing for Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University and
authority on abortion politics, said: ``You've got a nominee who is
clearly pro-life. You've got a platform that's clearly pro-life. I
think a display of independence could go over very well. Offending
an important interest group in your party, in its way, can have a
positive impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the case of Ridge, several Bush advisers explained that
the dangers were far deeper than the conventional wisdom that
religious conservatives would squawk and perhaps frustrate any
attempts at harmony at the party's national convention that opens
late this month.
</P>
<P>
   But some advisers to Bush _ even ones who favor Ridge _ said the
deeper concern in the Bush camp was over the reaction from the
Catholic church because the Pennsylvania governor is Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would not be able to hold functions in Catholic settings;
Catholic colleges, Catholic high schools, Catholic institutions,''
said one Bush adviser who otherwise said Ridge would make the best
choice. ``Every city that you were to go to, there would be bishops
and cardinals who would protest.''
</P>
<P>
   One Republican operative who discussed the selection process
with Bush in the last week said, ``I don't think he's afraid of the
Christian right.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats grouse that Bush has a deeper bench of prospects
than Al Gore, the vice president has the advantage of not having
any single issue looming over his short list.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It could be, of course, that while his advisers are wrestling
with the possibilities, Bush really never intended to pick an
abortion rights candidate. Some abortion rights advocates say
Bush's toying with pro-choice candidates has been one grand shell
game to stroke his friends _ and placate abortion right supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale said he auditioned some
politicians in 1984 that he never intended to pick as his running
mate out of nothing more than friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all friends of mine,'' Mondale said. ``One of the
reasons I wanted to talk to them was I liked them and I didn't want
to hurt anyone's feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, that seemed to be what was happening when Bush
met with Pataki on Friday. After all, no Bush adviser has dared to
predict that Bush could win New York in November. And Bush is even
friendlier with Ridge than Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   But people close to Bush and Pataki said Monday that after the
two had their high-profile meeting Friday morning, they privately
met again over lunch that day. And some Bush advisers said the
Texas governor appeared to be taking a close look at Pataki
because, though he is Catholic, he has not had difficulties with
Catholic leaders in New York, as Ridge has had in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Those advisers said the problem for Ridge is he has now become
too closely identified with the abortion issue, as happened with
Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey. Whitman, for her part, argued
that an abortion rights running-mate would hardly be a drag on the
ticket. ``I've just talked to too many Republicans across the
country who say, `I don't want this to be the definer,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman and other abortion rights Republicans can take heart
that Ronald Reagan picked a running mate in 1980 who _ unlike
Reagan _ had opposed a constitutional prohibition against abortion.
George Bush, the running mate, had little choice but to emphasize
that he opposed abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But he squirmed a bit at his joint news conference with Reagan:
``Please do not try to keep reminding me of differences I had,''
Bush implored.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Reagan-Bush ticket, the questions eventually
subsided.

UNION WOULD BACK EVERETT APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Red Sox outfielder Carl Everett will have the right to
appeal any suspension handed down by Frank Robinson, baseball's
vice president of on-field operations who is expected to announce
his ruling as soon as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Major League Players Association is prepared to file an
appeal if Everett asks, and would represent him in a subsequent
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Everett maintained his silence for a second day, and was in the
lineup playing center field and batting fifth against the Montreal
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard anything about anything,'' said Red Sox
manager Jimy Williams, who earlier in the day, while guest of honor
at a BoSox Club luncheon, angrily reacted to a question about
Everett from emcee Chris Collins of New England Cable News.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know when I'm going to hear anything,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been in contact with Frank's office,'' said Red Sox
spokesman Kevin Shea, adding that general manager Dan Duquette had
spoken with Robinson. ``They indicated they're in the fact-finding
stage of the process. They've read the umpires' report and they're
going to look at the video and they hope to gather all the material
(Monday and Tuesday).''
</P>
<P>
   Several officials in baseball's hierarchy were reluctant to
speculate on the severity of the penalty Everett is expected to
receive for twice making physical contact with umpire Ronald Kulpa
after being ejected from Saturday's 6-4 win over the New York Mets
at Fenway Park. Sox reliever Rod Beck suggested that Everett might
get five games for each time he came in contact with Kulpa. A
number of baseball officials at Fenway Park Monday night predicted
that Everett will be suspended at least 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez was suspended five games May 3
for hitting Robbie Alomar of the Cleveland Indians with a pitch
after being warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspending an everyday player, Everett, for five games,'' one
person in the baseball hierarchy said, ``is the equivalent of
giving Pedro 20 games, in terms of the amount of actual playing
time he'll miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who received the umpires' report Saturday night,
received a videotape Monday. Robinson said Saturday he had already
seen the incident _ in which Everett appeared to strike Kulpa with
the beak of his helmet, then head-butted him _ on TV.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it difficult to predict the penalty, those officials
said, was that this is Robinson's first year on the job, and this
will be his first ruling on physical contact between a player and
an umpire.
</P>
<P>
   Because it involved an umpire, one official said, Robinson gave
the matter precedence over other incidents that occurred on the
weekend, including a brawl in Colorado Saturday between the Rockies
and Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Robinson gave Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox a
five-game suspension for making contact with umpire Derryl Cousins.
In that incident, Cox grabbed Cousins's arm.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's contact with Kulpa appeared to be much more
aggressive, but one official said that Robinson's absence of a
track record in these matters makes it impossible to predict how he
will rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Carl being an All-Star, and because it involves an
umpire, this is obviously a high-profile case,'' said one major
league official.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the longest suspension given a player by Robinson is the
eight-game penalty he gave Dodgers catcher Chad Kreuter for his
part in a brawl with fans in Chicago's Wrigley Field May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Another official suggested that any suspension greater than
eight games will be contested by the union, which would be expected
to argue, among other things, that forcing a player to sit out for
that length of time would put him at risk of injury upon his
return.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a significant change in the disciplinary process
since Major League Baseball abolished the league offices and placed
all authority in the commissioner's office. Previously, league
presidents handed down suspensions and heard subsequent appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, with input from executive vice president Sandy
Alderson, now makes disciplinary decisions. Appeals are heard by
Paul Beeston, baseball's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   It was Beeston who overturned the suspensions Robinson gave to
12 members of the Dodgers for the Wrigley Field incident. Beeston
upheld the suspensions of four players and two coaches; the
stiffest suspensions of eight games were given to Dodgers catcher
Kreuter and coaches Rick Dempsey and John Shelby.
</P>
<P>
   Monday at the BoSox Club luncheon, Collins asked Williams a
question about the difficulty of managing the team in the absence
of Everett. Collins suggested that Williams would be working with a
23-man roster, since he also doesn't play Izzy Alcantara.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has been demonstrably sensitive on the issue of
Alcantara, whom he didn't play for two weeks until starting him
Saturday, and he bristled at being asked about Everett.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just went into a 2 1/2-minute tirade,'' Collins said. ``He
said how he loved the Boston fans, but that it was people like
these guys (Collins) and other members of the media that try to
manage the team and create this bad atmosphere. He said he was
insulted by the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Williams walked away from the microphone and sat
down. He never mentioned Everett by name.

BUSINESS TYCOON SAYS HE WILL SEEK TO RALLY OPPOSITION TO PUTIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs 18th graf to correct name to Vladimir Gusinsky sted Boris
Gusinsky)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Boris Berezovsky, the archetypal Russian tycoon,
politician and, until lately, a force within the Kremlin itself,
said on Monday that he will quit his seat in parliament and try to
form an alliance of big business and regional politicians aimed at
curbing President Vladimir Putin's growing power.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky said that he is resigning on Wednesday because ``I do
not wish to take part in the dismantling of Russia and the
imposition of authoritarian rule.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the bluntest attack yet by a major figure on the popular
Putin, who has taken dead aim at Russia's business oligarchy and
its 89 regional governors in a bid to reimpose Kremlin control over
a virtually untamed political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It also carried considerable risk for Berezovsky, an unpopular
public figure and one of the very tycoons Putin's administration is
sizing up. His plan for a new anti-Kremlin movement drew catcalls
when he first hinted at it earlier this month, and most experts
give it scant chance of quick success.
</P>
<P>
   By resigning from parliament's lower house, the Duma, Berezovsky
also will surrender his immunity to prosecution just as the
government is threatening criminal action against other tycoons _
and after prosecutors questioned him last Friday in an inquiry
involving the Russian airline Aeroflot.
</P>
<P>
   In an afternoon news conference here, Berezovsky took pains to
suggest that he seeks to a create a new loyal opposition to a
president whose convictions and honesty he still admires. Were last
March's presidential election to be held today, Berezovsky said at
one point, he would vote for Putin again.
</P>
<P>
   But he also sounded like an angry and betrayed man, one who
blasted the Kremlin's attacks on his fellow tycoons as nothing more
than a bald attempt to usurp power for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Russia is facing a choice: whether we will follow the
Latin American model, with an authoritarian power and market
economy, or the European model with a liberal power and market
economy,'' he said. ``The only possible option,'' he said, is the
latter.
</P>
<P>
   Russia experts here and in Washington say the tycoon's
announcement shows how swiftly Berezovsky, who had an open door to
the Kremlin during former President Boris Yeltsin's final years in
office, has become estranged from Putin's administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any relationship between Putin and
Berezovsky,'' said Vyachaslav Nikonov, a top Russian political
analyst. ``Otherwise, Berezovsky wouldn't correspond with Putin by
sending him these open letters.'' Nikonov said that with
Berezovsky's access to the Kremlin cut off, he is now reduced to a
game of modest opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sending messages in different directions. One is to the
Kremlin, saying you guys are making a big mistake without me.
Message number two is to the governors: I'm your best friend. And
three is to the liberals: I'm your last hope for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Berezovsky, a 54-year-old former mathematician who
acquired immense riches by exploiting Russia's lawless capitalism
early on, seems an unlikely spokesman for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   He is widely assumed to have vast interests in Aeroflot;
AvtoVAZ, Russia's biggest automaker, and Sibneft, one of the
largest oil companies, among other concerns. He denies some of
those claims, but makes no bones about wielding great influence _
and even financial control _ over a media empire that includes
Russia's quasi-state television network, ORT, the Moscow business
newspaper Kommersant and the magazine Vlast, the Russian word for
``power.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is even richer: Berezovsky is widely believed to be
one of the Kremlin insiders who decided during Yeltsin's final days
in the presidency that Putin should be groomed to succeed him. ORT
played a major role in promoting Putin's election this spring.
</P>
<P>
   But then, experts still debate whether the Kremlin's assaults on
the governors and the tycoons are aimed at stabilizing Russia's
shaky democracy, as Putin says, or at aggrandizing the president's
power, as Berezovsky contends.
</P>
<P>
   Since being sworn in as president in early May, Putin has carved
Russia into seven administrative districts and installed his own
appointees in each one, moving swiftly to consolidate federal power
and patronage in a single place.
</P>
<P>
   He has also proposed to effectively abolish Russia's upper house
of parliament, which now consists of the 89 governors and their
appointees, and replace it with a more independent group of
legislators. Over Berezovsky's strident objections, the Duma seems
on the verge of doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's war on the tycoons began days after Putin's
swearing-in with a raid on the offices of Vladimir Gusinsky, who
controls a media empire that includes Russia's largest independent
television network.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has denied any involvement in that or moves since then
against a half-dozen other oligarchs in the oil, metals and auto
industries. But neither has he disavowed them, and it has become
apparent in the last week that the actions have his tacit approval,
if not his outright authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky revealed on Monday that federal prosecutors had
questioned him for two hours on Friday about allegations that up to
$600 million in proceeds from Aeroflot, the privatized Soviet
airline, had been laundered through Swiss banks. He insists that
the accusations are groundless and that, in any case, he is but a
witness in a case that centers on other people.
</P>
<P>
   But news reports quote prosecutors as saying Berezovsky, long
said to have a huge but hidden interest in Aeroflot, is a target of
the inquiry.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his news conference on Monday, Berezovsky said he had decided
to quit parliament in part because he did not believe it right to
side with his fellow oligarchs against Putin while having an
immunity from prosecution that they lack.
</P>
<P>
   The government's attack is ``no accident, not the initiative of
some over-zealous bureaucrat. It is essentially aimed at destroying
large independent businesses,'' he said. ``I do not want to enjoy
parliamentary immunity in such a case.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, noting that Berezovsky and other tycoons have
usually been major rivals in the last decade, offered a less
charitable assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to know that if these people want to get him, having
parliamentary immunity is not going to make any difference,'' said
Paul Saunders, director of the Nixon Center, a Washington-based
research organization that specializes in Russian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an opportunity to take a fairly high-profile,
dramatic step to once and for all make it clear to everyone that he
opposes what is happening.''

   ERC driver legal at St. Andrews
</P>
<P>
   By EDDIE SEFKO
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ The sun was high and hot. The sweaters
came off. Young lasses donned the two-pieces and raced to the
beach, letting the North Sea lap at their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the older locals groused about how dreadfully hot it
was getting around the historic Old Course on Monday. When the
mercury soared to almost 70 degrees, some sought the comfort of the
nearby pubs. They seemed oblivious to the fact the population back
in Houston was smoldering in 100-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of some, the totally un-British Open-like
weather was about the only thing causing sweat to form on many
brows as the week unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Much cooler and calmer heads were prevailing on one front in
particular _ the use of the controversial and banned-in-the-U.S.
ERC driver from Callaway. Neither players nor Callaway
representatives were throwing any salvos regarding use of the club
in the 129th British Open that begins Thursday. It will be a legal
club. And when hit straight, it can provide anywhere from five to
20 yards more than other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   On the PGA Tour, however, it is not legal. It's not even for
sale in the U.S. The USGA has ruled that the club is non-conforming
because it has a spring-like effect that is in excess of USGA
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, anybody can play the club if he so desires
because the Royal &AMP; Ancient Golf Club has deemed the club is legal.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, most of the 156 competitors won't take advantage of the
extra yardage the club provides off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not tried to promote the ERC on the PGA Tour because
it is a non-conforming club,'' said Mike Galeski, Callaway's
representative for players on the tour. ``We understand that, come
Sunday night, there are a lot of players who have to go back to the
States and won't be able to use it again.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, only a handful of the players in the tournament
will put the ERC in their bags. Galeski estimated the number is
likely to be between 20 and 25.
</P>
<P>
   And the pros get these clubs for free. Rest assured there are
many more being used around the world. Visitors to St. Andrews were
willingly plunking out 500 pounds (about $800) for the right to buy
one.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have had success with it on the European Tour is
Mark McNulty, who shot a 62 in the first round of qualifying on
Sunday. Fred Couples is said to have experimented with the club at
the Advil Western Open two weeks ago and may use it this week.
Colin Montgomerie may use the club as well.
</P>
<P>
   Others have shunned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't play it,'' Tiger Woods said. ``What happens if I like
it?''
</P>
<P>
   What would happen is that he'd have to leave it on this side of
the pond.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hype surrounding the club, it will be conditions at
St. Andrews that have more of an influence on whether select
players use the club. The fairways are harder and faster than most
courses in the U.S. That means drives are rolling farther, and if
they are off line, the error is compounded.
</P>
<P>
   With the scattering of so many pot bunkers around St. Andrews,
the extra length is not worth the risk for most players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the length; it's a matter of hitting one straight,''
said Jim Carter, who is on the Callaway staff of players. ``That's
the key.''
</P>
<P>
   What pro golfers want is one thing: clubs they are comfortable
with and in which they have confidence. It doesn't really matter
what label those clubs bear. Whatever they think gives them the
best chance to shoot low numbers is what usually ends up in the
bag.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions. Occasionally, a player will sign an
endorsement package with a club or ball manufacturer and see
results slip, but because of the contractual obligation, stay with
the product.
</P>
<P>
   But normally, it's a matter of going with what works.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just switch one week to another driver,'' said Vijay
Singh. ``The club might be longer. But you're giving away some
accuracy at the same time if you use it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was Notah Begay III who summed up the feelings of
most players.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game has always been about being in control and being
comfortable,'' he said. ``And I feel like I'm in control with the
driver I'm using. So it would be silly of me to try to squeeze 10
more yards when I don't really need it. I know for a fact the ball
goes farther with it. But why change when something's working?''
</P>
<P>
   Considering Begay has won the last two tournaments he's entered,
who's to argue?

TALKS INTENSIFY AS DEADLINE LOOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ With Wednesday's deadline fast approaching,
President Clinton stepped up his meetings with Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators on the seventh day of Middle East peace
talks, giving every indication he would leave for Japan whether
there is a peace deal or not.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on all sides have speculated that Clinton's departure
Wednesday is not set in stone, suggesting he might postpone his
trip to the G-8 summit, a meeting of industrialized nations that
begins July 21. But in restating the travel plans Monday, White
House officials seemed to be prodding negotiating teams on a day of
talks that officials described as ``intense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has a schedule to keep,'' White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart told reporters. ``That schedule has not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said: ``I expect when the president leaves the parties
will have wrapped up their business.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks fueled speculation about the status of the talks as
reports flooded out of the Middle East that the Israeli team was
displeased with the direction of the negotiations, which are
focusing on a series of disputes, including the status of Jerusalem
and the future of Palestinian refugees. After a phone conversation
with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, the speaker of the Israeli
Parliament, Avraham Burg, said in a radio interview that Barak was
``not optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wants to reach an agreement, but that we are not
there yet,'' Burg said on Israeli radio.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, on the other hand, continued to signal greater
optimism than they had a week before. A Palestinian official also
said the delegation would be willing to stay beyond Wednesday, a
proposal the Israeli team has already agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the American side decided to extend the period of the
talks, then I don't think that we will reject it,'' Palestinian
spokeswoma Hassan Abdel Rahman said. In addition to the limitations
imposed by Clinton's schedule, a senior member of the Palestinian
team, secretary general Abu Mazen, is supposed to leave by Thursday
to attend his son's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   US officials suggested that strict timetable had led to a shift
in atmosphere inside the presidential retreat, where some 35
delegates have been sequestered for a week. Keeping later and later
hours, sometimes until 3 a.m., the negotiators skipped dinner on
Sunday night to keep working. They are now working in an
environment that has ``intensified,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace and the intensity have both quickened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 7 miles from Camp David, teams of negotiators also
continued to gather in the town of Emmitsburg to work on so-called
``non-core'' issues, such as water issues and economic affairs.
Unlike the participants at Camp David, they are not bound by
secrecy rules. Still, the Emmitsburg teams did not report any
breakthroughs Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, questions surfaced about Clinton's decision to break
his own news blackout about the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged by accusations that his wife once made an anti-semitic
slur, Clinton took a break from the peace talks on Sunday to
telephone the publisher of the New York Daily News to solicit an
exclusive interview in her defense.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview that followed, Clinton also talked about the
peace summit, despite a strict US-imposed gag rule. Lockhart, who
did not know about the interview until later, said Clinton was
``outside the rules we've set down.''

THIS MASKED FAN SAYS RANGERS CAN STILL WIN
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Lone Ranger rides again.
</P>
<P>
   And I do mean lone.
</P>
<P>
   Every big-time media mogul in town, every ``football guy,''
every golden throat worth his overpriced designer hair spray, will
gather Tuesday in Wichita Falls, Texas, to celebrate the first day
of ``meaningless'' two-a-days at Camp Cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question: If it's all so danged meaningless, why
in the name of Dave Campo will virtually every media outlet from
the Rio Grande to the Red River and beyond be on hand to chronicle
each drop of sweat that trickles down Troy Aikman's precious
forehead?
</P>
<P>
   And did anybody bother to turn out the lights on the way out of
town?
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. The answers would be just as meaningless as the next
six weeks in Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Bor-ing.
</P>
<P>
   It's good riddance anyway. Wichita Falls is the perfect place
for all those brainwashed ``football guys'' to gather over their
red draws and talk blocking schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Me? I've got a baseball season to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Jeez, a guy goes on vacation for a couple of weeks and everybody
wants to pull the plug on the Texas Rangers, just because they had
a bad June. Give it a rest, will ya? Can't we hold off on the white
flag at least until we see what happens this weekend in Seattle?
</P>
<P>
   This does not put me in a popular position with most of my
colleagues, who have been all too willing to call off the Rangers
season and get on with more important issues, such as red-zone
percentages and whether little Dat Nguyen is really big enough to
fill Randall Godfrey's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Enough already. This baseball season is just getting
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, while I was temporarily out of pocket, Rangers
general manager Doug Melvin did a first-rate job of keeping the
bath water in the tub.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of folks have been trying to pull the plug,'' Melvin
acknowledged Monday from Tulsa, Okla., where he was watching the
club's Double-A team. ``I've been scrambling just as fast to keep
it plugged in.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank heavens for at least a little sanity around here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a plan here, and we're trying to stay with it,'' Melvin
said. ``I don't want to deviate from that plan because we're still
a young club. I'm not going to make a deal just for the sake of
making a deal. I'm not being pushed by Tom Hicks to dump money. If
I make a deal, it'll be because it can help us in the next two
years or in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, after a miserable stretch in June, have played much
better. They took two of three in Arizona to kick off this road
trip, including a gritty, don't-give-up-on-us-yet comeback against
Randy Johnson and the Diamondbacks on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Johnny did a heck of a job managing in that
series,'' Melvin said. ``Everyone contributed. I have no complaints
about the way we've been playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame we had that one horrible 10-game stretch. We lost
nine of 10 and Seattle and Oakland were both winning nine of 10.
But we can't make that go away. It happened.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not, however, enough to sink an entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything can happen in a week's time,'' Melvin said. ``Teams
can have injuries. It's going to come down to the
(trading-deadline) wire whether we do anything or don't do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin is asking for patience and a little time. This isn't a
football season, where you give up if your team starts 4-4 or 3-5.
Baseball remains a marathon. You don't win the race with a 10-day
sprint in June.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, in fact, is filled with glorious stories of comeback
teams throughout history.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees had pulled the plug back on July 19, 1978, when
they trailed the Red Sox by 14 games in the American League East,
then Bucky Dent probably wouldn't be the most hated man in New
England today.
</P>
<P>
   And what if the Giants had given up in 1951, when they lost the
opener of a doubleheader Aug. 11 to fall behind the hated Dodgers
by 13 1/2 games? We'd have never been thrilled by Bobby Thomson's
``shot heard 'round the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there was the infamous final week collapse
of the 1964 Phillies, who led by six games with seven to play and
blew it, allowing the Cardinals to win the National League pennant.
</P>
<P>
   Even as recently as '97, the Angels enjoyed a double-digit lead
at the All-Star break, only to fall apart in the second half and
watch the Mariners win the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's past is filled with dozens of such comeback stories.
It can happen again. That's why they play 162 games.
</P>
<P>
   Even a complete collapse by Texas in Seattle this weekend
wouldn't necessarily predicate a Rangers surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember the wild-card scenario, too,'' Melvin
noted. ``If Seattle sweeps us, they're having a good year, but
there are other clubs in the wild-card race that are either
struggling or could struggle. If (the worst) were to happen (in
Seattle), then we'd have to make a decision about battling for the
wild card.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin has three options to consider as the July 31 deadline for
trading players without them clearing waivers approaches: (1) Do
nothing and continue to battle to make the playoffs, either by
winning the division or the wild-card race; (2) give up the season
and trade free agents-to-be John Wetteland and David Segui for
prospects; (3) try and walk a fine line by trading Esteban Loaiza
for a top-flight prospect or two while still trying to remain
competitive in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Option 3 is interesting but dangerous. If he trades Loaiza to
another wild-card contender, say Toronto or Cleveland, the move
could come back to bite him.
</P>
<P>
   Why bother? It's a common question among the small-minded, who
are convinced the Rangers can go nowhere even if they should
somehow make the playoffs. I'll let Melvin answer that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Cleveland and the Yankees; they aren't the same
quality clubs they've been over the last few years,'' Melvin said.
``That's what gives you hope that anything can happen. A couple of
years ago, no one thought San Diego could get by Randy Johnson and
Houston, or the Braves, but they wound up in the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp Cowboy? Excuse me, but the Lone Ranger has a baseball
season to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Are you with me, kemo sabe?

TV SPORTS COLUMN: RICH GET CABLE DEALS, POOR GET RABBIT EARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a fascinating confluence of events: Last Friday, a
blue-ribbon commission studying baseball's economics recommended
that teams share up to 50 percent of their local revenues,
including television fees.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, a lawsuit filed against the Yankees by MSG
Network revealed that the team has made a deal with the
many-tentacled International Management Group to create a cable
television network that will pay the team $65 million next year and
$119 million by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Teams were jealous enough of the Yankees' MSG deal, which
expires after this season, when the world champions will receive
$55.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the envy of teams with puny television deals, which
cannot support a $100 million payroll or win three World Series in
four seasons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Think of the Pirates, with only $7 million in TV cash, or the
poor Padres, with a mere $6 million, according to Broadcasting &AMP;
Cable magazine. The Expos have no TV deal!
</P>
<P>
   Even a new Pirates or Reds stadium won't level the revenue field
much; eventually, the Yankees will get a new ballpark that will
generate so much cash that George Steinbrenner's squad may have no
solvent teams to compete against.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the blue-ribbon panel. It hardly seems possible that
Steinbrenner endorsed the creation of a network that would generate
still more TV cash in order to kick half of it back to revenue-poor
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a sitdown between Steinbrenner and Harvey Schiller, the
chairman of YankeeNets, the parent company of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for my Padres pals,'' the Boss says. ``They've lost
$72 million since 1995 and I've made $64 million. Dang it, if I
prosper, the Pods got to prosper. Got it, Harv?''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, teams contribute 20 percent of their net local
revenues to a major league pool, with only one-quarter of the money
redistributed to teams below the industry's average local revenue.
The rest goes equally to all clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The panel suggested pooling 40 percent to 50 percent of all
local revenues in a yet unspecified way.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Steinbrenner, the future impresario of the New York
Sports Network and sovereign of a new stadium with 150 luxury
suites, to gladly hand over half of these wonderful revenues to
enhance the cause of major league socialism.
</P>
<P>
   Who is to say sharing more revenues will help struggling teams?
Why give the weak sisters a windfall for being, well, weak sisters?
</P>
<P>
   Page 1 of the commission's report noted that existing revenue
sharing has not helped competitive balance; needy teams did not use
the cash to pay players. ``Some low-revenue clubs,'' the report
said, ``believing the amount of their proceeds from revenue sharing
insufficient to enable them to become competitive, used those
proceeds to become modestly profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission linked more revenue sharing to setting minimum
payrolls, discouraging teams from lining their greedy pockets. Good
old George Steinbrenner can help. If he pooled half his network
cash, the poor teams could sign more players and post higher
profits. All thanks to George. Imagine the acclaim that would
shower down on our corporate Yankee Doodle Dandy if he personally
pushed other teams into the black.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos, in a market that doesn't sustain a team with a teensy
payroll, lost $5.1 million from 1995 to 1999. Just send a few more
million over the border, George, just a few more. Help put us over
the top.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's owner, Jeffrey Loria, might have trimmed his losses
if he hadn't jacked up his TV contract demands beyond what any
station would sanely pay.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees, there is no such concern. MSG would likely pay
semi-insanely to keep the Yankees, the bulwark of the network. What
would MSG carry in the spring and summer without the Yanks? Metro
Guide programming?
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision would probably pay from $75 million to $100 million
a year to preserve the Yankees on MSG. But MSG is in a war of
retention. In its lawsuit, MSG claims that the new Yankee network
is not an offer that it can match, under its right to match any
outside offers for Yankee rights. &QL; 
challenging Cablevision to do exactly what I.M.G. plans to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to match,'' said Bob Gutkowski, who made the
Yankee deal at MSG when Paramount Communications owned it.
Paramount outbid Cablevision's Sportschannel New York (now Fox
Sports New York) to snare the Yankees. Eventually, Cablevision
acquired Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Gutkowski, now the president of Worldwide Entertainment &AMP;
Sports, has seen the other side of the Yankee equation. Between
1997 and 1999, as an executive for the Marquee Group and SFX
Sports, Gutkowski counseled Steinbrenner on creating a network of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees don't want to sell their rights, so George is
creating an equity base and a competitor,'' he said, noting that
Cablevision's matching right does not preclude the Yankees from
changing their desires from a straight rights deal to a network.
``I think the Yankees will win. And losing the Yankees will be a
huge body blow to Cablevision. MSG may have to be folded into Fox
Sports New York.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first phase of the Yankees-MSG battle, Judge Barry A.
Cozier issued a preliminary injunction to keep the Yankees from
consummating the network deal. Barring a settlement, the two sports
fat cats will meet in court on July 31, the day the network deal is
set to close. Now, this is great interleague baseball. &QL;

BID FOR HONUS WAGNER CARD BRINGS $1.1 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Story has been shorted.) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A collector from Southern California paid $1.1 million Saturday
for the rare, early 20th-century Honus Wagner tobacco card that was
once co-owned by Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Siegel of Santa Ana, Calif., made the 13th and final
online bid on eBay for the card, which was included in cigarette
packs made by the American Tobacco Co. in 1909. An estimated 50 of
the cards still exist.
</P>
<P>
   The card was considered the most expensive artifact in sports
memorabilia until $3.05 million was paid for Mark McGwire's 70th
home run ball.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel was the buyer, said a person involved in the auction, and
was unavailable for comment, pending a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With a 15 percent buyer's fee, the full price being paid is
$1.265 million.
</P>
<P>
   The card was bought nearly four year ago by Michael Gidwitz, of
Chicago, who paid $640,500 at auction. Previously, Gretzky and
Bruce McNall, the former Los Angeles King owner, acquired the card
for $451,000 in 1991, then sold it in 1996 for use in a promotional
contest staged by Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   The contest winner then sold the card to Gidwitz to pay taxes on
the prize.

PROPOSED AMERICAN-NORTHWEST MERGER ON THE ROCKS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By DAN REED 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ American Airlines executives have all but
given up on reaching a deal to buy rival Northwest Airlines this
month because the two companies remain far apart on price, insiders
and others familiar with the negotiations say.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, a Justice Department decision Friday to extend its
antitrust review of the proposed merger of UAL Corp. and US Airways
by at least 20 days has removed pressure to reach a deal quickly,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The May 24 announcement by UAL, parent of United Airlines, and
US Airways merger triggered a scramble by competitors, including
American and Delta Air Lines, to seek out potential partners of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   But the key dividing point between American and Northwest is
money: Northwest Chairman Gary Wilson is insisting that his company
is worth about $10 billion, or $100 per share. American executives
have valued Northwest at $56 per share, or roughly the same premium
that UAL would pay for US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The hangup over a purchase price has derailed American's plan to
put a merger proposal of its own before regulators this month _ as
the Justice Department contemplates the United-US Airways deal.
It's unclear how long the Justice Department review will go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to do the deal, but not at any price,'' said one
senior American executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest stock, which has run up in recent weeks on merger
speculation, fell $1.31 a share yesterday to close at $36.62. AMR
gained 50 cents a share to close at $32.62.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman for American, based in Fort Worth, and Northwest,
based in Eagan, Minn., declined to comment on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   American executives have said that they did not want to launch
another round of industry consolidation, but that the company will
not stand still if other carriers combine. If forced to review
multiple proposed mergers at the same time, regulators might balk
at all such deals rather than risk a marked loss of competition,
analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
   American, the second-largest passenger carrier behind United,
would be 50 percent smaller than the combined UAL-US Airways.
Northwest is the nation's No. 4 carrier. American and its parent,
AMR Corp., employ more than 27,000 people in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks say American and Northwest executives
have been in regular contact, and have generally agreed to how a
merger of the two carriers would work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's price only, nothing else,'' one source said of the major
sticking issue.
</P>
<P>
   The American executive suggested that American might now
reluctantly wait for the Justice Department to complete its review
of the UAL-US Airways deal before moving to acquire a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like we're going to get anything up to
Washington before Justice rules on United-US Air,'' the executive
said, unless Northwest executives ``are willing to talk in
realistic numbers pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive noted that Northwest's asking price is more than
American's $4.8 billion value in the stock market, even though ``we
have twice the revenues and they have a fleet of old airplanes that
aren't worth much.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how much American and Northwest are willing to bend
in their positions on price. Julius Maldutis, a veteran airline
analyst for the CIBC Oppenheimer investment firm, suggests that
Wilson's demand might merely be a bargaining tactic.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson runs a significant risk, analysts said. AMR could
present the financier, who led the investment group that acquired
Northwest a decade ago in a $3.3 billion leveraged buyout, the best
opportunity to cash out of their investment.

<P>
   SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. _ To take the temperature of excess in the
Hamptons this summer, join Jay Lieberman in the shower of the new
12,000-square-foot house that he hopes to sell for $8 million,
preferably to someone who will pay cash.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a builder, has taken a seat in the glassed-in shower
stall of the ``his'' bathroom in the master bedroom. He proudly
points to a shower head that is 10 inches in diameter and is
capable of caressing the human body with 22 gallons of water per
minute (about nine times the maximum flow allowed in New York
state, but unlikely to result in any legal woes). That super-sized
spritzer costs $800. But it is merely an appetizer for what awaits
across the hall in what Lieberman calls ``the last word in
bathrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``hers'' bathroom has a skylight, radiant heat in the
floors, wiring for satellite television and views of the pool and
tennis court. Like the ``his'' bath, the showpiece here is in the
shower: an all-exposed, hand-machined, hand-polished,
nickel-plated, thermostatic mixer with overhead shower and hand
sprayer on a cradle. It cost $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anything in this house that I did not pull out all
the stops for,'' Lieberman boasts. ``Whoever takes this house will
be a client with a lot of money who walks in and says, `Wow!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the frenzied pace of speculative construction here this
summer and the frazzled lives of workers doing the building, the
Hamptons have never before been invaded by so many rich people
wanting to be wowed and demanding that it happen fast.
</P>
<P>
   The invasion has driven construction costs to record levels,
seduced builders, architects and even carpenters to build houses on
``spec,'' choked roads with commuting workers and encouraged
subcontractors to insist on bonuses merely for showing up on time.
It also has enriched and exhausted nearly everyone willing to drive
a nail, paint a wall or dig a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's house ranks among the most expensive ever built in
the Hamptons without a contracted buyer. Part of the reason it is
so expensive is what goes on in its 9{ bathrooms. Each bath,
excepting the maid's, has faucets imported from England that cost
an average of $2,000 each. The company that made them, Barber
Wilsons &AMP; Co. Ltd., does faucets for the queen of England and for
Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't price yourself out of this market,'' said Carmine
Cornacchio, owner of Cornacchio Electric here in Southampton. He
and his crew of 20 electricians specialize in custom wiring for
houses selling for $2 million to $3 million. Such houses,
Cornacchio said, usually include devices that, for example, allow
an owner stuck in traffic on the Long Island Expressway to turn on
the hot tub with a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the sentiments of many architects, builders and
subcontractors in the Hamptons, Cornacchio said that this year it
had become all but impossible to put off mansion-hungry clients by
charging outrageous prices.
</P>
<P>
   Several subcontractors said they were making record profits, and
a few have used the windfall to buy big-ticket toys, like
airplanes. But they also said it would be bad business to talk
publicly about their new wealth. Steven Gaines, who lives in the
Hamptons and whose best-selling book ``Philistines at the
Hedgerow'' (Little Brown, 1998) chronicles the hijinks of rich
residents, said his plumber now owns a plane. Gaines said, however,
that disclosing the plumber's name would mean that he would have to
find somebody else to fix his toilet.
</P>
<P>
   John Tortorella builds swimming pools for the rich and famous in
the Hamptons. His clients have included Billy Joel, Peter Jennings
and Kathleen Turner. This year, he said, has been the busiest and
most lucrative of his 19 years in the swimming-pool trade. But he
said overwork is making him question the meaning of success.
</P>
<P>
   He is exhausted, his employees are exhausted, and still the
orders for bigger, more costly and more complicated swimming pools
keep rolling in. Five years ago, he said, a $200,000 pool was
considered ``pretty huge.'' Now, his company, J. Tortorella
Swimming Pools, is rushing to complete five pools, the cheapest of
which will cost $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are talking `backyard concepts,' with a pool, a spa, a
pergola, a stone bridge, wrought iron gates,'' said Tortorella, who
has begun to design his biggest pools along historical themes like
the lost island of Atlantis, ancient Egypt and Stonehenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody used to talk about the go-go '80s like they were so
wonderful,'' he said. ``Well, the '80s were like child's play. It
is ridiculous now. The amount of time and stress that my people
have had to put up with is inhuman.''
</P>
<P>
   The minting of millionaires in Manhattan is far outpacing the
supply of skilled labor and good property in the Hamptons,
according to local government officials on the East End of Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of prime lots dwindles, the chief building
inspectors in the towns of Southampton and East Hampton said,
million-dollar houses are being built near town dumps and on
misshapen or poorly drained parcels of land.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are building on properties now that they wouldn't have
even looked at 10 years ago,'' said Don Sharkey, the chief building
inspector for the Town of East Hampton. ``In a couple of years, we
are going to run out of buildable parcels.''

<P>
   The shortage of land, combined with local moratoriums on some
kinds of subdivisions and the possibility of far more restrictive
development rules in the near future, have helped push home prices
this year to levels that stun veteran real estate agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen the biggest-ever across-the-board quarterly jump
in home prices in the Hamptons,'' said Diane Saatchi, president of
Dayton-Halstead Real Estate, which publishes a quarterly report on
home prices in seven markets in the Hamptons. Figures for the first
quarter of 2000 came out last week.
</P>
<P>
   They show that in the Village of East Hampton, summer home to
the likes of Spielberg and Martha Stewart, the average price of
houses has jumped in the last three years to $2.1 million from $1.2
million. More than two-thirds of that increase occurred during the
first quarter of this year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi, voicing an opinion shared by many builders and
architects, speculates that the boom is fueled by continued
strength in the stock market and by aging baby boomers in Manhattan
who find themselves with buckets of excess money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have gotten to a point where they are in their prime
earning years, their kids are through college, and they need houses
that are big enough to accommodate several generations and kids
from multiple marriages,'' said Saatchi, who has been selling real
estate in the Hamptons for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their reasons, buyers are spreading so much money so
fast that the craftsmen in the Hamptons are at risk of drowning in
a flood of trickle-down economics. The unemployment rate in
Southampton hit a record low of 2 percent this spring. For skilled
labor, New York State employment officials said, the jobless rate
in the Hamptons is about zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``The East End of Long Island is the tightest
skilled-construction market in the United States, without
compromise,'' said Daniel McMillan, regional vice president of
Trade Source, a company in Greenwich, Conn., that recruits and
places craftsmen in construction jobs around the country. ``We have
hired a former Navy recruiter to go around the Hamptons and talk to
anybody who is wearing work boots and driving a pickup.''
</P>
<P>
   With more jobs than workers to fill them, Trade Source two weeks
ago began offering a free carpenter's course to recent high school
graduates. The first class was convened in an office building in
the Suffolk County hamlet of Bohemia, about an hour's drive from
the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure that if I improve my skills, I can bump my wages from
$15 to at least $25 an hour out in the Hamptons,'' said John
Vitale, 23, who showed up for the course. ``The money is definitely
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep pace with demand, a number of Hamptons builders have
begun hiring immigrants from Central America to frame houses,
shingle roofs and build swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``They broke out of the landscaping business about two years
ago, and now they are rising through the trades,'' said Al Tuff, a
builder in Bridgehampton who employs recent immigrants and who said
his business would shut down without them.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Velasquez, a Salvadoran immigrant who has been in the
United States for six years, earns $23 an hour and works 12 hours a
day, seven days a week, for Tuff, who also employs Velasquez's two
sons, Carlos and Victor, both in their early 20s. They, too,
usually work 12 hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just too much work,'' Velasquez said.
</P>
<P>
   Elected officials in the Hamptons are struggling to find ways to
slow the pace of development, and a few are conceding that local
governments have all but lost the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last decade, we have been building houses at a rate of
a house every single day,'' said Jay Schneiderman, the supervisor
in the Town of East Hampton. ``We have added probably 20,000 people
to our summer population without changing any significant
infrastructure. That is creating tremendous stress on the quality
of life in this area. It has not been a balanced approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneiderman said that town governments, even with millions of
dollars to spend on buying up vacant land, were finding it
difficult to persuade speculators to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``A builder would rather build a spec house,'' Schneiderman
said. ``He knows that the profit he'll yield will far exceed what
he'll make selling us vacant land. That makes it difficult to
preserve vacant space.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, builder of the $8 million house with the pricey
shower heads, said: ``Even I realize that there is a certain amount
of property that should be preserved. Things are obviously getting
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Difficult or not, Cindi Crain, a former magazine editor, said
she was going ahead with her dream house, which she is planned on
two acres of land she bought for $1 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Crain, 31, who has family money (Crain Communications, publisher
of Advertising Age and Crain's New York Business), said she had
been warned repeatedly by friends about the impossibility of
getting a house built on time and within a budget.
</P>
<P>
   She has been forced by soaring design and construction prices to
raise her budget for her planned 6,000-square-foot house to about
$3.5 million from $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   She intends to elude the pain of summer in the Hamptons by
sticking to back roads, staying away from overcrowded restaurants
and never commuting from Manhattan on Fridays or Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   And why is this worth $3.5 million?
</P>
<P>
   ``You really feel the sea out here. You suck in the sea air,''
Crain said. ``You can still chill out in the Hamptons, if you know
what you are doing.''

 &HT;    Cowboys' coach Campo celebrates birthday, new job
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas - _ Today, on his 53rd birthday, Dave Campo
assumes control of the Dallas Cowboys, a football team he has
considered family for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Campo is no stranger at training camp. He has watched Troy
Aikman and Emmitt Smith capture three Super Bowls. He has been an
assistant for Jimmy Johnson, Barry Switzer and Chan Gailey. He has
seen good times and bad times, which makes him uniquely qualified
for the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there is a change of coaches there will be some
uneasiness, but my relationship with the organization is a big
plus,'' Campo said. ``There is no question that I understand the
expectations of the fans and the organization. Dallas is different
than any other city in the United States. That comes from being
successful over a 40-year period.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo's excitement can be detected by his cheerful demeanor and
positive outlook. He resembles a child awaiting his first Little
League baseball game. The weight of training camp, which begins
today, kept him from sleeping Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can match team owner Jerry Jones' enthusiasm, it's
Campo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave is someone who is very bright, someone who knows what it
was like when we were successful and what it was like when we
weren't,'' Jones said Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave certainly fits that bill very well. The staff has a great
deal of respect for his skills and knowledge of football. A lot of
players lobbied for Dave because they know he has an opportunity to
do a very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones decided that the head coach should be someone ``in the
family'' after he fired Gailey last winter. The outspoken owner
admitted he made a mistake by hiring Gailey, a former Pittsburgh
Steelers assistant. The players were never comfortable with
Gailey's offensive system, which ultimately cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   In Campo, the Cowboys have someone they have known since 1989,
the year Jones bought the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Campo inherits a team with a small nucleus of people which won
its last Super Bowl in the 1995-96 season. Aikman, Smith, safety
Darren Woodson, defensive tackles Leon Lett and Chad Hennings, and
offensive linemen Larry Allen and Erik Williams have links to the
team's glorious past.
</P>
<P>
   The key to 2000, though, depends largely on a group of newcomers
and players under 25.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin, Daryl Johnston and Deion Sanders have moved on.
Receiver Joey Galloway, linebacker Joe Bowden and cornerback Ryan
McNeil have moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Campo is too busy to worry about a leadership gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really worry about the guys we don't have,'' Campo
said. ``I worry about the guys we do have. If we get an injury,
we're not going to use that as an excuse. If we do, we'll have to
have the young talent step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo said the offense will have a new look. The Cowboys, with
the speedy Galloway and Rocket Ismail starting at receiver, will
pass the ball more. The team had become too predictable and
conservative during Gailey's two years in Dallas. With former
Cowboys assistant Jack Reilly as the new offensive coordinator and
former coordinator Ernie Zampese as an adviser, Jones believes
Dallas has the tools to contend for another title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't won a Super Bowl in four years,'' Jones said, ``and
that's a major drought for me.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: The Cowboys have reached a contract agreement with their
top draft choice, Tennessee cornerback Dwayne Goodrich. The
second-round pick signed a four-year deal worth $3.2 million.
Georgia linebacker Orantes Grant, the final player to come to
terms, signed a three-year contract for $770,000.

FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR TELEMARKETING FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
   By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge in New Hampshire on Monday sentenced a former
U.S. attorney and commodities regulator to 24 months in prison for
becoming a co-conspirator with the operators of fraudulent
telemarketing scams of the type he had once investigated and
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence received by John Field III, 60, was a bit more than
one-fourth of the maximum 87-month term he could have faced. It
reflected his cooperation during a three-year period after he had
been caught by federal investigators, and agreed to cooperate in
sting operations and the recording of telephone conversations.
These led to the conviction of more than 18 fraudulent securities
and commodities telemarketers in six states and the District of
Columbia, who had netted nearly $200 million, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Field also faces sentencing in federal court in New Jersey on
other conspiracy charges connected to the telemarketing schemes,
which were aimed at elderly people and bilked them with the promise
of returns on investments in fraudulent cable and satellite
broadcasting operations. Federal prosecutors in New Jersey are also
expected to seek leniency at sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Field was the U.S. attorney for the southern district of West
Virginia from 1972 to 1977 and a former director of enforcement for
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In requesting leniency for him, federal prosecutors in Concord,
N.H., conceded in a motion to Judge Joseph DiClerico that Field had
let ``greed'' cancel out the years he spent protecting the public
from fraud and wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   They stated in the motion: ``While his crimes were egregious,
his cooperation has been exceptional. With the help of Field, the
government was able to quickly master the manner and methodology
used by the criminal enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gunnison, an assistant U.S. attorney in New Hampshire
who helped investigate the cases that led to Field and his work on
behalf of telemarketing fraud rings, said that Field, upon leaving
his post as a regulator, had taken on the work of helping his
clients in their intent to skirt and evade the laws regulating
commodities.

 WASHINGTON: particular surveillance.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The issue does not often arise today with the monitoring of
telephone conversations because when a law enforcement authority
wants to see a list of telephone calls made by a suspect, the agent
gets an order from a magistrate, presents the order to a telephone
company, and the company then turns over the list.
</P>
<P>
   In at least one instance, an Internet company did not cooperate
so readily with the government. In December, federal marshals
approached EarthLink _ a service provider with 4.2 million
subscribers _ with a court order permitting them to deploy a device
to register time, date and source information involving email sent
to and from a specified account.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned the device would record broader information, EarthLink
countered with a compromise: it would provide the government with
the requested information about e-mail senders and recipients,
according to Robert Corn-Revere, a lawyer for EarthLink, in recent
congressional testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Corn-Revere said that the government ultimately accepted the
compromise, but later became dissatisfied and wished to use its own
device. But a federal court rejected the company's request.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet companies have also been critical of Carnivore.
</P>
<P>
   William L. Schrader, chairman and chief executive of PsiNet, a
major commercial Internet service provider, said that the system
gives the FBI the ability to monitor e-mail of every person on a
given network. He said he would refuse to permit the government to
use the technology at PsiNet unless the agents could prove that it
could only sift out the traffic from a given individual that is the
target of a court order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I object to American citizens and any citizens of the world
always being subject to someone monitoring their email,'' said
Schrader, whose company serves about 100,000 business and more than
10 million users. ``I believe it's unconstitutional and I'll wait
for the Supreme Court to force me to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups, meanwhile, said that Monday's policy
announcement was an inadequate response to the growing controversy
over the deployment of Carnivore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's speech was camouflage to cover the mess that is
Carnivore,'' said Barry Steinhardt, an associate director of the
American Civil Liberties Union. ``In light of the public and
congressional criticism of Carnivore, we had hoped and expected far
more from an Administration that likes to tout its sensitivity to
privacy rights. Rather than glossing over Carnivore, Podesta should
have announced that the administration was suspending its use.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing growing concerns about Carnivore, Attorney General Janet
Reno said last Thursday that she would review whether the system is
being used consistent with privacy rights in the Constitution and
federal law. A subcommittee of the House is set to hold a hearing
next week on the system.
</P>
<P>
   While the civil liberties and privacy groups applauded giving
judges greater discretion to review certain kinds of requests for
surveillance, they were critical of other aspects of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, a research organization that studies privacy issues and
technology, criticized the administration for lowering the
standards for surveillance of cable modems rather than raising the
standards for telephone surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cable Act provides for one of the best privacy protections
in the United States,'' Rotenberg said. ``The question is whether
to harmonize up or harmonize down. Our view this harmonizes down.''
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials said the Cable Act never
contemplated that there would be broad use of cable modems for
e-mail traffic and that the standards used for obtaining warrants
for telephone surveillance should also apply to digital
communications through cable networks.

BABY'S FIRST FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By BETSY WADE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Philip Fischer, a specialist in pediatric and adolescent
medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, believes there is no age
at which an infant is automatically too young to travel by air. He
and some of his colleagues take issue with a report in a British
medical journal depicting perils to the very young in flight.
</P>
<P>
   The issue arose last month when Edward Lister, owner of the
Travel Medicine Clinic in Rancho Mirage, Calif., a nurse belonging
to the International Society of Travel Medicine, asked the members'
e-mail forum if there was any reason not to let a family take a
3-week-old infant on a 2,000-mile air trip to visit relatives.
Plentiful dialogue followed, with almost all the medical experts
supporting Fischer, a leader in the field of children's travel, in
his statement: ``I would personally not restrict air travel because
of a child's age.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer had one caveat. ``A 2,000-mile air trip probably
involves a big transition and some physical challenges for a
postpartum mother and for a family adjusting to a new baby,'' he
said. ``I would hope the scheduled itinerary is appropriate for all
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sheila Mackell of Oakland, Calif., a pediatrician and member
of the society, said she likewise asked patients whether they were
ready for such a journey.
</P>
<P>
   In the travel medicine dialogue, many experts pointed out
reasons that parents often undertook long air journeys with
newborns: the family may prefer to have the delivery someplace
other than where they live, or, commonly these days, the family may
have adopted a baby in another state, or another country, and want
to hurry home and settle in.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David R. Shlim, a specialist in high-mountain illness and
traveler's diarrhea, who has a clinic in Jackson Hole, Wyo., said:
``Many women who live in a developing country will leave that
country in the last month of pregnancy in order to deliver in a
safer environment. Often they have to leave their spouses behind
and even children who might be in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are understandably anxious to get back to their life in
Nepal, or India, or Africa, as soon as possible after delivery. It
is this group that is most likely to want to travel with a newborn
baby. We flew home to Nepal from Bangkok with our first child when
he was 8 days old.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Rosselot, a nurse practitioner and public health expert who
directs a clinic in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and her husband took
their adoptive daughter on an air trip when she was 9 days old. The
couple flew to California to meet her when she was 2 days old, then
flew to Houston and on to San Antonio to complete adoption
formalities before returning to New York through Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Rosselot said that on her trip, Continental Airlines asked her
how old the baby was, but said that 9 days was old enough and let
her board. Clients of her clinic now tell her they have received
conflicting information from an airline on the phone and then at
the boarding gate, and sometimes aboard, and have met varying rules
when they took connecting flights from California to Texas and home
to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sparse material published on the subject is a notation
in Health Information for International Travel 1999-2000, the
``yellow book,'' published by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Under ``Air Travel During Pregnancy,'' there is this:
``Women traveling with infants should keep in mind that newborns
under 6 weeks old should not fly because their alveoli are not
completely functional.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Phyllis E. Kozarsky of the Emory University Travel Clinic in
Atlanta, who helped write this guideline, said that the 6-week age
limit represented a theoretical consensus ``since there are really
no firm data to support or refute.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackell in Oakland characterized as inconclusive a report
published in the British Medical Journal in 1998 saying that
infants who traveled by air were more likely to be victims of
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. She said that this study had raised
wide concern in the travel-medicine community.
</P>
<P>
   She and Kozarsky both said, however, that when an infant was
involved they usually asked ``is this trip necessary.'' Kozarsky
said: ``Occasionally we see adoptive parents who will be traveling
to pick up their babies from overseas or even within the country
and wish to bring the child home as soon as possible, and thus the
question arises. If there is no urgency, however, one might be a
bit more conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of transmitting infections, Mackell said that the
air in planes was perfectly good but that the passenger sitting
next to the baby might be carrying something, and long proximity
could be a problem. One participant in the dialogue, Dr. Alison
Clough of the Travel and Geographic Medicine Clinic in Tucson,
Ariz., a family doctor, said that studies had shown airline air to
be quite clean and she believed that most post-air-travel colds and
flu she had seen were picked up in airports and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Of seven major domestic airlines, three are concerned with
minimum passenger age. Continental will not accept a child who is
under 7 days old, according to Julie Gardner, a spokeswoman.
United, according to Chris Nardella, a spokeswoman, wants a
doctor's letter saying a child under the age of 7 days is able to
fly. If American Airlines is asked the question, according to John
Hotard, a spokesman, it replies that it does not accept infants
under 3 days of age. But he said: ``If someone arrives with a baby
in a bassinet, our agent is not going to say, `Excuse me, ma'am,
may I inspect your baby?'''
</P>
<P>
   Trans World Airlines, US Airways, Delta and Northwest Airlines
report no restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karl Neumann of Queens, a travel-medicine expert who
specializes in pediatrics, had a few suggestions for parents taking
infants _ or young children _ on planes. First, he said, parents
are sometimes told their children need copious liquids in flight,
and this is not the case. ``It just gives them a stomachache,'' he
said. However, he said, the swallowing involved in breast-feeding
or taking a bottle will often relieve earache in ascent and
descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lap children,'' that is children under the age of 2, can
travel free domestically, but the experts said these babies
traveled most safely in a rear-facing child seat strapped into an
airline seat. This means buying a ticket for the child. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In April, Northwest instituted a ``special delivery'' fare for
parents going overseas to adopt a child. In company with KLM, it
has a reduced fare to 100 destinations the lines serve in Asia,
Africa, Europe, India and the Middle East. Information may be found
on the Northwest Web site at www.nwa.com. Enter ``adoption fare''
in the inquiry box. For special services: (800) 322-4162.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways created special adoption fares in April. These
too provide a 65 percent discount on the full economy fare from 21
United States cities to any point on the line's main routes. The
line does not have a minimum age for passengers, according to John
W. Lampl, its spokesman. Information: (800) 247-9297.  &QL;

WHITE HOUSE PRESSES ATTACK ON REPUBLICAN TAX PROPOSALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate moved toward passage of an
election-year tax cut for married couples, the Clinton
administration renewed its attack Monday on the tax agenda being
promoted by the Republican majority in Congress, calling it a
fiscally reckless attempt to help the wealthy at the expense of
working people.
</P>
<P>
   The treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers, said the Republican
tax cut proposals ``primarily benefit the highest-income
Americans'' and would explode in cost as time went by, imperiling
the nation's ability to deal with long-term challenges like
maintaining the solvency of the Social Security and Medicare
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans defended their plans as prudent and said President
Clinton was misguided in casting all tax debates as a contest
between rich and poor. And they pressed on with their effort to
pass their proposed tax cut for couples, heartened by new, larger
projections of the federal budget surplus from the Congressional
Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   The budget office, in a report to be released publicly on
Tuesday, estimated that the budget surplus outside of Social
Security will be nearly $2.2 trillion over the next decade. The
projection is $1.3 trillion higher than the budget office's last
estimate, which came in January, and $300 billion higher than a
projection released last month by the White House's Office of
Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a bill last week to repeal the federal estate
tax, joining the House, which had passed it last month. The House
plans to take up bills this week to expand tax breaks for
Individual Retirement Accounts and 401(k) retirement plans and to
repeal some of the tax on Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The focus in Congress Monday was on the Republican plan to
reduce taxes on nearly all married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Packaged as an attempt to alleviate the so-called marriage
penalty, the quirk in the tax code that leads many two-income
couples to pay a higher tax bill than they would if they had
remained single, the bill debated in the Senate Monday would
actually amount to a tax cut for married couples who do not pay the
penalty as well as those that do.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the bill failed to address the underlying
complexities in the tax code that create the marriage penalty, and
offered an alternative proposal that would have given a tax cut
only to those couples who actually paid more because they are
married, and limited the benefits to couples with incomes of less
than $150,000. The Democratic proposal was defeated by a vote of
50-46.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans brushed aside complaints from Democrats that
high-income people would benefit from their plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not shy away from the fact that our bill benefits
virtually every American family,'' said Sen. William V. Roth Jr.,
R-Del.
</P>
<P>
   With projections of the federal budget surplus growing and tax
cuts proving to have more support among Democrats than even a few
months ago, administration officials stressed that Clinton would
also like to enact tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
   But they said the president would continue to insist that they
primarily benefit low- and middle-income people and that they not
be adopted before bipartisan agreement on other issues like the
addition of prescription drug coverage to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis released Monday by the Treasury Department said that
the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers by income _ about 1.2 million
households earning $346,000 or more _ would receive 27.5 percent of
the benefits of the tax cuts being pushed this year by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 percent of taxpayers by income _ 11.5 million
households with incomes of $115,000 or more _ would receive 60.2
percent of the benefits, the analysis said.

NFL MAKES STARTING TIMES EARLIER FOR ABC CONVENTION COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ABC News said Monday that the National Football
League had agreed to change the starting times of two Monday night
preseason games, a decision that will allow the network to devote
an hour of prime-time coverage each to the opening nights of the
Democratic and Republican national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The network had earlier announced that it would not pre-empt the
football games and would provide prime-time convention coverage on
those nights _ Monday, July 31, when Republicans convene in
Philadelphia, and Monday, Aug. 14, when Democrats gather in Los
Angeles _ only during halftime.
</P>
<P>
   David Westin, president of ABC News, said on Monday that network
officials decided to approach the NFL about helping them make room
for the conventions after concluding that the lineup of speakers
for the opening nights had considerable news value.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Colin L. Powell and Laura Bush, wife of Gov. George W.
Bush, are to speak on the opening night in Philadelphia, while the
Democrats have tentative plans to have President Clinton and
Hillary Rodham Clinton address the delegates on the first night in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Westin said Robert A. Iger, president of ABC's parent, the Walt
Disney Co., had taken a lead role in discussions with NFL officials
about how convention coverage might be accommodated. As a result,
the games will start an hour earlier, at 7 p.m. rather than 8 p.m.,
EDT, ABC officials said. That should allow convention coverage to
start about 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ABC thus will be broadcasting live from the conventions on all
four nights of each, just as it did four years ago, and will
provide gavel-to-gavel coverage on its Web site and in multiple
daily Webcasts.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News announced on Monday that it would broadcast on all four
nights of each convention, including special editions of its
magazine programs ``48 Hours'' and ``60 Minutes II'' on the Monday
and Tuesday of each. The network will devote an hour of prime time
on each Wednesday and two hours on each Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   NBC News has said it will televise all four nights of each
convention on its MSNBC cable channel and provide live coverage on
the flagship NBC network on the final two nights of both.

`BIRDS OF PASSAGE': SYRIANS, AFTER GENERATIONS IN EGYPT, ARE STILL
FRENCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the Syrian colony in Egypt, well to do, long established and
Francophile, the favored obstetrician in the 1930s and '40s was a
Professor Martin-Berard. The narrator of ``Birds of Passage''
imagines this fashionable doctor palpating his mother's belly and
sensing how she and her friends ``adored France without having a
drop of French blood in their veins, just as they knew Paris by
heart without ever having set foot there.'' He reflects:
</P>
<P>
   ``And what of us, the occupants of those bellies, the Rafiqs or
Nabils, Pauls or Pierres? You, monsieur, were our first contact
with the outside world. When our noses or rumps emerged, the hands
that hauled us out were French: France was there to greet us! In
other words, the concept of a motherland has never been too well
defined in our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sole's mischievous birth conceit is about not being too
well defined. Not every people can hew to Socrates' caution that
the unexamined life is not worth living. Sometimes it is only when
there is not too much examining that life remains possible. Perhaps
it was better, after all, when the vague ``Yugoslav'' was allowed
to blur the exactness of ``Serb'' and ``Croat.'' These weeks, along
the Garvaghy Road and other scenic routes in Northern Ireland, the
marching Orange Order has been defining those it claims to defend
to the point where most of them hardly recognize themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sole, born and raised in Egypt, writes a mix of fiction and
history to portray the life of one of the many minorities blown
about the Middle East. The narrator's grandfather, Georges
Batrakani, comes from a clan settled in Egypt for three generations
before him. In long languorous lunches _ Sole does them wonderfully
well _ uncles and cousins embroider dreamy variations on their
Syrian origins: from Lombardy or from a Greek Patriarch or, an aunt
insists, right back to the Crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   Identity, though, becomes not what you are but what you are not.
The grandmother's relatives left Syria two centuries earlier and,
like the Batrakanis, are not really Egyptian. They are not Muslim
either, of course, nor Roman Catholic nor Greek Orthodox. They
belong, along with the rest of their community, to a splinter Greek
Catholic sect in disputatious communion with Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians prospered in an Egypt ruled by the Ottomans, who
made a point of giving positions of trust and profit to foreigners,
even in the Court of Constantinople. Cut flowers are as decorative
as rooted ones, and they don't inconveniently grow or spread. When
the British took over in the early 1800s, they found a similar
convenience in these same educated and enterprising Syrians and
Greeks, aloof to the rising hungers of Egyptian nationalism. When
nationalism took over, in the army coup led by Nasser, the
aloofness paid its price. The minorities were gradually squeezed or
threatened out.
</P>
<P>
   In his three-generation story, Sole portrays the rise, golden
time and eventual scattered departure of the Batrakanis and their
circle. There is George's father, Elias, with no head for business.
He settled, instead, for a modest job with the British-run public
works department. His lifelong regret (regret is hope backward, and
sustains almost as well) was failing to get rich at the building of
the Suez Canal. A Cairo millionaire used to trace the origins of
his engineering fortune back to having imported 300 cats to solve
an advertised rat problem at the canal site. ``I thought of cats
too,'' Elias would chime in at family gatherings, ``but I was too
busy to answer the advertisement that day.''
</P>
<P>
   There is George's self-indulgent brother, Nando, who makes a
cheerful fortune buying up rural property and taking no account of
local resentments till the day he is murdered. There is George's
son Michel, who develops an obsession with Hussein Kamil, installed
by the British in 1914 with the title sultan (a move against
Germany's ally, the Ottoman sultan).
</P>
<P>
   Michel's obsession stems from childhood, when he was called on
to recite a La Fontaine fable during a royal school visit. The
Sultan recited ``The Grasshopper and the Ant'' in return. Michel's
glory lasts a lifetime: one more member of this Syrian clan who
pursues his illusions in Egypt without quite living there.
</P>
<P>
   Andre, another son, has a clearer vision. This is a result,
though, of studying abroad as a Jesuit (only in France did he learn
Arabic properly) and returning to take part in his order's
painstaking if slipping local involvement. He is the wisest of the
Batrakanis: arriving back in Cairo while King Farouk is still in
power, he sums up old Egypt in a remark about the baggy-trousered
traffic policemen: ``They conveyed all the wretchedness and
gentleness of a country that failed to take itself seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, of course, there is Georges, a man of great enterprise
and exuberant life: a minor Sun King to family and friends. They
share the pleasurable existence he provides for them: meals,
expeditions and long summers on the beaches of Alexandria. The key
to George's fortune is also the key to its decline. He achieves a
near monopoly manufacturing the tarboosh, or fez. It is the
national headgear of the old Egypt he lived in and kept an intimate
distance from. The new Egypt discards tarboosh and Baktrakanis,
though they move and prosper elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Birds of Passage,'' translated by John Brownjohn from the
French, is in a line of other, much greater works that evoke the
cosmopolitan redolence of the foreign communities in pre-Nasser
Egypt. The Greek-Egyptian Constantine Cavafy comes to mind, and
Lawrence Durrell's Alexandria Quartet; but most of all Andre
Aciman's recent ``Out of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   At its best, ``Birds'' is delightful, despite a junky subplot or
two and some thinly fictionalized history. But it is a long way
from Aciman's fictional memoir, which goes beyond a golden look
backward to send its characters into the world, their gold
devaluing as they live in the puzzlement, displacement, comedy and
regret of universal human exile.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Courtney Love's band mates in Hole were probably the
first to revive them, in long ago 1998. The fashion tyro Jeremy
Scott is rarely seen without one. Lara Flynn Boyle, the actress,
sported a sequined version to the Golden Globe Awards. The
alternative rocker Perry Farrell, the model Shalom Harlow and the
designer Stella McCartney are devotees of a fashion trend that
originates in the least fashionable arena you can imagine.
``Arena'' is intended literally here. What these people are wearing
generally started as souvenirs from that dubious rock genre: the
big-hair, heavy metal band.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely acknowledged that the perversity of taste knows no
limits. So it wasn't entirely surprising that, as the fashion time
machine lurched through the decades of the late 20th century, it
made stops at 1960s helmet hair, '70s glam rock, the '80s power
suit and the kitsch-pop '90s effusions of Hello Kitty. But who
could have predicted a vogue for Iron Maiden T-shirts, the older,
rattier and more reworked, the cooler?
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably says something about the willingness to accept
almost anything as a fashion statement without examination,'' said
Howard Kramer, the assistant curator at the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame in Cleveland, whose collection includes the original rock
T-shirt, made for an Elvis Presley concert in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Just as likely, the trend suggests something about pop culture's
renewable amnesia and appetite for cheesy aspects of the past.
``The kids who're wearing these band T-shirts wouldn't necessarily
have listened to this music in the first place,'' said Laura Wills,
whose Screaming Mimi stores in Manhattan and in Tokyo do a thriving
business in $80 T-shirts made for bands like Whitesnake, Rush or
Motley Crue. ``For one thing, they're too young.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one is too young, apparently, to escape being haunted by
irony. How else to explain a model, Sophie Dahl, impersonating
Debbie Harry in ads for Alexander McQueen eyewear? Or models sent
out wearing Joey Ramone bangs at Martin Margiela's fall 2000 show
for Hermes? Or the vision of Sarah Jessica Parker in ``Sex and the
City'' wearing an T-shirt showing David Bowie from the era of
Aladdin Sane?
</P>
<P>
   No longer just the province of independent retailers like Trash
and Vaudeville or Patricia Field, the trend has been seized on by
chains like Urban Outfitters, which promotes the stylishness of
T-shirts intended for the most antifashion cohort imaginable:
teen-age stoners who play air guitar. ``It's just, like, a big
thing _ everybody's doing it,'' said Billy Basinski, the proprietor
of Lady Bird, a store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The shirts
themselves are vintage, a rag trade euphemism for used. But in the
hands of Heidi Sjursen, the designer of Custom Heidi, they are
cleaned, fringed and studded with rhinestones and beads. ``She does
all that slicing, ribs them up and makes them totally trashy '80s
slut,'' Basinski said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Sjursen is through, the shirts look more like
something a mall rat might have worn to see Def Leppard play the
Meadowlands in the summer of '89.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stylists love them,'' Basinski said. ``Rock 'n' roll people
love them. The English love them. Americans can't afford them.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain of Sjursen's shirts, cut into halters, punctured with
grommets and sewn into dresses, retail for over $200. ``You can't
get enough AC/DC for the French,'' said Basinski, adding that other
hot sellers are dresses made from T-shirts of Farrah Fawcett Majors
in her best-known cheesecake pose and anything with Michael Jackson
with the black glove, circa ``Thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   The designer Stephen Sprouse once called a torn rock T-shirt and
slash of black eyeliner the perfect outfit for cocktails _ speaking
for guys. Rolling Stone called the T-shirt the ``ultimate rock
garment,'' proposing it as a ``$10 signifier.'' But even in the
early days of the rock T-shirt, which by consensus originated in
the late-'60s flowering of psychedelic rock in San Francisco, they
were rarely cheap. As early as 1974, Rolling Stone reported, fans
were offering $100 for thrusting tongue T-shirts marking the 1972
Rolling Stones American tour.
</P>
<P>
   The most democratic, adaptable and seasonless article of
apparel, the T-shirt most likely evolved from Civil War union suits
and the long john. It went on to become civilian America's uniform
after soldiers who had received them as standard issue came home
from World War II. Marlon Brando helped popularize T-shirts as
outer wear in ``The Wild One.'' But, Alice Harris wrote in ``The
White T'' (HarperCollins, 1996), it was not until Sen. John F.
Kennedy was photographed relaxing at his Georgetown town house in
1959 that the T-shirt, ``socially speaking, arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late '70s, three out of 10 Americans owned a T-shirt
bearing some sort of design. Some 48,000 T-shirt companies enjoyed
a total of $3 billion to $5 billion in revenues. ``T-shirts used to
be more of a premium piece than a commercial piece,'' Kramer of the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame said. ``People who had them invariably
worked security for the shows. They were swag.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until arena rock took hold that artists saw T-shirts
as ``an enormous revenue stream,'' Kramer said. ``They made a lot
of people a lot of money. Artists who never saw a dime out of
record sales used T-shirts as a way to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Given their ubiquity, vintage T-shirts do not seem to have
survived in enormous quantities. ``I scour the country,'' said
Wills, the proprietor of Screaming Mimi's, whose New York branch is
on Lafayette Street in Manhattan. ``I just found six good ones with
dates. There are tons of companies doing knockoffs of the old
shirts, but that's not what the kids want.'' Sjursen relies on a
Salvation Army connection in her hometown, which she declined to
name.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely the shirts worn until, as Sprouse put it, they
feel silky that are most coveted. ``The older, the better,'' Wills
said. ``The grungier, the better. People really like them worn.''
</P>
<P>
   The true rock faithful seek out T-shirt rarities: the infamous
Vivienne Westwood design for the Sex Pistols, depicting Queen
Elizabeth II pierced by a safety pin, or else shirts printed with
images of cult musicians, like the glam rock New York Dolls. For
the most part, however, people embrace the irony of wearing a
Whitesnake T-shirt to hip downtown events like the Thursday night
party Ultra, held at a club called Spa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hit a peak,'' said Ive Bjork, the assistant manager at
Patricia Field on West Eighth Street in Manhattan, where rock
T-shirts customized by designers known as Halah and Self Mart sell
for as much as $400. ``Stylists, men from Boston, everyone's buying
them,'' Bjork said. ``You get such a glimpse of what type of person
it is from what they're into.''
</P>
<P>
   At the store Filthmart on East 13th Street in Manhattan, whose
stock is mainly discontinued merchandise recovered from warehouses,
the top sellers are AC/DC, Motley Crue, Led Zeppelin and Iggy Pop.
At Sjursen's Web page, www.hoverground.com, the hot shirts of the
moment feature Skid Row and the American flag logo from the Rolling
Stones ``Steel Wheels'' tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out doing typical rocked-out T-shirts,'' said
Sjursen, whose new designs venture into the world of shirts with
cigarette ads. ``I did them all, Skid Row and Motley Crue. But
never Bon Jovi. I draw the line at Bon Jovi, OK?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - It's not that the title of Bo Banville's
autobiography, ``Bo Doesn't Live Here Anymore,'' isn't clever.
</P>
<P>
   It's a darn good name, really, for a book about a guy who's
lived in 22 states and overseas, gone to 28 schools, and won and
lost dozens of jobs, scores of women and thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that some sort of subtitle also seems called for _ a
warning, if you will. Something that cautions young men,
especially: Read. Laugh. Enjoy. Even ponder the more poignant
parts. But, whatever you do, Don't Try This at Home.
</P>
<P>
   Because Bo knows adventure. And Bo knows how to have a good
time. But Robert ``Bo'' Banville, 56, is the Evel Knievel of
business and personal relationships: He flies high and falls short,
catches fire and burns out, heals up and gets hurt again.
</P>
<P>
   Bo doesn't know boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   He's living a quiet life as a diamond salesman in Port St.
Lucie, Fla., now, and is known around the Treasure Coast as an
auctioneer for charity functions. But Banville, also known as Bo
Wyley in his younger years, spent most of his career as a disc
jockey at various radio stations, many in the South. And he still
has a bit of show biz left in him. Dressed to impress in a Tom
Wolfe white suit, he pours a glass of Zinfandel _ at 9:30 a.m. _
and explains how he came to write his tale of paternal sin and
personal salvation.
</P>
<P>
   He knows it's all a little hard to believe: The voluptuous
(37-22-36), violet-eyed wife who, unfortunately, had a dangerous
mean streak. The stint with an escort service that ended when he
found out one of his most attractive clients was actually a man.
The undercover work for the Drug Enforcement Administration,
keeping tabs on high-profile partiers.
</P>
<P>
   So Banville pulls out a montage of old newspaper clippings and
business cards to back up his claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in the book is factual,'' he says. ``With some
embellishments.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-huh ...
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, it would have been easier to write and sell as
fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go back to the reason I wrote the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is?
</P>
<P>
   ``To show that whatever happens in your life, you can overcome
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That message would have been lost, Banville says, if he'd gone
the fictional route. And there were some important stories to
relate along with all his outrageous tales about cheating hearts,
gorgeous groupies and promotional stunts at small-town radio
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took three months before he told his friend and
co-author, Arlene Lawless, ``the bad stuff.'' He struggled with
explaining the off-and-on relationship he's had with his daughters
(whose names, along with those of most of the women in Banville's
life, have been changed for the book).
</P>
<P>
   And he was embarrassed to tell her too much about the time he
hijacked the radio station in Kinston, N.C., in 1985. When she
called to verify the story, Lawless reports, ``they said they still
talk about it to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   But the hardest chapters to write were those discussing the
sexual and physical abuse Banville says his father, a career
military man, got away with for years. ``Part of me didn't want to
tell anybody what a monster he was,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He does, however, want others who have been abused to know that
it's possibions, no matter what happened in the past.
</P>
<P>
   That bit of inspiration was so important to him, he says, he and
Lawless decided to get the book to a wider audience as quickly as
possible by publishing it on iUniverse.com. It can be ordered
online for $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, if it sells, Banville will settle down. In the meantime,
though, he's gone through a few more women, jobs and addresses. And
there's a sequel in there, somewhere, he's sure.

<P>
   BRUNSWICK, Ga. - It has been an uneventful two weeks since July
4th revelry turned into a bottle-throwing, car-burning melee that
pitted blacks against police in a rundown section of this port
town.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the appearance of cordiality, though, anger remains.
</P>
<P>
   Monday evening, it surfaced when about 200 residents, preachers
and black community leaders gathered near the epicenter of the
disturbance to protest what they say is a pattern of police
harassment topped off by recent offensive comments by the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   A ``peace and unity'' rally was held at Albany and K streets,
next to the McIntyre Court public housing complex and within site
of the charred grass where a police cruiser was burned during the
disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   The march was organized by the Rev. Burnette Fulton Sr., who
earlier condemned the holiday weekend violence that marred the
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to carry a message that we as a black community don't
condone the actions of the perpetrators,'' Fulton said before the
rally. But he said the melee was spurred by long-simmering
grievances.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Fulton and his supporters marched 10 blocks from
Albany Street to the Old City Hall to bring their grievances to the
mayor's doorstep. The marchers filled much of Gloucester Street in
front of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Minister Odis Muhammad of the Nation of Islam called on Mayor
Brad Brown to meet with the demonstrators. ``The citizens of this
city have a problem and you shouldn't hide behind the walls of City
Hall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown did not attend the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Many black residents were angered earlier when Brown said those
involved in the holiday disturbance were ``all hoodlums, drug
dealers, pimps for prostitutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was messed up, what he said. That's a lie,'' Kendra
McCrae, a 28-year-old secretary, said Monday. McCrae witnessed the
violent episodes both in Brunswick and nearby St. Simons Island.
``He shouldn't down our community like this if he is the mayor of
Brunswick. He's just talking about black people like we're
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown stood his ground Monday. ``The folks crying foul really
need to look at the situation and the destructive damage that
occurred to public property and realize that these type actions put
a bad light on the community and do not foster peacefulness and
unity, he said.''
</P>
<P>
   McCrae said she was on the beach at St. Simons when the holiday
disturbance began. She said police sprayed pepper spray in her
direction, cursed her and told her to ``get off our beach and get
off our island.''
</P>
<P>
   Glynn County Police Chief Carl Alexander said Monday that was
``an absolute lie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not mistreated at the beach,'' Alexander said. ``Our
message to our (officers) is that you treat every person with
dignity and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Three men have been arrested as a result of the July 4th
outbreak. Police continue to look for other suspects. Two
nightclubs, which Brunswick police and elected officials say
contributed to the rowdy atmosphere, remain shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   The disquiet in Brunswick won't completely fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something needs to change,'' said McCrae. ``It's due. We're
due. We are human beings, just like them. It's time they treated us
like humans, not like wild, untamed animals.''

 WASHINGTON: particular surveillance.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The issue does not often arise today with the monitoring of
telephone conversations because when a law enforcement authority
wants to see a list of telephone calls made by a suspect, the agent
gets an order from a magistrate, presents the order to a telephone
company, and the company then turns over the list.
</P>
<P>
   In at least one instance, an Internet company did not cooperate
so readily with the government. In December, federal marshals
approached EarthLink _ a service provider with 4.2 million
subscribers _ with a court order permitting them to deploy a device
to register time, date and source information involving email sent
to and from a specified account.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned the device would record broader information, EarthLink
countered with a compromise: it would provide the government with
the requested information about e-mail senders and recipients,
according to Robert Corn-Revere, a lawyer for EarthLink, in recent
congressional testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Corn-Revere said that the government ultimately accepted the
compromise, but later became dissatisfied and wished to use its own
device. But a federal court rejected the company's request.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet companies have also been critical of Carnivore.
</P>
<P>
   William L. Schrader, chairman and chief executive of PsiNet, a
major commercial Internet service provider, said that the system
gives the FBI the ability to monitor e-mail of every person on a
given network. He said he would refuse to permit the government to
use the technology at PsiNet unless the agents could prove that it
could only sift out the traffic from a given individual that is the
target of a court order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I object to American citizens and any citizens of the world
always being subject to someone monitoring their email,'' said
Schrader, whose company serves about 100,000 business and more than
10 million users. ``I believe it's unconstitutional and I'll wait
for the Supreme Court to force me to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups, meanwhile, said that Monday's policy
announcement was an inadequate response to the growing controversy
over the deployment of Carnivore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's speech was camouflage to cover the mess that is
Carnivore,'' said Barry Steinhardt, an associate director of the
American Civil Liberties Union. ``In light of the public and
congressional criticism of Carnivore, we had hoped and expected far
more from an Administration that likes to tout its sensitivity to
privacy rights. Rather than glossing over Carnivore, Podesta should
have announced that the administration was suspending its use.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing growing concerns about Carnivore, Attorney General Janet
Reno said last Thursday that she would review whether the system is
being used consistent with privacy rights in the Constitution and
federal law. A subcommittee of the House is set to hold a hearing
next week on the system.
</P>
<P>
   While the civil liberties and privacy groups applauded giving
judges greater discretion to review certain kinds of requests for
surveillance, they were critical of other aspects of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, a research organization that studies privacy issues and
technology, criticized the administration for lowering the
standards for surveillance of cable modems rather than raising the
standards for telephone surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cable Act provides for one of the best privacy protections
in the United States,'' Rotenberg said. ``The question is whether
to harmonize up or harmonize down. Our view this harmonizes down.''
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials said the Cable Act never
contemplated that there would be broad use of cable modems for
e-mail traffic and that the standards used for obtaining warrants
for telephone surveillance should also apply to digital
communications through cable networks.

   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Not content with orchestrating a merger
with the London Stock Exchange, the chairman of the Frankfurt stock
exchange said Monday that he wanted to explore a full merger with
the Nasdaq market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement about their own plans to merge, the London Stock
Exchange and the Frankfurt exchange, or the Deutsche Borse, said
their real goal was to explore a complete partnership with Nasdaq,
which is run by the National Association of Securities Dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The two exchanges reiterated earlier statements that they wanted
to set up cross-shareholdings with Nasdaq as part of an effort to
set up a global trading system. But the statement Monday went
further.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Nasdaq said it was in discussions with the
Frankfurt and London exchanges about their relationship, but it was
``premature to discuss anything in further detail.''
</P>
<P>
   Werner Seifert, chief executive of Deutsche Borse in Frankfurt
and the man who is slated to run the combined London-Frankfurt
operation, said Monday that global connections were increasingly
critical to success.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a final objective, a European goal is not far reaching
enough and that's why we are talking with Nasdaq,'' Seifert said at
a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Deutsche Borse said they had viewed a full merger
with Nasdaq as an appealing possibility for months.
</P>
<P>
   But industry executives predict it will be a long while before
Seifert pulls off such a trans-Atlantic merger. For one thing,
there is still resistance in London and Frankfurt to the proposed
merger of the two European exchanges, which is to be called iX.
</P>
<P>
   Frankfurt brokers are already worried that Nasdaq's European
operations, linked to iX, will be based in London and will take
business from Frankfurt.

 WASHINGTON: particular surveillance.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The issue does not often arise today with the monitoring of
telephone conversations because when a law enforcement authority
wants to see a list of telephone calls made by a suspect, the agent
gets an order from a magistrate, presents the order to a telephone
company, and the company then turns over the list.
</P>
<P>
   In at least one instance, an Internet company did not cooperate
so readily with the government. In December, federal marshals
approached EarthLink _ a service provider with 4.2 million
subscribers _ with a court order permitting them to deploy a device
to register time, date and source information involving email sent
to and from a specified account.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned the device would record broader information, EarthLink
countered with a compromise: it would provide the government with
the requested information about e-mail senders and recipients,
according to Robert Corn-Revere, a lawyer for EarthLink, in recent
congressional testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Corn-Revere said that the government ultimately accepted the
compromise, but later became dissatisfied and wished to use its own
device. But a federal court rejected the company's request.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet companies have also been critical of Carnivore.
</P>
<P>
   William L. Schrader, chairman and chief executive of PsiNet, a
major commercial Internet service provider, said that the system
gives the FBI the ability to monitor e-mail of every person on a
given network. He said he would refuse to permit the government to
use the technology at PsiNet unless the agents could prove that it
could only sift out the traffic from a given individual that is the
target of a court order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I object to American citizens and any citizens of the world
always being subject to someone monitoring their email,'' said
Schrader, whose company serves about 100,000 business and more than
10 million users. ``I believe it's unconstitutional and I'll wait
for the Supreme Court to force me to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups, meanwhile, said that Monday's policy
announcement was an inadequate response to the growing controversy
over the deployment of Carnivore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's speech was camouflage to cover the mess that is
Carnivore,'' said Barry Steinhardt, an associate director of the
American Civil Liberties Union. ``In light of the public and
congressional criticism of Carnivore, we had hoped and expected far
more from an Administration that likes to tout its sensitivity to
privacy rights. Rather than glossing over Carnivore, Podesta should
have announced that the administration was suspending its use.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing growing concerns about Carnivore, Attorney General Janet
Reno said last Thursday that she would review whether the system is
being used consistent with privacy rights in the Constitution and
federal law. A subcommittee of the House is set to hold a hearing
next week on the system.
</P>
<P>
   While the civil liberties and privacy groups applauded giving
judges greater discretion to review certain kinds of requests for
surveillance, they were critical of other aspects of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, a research organization that studies privacy issues and
technology, criticized the administration for lowering the
standards for surveillance of cable modems rather than raising the
standards for telephone surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cable Act provides for one of the best privacy protections
in the United States,'' Rotenberg said. ``The question is whether
to harmonize up or harmonize down. Our view this harmonizes down.''
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials said the Cable Act never
contemplated that there would be broad use of cable modems for
e-mail traffic and that the standards used for obtaining warrants
for telephone surveillance should also apply to digital
communications through cable networks.

PROSECUTORS SAY SCHEME EXPLOITED RUSSIAN TASTE FOR CHICKEN LEGS
</HEADLINE>
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Using forged documents and shipments of frozen
chicken legs to Eastern Europe, a father and son from Westchester,
N.Y., with links to Russian organized crime stole more than $35
million from banks and financiers in Latvia and the United States,
Manhattan prosecutors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The men, Nickolai and Serguei Kouznetsov, who already face a
half-dozen civil lawsuits in Florida, Illinois and New York, and an
accomplice were indicted Monday on charges that they sold _ and
resold _ the same chicken legs to multiple buyers.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, one Latvian bank lent them $3.5
million on the basis of forged documents stating that 6 million
pounds of chicken were in a Florida warehouse, when they had
already been sold abroad and shipped to Tallinn, Estonia.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments mark the first stage of an investigation into
the scheme, which exploited a Russian love of dark-meat chicken,
one of America's largest exports to that country, said Robert
Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The younger suspect and the only one in custody, Serguei
Kouznetsov, 28, was arrested on Friday at his mother-in-law's house
in Lindenhurst, N.Y., the authorities said. He was denied bail
Monday after an assistant district attorney, Clark Abrams, told the
judge that, according to international law enforcement officials,
Kouznetsov had worked with Russian organized crime members.
</P>
<P>
   ``His position is that he's not guilty and he's going to contest
the charges vigorously,'' said Kouznetsov's lawyer, Austin
Campriello, who also said that his client had an American-born wife
and twin boys who turned 2 years old on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that his father, Nickolai, 50, along with Igor
Ilchenko, 38, who owns an Estonian company, were fugitives and
might be in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury also indicted two corporations run by the
Kouznetsovs, NASL Corp. in Manhattan and Claremont Trading in
Tortola, the British Virgin Islands, and an Estonian corporation
run by Ilchenko, Joint Stock Co. Trendors.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the scheme began on Long Island, where the
Kouznetsovs sold frozen chicken-leg quarters, along with whole
chickens, beef liver, turkey thighs and hot dogs, to various
chicken exporters. Among those exporters was one of the largest
such U.S. companies, Trans Commodities Inc., based in New York City
and run by Sam Kislin, who has been a contributor to Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and other New York politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the indictment, the Kouznetsovs did not stop at
selling the chicken legs once. They obtained a loan from the
Paritate Bank in Latvia by using as collateral false warehouse
receipts showing that more than 6 million pounds of chicken were
being stored in a warehouse in Pensacola, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of the warehouse receipts, the Paritate Bank wired
$3.5 million to the Kouznetsovs' account at the Bank of New York.
But the chicken had already been sold to another purchaser and was
on a ship on its way to Estonia, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Monday whether investors had made any
independent effort to verify whether the chicken actually existed.
``There are a lot of suckers at that bank,'' said John Moscow,
deputy chief of the Manhattan district attorney's investigation
division.
</P>
<P>
   In this manner, the men stole 130 million pounds of chicken
worth more than $35 million, pledging it to financial institutions
in return for loans while selling it to other purchasers instead,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment filed by Morgenthau's office covers only the $3.5
million loan from the Paritate Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme was far larger, according to a civil lawsuit filed by
the insurer Lloyd's of London in federal court in New York. The
lawsuit states that four financial companies insured by Lloyd's
have lost $38 million in stolen chicken.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, the four companies discovered that the
64,000 tons of chicken they supposedly owned had disappeared from
warehouses and ships, had been sold to others, and that they had
been duped with a trail of false documents, including shipping
bills, warehouse receipts and even forged certificates from the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors declined to comment on whether any of those who
financed the chicken purchases or bought the chicken from NASL were
under investigation, but they emphasized a wide-scale and
continuing inquiry. Morgenthau said, ``This is a case that has
legs.''

GERMANS SIGN AGREEMENT TO PAY $5 BILLION TO NAZI-FORCED LABORERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ It has been 55 years since Karel Horak was forced to
work at Czech factories seized by Hitler's forces. On Monday, as he
watched with the patience acquired over a long life, the United
States and Germany approved a $5 billion agreement to compensate
forced laborers like him from the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope they can move quickly,'' Horak said, ``because I
am already 80 years old. People around me are dying very rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Horak, who is vice president of an association in Prague, Czech
Republic, of former forced workers, said, ``We had 640,000 forced
laborers at the end of the war, and now there are only 61,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, after a half-century of denial and two years of grueling
negotiations, German government and industry leaders formally
signed an agreement that is intended to bring at least legal
closure to the last remaining claims arising from atrocities of the
Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the German government and German companies
will contribute equally to a $5 billion fund to compensate former
laborers, possibly more than 1 million of them, who were slave
workers in concentration camps or forced laborers in German
factories.
</P>
<P>
   Former slave workers are entitled to payments of about $7,500.
Former forced laborers are entitled to about $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Other victims, such as people who had their property seized or
who were victims of Nazi medical experiments, will also be able to
file for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the agreement, President Clinton has pledged
that the United States will do everything it can to block new
class-action lawsuits brought in the United States against German
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   It is a historic bargain, because it is intended to compensate
Nazi-era victims in more than 20 countries, from Poland and Ukraine
to Russia and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small minority of the people have ever set foot in the
United States, but the United States assumed the lead negotiating
role with Germany because American class-action lawyers had filed
lawsuits on behalf of victims from around the world against German
companies like DaimlerChrysler, Siemens and Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   There are still a few snags, including the fact that German
companies have raised only half the amount they have pledged. But
people on all sides of the talks predicted Monday that the money is
not in serious doubt. With any luck, they said, survivors would
start receiving payments sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fulfills a void that has existed for 55 years,'' said
Stuart Eizenstat, the U.S. deputy secretary for the Department of
the Treasury, who led negotiations for the American government.
``This had never been dealt with. It had fallen off the agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who brought the cases will earn about $50 million, but
that is just 1 percent of the total, Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has paid nearly $100 billion in various forms of
compensation and support to Jewish groups, the state of Israel and
to Central European countries that the Germans invaded during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   But surviving forced laborers received little or nothing,
largely because German corporations insisted that the government
was responsible. And former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who controlled
the government from 1982 to 1998, adamantly refused to contribute
any public money to the workers.
</P>
<P>
   But two things abruptly changed the picture. The first was the
successful use of American class-action lawsuits against Swiss
banks, which had been accused of hoarding wealth in dormant
accounts set up by Holocaust victims. The suits never went to trial
and the Swiss banks agreed to settle out of court with promises to
pay $1.25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss case quickly prompted American lawyers to take aim at
German corporations, particularly on the issue of forced labor.
Though none of the cases have succeeded in court, and two were
rejected by federal courts, the threat of prolonged litigation and
nightmarish publicity was terrifying to companies like
DaimlerChrysler and Deutsche Bank, which do vast amounts of
business in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The other big change was Gerhard Schroeder's election as
chancellor in late 1998. Almost immediately, Schroeder announced
his desire to create a foundation that would compensate victims and
that would be funded in part with government money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the government's willingness to contribute, we could
never have gotten up to the minimum level we needed,'' Eizenstat
said in an interview Monday. ``The fact that the government came in
at a time when it was cutting its own budget is remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, presiding over the signing ceremonies, seemed mainly
relieved that the negotiations were finally over. When German
businesses first proposed a settlement two years ago, they offered
1.5 billion marks, or about $750 million at current exchange rates.
Attorneys representing survivors, by contrast, were making demands
as high as $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While Eizenstat led negotiations with Count Otto Lambsdorff, who
represented German industry, many Central European leaders felt
they had been relegated to the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were invited to be guests, to be observers, but not to be
direct participants,'' complained Jerzy Kranz, head of the Polish
delegation to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat denied excluding Central European leaders from the key
discussions, and he noted that most of the money will go to
survivors in Central Europe. And despite the somewhat injured
feelings, representatives from Poland, the Czech Republic, Russia,
Belarus and Ukraine all supported the final agreement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Noach Flug, a former slave worker in Poland who now represents
the International Auschwitz Committee in Jerusalem, said the final
agreement was far better for all of the victims' groups than what
German corporations or the German government originally proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final agreement is completely different,'' Flug said. ``It
is 50 years late and 80 percent of the people have already died,
but it is at least something.''

TERRORISM SUSPECT WAIVES EXTRADITON HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ An Algerian indicted in the United States on charges
of terrorism waived his right to an extradition hearing Monday and
will be turned over to the Americans in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Mokhtar Haouari, was indicted last Jan. 6 in New
York on charges of helping another Algerian living here, Ahmed
Ressam, who was arrested in December as he traveled into Washington
state from Canada. The police say Ressam's car carried explosives
and other bomb-making equipment as he crossed the border on Dec.
14.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari, 31, was arrested later in January in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers did not complete the arrangements to expedite Haouari's
transfer to the United States until minutes before his extradition
hearing was to have begun Monday. After Haouari had read and signed
the agreement, Judge Lise Cote ordered him turned over to the
Americans without delay. Haouari will remain in custody and leave
for New York after Canada has approved its paperwork, which could
take up to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari's lawyer, Joseph Elfassy, said Haouari wanted to face
the charges promptly and move on. ``We are convinced now that there
will not be enough proof to find him guilty,'' Elfassy said. ``so
our position was not to drag the case any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Haouari admits knowing Ressam, but denies any involvement in
terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
   Had Haouari followed the two-and-a-half-year extradition process
in Canada, the United States could have charged him only with the
six offenses cited in the extradition request. Waived his right to
a hearing means that the Justice Department can bring new charges.
</P>
<P>
   Elfassy was confident, saying: ``We are convinced that the
United States will not charge him with any offenses other than the
ones he faces already. So we agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said he had decided to change tactics after a court
in Los Angeles had postponed Ressam's trial until February 2001.
Elfassy had wanted Ressam to testify at Haouari's trial in New
York, a move that seems a highly unlikely prospect now, because of
the postponement.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari's waiver closely follows an arrest by the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police on June 26 of Mohamed Zeki Mahjoub, who, the
Canadian Security and Intelligence Service says, is a terrorist
leader closely allied with Osama bin Laden.

CANADA'S WINSPEAR DIAMONDS REJECTS OFFER FROM DE BEERS AS
INADEQUATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ De Beers Consolidated Mines, the South African diamond
giant, is finding unexpectedly tough resistance to its expansion
into a potentially lucrative property in the Canadian north.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers is thought likely to eventually gain control of its
first North American diamond mine by purchasing Winspear Diamonds,
a small Vancouver-based company. Winspear owns a site at Snap Lake,
about 150 miles northeast of Yellowknife, in the Northwest
Territories, that it calls one of the richest undeveloped diamond
properties in the world. It is putting up a fight that could make
success for De Beers more expensive than the big company
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian diamonds are regarded as especially important to De
Beers now because the company is trying to avoid marketing diamonds
mined in African war zones. Last week, it pledged not to trade with
companies that profit from diamonds used to finance African
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   On June 26, De Beers offered 259 million Canadian dollars, or
roughly $175 million, for Winspear. Although that was a 77 percent
premium to the price of Winspear's shares, the company's board
called the offer opportunistic and inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Winspear moved to back up that contention,
saying that under new projections, the size of its ore reserves had
tripled and the potential rate of production would double.
</P>
<P>
   That sounded implausible to De Beers, particularly since
Winspear based the new projections on drilling information not
disclosed in a prospectus to shareholders a month earlier. De Beers
officials called the projections an attempt to thwart its takeover
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No reserve has yet been defined on the Snap Lake property,''
said Richard Molyneaux, president of De Beers Canada. He said
excavation of the ore on the Winspear property ``at a relatively
low depth, under a lake, has not been undertaken anywhere in the
world, and brings with it a number of significant risks.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Winspear's chief executive, Randy Turner, formally
rejected De Beers' price, and said it had been approached by other
companies, which could lead to a higher offer.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said the new projections put the value of the Snap Lake
property at 1.35 billion Canadian dollars, or more than $900
million, and that previous assessments made the property worth at
least 500 million Canadian dollars _ almost twice what De Beers had
offered.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the world's production of new diamonds comes from De
Beers, and two-thirds of the gems sold go through its distribution
system. The company missed out on early exploration in Canada, but
has become more determined since Molyneaux, an experienced mine
operator in South Africa, arrived early this year. De Beers gets 35
percent of the output from the Ekati mine in the Northwest
Territories, but has no operation of its own.

LAW STUDENT PLEADS GUILTY TO STEALING MALCOLM X'S DIARY FROM
COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three days into his trial on charges of grand
larceny, a former court clerk pleaded guilty Monday to stealing the
diary of Malcolm X from an evidence safe in Manhattan state Supreme
Court, where he worked.
</P>
<P>
   The clerk, Douglas Henderson, 41, had already admitted to
prosecutors that in 1991 he stole the diary, which the civil rights
leader had in his jacket pocket when he was assassinated at a
Manhattan ballroom in 1965. But he decided to go to trial anyway in
hopes of being cleared.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Henderson, who is a law student at New York Law
School, pleaded guilty before Judge Jeffrey M. Atlas in State
Supreme Court in Manhattan, swiftly concluding a trial in which two
of Malcolm X's daughters were expected to testify Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 146-page diary was first discovered missing from court
archives last May, when a private collector in California planned
to sell it through the auction house of Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield.
The mock-leather diary, which was bloodstained and bullet-pocked,
contained the phone numbers of Malcolm X's friends and a schedule
of planned appearances. One expert at the auction house estimated
its sale would bring $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The diary had been part of the evidence at the trial of three
men who were convicted of killing Malcolm X, and was supposed to
remain in the archives of the case. When Henderson stole the diary,
he left behind an empty evidence file in the safe marked ``1965 Red
Diary with Three Bullet Holes.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, he sold it to a memorabilia dealer, Mark
Schafler, for $5,000. After his arrest, Henderson at first said
that he had planned to return it to Malcolm X's family.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, who apparently has long been fascinated with Malcolm
X, attended the prestigious Horace Mann School in the Bronx,
graduated from Lehman College, and is now a second-year student at
New York Law School.
</P>
<P>
   He worked as a top assistant of the tennis player Jimmy Connors,
and was a friend of Arthur Ashe and former Mayor David Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   He said was reluctant to plead guilty initially because of his
aspirations to be a lawyer, people involved in the case said. If
convicted, he faces seven years in prison.

Usually, when hail descends on the picturesque apple orchards of the
Hudson Valley, it strikes fitfully, creating havoc on a farmer's
field of Empires, say, but sparing his McIntoshes.  But this spring's
hail was  different. Two storms pelted newly formed apples with
jagged balls of ice on more than 7,000 acres. Ordinarily, apple
farmers would curse Mother Nature and hope for better luck. But a
number of forces -- from depressed prices resulting from a worldwide
glut to spotty insurance coverage to consumer demand for flawless
fruit -- have pushed Hudson Valley farmers to the brink. (Suzanne

IN CONTEMPT CASE, STARR'S FORMER SPOKESMAN DENIES MISLEADING A
JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Charles G. Bakaly III, the former spokesman for the
independent counsel Kenneth Starr, testified Monday that he never
misled a federal judge about the role he had played as a source for
an article in The New York Times that discussed whether President
Clinton could be indicted while in office.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the stand in his defense at a trial in which he is
charged with criminal contempt, Bakaly insisted that there was
nothing untruthful in a sworn declaration he had provided to the
judge. In it he said he had never provided any ``nonpublic
information'' to The Times for the article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it true?'' Michele A. Roberts, a defense lawyer, asked
Bakaly about his signed statement to the court in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes it was,'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it remain true today?'' Roberts asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes it does,'' Bakaly said.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration was provided to Judge Norma Holloway Johnson,
the chief judge of the federal district court here, by the office
of the independent counsel during an investigation into whether
anyone in the office had leaked the information that led to the
article.
</P>
<P>
   After the declaration was filed, Bakaly gradually disclosed to
investigators that he had provided the newspaper with some
documents in connection with the article. He also told
investigators that he may he have inadvertently confirmed some of
the information that he said the reporter, Don Van Natta Jr., had
told him he had learned from sources outside the counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   When the office learned of these later disclosures by Bakaly, it
informed Johnson that the original declaration was inaccurate.
Johnson charged Bakaly with criminal contempt and is hearing the
case without a jury. Bakaly could face up to six months in prison
if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly, a 44-year-old lawyer from California, offered a
two-pronged defense Monday.
</P>
<P>
   First, he argued that in an effort to steer Van Natta from
writing the article, he had provided information that was not
secret but was in documents already in the public record.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he argued that fellow lawyers in Starr's office had
omitted some changes he had proposed in the declaration, which
would have provided a more complete account of his dealings with
Van Natta.
</P>
<P>
   The Times article, published on Jan. 31, 1999, cited unnamed
associates of Starr as saying the independent counsel had concluded
that he had the constitutional authority to indict Clinton while he
was still serving as president.
</P>
<P>
   The article was published when the Senate was considering
whether to convict Clinton on impeachment charges voted by the
House. Clinton's lawyers complained that the article was an effort
by the independent counsel's office to influence the impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said Monday the reporter had come to him with information
he said he had learned from sources outside the office about
internal deliberations on whether to indict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said he first told him that his sources might not be well
informed. He also sent Van Natta part of an internal memorandum
about how Leon F. Jaworski, the independent prosecutor during
Watergate, had felt about the issue in connection with President
Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly testified he regretted having sent that document.
Although it was historical and factual, he said, providing the
document ``caused harm to the morale in the office and harmed my
colleagues.'' But he continued: ``The key thing is I did not give
him any nonpublic information or information that related to grand
jury matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination by John Griffith, a Justice Department
lawyer, Bakaly acknowledged he did not initially admit he had been
the source for some of the information in the article.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith asked Bakaly about a meeting in the office of
independent counsel the Monday after the article appeared. He asked
Bakaly if he had told lawyers at the meeting that there were parts
of the article for which he had been responsible. Bakaly said it
did not come up in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson urged Bakaly to answer more directly. Then he said,
``No,'' he had not talked about his role in the article.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-examination continues Tuesday.

GORE AND BUSH DEBATE HYPOTHETICAL ISSUE: EXECUTION OF A PREGNANT
WOMAN
</HEADLINE>
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ The national debate over the death penalty took
an odd turn Monday when Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas each discussed what to do in the hypothetical case of
a pregnant woman facing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the issue was one of abortion rights: He would let the
woman decide whether the execution should be delayed, allowing her
the option of whether or not to give birth.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, who has presided over more executions than any other
governor in the country, it was a matter of pointing to the
compassion in his conservatism. He said he would support delaying
such an execution ``because there's a second life involved.''
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, the issue has apparently been moot.
Experts on the death penalty said the situation had never arisen on
the federal level since Congress created an exclusion for pregnant
women when it expanded the federal death penalty law in 1994.
Several states, including Texas, have also enacted such exclusions,
but no experts reached Monday could remember a single case in which
a pregnant woman faced execution.
</P>
<P>
   The question first came up on Sunday in an interview with Gore
on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press.'' The vice president, who
backs the death penalty, was asked whether he would support it if
the condemned prisoner happened to be pregnant. Gore replied that
he was unfamiliar the issue and would have to examine it.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, Gore said he would allow a pregnant
woman to choose whether to delay her execution until she gave
birth. ``The principle of a woman's right to choose governs in that
case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At an earlier news conference in Little Rock, Ark., Bush tweaked
Gore for his answer in the television interview, saying he was
``surprised, frankly,'' that the vice president had needed time to
think about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty opponents said that the subject was a bit far
afield in the larger debate on capital punishment but that it
nonetheless underscored the kind of harsh reality involved in
putting people to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``This question is yet another illustration of the fact that the
discussion and debate around the issue is becoming more specific
and less abstract,'' said Diann Rust-Tierney, director of the
capital punishment project at the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Gore addressed the issue after flying here to his home state
Monday, armed with new poll numbers showing his race with Bush
growing tighter.
</P>
<P>
   He continued his attack on Bush's record in Texas and, in
casting his own candidacy in classic Democratic terms as a fight
for the disadvantaged, made personal reference to his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of what this campaign is all about, I think of my
own upbringing,'' he told a gathering of his field workers from the
50 states at a rally in Nashville, his campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two sets of really good friends, one in Washington,
D.C., and the other in Carthage, Tenn.,'' he said of his
son-of-a-senator winters and his family-farm summers. He said the
friends in Washington came from well-to-do families, went to
college and enjoyed lots of advantages. The ones in Tennessee, he
said, ``were just as bright _ at least as bright _ and had at least
as much potential as the ones I grew up with in Washington, but
they did not have the same opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   This disparity ``broke my heart, because I saw that they did not
get what they deserved in life by virtue of their talent and their
potential,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I travel around this country today,'' he added, ``I see
young men and women and Americans of all ages like my friends who I
know deserve to have the barriers removed, the opportunities opened
up so that they can reach their full potential.''
</P>
<P>
   This theme dovetails with the policy formulations Gore has been
developing over the last several weeks, particularly as he rails
against the ``special interests'' like big oil that he says Mr.
Bush is serving.
</P>
<P>
   This was officially Commerce Secretary William Daley's first day
as Gore campaign chairman, and, in a Nashville briefing with
campaign workers from around the country that that was closed to
reporters, the vice president pointed to a new CNN/USA Today poll
that showed him trailing Bush by only 2 points, 43 percent to 45
percent; that was considerably closer than last month's CNN poll,
which had Gore trailing by 12 points. A new CBS poll also showed
Gore narrowing the race, to 2 percentage points, 41 percent to 43
percent; in mid-May, Gore trailed in that poll by 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch with his mother and a conference with campaign
strategists, Gore greeted the dozens of workers who staff his
Nashville headquarters. Standing on a chair, surrounded by the
mostly college-age crowd, he adopted the language that his
daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 26, uses on the campaign trail to
reach her under-30 audiences.
</P>
<P>
   In appealing to their sense of idealism, Gore warned the young
workers to avoid the ``ironic detachment'' that afflicts the
cynical. He said some people became detached because they were
afraid that if they gave their hearts to something, they would only
be let down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give it everything you have got, he exhorted them, ``and then
some.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference later in the day, Gore was asked how he
would square his criticism that Bush had mismanaged the state
budget in Texas with his earlier assertions that Bush was a weak
governor who had little power.
</P>
<P>
   ``What power he does have he has used to ill effect,'' Gore
replied. He called Bush's budget a ``two-page ditty'' that served
only the special interests.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of his record as governor, Bush has often noted that
the people of Texas re-elected him in 1998 with nearly 70 percent
of the vote. To that, Gore scoffed on Monday, ``People in the other
49 states vote in this election.''

   THE POLLS
</P>
<P>
   BUSH LEAD GETS SMALLER  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three new polls taken over the weekend indicate that Gov. George
W. Bush's lead over Vice President Al Gore is narrowing. A CBS News
survey shows Bush leading Gore, 43 to 41 percent, down from his
47-to-39 edge in May. A Zogby poll has Bush holding a 45-to-41
lead, compared to a 47-to-39 edge a month ago. And a USA Today/CNN
Gallup poll has Bush leading Gore 48-to-46, compared to 50-to-41 a
week ago. The CBS poll covered 596 adults and had a margin of
sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, meaning the
Bush lead was statistically insignificant. Significantly, however,
Bush's potential voters were more likely than his rival's to say
they supported him enthusiastically. And when people who leaned to
Bush or Gore were added to those firmly committed, Bush led 46 to
43. When Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party and Ralph Nader of the
Green Party were added to the poll, Bush beat Gore, 42 to 37, and
Nader and Buchanan got 4 percent each. In the Zogby poll, which
surveyed 890 likely voters and had a three percentage point
sampling error, Bush led Gore, 43 to 37, when other candidates were
added, with Nader getting 6 percent and Buchanan receiving 3
percent. In the USA/CNN poll, which surveyed 1,063 registered
voters over the weekend and has a four percentage point error
margin, Bush led Gore, 45 to 43, when other candidates were added,
with Nader picking up 5 percent and Buchanan getting 3 percent. The
USA/CNN poll showed Gore gained support from women and independents
in the past week, apparently helped by the endorsement of former
Sen. Bill Bradley.

   HOUSE SPENDING RECORD LIKELY TO FALL  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's only July and already the hard-fought congressional contest
in the Los Angeles suburbs between Rep. James E. Rogan, R-Pasadena,
and State Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, is on the verge of becoming
the most expensive House race in American history. With about $7.5
million raised so far, the candidates seem all but certain to
surpass the $8 million record set in Georgia in the 1996 contest
between then-Speaker Newt Gingrich and his Democratic challenger,
Michael Coles. Rogan, one of the House impeachment managers in the
case against President Clinton, is facing a stiff challenge in a
once-Republican district that has been trending more Democratic in
recent years. Liberal groups have made Rogan one of the year's top
targets in the Democratic effort to regain control of the House,
and by the time independent expenditures by outside groups are
factored in, the overall cost of the race is sure to be even
higher.

 FIGURING SHARES POST SPIN-OFF
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY ARTHUR LOUIS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: I am a Hewlett-Packard shareholder who received shares of
Agilent Technologies recently when HP spun it off. Can you tell me
how to figure the cost basis for the Agilent shares and the new
cost basis for my HP shares?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Take the original cost basis of the HP shares and
multiply by 0.78. That is the new cost basis for the HP shares.
Divide the number of HP shares into that result to get your
per-share cost basis for HP.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder _ 0.22 times the original cost of your HP shares _
will be your cost basis for Agilent. Divide the number of Agilent
shares into that figure to get your per-share cost basis.
</P>
<P>
   HP says the Internal Revenue Service declared the Agilent
distribution tax-free. This means that you don't have to pay taxes
on the Agilent shares immediately _ only if you sell them, in which
case you could be liable for a capital-gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   So you also will want to know the official purchase date of your
Agilent shares: It is the same as the purchase date for your HP
shares.
</P>
<P>
   An HP spokesman says you should have received materials at the
time of the distribution that would have answered your question. It
may be that you discarded them without looking them over.

   Early 401(k) Withdrawals
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am sitting on a large amount of money in a 401(k) plan, am
under age 55 and no longer employed by the company whose plan it
is. Can I take distributions from the plan now without paying the
10 percent penalty tax for early withdrawal?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been different if you had left the employer during
or after the year in which you reach age 55, says Joe Calderaro,
technical coordinator with the Internal Revenue Service. In that
case, you could have taken advantage of a quirky exception to the
rule that normally requires you to wait for distributions until age
591/2 to avoid the penalty tax.
</P>
<P>
   Switching Stockbrokers
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have two accounts with a discount broker _ a standard
account and a Roth individual retirement account. This broker's
performance was excellent until this year, but now I want to find
another broker. I wonder whether switching will trigger a taxable
event _ capital gains _ in my standard account. And what about the
Roth? Will I have to pay some sort of penalty tax?
</P>
<P>
   A: You won't be hit with a capital-gains tax in your standard
account unless you sell shares of stock that have risen in value
since you bought them. It isn't necessary to do that merely because
you are switching brokers. Just sign the standard forms authorizing
your next broker to transfer your account intact from your present
broker. The stock will go to the new broker in the form of stock,
the cash in the form of cash.
</P>
<P>
   You also can roll over your IRA without penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Such transfers are done all the time, without tax-related
hitches _ and that's as it should be. It wouldn't be fair to
penalize you because your broker turned sour. And it wouldn't be
fair to give lousy brokers such a powerful grip on their
dissatisfied customers.

GEORGIA-PACIFIC PAYING $7.5 BILLION FOR FORT JAMES; EARNINGS BEAT
FORECASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Georgia-Pacific Group said Monday that it would buy the Fort
James Corp. for $7.5 billion in cash and stock, creating the
world's largest maker of tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Based on closing prices on Friday, the deal calls for
Georgia-Pacific to pay $37.17 for each share of Fort James, 80
percent in cash and 20 percent in stock. It will also assume $3.5
billion in debt. The combined company will have about $25 billion
in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific will divest 250,000 tons of tissue capacity to
ward off potential Justice Department objections. And it will
divest some commodity operations to raise cash.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition surprised many analysts. Georgia-Pacific has
been steadily adding to its portfolio of retail and away-from-home
papers _ tissues, napkins and other products used in businesses and
restaurants _ and owns AngelSoft, Coronet and other well-known
brands. Still, it derived more than 90 percent of its $17.8 billion
in revenue last year from lumber, paperboard and other highly
cyclical commodity papers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, most analysts saw the company as more similar to commodity
paper companies like International Paper and Weyerhaueser than to
tissue producers like Procter &AMP; Gamble and Kimberly-Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured G-P would acquire other commodity paper companies,
or maybe be bought itself,'' said Mark Wilde, an analyst with
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, though, Georgia-Pacific has been telegraphing its
search for ways to unleash itself from the cyclical pulp and paper
market for some time. In late 1997, it created a tracking stock for
its timber operations. And during the last two years, it bought the
Chesapeake Corp.'s tissue operations and Unisource Worldwide, a
distributor of office paper, washroom supplies and janitorial
services. Earlier this month, it bought exclusive rights to
distribute the Xerox Corp.'s printer and copier papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been moving away from a commodity, raw material-based
strategy, and you can expect us to continue that,'' said A.D.
Correll, Georgia-Pacific's chairman and chief executive. The
company's second-quarter earnings, which it also released Monday,
puts Correll's yen for higher-margin products into focus. The
company's pulp and paper business had a strong quarter, but weak
demand and prices for its building-products segment pulled profit
down to $206 million, about $5 million less than in the quarter a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Per-share earnings of $1.20 beat analysts' forecasts of $1.16,
but Charles Hill, director of research at First Call/Thomson
Financial, which tracks company earnings, said most analysts had
cut their estimates in anticipation of a bad quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Fort James, which owns well-known brands like Quilted Northern,
Brawny and Dixie Cups, does own some pulp plants, but it uses much
of its production for its tissues. If the merger goes through,
Georgia-Pacific will command about a third of the North American
market for retail and away-from-home paper.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the prospect does not thrill investors. Shares of
Georgia-Pacific fell $2.25, to $26.375. Fort James soared $8.4375,
to $33. ``They'll have to really show that this merger will work
before the Street will buy into it,'' said Wilde of Deutsche Banc
Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Fort James will not be easy for Georgia-Pacific to digest. Fort
James was formed in 1997 when James River and Fort Howard merged,
and it has had a rough time integrating back-office operations and
product lines.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific recently installed a sophisticated software
system that ties in all its operations, from orders to production
to accounts receivable to human resources, and analysts expect it
to add Fort James' operations to the system as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific, which already carries about $6.5 billion in
debt, is borrowing $10 billion more to finance the deal. Correll
has said he wants to get debt down to $9.5 billion by early 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Correll said divestitures would accomplish much of that, but he
declined to identify what those would be. But Wilde suggested that
lumber operations were ``high on the hit list.''
</P>
<P>
   Correll also promised that by the third year of the merger, he
would have wrested at least $500 million in annual costs out of the
combined companies. He added that he had already pinpointed ``a
fair number of job reductions'' and would soon deliver the news to
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Fort James' top management seemed to be on that list. Miles
Marsh, Fort James' chief executive, was not included in Monday's
conference call with analysts.

EX-DOCTOR PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN MURDER AND FRAUD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Wearing a blue V-neck prison shirt that
resembled the hospital scrubs he once wore to work, a former doctor
pleaded not guilty Monday to federal charges that he killed three
patients in a Long Island hospital in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The former doctor, Michael J. Swango, 45, entered his plea as he
was arraigned here in Federal District Court on charges that he
used fraud to obtain medical posts where he then went on to kill
and assault patients by injecting them with various poisons.
</P>
<P>
   If he is convicted, Swango could face the death penalty. The
government will decide whether to seek the death penalty within the
next three months, said Joseph Conway, the assistant United States
attorney prosecuting the case.
</P>
<P>
   Swango, who appeared pale and gaunt in court, with his blond
hair cropped short, stood impassively as prosecutors read aloud the
17-page indictment accusing him of fraud, murder, assault and
making false statements.
</P>
<P>
   After Swango's lawyer, Randi Chavis, said his client pleaded not
guilty to the charges, the judge, Jacob Mishler, turned to Swango
and asked him if that was indeed his plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, yes,'' Swango said quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Swango's case has troubled law enforcement officials and medical
authorities alike: although he was dogged by unsettling allegations
throughout his medical career, he continued to find work as a
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accuses Swango of murdering a patient in 1984, as
a first-year resident at Ohio State University Hospital. It states
that he killed Cynthia McGee, a 19-year-old gymnast who was being
treated there after she was struck by a car, by giving her a
potassium injection that stopped her heart. The teen-age driver who
had struck her was convicted of reckless homicide and sentenced to
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Swango was able to secure medical positions even after he served
two years in prison for trying to poison several of his co-workers
at an ambulance company in Illinois in 1985. Prosecutors charge
that he secured some posts by fraud and by using aliases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he was hired as a resident by the Stony Brook Health
Sciences Center and posted at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center
in Northport, N.Y. Hospital officials learned of Swango's criminal
past and fired him three months after he started. He served three
and a half years in prison, and would have been released Saturday
had the new charges not been filed.
</P>
<P>
   During the brief time that he worked at Northport, prosecutors
charge, Swango killed three veterans with poison injections: George
Siano, 60, Thomas Sammarco, 73, and Aldo Serini. In two of the
cases, Swango is accused of lying, saying that he had obtained ``do
not resuscitate'' orders to ensure no attempts would be made to
revive them.
</P>
<P>
   Siano's stepdaughter, Roselinda Conroy, sat in the front row of
the courtroom Monday, occasionally shaking her head as the charges
were read. ``It seems very unreal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Giving what is perhaps a preview of her defense, Chavis said in
court that there was ``no direct evidence'' to support the charges
against Swango, indicated that she would move to have the forensic
evidence in the case ruled inadmissible and complained that the
government was relying on witness statements that are ``close to 20
years old.''
</P>
<P>
   She also accused the government of violating the laws governing
pretrial publicity, giving as an example an article in The New York
Times, which reported last week that prosecutors believed that
Swango might have been involved in a number of other murders across
the globe, but would not say how many there might be.
</P>
<P>
   Gary R. Brown, another assistant United States attorney
prosecuting the case, denied the government had done anything
wrong. Mishler directed both sides to stop making public statements
about the case.

GENENTECH STOCK  
 FALLS WITH DIP  
 IN DRUG SALES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY TOM ABATE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An unexpected dip in the sales of a breast
cancer drug drove shares in Genentech Inc. down 5 percent Monday,
making the South San Francisco giant one of the rare losers on a
day when biotech stocks enjoyed a modest rally.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued before the market opened Monday, Genentech
reported operating earnings of $78.2 million (29 cents per share)
for the quarter ended June 30, matching analysts' consensus
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Those second-quarter figures were 7 percent higher than the
year-ago quarter, when Genentech reported operating earnings of
$73.2 million (27 cents).
</P>
<P>
   But investors zeroed in on the fact that sales of Herceptin,
Genentech's breast cancer treatment, slipped 3 percent last
quarter, compared with the first three months of the company's
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech spokeswoman Sabrina Johnson said the drop occurred
because Roche, the Swiss drug giant that owns a controlling
interest in Genentech, stockpiled Herceptin in the first quarter in
preparation for introducing that drug in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Those Roche orders helped lift Herceptin sales by 26 percent in
the first quarter to $68.7 million. But when the Swiss firm cut its
Herceptin purchases in the quarter just ended, the result was a $2
million dip that surprised analysts who were expecting total
Herceptin sales above $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said sales were artificially elevated because Roche
(previously) bought a significant amount of Herceptin,'' said
analyst Eric Schmidt with SG Cowen. ``What they forgot to do is
tell us that last quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Genentech Chief Financial Officer Lou Lavigne said the company
has warned investors in the past that large drug sales to overseas
marketing partners could cause ``fluctuations'' in
quarter-to-quarter sales. ``That shouldn't have been a surprise,''
Lavigne said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had the last word Monday, driving Genentech shares
down $8 to close at $153.50 on volume of 1.5 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech's retreat stood in contrast to a 3.9 percent rebound
in the Amex biotech stock index, which consists of 17 large biotech
firms. Last week, the index slipped 7.3 percent as a wave of profit
taking erased some of the gains the biotech sector had registered
in June and early July.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech aside, biotech seemed back in favor Monday as shares
in 15 of the 17 firms in the Amex index gained ground, including
Chiron Corp. of Emeryville, which rose $2.19 to close at $54.88.
</P>
<P>
   A second and larger index, which reflects the performance of 200
smaller biotech firms, also rose 2.3 percent Monday, with gainers
outnumbering losers 2 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech, meanwhile, continued to accent the positive in its
earnings report, including its sales of Rituxan, a treatment for
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Genentech reported Rituxan sales of $102.8
for the quarter, beating the $94 million analysts had expected. The
surplus in Rituxan sales helped offset the Herceptin shortfall and
allowed Genentech to meet its earnings-per-share target.
</P>
<P>
   Lavigne, Genentech's CFO, said the company also introduced two
new drugs during the quarter, an improved clot buster for heart
attacks and a time-release version of its growth hormone drug that
eliminates the need for daily injections.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our standpoint, this was a very, very solid quarter,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech's earnings are complicated by charges stemming from
its purchase by Roche in 1999 and Roche's subsequent spin-off of
Genentech shares. For the most part, Wall Street ignores the
charges and focuses on operating earnings.
</P>
<P>
   When acquisition-related charges are considered, Genentech lost
$14.2 million (5 cents) in the second quarter. During the same
period a year ago, the company lost $923.2 million ($3.59).

JOHNSON &AMP; JOHNSON EXPECTING TO SELL TYLENOL IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a sign that American drug companies are cracking open the
Japanese market, Johnson &AMP; Johnson will announce Tuesday that
Tylenol will be available in Japan early this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is the second largest market for over-the-counter drugs in
the world. But for decades, the government has kept many foreign
drug makers out. And, many drugs available to Europeans or
Americans are not approved for sale in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Tylenol has been available in the United States since 1955, and
is now available in 46 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson executives said Monday that the company did
not begin trying to get approval to sell Tylenol in Japan until
1995. In 1997, it signed a partnership agreement with Takeda
Chemical Industries, Japan's largest drug company, to jointly
market the pain reliever. The Japanese government agreed that the
companies could sell Tylenol last year. Since that time, the
companies have talked to more than 3,000 Japanese consumers to find
out how best to market the pills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a demanding government in Japan,'' said Fred Walker,
marketing director for the company's McNeil Consumer Healthcare
division in Japan. ``There is a demanding consumer. We needed to do
our homework.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading over-the-counter pain reliever in Japan is now
Bufferin, which is made by the Lion Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson will market Tylenol the same way similar drugs
are sold in Japan. For example, the company will offer granules of
Tylenol, flavored and packaged in an envelope, which quickly
dissolve..
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson officials would not disclose how much Tylenol
it expects to sell in Japan or how much of the profits Takeda will
get.
</P>
<P>
   For years, strict Japanese requirements for foreign drug
companies have kept many popular medications out. A turning point
came last year when Viagra, the anti-impotence drug, was quickly
approved. The government then agreed that oral contraceptives could
be sold. The contraceptives had been under review by the Japanese
government for at least nine years.

TRUMP EFFORT TO PREVENT INDIAN CASINO IS INVESTIGATED 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The state lobbying commission is looking into
Donald J. Trump's ties to a group that used television, radio and
newspaper ads to try to block an Indian casino in the Catskills, a
project that Trump also tried to stop, according to people close to
Trump.
</P>
<P>
   The Temporary State Commission on Lobbying is investigating the
anti-casino group, called the New York Institute for Law and
Society, a fact confirmed by correspondence from the group's
lawyers to the commission, and obtained from the commission under
the state's Freedom of Information Law.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute, based in Rome, N.Y., bought the ads in March, at
a time when the State Legislature was considering various bills _
all of which failed _ dealing with whether and how the state might
approve a casino in Monticello proposed by the Mohawk tribe. The
lobbying commission is looking into whether those ads should have
been considered a lobbying expense, intended to influence
legislation. If so, the institute would have been required by law
to register with the commission as a lobbyist and a lobbying client
and report its expenses, which it did not.
</P>
<P>
   Trump associates say the lobbying commission is also asking
whether Trump paid for those ads, using the institute as a front
group without reporting that spending to the commission, which
could be a serious violation of the lobbying law. Trump opposes
development of a Catskills casino, which could draw business away
from his Atlantic City casinos.
</P>
<P>
   David M. Grandeau, executive director of the lobbying
commission, refused to say whether the commission was investigating
a Trump link to the anti-casino ads.
</P>
<P>
   Violations of the state's lobbying law can bring fines up to
$25,000 an incident. The commission can also refer cases to
prosecutors for criminal action, but it has done so just once in
its 22-year history, and no charges were filed in that case.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Trump have said that he put up much of the money
used for the ads. Calls Monday seeking comment from the Trump
organization and the Institute for Law and Society were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying commission is investigating Trump and a rival
Atlantic City gambling magnate, Arthur Goldberg, president of Park
Place Entertainment, to determine whether they should have
registered as lobbyists because of the time they spent trying to
influence the legislature's handling of the casino bills. That
investigation was first reported Monday by The New York Post and
confirmed Monday by associates of Goldberg and Trump.
</P>
<P>
   While Trump sought to prevent construction of a casino in the
Catskills, Goldberg wants to build one in a deal with the Mohawks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the lobbying law, anyone whose work and expenses in trying
to influence legislation exceed $2,000 in a year must register with
the commission as a lobbyist. Trump and Goldberg both contend that
they did so little lobbying that they did not cross that threshold.
In a 1997 opinion sought by Trump, the commission ruled that the
$2,000 rule applies not only to professional lobbyists, but also to
business owners and corporate executives who buttonhole lawmakers
on issue of interest to them.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Trump, Edward C. Wallace of Greenberg, Traurig,
noted that Trump, following the commission's advice, registered as
a lobbyist in 1997 and again in 1998, and that his company, Trump
Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc., had reported its rather lavish
spending on several of the state's high-priced professional
lobbyists. ``Obviously, this is not a guy who's averse to
disclosure,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   To determine whether Goldberg and Trump spent more than $2,000
worth of their time lobbying, the commission would have to
determine not only how much time was involved, but how much the two
men earn, information they may be reluctant to reveal.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators, lobbyists and lobbying commission officials all
agree that there are many corporate chiefs who make calls to
legislators but do not register as lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Some Trump associates said the commission may be looking to make
an example of Trump, hoping that because he is so well-known, an
action against him would be widely publicized and would spur other
business leaders into filing as lobbyists.

INSURANCE SCANDAL CREATES QUANDARY OVER HOW TO PICK

</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush's
scandalous downfall, cries for reform are resounding throughout
California.
</P>
<P>
   Some reformers argue that the office of insurance commissioner
should be changed from elective back to appointive, to depoliticize
it.
</P>
<P>
   Others want to keep the position elective but ban insurance
companies from contributing to the election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Still others say that simply finding an honest person to fill
the office should be the uppermost concern.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush resigned under pressure on June 28, after state
Assembly hearings disclosed that he let insurers avoid as much as
$3.7 billion in fines stemming from alleged mishandling of
policyholder claims after the 1994 Northridge earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the insurers were permitted to wriggle out by paying
$12 million into nonprofit foundations that Quackenbush created.
Foundation money was then allegedly used to finance political
events that benefited Quackenbush.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's many critics have been quick to point out
that the insurance industry provided major financial support to
Quackenbush's successful election campaigns in 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Some want to eliminate the public's right _ granted a decade ago
by Proposition 103 _ to elect insurance commissioners. They say the
system has failed and that insurance commissioners should once
again be appointed by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Others feel that it would be unfair _ not to mention politically
hazardous _ to deprive Californians of their precious voting
rights. They point out that the passage of Proposition 103 came
about, in part, because voters were displeased with an appointed
commissioner, Roxani Gillespie, who also &LR;   &LR; was perceived as being
too cozy with the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot legislate honesty,'' says Harvey Rosenfield, the
author of Proposition 103 and head of the Foundation for Taxpayer
and Consumer Rights in Los Angeles. ``Punishing the voters by
stripping them of the right to elect isn't going to eliminate
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for insurance commissioner in California depend
heavily on contributions, because it costs millions to wage an
effective campaign. That's largely because TV ad time is
prohibitively expensive in the densely populated Los Angeles and
San Francisco areas.
</P>
<P>
   But allowing insurance companies to make contributions
inevitably produces conflicts of interest, because the insurers are
_ supposedly _ regulated by the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Says San Francisco attorney Ray Bourhis, who represents
consumers in insurance disputes: ``It's the same as putting a
collection plate on the bench of your local Superior Court and
asking whether litigants want to contribute to the judge's son's
football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Quackenbush's conduct is enough to justify a change in
the way the commissioner is chosen is highly debatable.
</P>
<P>
   The foremost supporter of such a change _ not surprisingly _ is
Gov. Gray Davis, who proposed it a couple of days after Quackenbush
said he was stepping down. If the proposal were adopted, it would
give him the power to make the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent supporter is state Sen. Jackie Speier,
D-Hillsborough, a consumer advocate who pushed such a proposal
through a Senate committee in May as details of the Quackenbush
scandal were unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   However, the proposal has powerful opposition in Sacramento.
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, quashed an
attempt to bring the Speier measure to the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Burton explained that he preferred not to change a setup that
was approved by the voters.
</P>
<P>
   California is one of 12 states in which commissioners are
elected, according to the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, and Quackenbush is not the only elected commissioner
to become mired in scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, elected commissioners in Louisiana,
Mississippi and Florida have been forced to resign because of
illegal conduct, notes Jerry Davies, a spokesman for the Personal
Insurance Federation in Sacramento. Appointed commissioners, he
says, have generally had less trouble with the law.
</P>
<P>
   However, Davies concedes that the current, elected Florida
incumbent, Bill Nelson, is one of the top commissioners in the
nation. Nelson has a reputation for effective crackdowns on
insurance agents who defraud consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Campaniano, who served as appointed insurance commissioner
of Hawaii from 1987 to 1991, maintains that whether commissioners
are appointed or elected does not in itself determine how good a
job they will do.
</P>
<P>
   Campaniano says the key to the job is to not play favorites, but
rather to strike a balance between the interests of consumers and
companies. He points out that one of the duties imposed on
commissioners is to make certain that insurers remain solvent _
which means occasionally granting permission for premium increases,
however unpopular they may be.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Senn, the elected insurance commissioner of the state of
Washington, says having to go before the electorate every four
years helps her do her job better, because it makes her ``much more
responsive'' to the wishes of the public.
</P>
<P>
   Noted for her battles with health care insurers over
questionable rejections of patient claims, Senn has been described
as the best insurance commissioner in the nation by consumer
advocate (and presidential candidate) Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Senn points out that her state has a law prohibiting insurance
companies from contributing to election campaigns of would-be
insurance commissioners. She says that she also voluntarily
declined to take contributions from health maintenance
organizations _ arguably something she would not have gotten
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   John Garamendi, Quackenbush's predecessor and the first elected
California commissioner, says he declined to accept
insurance-company contributions during his campaign on the
Democratic ticket in 1990. Yet he managed to raise $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that you have to rely on insurance-company
contributions is a falsehood, a sham,'' Garamendi says. He contends
that such contributions constitute ``potential bribery'' and should
be made illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Garamendi acknowledges that some of his financing came from
trial lawyers, the natural enemies of insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   But that's OK, he says, because ``the insurance commissioner
doesn't regulate the trial lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sirola, a spokesman for State Farm Insurance, the
property/casualty insurer with the largest market share in
California, says his company ``leans toward'' making the
commissioner's job appointive again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for the same reason we don't elect the chairman of the
Federal Reserve, Supreme Court justices or banking commissioners,''
he explains. ``Regulators should be above politics. We find it very
difficult to operate in those jurisdictions where the regulatory
positions have become heavily politicized.''
</P>
<P>
   Sirola says that State Farm does not make political
contributions and that the company favors banning contributions
from insurers and ``anyone who derives income from the insurance
mechanism, including lawyers and body shops.''

 WEST NILE VIRUS IS FOUND IN STATEN ISLAND, WESTCHESTER AND
SUFFOLk  
 By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After finding two dead crows infected with the West
Nile virus on Staten Island, New York City officials announced late
Monday that they would spray about half the borough with a
pesticide starting Wednesday night to try to kill mosquitoes that
carry the disease before it is spread again to humans.
</P>
<P>
   The confirmation that the virus had returned to New York City
was announced on the same day that state health officials said that
for the first time this year it had also turned up in samples, or
pools, of mosquitoes collected in Westchester and Suffolk Counties.
</P>
<P>
   The two announcements offered the best evidence to date that a
virus never before seen in North America until last year _ when it
was blamed for seven deaths and the infection of 62 others in the
New York area _ had survived the winter and was again flourishing.
The findings also suggest that it may now also be working its way
back and forth between insects and birds, a step necessary before
it can be spread to humans, health experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The virus can cause encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain
and central nervous system that is sometimes fatal. The elderly,
children under 5 and people with weakened immune systems are the
most vulnerable to life-threatening cases.
</P>
<P>
   No human infections have been found so far this year, a point
that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other city officials made
repeatedly Monday in urging city residents not to overreact. But
state and city health officials again urged residents to use bug
repellent, long-sleeved shirts or long pants when going outside at
night, particularly if visiting coastal or wooded areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't panic,'' Giuliani said at a Staten Island news
conference, standing next to Neal L. Cohen, the city health
commissioner; Guy V. Molinari, the borough president; and Richard
Sheirer, the city director of emergency management.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not mean there has been an outbreak of West Nile
virus _ yet,'' the mayor said, as he prepared to explain the
pesticide effort, which will be completed from the ground on
Wednesday and Thursday morning. ``But it is absolutely necessary
that we do this.'' At this point, the city has no plans to do
aerial spraying.
</P>
<P>
   The spraying will start at 10 p.m., EDT, Wednesday and continue
until about 5 a.m. Thursday in the Rossville and Westerleigh
sections of Staten Island, where the dead birds were found. City
officials intend to spray a pesticide known as Anvil, which has the
active ingredient Sumithrin, a substance considered similar to the
natural pesticide produced by chrysanthemum flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Anvil breaks down in sunlight and water and is considered
``relatively nontoxic'' to humans, dogs, cats and other mammals,
city health officials said, but they recommended that people and
their pets stay inside during the spraying, and that windows and
air conditioners be turned off.
</P>
<P>
   So far, city officials say they plan to extend the treatment to
other boroughs only if they find infected birds or evidence of the
virus elsewhere, but Giuliani warned, ``You have to leave all the
options open to protect people's health.''
</P>
<P>
   The infected crows found in Staten Island were identified as a
result of a regional effort to quickly detect the presence of the
disease. Health officials hope that by moving immediately to kill
mosquitoes in areas where the disease is found and urging the
public to avoid exposure to surviving insects, they can prevent a
widespread outbreak. Efforts have also been under way since the
start of spring to kill mosquito eggs.
</P>
<P>
   In New York State alone, 700 birds, 55,000 mosquitoes and 200
humans have been tested so far this year. To date, 32 mosquitoes
have been found with evidence of the virus _ those confirmed Monday
in Westchester and Suffolk Counties. A total of about 25 infected
birds have also been found, most of them in the last two weeks,
with the ones outside Staten Island picked up in Rockland,
Westchester and Suffolk Counties in New York and in Bergen County
in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, New York City officials announced plans for ground
spraying in parts of Queens, but the effort was canceled after two
laboratories concluded that a chicken thought to have contracted
the virus was not infected.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Suffolk County, on eastern Long Island, announced
their own plans Monday for ground spraying in selected areas of the
county. The county is also considering aerial spraying, said Millie
Svatek, a spokeswoman for the Suffolk County Department of Health
Services. And it intends to distribute insect repellent for free
Tuesday to county residents.
</P>
<P>
   New York State Health Commissioner Antonia C. Novello contacted
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, asking the
agency to help coordinate the response between New York and its
neighbors. Throughout the region, people are being urged to
eliminate standing water where mosquitoes can breed by making sure
roof gutters drain properly, disposing of tires and cleaning and
chlorinating swimming pools, outdoor saunas and hot tubs.

FORMER BOFA  
 CEO RETURNS  
 TO BANKING
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY SAM ZUCKERMAN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ David Coulter, one of the leading lights in the
soap opera that shook Bank of America, is back in banking.
</P>
<P>
   The former chief executive of the giant San Francisco bank,
bought in 1998 by North Carolina's NationsBank, is taking an
unspecified top-level job at Chase Manhattan Corp., the
third-largest bank in the United &UR;  &LR; States.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter, who will turn 53 later this month, will work for the
New York bank ``in a very senior role. We just haven't decided what
that is yet,'' Chase chief executive Bill Harrison told the British
magazine Euromoney in a recent interview. A Chase spokesman
declined to elaborate, and Coulter did not return calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter's return to banking comes nearly two years after he
engineered the sale of BofA, only to find himself forced out by
NationsBank chief executive Hugh McColl days after the takeover was
completed and publicly blamed for risky investments that led to
hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.
</P>
<P>
   Since his unceremonious ouster, Coulter has kept a low profile.
But that hasn't stopped him from playing an active role in
California business and cultural affairs. He sat on several
corporate or charitable boards, including that of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist
Group, the San Francisco high-tech investment bank bought by Chase
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the first time, nor the last time, that there will be
ironic twists of fate,'' said Tony Price, a San Francisco executive
recruiter with the search firm Russell Reynolds Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Being outmaneuvered by McColl apparently hasn't tarnished
Coulter's reputation. His personal decency, analytical skills and
knowledge of corporate finance are widely respected in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Coulter was one of a handful of top candidates
interviewed for the CEO slot at Chicago's Bank One Corp., the No.
4. U.S. bank, sources said. Former Citigroup executive James Dimon
got the job.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Coulter became a senior partner and manager of the
Los Angeles office of the Beacon Group, a tony investment boutique
and money management firm.
</P>
<P>
   It was by that route that he came to New York's Chase, a bank
that traces its origins to the Rockefeller family and is one of
elite names in U.S. finance. Two months ago, Chase bought Beacon
and hired its founder, former Goldman Sachs merger adviser Geoffrey
Boisi, to head its rapidly growing investment banking operations.
The bank got Coulter in the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter at first was leery of returning to banking in a
subordinate role, several people familiar with his thinking said.
Up until a few weeks ago, he was forging ahead with his Beacon
projects, including a series of joint investments with Japan's
Softbank Venture Capital.
</P>
<P>
   But then Chase's Harrison turned on his considerable sales
skills. After a meeting that lasted several hours some weeks ago,
Coulter agreed to stay at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The two executives are still working out the nature of Coulter's
responsibilities, people familiar with the matter said. It's not
clear whether he will remain in Los Angeles or move to New York.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Coulter isn't taking a Chase job because he needs
money. In addition to a BofA severance package worth an estimated
$100 million, Coulter also cashed in as a Beacon partner.
</P>
<P>
   The price Chase paid for Beacon wasn't disclosed, but an earlier
bid for the firm came in at $400 million. If Chase's price was
similar, that would have meant, on average, a windfall of more than
$25 million for each of Beacon's partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done very well in his new situation,'' said Price.

INSURERS STILL DISCRIMINATING AGAINST BLACKS, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ga.)   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly a month after one of the largest insurers in the United
States agreed to pay more than $215 million in penalties and
restitution to resolve claims that it charged black customers more
for coverage than white ones, regulators in Florida and Georgia
said they suspected some companies were continuing to discriminate.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators said they thought that at least four companies
were continuing to discriminate in premium collections in Georgia
and that at least one was doing so in Florida. But they said their
investigations were in the preliminary stages and that the number
might well grow as they gathered more information.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bill Nelson, the insurance commissioner in Florida, and
John W. Oxendine, the commissioner in Georgia, issued orders Monday
that the practice be stopped immediately. The orders apply to 28
companies in Florida and 23 in Georgia. Ignoring the order, the
regulators said, could lead to fines and revocation of sales
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Neither state would identify companies suspected of
discrimination. But they said that while they developed their
cases, they wanted to pre-empt further discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to let another day go by with consumers paying
higher premiums because of the color of their skin,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   On June 21, American General, the nation's fourth-largest life
insurer, agreed to pay $215.5 million in fines and restitution to
settle a class-action suit and accusations by regulators that for
decades it had charged black customers up to 30 percent more than
it charged white ones for burial insurance. American General
acknowledged that it had continued to collect the discriminatory
premiums until April, when Nelson ordered the company to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the two largest American life insurers _ MetLife
and Prudential Insurance of America _ were accused in separate
class-action suits of charging blacks more than whites for
coverage. Both companies acknowledged they had priced life
insurance based at least in part on race but said they stopped
collecting premiums on all burial policies, known as industrial
life, in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, until the civil rights actions of the early 1960s,
the insurance industry sold life insurance based on actuarial
tables indicating that blacks were likely to die sooner than
whites. Later, the actuaries came to believe that longevity was
related to economic conditions rather than race.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating having to pay death benefits to blacks sooner than
to whites, the insurers charged blacks higher premiums. In many
cases, the companies also often charged both blacks and whites more
in premiums than the policies would eventually pay their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Florida began investigating the discrimination last fall. In
Atlanta, Oxendine said his office had begun looking into companies
in Georgia just last month. ``We definitely see indications that
some of these policies are still in force and that the race-based
premiums are still being collected,'' he said. ``We've just
started. We haven't looked at most of the companies yet.''

 PUC HUNG UP ON WHETHER TO FINE PAC BELL FOR SALES PITCHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY TODD WALLACK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ State regulators are sharply split over whether
to sanction Pacific Bell over complaints that it misled customers
into buying services they didn't want or need.
</P>
<P>
   Public Utilities Commission Judge Maribeth Bushey ruled late
last week that the local phone company should be fined a record $49
million _ $5 million more than her initial ruling in December _ for
marketing abuses. For example, the judge chastised the local phone
company for labeling a package, brimming with extras such as
three-way calling and voice mail, as the ``basics.''
</P>
<P>
   But Commissioner Josiah Neeper, who was assigned to oversee the
case, argues in an alternate decision that no fine is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Neeper said Pac Bell's marketing practices ``do not violate
statutory and current decisional standards.'' He also said Pac Bell
made it clear that its ``basics'' package is unrelated to basic
phone service. Pac Bell says it first sells new customers the local
package, and then in a separate part of the call talks about extra
features.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the issue will come up before the full commission as
early as August 3.
</P>
<P>
   But it is too early to say for certain how the other four
commissioners will rule. An adviser to Commissioner Henry Duque
said he has not made up his mind yet. An aide to Commission
President Loretta Lynch said he was not sure how she would vote.
She could not be reached for comment yesterday. The
telecommunication advisers for the other commissioners did not
return calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fork in the road for the commission,'' said Chris
Witteman of Greenlining, a consumer watchdog group in San
Francisco. ``It's two opposing views of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Pac Bell and consumer advocates routinely do battle
over allegations that the company mistreats customers, this battle
is particularly crucial because the potential fine is large.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell, which took out full-page ads opposing the fine in
newspapers across the state, hailed Neeper's proposal as a sign
that the fine could be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we said all along, Pacific Bell follows all rules and
regulations,'' Pac Bell spokesman John Britton said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Utility Consumers Action Network, the San Diego group
that helped start the case, dismissed Neeper's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an embarrassment,'' said Michael Shames, the group's
executive director. ``I'd be shocked if this proposal was
adopted.''

  (Editors: 2nd take is 1100 words of do's and don'ts.) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Left to my own devices, I would not have spent my first
afternoon in London hanging out with men dressed as nuns.
</P>
<P>
   But my traveling companions _ two teen-age boys _ overruled me
and dragged me to the balcony of the Prince Charles Cinema for a
showing of ``Sing-A-Long-a Sound of Music.'' Soon I found myself
belting out ``Edelweiss'' along with my son, Will Griggs, 14, and
his friend, Wyatt Fenner, 15, and cheering the guy in the yodel
girl outfit who won the fancy-dress contest at intermission. While
I might have planned an itinerary of ambling through Hyde Park,
picking my way through the antiques on Portobello Road and sipping
Pimm's Cup at the Ivy in Covent Garden, I had to give in to the
boys.
</P>
<P>
   Giving in to the boys turned out to be a good guiding principle
for this trip.
</P>
<P>
   Our five-day jaunt to London in April was my fifth vacation with
teens. Over spring break, while my husband putters in our garden
and enjoys the suburban solitude, I usually go off with one or both
of our teen-age children (my daughter, Cornelia, then age 16, had
different vacation dates this year), often with friends or a cousin
in tow, to destinations that have also included Los Angeles, Las
Vegas, Paris and the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   I always dread these trips and they always turn out great. They
have produced some bad sunburns and sore feet but, amazingly, not
even a small argument. With school out and many two-career couples
trying to plan vacations that will appeal to teen-agers, it helps
to have a clear-headed view of what works and what doesn't. Today's
sophisticated children are used to the stimulation of big cities
(we live outside Washington, and my nephew, who sometimes travels
with us, lives in New York). And many have travel opportunities
that adults would envy. Yes, they are privileged, but they are
still teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing that I'm about to travel alone with a gaggle of kids,
I've had friends look at me with pity and share their favorite ``I
took the trip from hormonal hell'' horror story. For example, a
colleague told me about arriving with her 14-year-old daughter at
the King David Hotel in Jerusalem with a fabulous swimming pool.
When she suggested a swim, her daughter responded that she
preferred to retire to her room alone and order room service pizza.
</P>
<P>
   My nephew, now 21, sulked through much of a family drive through
the Irish countryside two years ago and confided to me afterward
that he rated a vacation in direct relation to the amount of time
he was cooped up in a car with his parents. That's a cautionary
note for parents who are planning to pile the teen-agers into the
SUV this summer for a cross-country trek or a camping trip.
</P>
<P>
   I can empathize. At 16, on my first trip to Europe, I pretended
to sleep during a car trip through the Alps because I wanted to
punish my parents for relentlessly pressuring me to register my
delight at every sight.
</P>
<P>
   So I began traveling with my two teen-age children with a proper
sense of trepidation. But over the years, I've learned that one key
to success is carefully mixing what they want to do with what you
want to do.
</P>
<P>
   In London, that meant Tower of London, yes. (Like Queen
Elizabeth I, teen-agers like gory stuff and outsized diamonds.)
British Museum, no. British war rooms, yes. (They've seen enough
World War II movies to make Whitehall interesting.) Parliament, no.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon, we all got dressed up for high tea at Brown's
Hotel. (The boys' version of fancy dress for tea was nice sweaters,
no dirty sneakers.) They loved the ritual of pouring the tea
through a strainer and pronounced the lumps, Britain's far more
interesting version of sugar cubes, ``awesome.'' Will, a piano
player himself, enjoyed the Gershwin and Porter tunes played by the
hotel's pianist.
</P>
<P>
   I got to go antiquing, in a manner of speaking, when Will took
me vinyl shopping on Camden High Street and I found myself thumbing
through long out-of-print '60s albums at Rhythm Records. Greeting
the visages of old friends like Peter Noone (Herman of Herman's
Hermits) and Petula Clark (of ``Downtown'' fame), I felt as if I
were back on Carnaby Street during my first trip to London in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   That, essentially, is the joy of traveling with kids this age.
It can re-establish the connections between your life and that of
your teen-agers, who often do their best to shut out their parents.
That is the guiding spirit for the road rules I've developed.

 NATHAN MOST, CREATOR OF EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS, STILL A VISIONARY
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY KATHLEEN PENDER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Most of Hillsborough got his start trading safflower
seeds and coconut oil futures.
</P>
<P>
   He later developed a product that helped save the American Stock
Exchange from oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Today he's in the middle of a mutual fund revolution.
</P>
<P>
   And he's only 86.
</P>
<P>
   Most is the originator of the exchange-traded fund _ a low-cost
mutual fund that tracks an index and trades throughout the day on a
stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   He developed the first ETFs, called Spiders, at the American
Stock Exchange. Today, he's a consultant with San Francisco's
Barclays Global Investors, which has introduced 45 ETFs called
iShares and will launch 12 more this month.
</P>
<P>
   ETFs already have more than $47 billion in assets, and giant
Vanguard Group plans to introduce a line of them, called Vipers,
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Most says he probably wouldn't have come up with exchange-traded
funds were it not for his background in commodities trading.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Most worked for Pacific Vegetable Oil in San
Francisco as vice president of finance and head of safflower seed
trading.
</P>
<P>
   When that company was liquidated, he went to the Pacific
Commodities Exchange, where the main product was coconut oil
futures. A worldwide drought in 1974 made millionaires out of his
traders, but when the rains came, the market reversed itself and
half of his traders went bust.
</P>
<P>
   After the exchange was shut down in 1976, Most joined the newly
created Commodities Futures Trading Commission in Washington, D.C.,
as technical assistant to the chairman. In 1977, he moved to the
American Stock Exchange in New York, where he eventually headed up
new product development.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, the Amex was losing stock listings and Most
was casting around for ideas to make up for dwindling volume on the
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   He set his sights on open-end mutual funds that track the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which were among the biggest-volume
securities not traded on an exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Closed-end mutual funds had already been trading on stock
exchanges for many years but have a nasty habit of trading above or
below the true value of their stock holdings. This makes them
riskier, and more complicated, than regular, open-end mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Open-end funds are always sold and redeemed at net asset value.
This price, known as NAV, is calculated by adding the value of all
the stocks in the fund, based on their closing prices, and dividing
by the number of fund shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The downside, for some people, is that open-end funds are priced
only once a day, at the close of trading, so investors can't buy or
sell at intra-day prices. Some index funds, including many of
Vanguard's, won't even let most shareholders trade by phone or
mouse _ they have to send written orders via snail mail.
</P>
<P>
   Most figured there might be a market for an S&AMP;P index fund that
investors could trade throughout the day. But there were two big
problems.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there was nothing in the Investment Company Act of
1940, which regulates mutual funds, that allowed them. However, a
provision in the act allowed exceptions if they were in the
``public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us three years to get exemptions to the 1940 Act,'' he
says. ``We ended up getting exemptions from almost (all the
provisions) of the act.''
</P>
<P>
   The second challenge was devising a mechanism to keep the fund
trading at or very close to net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   The solution was a ``creation unit.'' This is a large basket of
stocks that mimic the index the fund tracks. Think of it as a
mini-index fund with $5 million to $10 million worth of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Large institutions _ such as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter or
Salomon Smith Barney _ can assemble a creation unit and exchange it
for shares in the ETF. For each creation unit, institutions get
50,000 retail shares, which they can sell to individual investors.
When they want out of the fund, they turn in retail shares and get
creation units back.
</P>
<P>
   Once the ETF shares begin trading on a stock exchange,
institutions help keep their price at NAV through an investment
strategy known as ``arbitrage.'' This involves simultaneously
buying and selling related securities to lock in a profit.
</P>
<P>
   If the price of the ETF and the price of the underlying stocks
drifts apart, arbitrageurs will buy retail shares and redeem
creation units, or buy creation units and redeem retail shares,
until the two prices come back into line.
</P>
<P>
   ETFs are very cheap to run because the fund deals only with a
few large institutions that trade in creation units. Everyone else
buys and sells ETF shares just as they would any stock, through a
brokerage firm. A regular mutual fund deals with its customers
directly, which is far more costly.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1993, the Amex introduced its first ETF, managed by
State Street Bank. Shares in the fund are called S&AMP;P 500 Depositary
Receipts, or Spiders for short.
</P>
<P>
   Most says it took about two years for Spiders to catch on, but
once they did, other ETFs followed.
</P>
<P>
   The Amex added Spiders based on the S&AMP;P 400 midcap index and
various sector indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Most helped Morgan Stanley create 17 ETFs tied to foreign stock
indexes called the World Equity Benchmark Series, or WEBS.
Recently, Barclays Global Investors took over WEBS and renamed it
iShares.
</P>
<P>
   Other ETFs, which also trade on the Amex, include the Diamonds,
based on the Dow Jones industrial average and the wildly popular
Nasdaq-100 Trust, better known by its ticker symbol QQQ or
``Cubes.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, ETFs (including iShares) account for more than half of
the trading volume on the Amex.
</P>
<P>
   The original S&AMP;P 500 Spider is the largest. With $22 billion in
assets, it accounts for almost half of all ETF assets combined.
</P>
<P>
   But the most active is the volatile Nasdaq 100, managed by the
Bank of New York. Its average daily trading volume is $16.8
billion, about 53 percent of all ETF trading volume.
</P>
<P>
   Most says ETFs ``pretty near'' rescued the Amex, ``but they
don't like to admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Weber, Amex senior vice president of new product
development, would only say that ETFs ``have been growing extremely
well and are clearly an important part of our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Most retired from the Amex in 1996 and moved back to
Hillsborough. But he soon tired of household chores and contacted
the Pacific Exchange in San Francisco about setting up a
technology-oriented ETF.
</P>
<P>
   That never happened, but Most discovered that Barclay's Global
Investors wanted to get into ETFs in a big way. BGI is the nation's
second-biggest money manager, ``but whoever heard of them?'' he
asks. Because BGI deals mainly with institutions, it has little
retail name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   BGI chief executive Patricia Dunn saw ETFs as a way to play the
``democratization'' of the markets. ``More and more, it's
individuals, instead of institutions, that control investment
assets,'' she says. But ``moving full scale into the retail market
was not feasible for us. The neat thing about iShares and ETFs is
that they provide a really leveraged way to approach individual
investors and their financial advisers _ and one that we could
afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn assigned BGI executive Lee Kranefuss to head an ETF
business and hired Most as consultant. Most was also named chairman
and president of the iShares Trust.
</P>
<P>
   BGI is promoting iShares with a $12 million print and television
advertising campaign. Since the first ones were introduced in May,
iShares (excluding the rebranded WEBS) has attracted $2.3 billion
in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Most says ETFs would have displaced mutual funds long ago ``if
there had been the computing power we have today. Now that we have
the computing power to buy the basket (of stocks) with a single
command, I think these (ETFs) will replace closed-end funds first
and then we will be hitting the mutual funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that can happen, there's one more big problem that must
be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ETFs must publish a list of its holdings each day, so
institutions know how to assemble the creation units.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a problem for index funds, because they're tracking
well-known portfolios of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be a problem for actively managed funds. Most of
these funds don't even like disclosing their portfolios twice a
year, as required by law, much less every day.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on its size, it might take days, weeks or even months
for a mutual fund to build, or dispose of, a position in a
company's stock. Most active-fund managers fear that if everyone
knows what they're doing, other investors will jump in ahead of
them, making the fund's trades less profitable.
</P>
<P>
   That's why all ETFs, so far, are index funds.
</P>
<P>
   Most says he's working on a way to create ETFs for actively
managed funds, but he won't disclose any details.

Undated: I've developed.  
RULES OF THE ROAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. BE SPONTANEOUS. If you have your heart set on your
teen-agers' seeing every painting in the Louvre, you are in for mal
de mer. In Paris, my daughter, Cornelia, then 15, and her cousin
Ted, 14, inhaled the Louvre one evening in less than two hours.
They were more interested in the museum shop than the museum. I
didn't push.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Internecine warfare often begins when you are determined that
kids see and take in all the classic sights. Instead, give them
just a taste and hope that it will inspire them for a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   2. THINK KITSCHY. Last year, Cornelia, Will and Ted lobbied hard
to go to Atlantis in Nassau. They'd seen Atlantis' many television
commercials and loved the look of this kitschy resort, best
described as a combination of Disney World and Las Vegas built on a
fabulous beach. Actually, two beaches _ a real and a fake.
</P>
<P>
   I would have much preferred a quieter place, but the three kids
loved the elaborate water slides, the bustle of the giant hotel and
the casino, where they courted danger and got thrills from trying
to pump coins into the slot machines and ogling Michael Jordan, who
was at the resort with his kids and hit the gaming tables at night.
(When the three tried to use the slots, they were nearly always
chased away by the pleasant but firm hotel staff, since anyone
gambling must be at least 21.)
</P>
<P>
   AAtlantis turned out to be a great place for real talks. Every
afternoon, I persuaded one of the kids to take a long beach walk,
which gave me a chance to catch up on what each of them was up to.
</P>
<P>
   Tackiness ruled in 1997, when the kids chose Las Vegas as our
destination. My two kids each took a friend, whose parents chipped
in to cover their expenses. They loved the kitsch, from the fake
pyramids at the Luxor to the mock Coney Island of New York, New
York. While the amusement park at the MGM Grand occupied an
afternoon, they also enjoyed an old-fashioned stage show with the
requisite white-suited and sequinned Elvis impersonators.
</P>
<P>
   I got into the flashy spirit of things by renting a stretch limo
(white with purple-tinted windows) for a 45-minute ride down the
Strip.
</P>
<P>
   3. DON'T CHANGE THE SLEEP CYCLE. Teen-agers sleep an average of
20 out of 24 hours, or so it seems on vacation. Don't plan early
excursions. In Paris with Cornelia and Ted in 1998, I let them
sleep until noon. I got up early, got coffee and a croissant at a
patisserie near our Left Bank hotel, and went for walks and museum
visits on my own, or with my sister, who joined us.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age metabolism got jump-started later, and they were in
a better mood to see Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower. They were
enthusiastic about Paris night life, including eating late in nice
restaurants. Although they complained a bit about all the walking,
our outings were liberally sprinkled with shopping in trendy
boutiques like Agnes B. Ted, a gifted artist, liked drawing the
gargoyles at Notre Dame.,
</P>
<P>
   4. DON'T BOOK EXPENSIVE SIGHTSEEING EXPEDITIONS. I can't stand
the idea of missing a famous landmark if it's in striking distance
so, in Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon beckoned. The kids were game,
and I spent $600 chartering a plane to fly us over the majestic
site. On the flight, air turbulence made one of the kids sick and
two others fell asleep; we would have been a lot happier spending
the afternoon by the pool.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the kids didn't recognize enough of the names of
the old-time stars like Rita Hayworth and Clark Gable to make a
slow ``Homes of the Stars'' bus tour worth an entire afternoon. But
they loved the footprints at Mann's Chinese Theater.
</P>
<P>
   5. BUNK ALONE (IF BUDGET PERMITS). A vacation is not the optimum
time to instill order.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris and Las Vegas, I shared a room with my daughter and her
friend. Within a day, the floor was covered in dense layers of
clothes, which made me crabby. Not having to keep her room neat was
part of the point of a vacation, Cornelia pointed out, something I
had agreed to in a weaker moment. At Atlantis, where I shared a
room with a friend from home, we were all much happier.
</P>
<P>
   After supervising one eve-of-departure clean-up by the kids, I
left a generous tip for the hotel maid to make up for their mess.
</P>
<P>
   With two 15-year-old males hovering between boyhood and manhood
as my London mates, the young gentlemen, as the staff referred to
them, had one minor mishap in the room they shared (mine was on
another floor). They called me in a panic one night at 11, claiming
to have ``mistakenly'' ordered an X-rated movie from the pay movie
selections. (After selecting the movie, they probably realized
their choice might appear on my bill.) I told them not to worry.
Flexibility is good.
</P>
<P>
   6. A POOL RULES. In Los Angeles, I thought the kids would get a
kick out of a cool Art Deco hotel in Santa Monica that I had always
liked, the Shangri-La. I was wrong. Their interest in architecture
was limited to the hotel's lack of a pool. I conceded defeat and
checked us into a Holiday Inn a few blocks away, where our bland
room was poolside. The kids were thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   In London, where my indulgence to myself was splurging on a
lovely hotel, One Aldwych, my first glimpse of the boys came late
in the morning, when they would meet me for a workout in the hotel
gym. Then we'd all go for a swim in the blue-tiled pool, which
played music underwater. The boys thought the pool was ``phat.''
</P>
<P>
   7. LOOSEN THE LEASH. It's important to find safe opportunities
to let teen-agers go off by themselves. Will and and his friend
Wyatt love the theater. The three of us went to two plays, then I
let them have a night to themselves. I went to dinner with a friend
living in London and they went to ``The Lion King'' and had dinner
at Orso, a West End restaurant. They had a midnight curfew, which
they dutifully observed.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, while my sister and I attended a classical music
concert, my daughter and her cousin went to a movie on the
Champs-Elysees. They loved the independence and the daring sense of
exploring on their own.
</P>
<P>
   8. GET A SWEET CAR. A convertible may cost extra, but if you are
driving a lot, teen-agers will tolerate the travel if you have a
car they like. A CD player can overcome a lot of problems.
</P>
<P>
   9. THE MORE, THE MERRIER. Teen-agers are pack animals. Let them
bring friends. Often, other parents are thrilled when their
children get an invitation to travel and they expect to help defray
the cost. Having pals along makes any trip more fun and encourages
better, more considerate behavior. Above all, these trips have
reminded me how much fun it can be to hang out with teen-agers.
Instead of insisting they be little adults, you can try being a big
kid; at least, that's my approach.

LOUIS QUILICO, BARITONE KNOWN AS MR. RIGOLETTO
</HEADLINE>
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louis Quilico, a Canadian baritone who sang nearly 300
performances at New York's Metropolitan Opera during his 25 years
on the company's roster, died on Saturday in Toronto. He was 75 and
lived in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Giles, Quilico's publicity spokeswoman, said the cause was
complications after knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Quilico was a robust singer who was at his best in the great
Italian and French Romantic baritone roles. Donizetti, Verdi,
Puccini and Massenet were the composers most heavily represented in
his repertory of more than 80 roles, but he also touched on the
Mozart and Wagner repertory, and performed in the premieres of
operas by Milhaud and Jolivet.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of his career, he also sang some music theater
roles, most notably Tony in ``Most Happy Fella.''
</P>
<P>
   The signature role of his operatic career, however, was
``Rigoletto.'' He sang the role more than 500 times _ the last was
at the National Arts Center in Ottowa in 1994 _ and was so
thoroughly identified with his portrayal of Verdi's tormented
jester that he was widely known as Mr. Rigoletto. The nickname was
used as the title of a book, ``Mr. Rigoletto: In Conversation With
Louis Quilico'' (1996), by Quilico's wife, the pianist and writer
Christina Petrowska, and as the title of a recent compact disc
retrospective, ``Mr. Rigoletto: My Life in Music.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Quilico was born in Montreal on Jan. 14, 1925. After
beginning his studies in Montreal, he won a local competition for a
scholarship to study at the Conservatorio di Santa Cecilia in Rome.
When he returned to Montreal, he became a student of Martial
Singher at the Montreal Conservatory, and later continued working
with Singher at the Mannes College of Music in New York. Also among
his early teachers were Teresa Pediconi and Riccardo Stracciari. In
1949 he married Lina Pizzolongo, his pianist and vocal coach. She
died in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Quilico won a Montreal radio competition in 1953, and made his
professional stage debut with the Opera Guild of Montreal in 1954.
He was a winner of the Metropolitan Opera Auditions of the Air in
1955, but did not make his debut at the Met until 1972. Instead, he
gave his first New York performances at the New York City Opera,
where he made his debut as Germont in a production of Verdi's
``Traviata'' in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   It was also as Germont that Quilico made his Covent Garden debut
in 1960, and he quickly cemented his reputation as a Verdi baritone
with notable debuts at the Bolshoi (as Rigoletto in 1962) and the
Paris Opera (as Rodrigo in ``Don Carlos'' in 1963).
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 he made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera as a
replacement for an ailing Thomas Stewart as Golaud in Debussy's
``Pelleas et Melisande.'' He joined the Met roster in 1973, and
sang in five productions his first season: three Verdi operas, ``La
Traviata,'' ``Rigoletto'' and ``Il Trovatore,'' as well as
Berlioz's ``Troyens'' and Gounod's ``Faust.'' From the time of his
debut, he sang with the company for 25 consecutive seasons and was
included in several of the company's television broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   When he appeared in Massenet's ``Manon'' with his son, Gino
Quilico, also a baritone, it may have been the first time a father
and son in principal roles shared the Met stage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son and Petrowska, whom he married in 1993,
Quilico is survived by a daughter, Donna Ruggeri, and two
stepdaughters, Dominique and Alexandra Bregent, all of Toronto; a
brother, Anthony, of Montreal; and two sisters, Madeleine Maynard
and Georgette Danduront, also of Montreal.

EFAX INVESTORS  
 VICTIMIZED BY  
 WOEFUL TIMING
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY TODD WALLACK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The news keeps getting worse for eFax investors.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Jfax of Hollywood agreed to buy eFax, a free Internet
faxing service based in Menlo Park, for $74 million, a paltry sum
compared with what similar firms fetched before the Nasdaq swooned
in April and dot-coms fell out of favor. Rival Onebox.com in San
Mateo, for instance, sold for $787 million in February.
</P>
<P>
   But $74 million looks like a small fortune compared with the
final price, after executives changed the terms of the deal last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Under the final pact, announced Friday, Jfax will hand over just
13 million shares _ instead of the 18.5 million originally agreed
on. That values the deal at about $26 million based on Monday's
stock prices. Jfax closed at $2.03 yesterday, up 14 cents.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal for eFax investors gets worse: More than half the
Jfax shares have been earmarked for hedge fund investors with
preferred stock and a technology company that did work for eFax.
Citadel Investment Group will claim 7.2 million shares. Integrated
Global Concepts, the technology firm, will get 2 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves just 3.8 million shares _ or $8 million _ for most
eFax investors. Under the deal, each share of eFax translates into
0.281 share of Jfax, or 57 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the new deal was announced, eFax shares were trading
at $1.03. So instead of a premium, eFax investors will actually
receive only half the market value for their shares. Efax closed at
72 cents a share yesterday, down 95 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a lousy deal,'' one investor fumed on an Internet chat
board.
</P>
<P>
   But eFax executives said it was the best option on the table.
The company was running low on cash, so it had to borrow $5 million
from Jfax to keep the company going until the deal closed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, since the deal was announced, eFax stock has fallen
roughly twice as much as Jfax. Executives said they needed to
adjust the terms of the deal to take into account the shifting
market values.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Kenck, the firm's chief financial officer, said he
sympathizes with investors. Kenck said he bought about 3,600 shares
_ mostly for $11 to $12 per share. And his stock options typically
have a strike price in the double-digits _ making them worthless at
the current values.

 READY OR NOT, POWER BARGE HEADED FOR BAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY DAVID LAZARUS &LR;

<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; A floating power plant has departed from its
berth in Texas and is expected to arrive in the Bay Area early next
month as an emergency stopgap to prevent further power failures,
PG&AMP;E Corp. said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   However, it remains unclear whether necessary permits and
authorization can be obtained for the 95-megawatt floating plant to
be brought into service this summer.
</P>
<P>
   If not, PG&AMP;E may be forced to moor its jet-turbine-equipped
barge in the bay until next year, absorbing any related costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power crunch isn't going to go away,'' said Greg Pruett, a
spokesman for the company. ``It's not going to be solved
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The barge, purchased by PG&AMP;E last month, was towed from its
berth in Freeport, Texas, on Sunday and is expected to reach the
Panama Canal by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   It is tentatively slated to reach the Bay Area by August 8 or 9.
</P>
<P>
   Protests are already being planned. Greenaction, a San Francisco
environmental group, said it will monitor the barge's progress and
will hold a rally when it arrives, to oppose use of a floating
power plant in the bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outdated, polluting technology,'' said Bradley Angel, the
group's executive director. ``And the plant would be used only on
the days when air quality would be worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The four turbine engines atop the barge run on jet fuel and have
not been upgraded to meet tighter emission standards since the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E has said that, without additional electricity-generating
resources, Bay Area homes and businesses may face a replay of the
recent ``rolling blackouts'' that cut off power to 35,000 customers
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Thaeker, manager for reliability controls with the
California Independent System Operator, the nonprofit agency that
oversees statewide electricity flow, said PG&AMP;E is essentially
rolling the dice that it will receive approval to operate the
floating plant by the time it arrives in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we've turned around on this thing there's been a
hurdle we hadn't expected,'' he said. ``We still have a lot of work
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E is hoping to moor the barge offshore from a substation near
Hunters Point, San Francisco International Airport or Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   Thaeker said it will cost as much as $15 million to transport
and temporarily deploy the barge in the Bay Area _ a cost that
ultimately will be passed along to PG&AMP;E ratepayers.

WHY NO CHARGE IS UNANSWERED BY MRS. CLINTON'S SENATE CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-CLINTON) 
By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The answer to the question of whether Hillary Rodham
Clinton ever made the anti-Semitic slur attributed to her by two
long-time enemies from Arkansas politics may forever be lost to
time and the conflicting accounts of what actually went on the
night that Bill Clinton lost his first race for Congress in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But that Mrs. Clinton felt compelled, at the near-unanimous
urging of her senior advisers, to call reporters to her home on a
Sunday afternoon to explicitly deny the charges, and that President
Clinton took a break from Middle East negotiations to telephone a
Daily News editor to back up his wife, reflects more than passing
concern over the latest storm to pass over Mrs. Clinton's campaign.
Their actions suggest the need to address persistent doubts about
her among Jewish voters _ which her advisers acknowledged Monday _
and, more fundamentally, lingering doubts about her trustworthiness
across the electoral spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   For most public figures, a charge of the sort raised _ that she
made an obscenity-laden anti-Semitic remark to Clinton's campaign
manager 26 years ago _ might have sunk out of sight. It is an old
anecdote coming out a little more than three months before an
election. It is made by two people with a history of enmity toward
the Clintons, and repeated by a third person who said he overheard
the conversation from outside the room.
</P>
<P>
   The book where the incident was first recounted, ``State of A
Union: Inside the Complex Marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton,''
is written by a former reporter for The National Enquirer, Jerry
Oppenheimer, as Mrs. Clinton's aides have been quick to note in an
attempt to question its credibility. The alleged recipient of the
anti-Semitic slur is Baptist, though he says his paternal
great-grandmother is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton and her campaign team found themselves
answering questions about it for the fourth day Monday, evidence
that the charge was not being dismissed as implausible. And Rep.
Rick Lazio, her Republican opponent who had stepped back when the
allegations first emerged, addressed the issue Monday in what his
aides said would be a continuing attempt to use it to raise
questions about Mrs. Clinton's honesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been three people that have made what I think is a
serious allegation,'' Lazio said outside a school in Harlem. ``Mrs.
Clinton has denied that allegation. I don't know who to believe. I
don't if New Yorkers know who to believe. And therein lies a good
deal of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's senior campaign consultant, Mike Murphy, said, ``I have
no doubt now that trust is becoming the major issue of the
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Her advisers reacted quickly to this latest allegation precisely
because her credibility has been challenged so regularly over the
past eight years, and she could not afford, at this point in her
campaign, another episode that raised questions about her
sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   The president called an editor of the Daily News on his own
accord on Sunday, according to the first lady's advisers, who
suggested Monday that presidential intervention might not have been
called for. They would not speculate as to why Clinton made the
call.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to the first lady, Mrs. Clinton and her
advisers made a deliberate calculation to rebut the story after
determining that it had the potential to turn into a brushfire.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came Sunday in a late-morning telephone conference
call between Mrs. Clinton and her aides, after they watched Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi declare on ``Fox News
Sunday'' that Lazio was getting substantial support from Jewish
voters in New York, ``and I think that's one of the reasons why
Hillary is uttering these anti-Semitic comments, if in fact she
is.''
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, the story had appeared on the Drudge Report on the
Internet, in The New York Post and in The Daily News, but Mrs.
Clinton's advisers figured that it was only a matter of time before
it spilled over into other newspapers, The Associated Press and
local television news. They agreed that Mrs. Clinton needed to
personally rebut a charge that was already stirring concern among
some of her Jewish supporters, and seemed not to be going away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept here is, let's not have any whispering
campaigns,'' one of Mrs. Clinton's senior advisers said Monday.
``Let's get the truth out. Let's not allow false information
promoted by a book to be used in a whispering campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mrs. Clinton's associates had worried that such a quick
and heated reaction would only draw additional attention to the
story. And Murphy suggested Monday night that the mere fact of a
president interrupting Middle East negotiations to call a newspaper
editor gave new life to a story that might have been on the
decline.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, for all their concern, reaction among Jewish
leaders has been relatively mild. Assemblyman Dov Hikind, the
Brooklyn Democrat who represents an Orthodox neighborhood, said
Monday that the incident raised ``the whole issue of credibility in
terms of things that Hillary Clinton says and does.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hikind, who has been wary of Mrs. Clinton's views on Israel,
given her support for a Palestinian state, went out of his way to
say he did not consider her anti-Semitic. A number of Jewish
organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League and the
American Jewish Committee, issued statements supporting Mrs.
Clinton Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Mrs. Clinton looked momentarily startled when told
what Lazio had said about her credibility, but then said: ``I'm not
going to respond to that. I said yesterday that it was untrue, it
did not happen and I think it's regrettable that there is an
accusation of that banality that is made.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of her most long-term advisers, James Carville, said
Monday that given the Clintons' history in politics, and voters'
fascination and polarized views of them, he did not believe this
would go away any time soon. ``My counsel to them is that this is
only the beginning.''

 &HT;    'Showgirls' author Eszterhas latest offering outrageous
 &HT;    By Anne Morris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Parents usually depend on their children for the
truth. Screenwriting wild man Joe Eszterhas is no exception.
Despite making adults-only films such as ``Showgirls'' and ``Basic
Instinct,'' he styles himself a family man. He quotes his
25-year-old son's reaction to ``American Rhapsody,'' the outrageous
comic novel that hit bookstores July 18:
</P>
<P>
   ``Please get some very heavy security when you go on the book
tour, Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpted in the current issue of Talk magazine, ``American
Rhapsody'' is an entertaining but thoroughly salacious read that's
part journalistic tale, part racy fiction and likely to rile a lot
of important people and their fans. It uses all real names (as well
as a few derogatory nicknames) but not all real events. Just some _
like Monica and Bill and the blue dress. With chapter titles such
as ``Ross Perot on Drugs,'' ``John Wayne McCain Chickens Out,''
``Better Than a Lava Lamp,'' (about New Age guru Jean Houston),
``Hillary Loves Eleanor,'' ``George W. Bush Defines Himself'' and
the final, ``Willard Comes Clean,'' (written from the point of view
of the president's body part that got him in trouble), the book
provides equal opportunities to rile readers of every political
persuasion. Along the way, the author also dishes dirt on Hollywood
power players such as David Geffen.
</P>
<P>
   Eszterhas, long one of Hollywood's highest paid screenwriters
with 35 films to his credit, has had less success in that area
since his 1995 film ``Showgirls,'' set in the world of Las Vegas
dancers.
</P>
<P>
   He works to put a pos-- tive spin on his novel, suggesting it
provides a breath of fresh air. ``The book is so revolutionary in
how it looks at political figures, it's impossible to say how
they'll respond,'' he says by phone from Malibu, Calif. ``No one's
on a pedestal in this book.'' Least of all, the man he calls ``the
first rock and roll president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Two who come out a little better than the rest are Laura Bush
and Jane Fonda _ an odd twosome _ but even they do not escape
unscathed. Sharon Stone, on the other hand _ who starred in ``Basic
Instinct'' _ gets trashed, though her official response to the book
has been to compliment Eszterhas on his knack for comedy. It's
difficult to believe a usually conservative house such as Alfred A.
Knopf published ``American Rhapsody,'' but they're solidly behind
it with a whopping first printing of 200,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Eszterhas, 56, a former Rolling Stone writer, began the book
three years ago during a midlife crisis and a troubled screen
career that drove him to Maui to write. The timing coincided with
the president's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trip of the whole impeachment process had a feel that was
at times rhapsodic,'' Eszterhas said. ``Because it became
entertainment and theater, it became an absolute guilty pleasure
for a lot of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that after writing screenplays for 25 years he's seeing
a link between politics becoming entertainment and entertainment
becoming politics. ``The process by which a president is made
inaccessible to the public is the same process by which a movie
star is made inaccessible to the public,'' he said. In the book, he
facetiously raises the prospect that in the future Clinton could
star in ``Basic Instinct 3'' with Stone. ``But in my mind, he's
much more of a rock and roll star,'' Eszterhas said. ``Men of our
generation really wanted to be rock and roll stars. Some of us have
grown up and know in our hearts we are not. But Bill Clinton hasn't
gone through that process. He really is in his own head, I'm
convinced, Mick Jagger on Chef Boyardee sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   Eszterhas dodges a question about whether there's any limit to
what he'll say about someone _ for in this book he's hinted that
several were cocaine users, others anti-Semitic, still others
outright amoral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiction sometimes illuminates truth more than fact does,'' he
says. Inserted in the body of the novel are monologue chapters
printed in boldface, to indicate fiction, he says. But other
chapters _ not in boldface, so presumably nonfiction _ contain
descriptions of events Eszterhas could only have imagined. Despite
his research, there's no bibliography. With this book, Eszterhas
hasn't evolved beyond what Edmund Morris attempted in ``Dutch,''
last year's controversial fictionalized biography of Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he'd mind if someone fictionalized his life in this
way, Eszterhas said it had been done to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``After `Showgirls,' the Philadelphia Inquirer hired a
psychiatrist who, based on the few things written about my
upbringing, made all these psychosexual judgments about me. It's
been done to me. I survived. I thought some of the psychologist's
opinions were pretty off-the-wall. I certainly grant the
possibility Kenneth Starr might think I'm pretty off-the-wall in
describing his lust for Gennifer Flowers,'' he laughs. ``There is
that possibility,'' he muses, ``but I'll deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eszterhas writes (boldface) monologues for Al Gorf (sic),
McCain, Bob Dole and George W. The one he's proudest of is the
fictional monologue he wrote for Hillary Clinton, in which she
explains, ``... I plead guilty to a quest for ... power _ in the
name of children, women, black people, gay people, the elderly, the
disabled, the ill. ... That is worth the humiliation and pain and
inner destruction I've sentenced myself to.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls writing her thoughts his biggest act of literary
conceit and says, sadly, he's heard the White House is furious
about the book.
</P>
<P>
   Eszterhas has no plans to turn his book into a movie but does
see it as a possibility for some quirky, independent director or
producer. Meanwhile, he has two movies now being cast _ a dark
comedy, ``Male Pattern Baldness,'' with Paramount Pictures, and a
thriller, ``The Trap,'' at Synergy. He plays down any notion
Hollywood is angry with him, saying the book party for him drew 300
heavy hitters from the entertainment industry.

 &HT;    North Texas town faces prospect of running out of water as sole
source evaporates
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THROCKMORTON, Texas _ After three years of drought, this North
Texas town's prayers for rain have gone unanswered, and now it's
time to do something.
</P>
<P>
   Without a saving storm, Throckmorton's 1,036 residents will be
out of water in three months when their sole source, Lake
Throckmorton, goes dry. And Monday, nearly 100 townspeople and
volunteers from as far away as New Jersey and Chicago began
building a 14-mile pipeline to bring water from a neighboring
community.
</P>
<P>
   An $800,000 state grant will pay for the pipe and a pumping
station, but the town doesn't have the money to rent equipment and
pay workers. So they're planning to do it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of locals have signed up to build their own lifeline in
the summer heat, and others have volunteered to take meals to the
workers or offer a spare bed for out-of-town volunteers. Local
businesses and surrounding towns have offered to lend backhoes and
other digging equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Throckmorton is treating every remaining drop of
water as a gift. The town has banned watering lawns, washing cars
and filling swimming pools and has urged residents to conserve
water any way they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad situation _ it really is,'' said Darlene Petty, a
bookkeeper at First National Bank in Throckmorton who drives to
Abilene or Wichita Falls to wash her car. ``You're real worried
that you're going to run out of water completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Drought has forced 129 Texas cities to launch water conservation
measures, but Throckmorton _ a farming and ranching community that
has produced former Dallas Cowboy star Bob Lilly and some dominant
football teams _ is the only one in imminent danger of running out
of water.
</P>
<P>
   The town is coping in creative ways. A local oil company planted
a 12,600-gallon water tank on its property to keep its lawn and
shrubs alive with trucked-in water. The city has hauled water from
Woodson, 10 miles to the south, to fill the town's only public
pool.
</P>
<P>
   A local church is treating its baptismal water with chlorine for
repeated use. One local woman uses gray water from her family's
washing machine to water the back yard. Billy Fowler, 65, said he
waters his two rows of okra plants with used bath water.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the Cadillac grill with her two sons, Kathy Bailes
debated the ethics of washing her sons' four show goats before a
livestock show in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, we wouldn't think anything about it, but now ... ``
said Bailes, whose husband, Jeff, is on the City Council. ``We're
going to have to get permission from the city to wash them, or
we'll have to take them somewhere else, I guess, because we can't
show them dirty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really makes you think about things that you take for
granted,'' Bailes said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has ever seen the lake go completely dry, not even during
the infamous drought of the 1950s. But now the summer heat and
North Texas wind are relentlessly evaporating what's left of the
lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Days like today _ 101 degrees with 20 mile per hour wind _
we're going to lose at least three-quarters of an inch of water
(from the lake),'' said Steve Bowlin, Throckmorton's director of
public works and the organizer of the pipeline project.
</P>
<P>
   The town has rallied in the face of its most serious crisis.
Water use is down by two-thirds from three years ago, Bowlin said.
He gets calls when someone sees a neighbor wasting water, but so
far he has written only four warning letters, and no one has been
fined for violating the emergency rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we know which way to go, we're commencing to get to
work, and we're laying pipe,'' Bowlin said. But time is running
out. Lake Throckmorton is at 13 percent of capacity, 14 feet below
its normal level. The latest study estimated the town has 90 days
before the lake runs out of drinkable water.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush declared the county a disaster area last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The lake, which depends on runoff from rains, began dropping
during the 1998 drought that gripped Texas.
</P>
<P>
   When last year's rains missed Throckmorton County, Bowlin began
talking to surrounding communities about buying water for his
thirsty town.
</P>
<P>
   Bowlin began negotiating with Albany, 32 miles away, before
focusing on Graham, which has a reservoir and sells water to a
water supply company whose lines end 14 miles northeast of
Throckmorton. The Graham City Council voted last week to sell the
water to Throckmorton.
</P>
<P>
   When the rains come back and the lake fills again, Bowlin said,
the pipeline will provide a permanent backup water supply.
</P>
<P>
   The town is still looking for more equipment to dig the trenches
and more bodies to assemble the pipe segments, Bowlin said. He
hopes they can finish the pipeline in two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking for anybody to do it for us; we're just
asking for a little help,'' Bowlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Settled by ranchers and farmers who cleared the mesquite and
prickly pear from the rocky, reddish soil, Throckmorton isn't used
to depending on outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The population has remained essentially the same for a century,
and even in an era when many small towns have seen their downtowns
wither away, Throckmorton's main strip still has a core of local
businesses: a saddle shop, a pharmacy, the Cow Country Motel, a
restaurant, two banks, a couple of churches, gas stations and a
senior citizens' center.
</P>
<P>
   People still watch out for each other's children here. They know
whose birthday is coming up and what kind of icing they like on
their cake. They donate faithfully to send local girls to
cheerleader camp. They toss horseshoes and run three-legged races
during the summer Pioneer Days festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say we're stuck in the '40s and '50s, and we
are, and that's not a bad thing,'' said Bowlin, who moved here from
Yoakum a few years ago with his wife and four children. ``This is
neighbor helping neighbor out here.''
</P>
<P>
   And something about that has struck a chord with strangers. Last
week, a national network did a story on Throckmorton's plight, and
Bowlin's phone began lighting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got people calling from all over the United States who
want to come to Throckmorton, Texas, to help lay this pipeline,''
he said. ``It is unbelievable.''

   SACRAMENTO _ Four minutes is a barrier. Forty years is not a
barrier. Regina Jacobs ought to know; she is gaining on both with
nary a sign of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old came within 1.01 seconds of her first sub-four
minute run as she won the 1,500-meter final at the U.S. Olympic
Track and Field Trials on Sunday. Twenty-four hours later, Jacobs
was back on Cal State Sacramento's Hornet Stadium track for the
heats of the 5,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a schedule, that's hard time. Call it Jacobs'
sentence for pleading guilty to being a legitimate Olympic
gold-medal contender in the 1,500 meters and the reigning American
record holder in the 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, Jacobs' feet move more frenetically than the
fingers of a generation of kids captivated by their hand-held
computer games. The truth is, Jacobs, a product of Campbell Hall
High in the Los Angeles neighborhood of North Hollywood, is not
wired for the sedentary lifestyle so in vogue today.
</P>
<P>
   It's not in her genes.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs laughs out loud when people ask _ some a lot less
politely than others _ if she isn't getting a little long in the
tooth to be competing at such distances. Jacobs doesn't have to
look far for a rejoinder. Her 60-year-old aunt, with whom she is
close, recently set a world age-group record in the metric mile.
</P>
<P>
   Yvette LaVigne wasn't even running at Jacobs' age. The Los
Angeles resident took up the sport after turning 40. She has been
shattering age-group records and age-old misconceptions ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Yvette is doing is really inspiring,'' Jacobs said. ``All
these people ask me, `How long are you going to keep competing?'
And I tell them, `Long enough to break my aunt's record.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The first time LaVigne raced 1,500 meters, earlier this year,
she was timed in 6 minutes, 9 seconds, impressing everybody but
herself. She was a little disappointed, having fully expected to
break the six-minute barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Like aunt, like niece. Jacobs won't rest until she challenges
Mary Decker Slaney's American record in the 1,500 meters. The mark
of 3:57.12 has stubbornly withstood the test of time. It is 17
years old now _ well past its prime, in Jacobs' opinion.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't want to go until the record does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only seen two races in the last four years that come
close to putting someone in a position to break that record,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs had a faraway gleam in her eye that made us wonder
whether a third such race isn't on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   She has nothing much left to prove in the 5,000 meters. The
four-time Olympian set the American record of 14:52.49 on the
Fourth of July in 1998. The only way she's likely to surpass the
world mark of 14:28.09, set in 1997 by Jiang Bo of China, is to
skip a lap. Or, if the whispers are to be believed, employ the same
pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   From 800 meters to the 5K, Jacobs' range is as impressive as
Whitney Houston's. Her speed was evident on Sunday, when she
shifted into another gear in the stretch and pulled away from
second-place finisher Suzy Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of kick is cause for optimism at the Olympics, which
historically have not been kind to U.S. female middle distance
runners. No American has medaled in the 800 since Kim Gallagher won
the bronze in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The next U.S. runner to medal in the 1,500 will be the first.
</P>
<P>
   How big is the pothole Jacobs will be trying to step around in
Sydney? No U.S. runner has placed higher than eighth in an Olympic
1,500: Jan Merrill filled that spot in 1976, Ruth Wysocki in 1984
and Slaney in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, who finished 10th in the event in the 1996 Games, said,
``I'll get mad when our flag is not up there, when our anthem is
not being played. I'm going to Sydney to bring a gold medal home
for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Our computer culture is partly to blame for this country's
middle- distance malaise. Chasing monsters on a video screen is not
exactly good training for catching the Chinese and the Algerians
and the Russians on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs sees it somewhat differently. She doesn't believe this
country's youth is necessarily too sedentary, just too soccer-mad.
During her daily workouts on a high school track near her Oklahoma
home, Jacobs sees many a young girl who looks born to run.
Invariably, they turn out to be soccer players.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do in soccer but run and run and run,'' Jacobs
said. ``It's popular and kids like to do what's popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs has made it her mandate to spread the popularity of
track. Over time, she has become an enthusiastic ambassador for the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1988 and 1992, I was so nervous as a competitor, I was so
absorbed with making the Olympic team, I couldn't do anything
else,'' Jacobs said. ``I wouldn't make myself available to kids and
the public. Now I can afford to give a piece of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to keep youth from being wasted on the young,
Jacobs has found, is to hang in the race long enough to draft off
experience.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On Israel's independence day this May, the electricity in our
Jerusalem apartment suddenly blew out. We knew the holiday would
make it impossible to get an electrician until the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed like a good time to check out the city's new
hotels, the 300-room Olive Tree and the 400-room Novotel, part of a
planned four-hotel complex near the venerable American Colony Hotel
in East Jerusalem. Our children, Emma and Adam, ages 6 and 4, were
out of school anyway, and both hotels featured swimming pools and
moderate rates, according to their advance publicity. My wife,
Debbie Sontag, chief of the Jerusalem bureau of The New York Times,
was to join us later. At the Olive Tree, run by the small local
Royal Plaza chain, the three of us were greeted warmly by the front
desk staff, who were outfitted in Ottomanesque finery. The kids
particularly liked the mirror-spangled brimless caps. The Olive
Tree opened late last year, just in time for the anticipated
millennial tourist boom here. Aimed mainly at Christian tour
groups, it is a Holy Land theme inn, constructed around an ancient
olive tree said to have marked a traditional stopping place for
pilgrims to Jerusalem's Old City. The Damascus Gate is just 15
minutes by foot, along a route that passes the Garden Tomb _ a
tranquil spot that Victorian archaeologists insisted was Jesus'
true burial place _ and a brace of souvenir shops, the best of them
being the Armenian-run Palestinian Pottery.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rates were reasonable by Jerusalem standards: $180 for a
double (including a kosher buffet breakfast, a feature of most
Israeli hotels). I knew from a previous quick look around that the
rooms were clean and well appointed, if a bit small and spartan.
But none were available. The children's disappointment was tempered
by the news that the indoor pool area was still under construction.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So we walked next door to the gleaming new Novotel. An
airport-terminal-like lobby and dining room seemed utterly
unpopulated. There was no one at the front desk, and, aside from a
few kitchen workers in the middle distance, no visible hotel
employees at all.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Following signs, the kids quickly discovered the small outdoor
pool, but the shaded and unheated water was pronounced too frigid.
When we returned to the lobby, a pleasant young woman at the
reception desk explained that the hotel had not yet published a
rate list. Rooms were available, but we could not be told the cost
until the next day, when the off-site reservations office, closed
on holidays, could be consulted by telephone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her guess, though, was about $250 for a couple and two children,
who could share a pull-out couch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. That wasn't much different from the gracious and tasteful
American Colony Hotel, a short stroll away, which I had originally
ruled out for economy's sake. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A cloistered compound developed from a 19th-century pasha's
manse, the American Colony boasts some of the most pleasing public
spaces in Jerusalem: an open dining courtyard with burbling
fountain, a luxuriant ``summer bar'' garden, and _ the main
attraction for my charges _ a sheltered, grassy pool area,
including a wading pool.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American Colony has, in fact, only one real competitor,
though it is utterly different in style and scale: the King David,
the lodging of choice for state visitors to Israeli West Jerusalem
and high-end tour groups. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were welcomed by the courtly porter, George Qumssiyah, who
had retired after 50 years on the job only to return months later
as a part-timer. As I registered, the manager, whisking by my tired
and thirsty children, summoned a waiter to serve ``our young
guests'' two fruit-juice cocktails.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem is essentially a small town, and we were hardly
anonymous visitors. A year and a half before we had stayed in the
hotel for a week, and since then, as with the other major hotels
here, my wife and I had been in and out for meals and meetings
dozens of times.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The photo ID required by hotels of local residents like
ourselves was in my case the government press card carried by all
correspondents based in Israel. So the front desk receptionist knew
from a glance at the card that I was a reporter (though not my
specific affiliation, which wouldn't have been of much interest to
them anyway). That alone entitled us to a 10 percent discount,
since the American Colony actively courts foreign journalists, who
constitute a distressingly large share of Jerusalem's business
travelers. Local residents are routinely given discounts at the
city's better hotels. An ``executive'' double room _ with the desks
and data ports that are not included in all standard rooms _ listed
for $250 a night. Children under seven (our present category) are
free . Shortly afterward we were upgraded to a third-floor suite.
They extended this courtesy, they said, because the suite happened
to be free that evening, and we were a family of four seeking one
room for one night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Room six turned out be an enormous stone-and-tile Orientalist
fantasy. Filling a strategic interior corner overlooking the leafy
courtyard, it was bathed in light from the south and west. Down an
interior flight of limestone stairs from the small entry hall were
two quilt-topped queen beds; a couple of petite antique writing
desks; an oversized armoire; and a formal sitting area with six
mosaic-inlaid straight-backed chairs, arrayed as if awaiting
relatives on a chaperoned wedding night.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the bathroom, a suite in itself, with a huge
Jacuzzi-rigged tub. A separate stone shower stall with multiple
jets. And terry-cloth robes. And slippers. And fresh fruit. We were
home.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After an afternoon swim, we had a room-service meal served
quickly and decorously: a crisp Margarita pizza ($11) for the
children, and a succulent ``Persian'' lentil soup ($7) for me _
good value by Jerusalem hotel standards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cozy Cellar Bar and grassy outdoor Summer Bar are perhaps
the best stocked and most aesthetically pleasing drinking spots in
the city, and it is all too easy to order one of the fine cognacs
or single-malt whiskeys. But inquire first. I once paid a
breathtaking $50 for an ounce and a half of Bowmore. Not that it
wasn't delicious. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Comparing almost any hotel in Jerusalem to the American Colony
is inherently unfair. This is an institution, rich in history and
character. It is imbued with a sense of intimacy _ there are only
84 rooms _ not shared by any major Jerusalem hotel, upscale or
otherwise. The independently managed gift shops include the city's
best English-language bookstore. A string quartet offers regular
recitals in an airy upstairs salon. The Middle Eastern food is
excellent. Though proudly and distinctly Arab, it is a studiedly
neutral meeting zone between the city's Palestinian East and
Israeli West (as one of the area's few nonkosher luxury hotels, it
operates fully during the Jewish Sabbath, making it a popular
Friday dinner spot for secular Israelis).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, feeling that I hadn't given the Novotel a
proper chance, I returned, this time alone. The front desk could
now give rates, and the previous estimate wasn't too far off: for
my wife and me and two children the base rate would have been $227;
a standard double is $151, but children 3 or older cost an
additional $38 each. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was quickly and courteously booked into a seventh-floor room
at a single rate of $131, a bargain by Jerusalem standards. It was
an odorless, colorless, compact rectangle with a firm queen bed and
adjacent fold-out couch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it was not unpleasant: the room was bright, and impressively
soundproofed. From the single large plate-glass window, I had a
sweeping view over the Old City to Mount Scopus and the Mount of
Olives. A room-length desktop featured built-in shelving, a
telephone with a data port, and a new flat-screen color television
set.
</P>
<P>
   The four of us would have fitted easily, if tightly.
Facilitating multiple occupancy, the small bathroom was separate
from the small shower room. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But two months after its opening, the Novotel was not yet ready
for prime time. There was a room service button on the telephone
but no room service menu. The minibar was humming but empty. Cable
TV choices were limited to a few Israeli channels and international
news networks; there were no movies, pay-per-view or otherwise.
There was no shop on the premises for newspapers or sundries,
though one is scheduled to open this summer. A small gym was still
under construction, but has since opened. Heading for the pool for
a pre-breakfast dip, I was surprised to find it locked; the pool
area is open only from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Novotel was well scrubbed, well situated, and
reasonably well run. The buffet breakfast, in a basement dining
hall, was abundant and tasty, with a good
Mitteleuropa-meets-the-Middle East array of salads and cheeses and
hummus and smoked fish. &QL; 
The Jerusalem Hilton, , which opened three years ago, has been
encroaching on the King David's official-entourage business,
especially for American delegations _ either because of
buy-America-first policies, or because one too many Secret Service
agents has seen the King David's film clip of its fire-bombed west
wing.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 385-room Hilton is a short walk from both the Old City gates
and modern Jerusalem's pedestrianized center. Its cool austerity,
the hard-edged creation of the ubiquitous Moshe Safdie, Israel's
celebrated architect, is appealing to some, off-putting to others.
The basement-level commercial gallery has a convenient assortment
of trinket dealers, travel and car rental agencies, beauty parlors
and a fast-service photo shop.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pool area, stark and sunlit, with comfortable chaise
loungues and lots of fluffy towels, includes an outdoor Jacuzzi and
a large wading pool for toddlers. You can swim from the main pool
under a glass barrier directly into the small but well-equipped
gym, used by President Clinton during his recent visit (there is an
$11 daily gym fee). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rooms are standard American chain deluxe: strong on bathroom
fixtures, short on charm, with pay-per-view movies and data ports.
At a base rate of $350 for a single, $390 for a double, this is not
bargain lodging. Add another $40 a night for rooms directly facing
the terrific view of the Old City: if you traveled any distance to
get here, you deserve to gaze on those massive floodlit walls. With
our two kids and the Hilton's no-more-than-three-humans-per-room
policy, we would require a ``family room,'' for $490. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet few customers pay the full freight. Israeli citizens, as in
almost every hotel in the country, are charged 25 to 50 percent
less than foreign tourists. Package tours and other regular group
customers also get preferential rates. The State Department, for
example, negotiates a $230 rate for a standard single, my wife
learned when she stayed there for a couple of nights covering a
visit by Madeleine Albright last fall There was some spoiled fruit
and a mold-covered room-service dinner abandoned in her room. It
took three calls to the front desk to get it removed; rooms where
guests checked out after noon could not be adequately cleaned
before the next check-in, it was explained.
</P>
<P>
   The room itself was clean and functional, as it had been when I
stayed there a few months earlier, with a king-size bed and a good
work space, though surprisingly dim lighting. Its Old City view was
dominated by the construction site for a long-delayed retail and
office complex next door. But the bathroom, with its marble tub and
separate high-pressure shower stall, was big, brightly lighted, and
well stocked with plush towels and Ahava lotions and shampoos. Here
was some of the deluxe pampering that might be expected from the
location and price. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For true self-indulgence, right up the street is the King David,
the city's first and still its best full-service luxury hotel.
Until I stayed there, though, I wasn't convinced. There is an
off-putting air of officiousness to the place, an inevitable
byproduct of playing official host to Israel's A-list guests for
half a century. Its grand-hotel air seemed at odds with the
country's essentially informal culture. It can take half an hour to
get a cup of coffee in the ornate Baghdad Deco wood-inlaid lobby.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But to be a guest, we discovered, was to be treated cordially
and expeditiously, all the time. Which one has a right to expect:
standard rooms start at $398 double. For our family of four, the
most economical option was a studio room listing for a
heart-stopping $604 a night.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet when we stayed one night in November the 300-room hotel,
unusually, was not nearly full. Our Israeli residency as verified
again by a glance at my government photo ID card, brought the suite
down to $400 a night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then we were upgraded to a luxurious two-room ``club suite'' _
Room 338 on the southeast corner, with the unmatched King David
view of the floodlit Old City walls and the great lawn and pool
area that is the city's biggest and best-kept private green space.
The listed rate for a club suite was $840, more than twice what we
paid. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Impeccably redecorated with inlaid woods and fine fabrics, the
bedroom and sitting room were spacious showcases of subtle lighting
and high-grade cabinetry. The big desks and two-line telephones and
large-screen television sets in each room made it easy to work.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our full-course room-service dinner came in 15 minutes; it was
excellent, as was the service, though the menu was mostly of the
rootless Continental variety. The empty table disappeared quietly a
couple of hours later _ and a small Easterish basket of plush toys
and sweets appeared in its place. It was my daughter's birthday,
which I had mentioned to a doting doorman; from then on, everyone
working in the hotel seemingly knew that Emma had just turned 6.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking thing about the King David is not its opulence
but its personnel, who have become an integral part of local
history. Flip on the television and you are confronted with one of
those welcome-to-the-hotel films one would normally click past
without a thought. But this one is different. It is the story of
Israel, as lived and told by the waiters and cooks and chambermaids
and doormen of the King David hotel.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The video doesn't pull punches: it shows July 22, 1946, in all
its destruction and carnage, when Menachem Begin's underground
Irgun movement blew up its west wing, killing 91 people, most but
not all of them members of the billeted British forces who were
Irgun's targets. Hotel employees vividly recall the fierce
Arab-versus-Israeli fighting within rifle range of the hotel in
1948 and again in 1967 _ but they also remember the elaborate
pyramid-motif cake they baked for their cherished guest Anwar Sadat
in his historic visit in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   History, after all, is what Jerusalem is all about. The open
rear verandas of the King David are the perfect spot to take it all
in: the 16th-century Ottoman city walls, the 7th century's great
gold Dome of the Rock and the many visible remnants of the far
older city underneath, from Herod's massive stone foundations to
the tombs and alleys of the Mount of Olives above. It is no
ordinary hotel, and it is no ordinary city. (BBOX) &QR;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the results fell short of expectations. Though Jerusalem had
a third more visitors from January to March than in the same period
last year, the supply of rooms still exceeded the demand. For
tourists, that was the good news. The bad news was that prices,
already high for less than posh lodgings, were raised past Midtown
Manhattan levels, and there they have stayed. But few people pay
the full listed rates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem is tour-group land, and whether the travelers are
Christian pilgrims or furrow-browed academics or an extended family
on a bar-mitzvah junket, they are probably paying a third less than
do walk-in foreigners. (Israelis get steep discounts.)  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In most of Jerusalem's hotels, the ``high season'' includes the
entire summer; winter break from Hanukkah to the Epiphany; and the
mini-seasons of Passover, Easter week and Succoth. These rates are
for standard rooms as of this month. They include breakfast buffet.
Food is kosher in all hotels listed except the American Colony.  &QL;

HAVING A BALL IN BRAZIL BY KICKING ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Brazil)   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
(Editors: a 500-word box, ``Taking the Team on the Road'' explains
how to arrange a soccer tour. It appears at the end of story.) 
 By ANNASUE McCLEAVE WILSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is hard to admit to being a soccer mom. That cliched title is
easier to bear, however, when the games are played on a crescent
moon of a beach in Brazil, where the team kicks up sand as white
and soft as baby powder. Our family loves soccer, that jogo bonito,
``beautiful game,'' as they call it in Brazil. My son John, 14, has
played since kindergarten, and his coach, Paulo Barreto, is a
Brazilian who played professionally there. His Cincinnati company,
Paulo's Brazilian Soccer Training and Camp, began organizing trips
last year to his hometown, Florianopolis.
</P>
<P>
   The coin toss to see whether my husband, John, or I would
accompany John on a trip there last March was agonizing. Not only
was the trip too expensive for everyone to go, but we would have
had to take our two younger children out of school. I won.
</P>
<P>
   This particular eight-day trip was designed for a team, but not
all of John's team, the Cincinnati Classics, participated, so they
were supplemented by other boys and girls of the same age and
ability from around Cincinnati. Parents were welcome, and of the 17
players, only 5 traveled without a parent, making us a group of 39.
</P>
<P>
   Other camps offer various levels of training and can include
international tournament play for players who hope to play at the
college level and beyond, but this trip offered the right balance
of soccer and vacation for us. Our trip revolved around three
matches with local teams and four morning training sessions, but
equally important was the beachfront hotel and organized afternoon
sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   Florianopolis, on the island of Santa Catarina, is about 350
miles down the coast from Sao Paulo. Our 24-hour trip was not made
easier by the way we were routed by the travel agency _ through
Detroit, Miami and Sao Paulo _ but the teen-agers seemed oblivious
to the inconvenience. When they were not giving water to thirsty
dogs in travel cages or bumping into airport police officers on
bikes, they managed to find enough open space at each stopover to
kick around a soccer ball. In Sao Paulo, they sprawled over the
floor of the airport terminal, lounging or sleeping on backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   Several in our group thought the island of Santa Catarina, on
which most of the city of Florianopolis is built, looked like one
of the islands of Hawaii from the air. The hilly countryside is
laden with subtropical flora, and both land and sea are dotted with
ancient black boulders that must have looked like gods to the
Tupi-Guarani Indians who first inhabited the region. The island is
connected to the mainland by two bridges, although one, the
Hercilio Luz, is closed to motor traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Our bright blue hotel, the Ingleses Praia, sat beside a beach
called Praia dos Ingleses, on the northeast shore of the island,
about 22 miles from downtown Florianopolis. The beach was named for
English explorers who poked around there about 1700. Each room had
a balcony, cool tile floors, air-conditioning and surprisingly
spacious bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   We ate breakfast and occasionally another meal at the hotel,
buffet style. Fruits and juices were fresh and delicious, but all
else paled in the morning before the coffee. It was deeply rich and
black, served with hot milk.
</P>
<P>
   Our first evening at the hotel, the parents in the group were
content to laze wearily on the veranda, drinking caipirinhas, a
lime drink usually made with cachaca, Brazilian sugar-cane liquor.
A few of the boys perused the small strip of beachfront restaurants
and souvenir shops selling T-shirts and crocheted bikinis and
thongs on either side of the hotel (their favorite souvenirs were
fake designer watches, but because the dollar is strong against the
real, almost everything seemed inexpensive).
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, they brought out a ball and began to kick it around
on the beach under the stars. This attracted some local people and
soon a full fledged game was on. Not one Brazilian guy walking
along the beach _ student, vendor or fisherman _ could keep his
foot off the ball if it came near him during our practices, and
their skill was remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   The team's first training session was at the Hotel Fazenda Jomar
on the mainland near Santo Amaro da Imperatriz, a spa town founded
to commemorate an imperial visit in 1845 by Dom Pedro II, emperor
of Brazil. Having traveled inland 18 miles, we were in dense green
mountains, and the group practiced on a field in danger of being
enveloped by the lush vegetation surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, we all took advantage of the resort's amenities. The
team swam in the pool, went rafting in rapids not rapid enough to
be classified, and sank paddle boats in the lake.
</P>
<P>
   On a shaded veranda, an accordionist played German music, a
reminder of the large influx of Germans who emigrated to this part
of Brazil in the 19th century. Several parents joined an ecological
walk around the grounds, which led to a waterfall of rare beauty;
on our way up, we disturbed a lizard the size of a small alligator.
</P>
<P>
   Florianopolis has two professional soccer teams, the Figueirense
Futebol Clube, based on the mainland, and the island's Avai Futebol
Clube, both of which cultivate players from a young age. After a
day of practice and a couple of scrimmages on the beach, our first
match took place against the Figueirense youth team in the club's
stadium in Florianopolis. The Brazilians, who were a year or two
older than John, won, 8-1, which did not seem to diminish the
excitement of playing a challenging opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Our game with the young Avai team two days later took place just
before the professional match between Avai and Caxias (from the
city of Porto Alegre). As the game went on, the stands filled up
with fans who cheered on both teams (we lost, 2-0) but who were
unforgiving of their pro team when it lost.
</P>
<P>
   After the game with Figueirense, our bus took us to the beach at
Joaquina, which is on the east side of the island and is famous for
surfing championships held there each year. After an open-air
lunch, the team wandered the beach, climbing the huge rocks at one
end and examining jellyfish that washed onto the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Praia da Joaquina are massive sand dunes of Saharan
proportion and, even though the wind whipped up the sand so
fiercely it practically blinded them, the team was determined to go
sandboarding. John and the boys happily forged their way up the
dunes over and over again, and dumped their weight in sand onto the
floor of the bus on the way back to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, we boarded a schooner and headed for the island of
Anhatomirim, where the team was to practice in the shadow of the
Santa Cruz fort, built in 1744. A Brazilian school group about the
same age as ours happened to be touring the fort, too, and it
wasn't long before another impromptu match was on.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian girls watched the American boys with obvious
pleasure, much to the consternation of the Brazilian boys, which
gave the game an edge it might not ordinarily have had. The
Brazilian boys, on the other hand, didn't know what to make of the
four highly skilled girls playing on our team. Only the parents
were in awe of the setting: on one side a centuries-old fortress
and on the other, the magnificent sea.
</P>
<P>
   After morning training another day, the group ventured downtown.
The two bridges to the mainland shadow 19th-century ocher-colored
market buildings along the old waterfront. Across the street from
the Praca 15 de Novembro, the city's main square, John stopped at
the entrance to the pink Cruz e Souza Palace to have his picture
taken beside the guard, who wore an elaborate uniform and held a
rifle with a bayonet. The team climbed the steps to the bright
white Metropolitan Cathedral, where a Mass was being said, then
plopped down pretending to be exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Since this day of sightseeing had little appeal for them, the
high point of the excursion was stopping at a shop called Futebol
Mania to buy official Figueirense and Avai jerseys. A few fathers
wandered off to the bus station to find Cuban cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Our meals outside the hotel were in seafood restaurants or in
churrascarias, places serving meat smorgasbords called rodizio (all
you can eat). Seafood lunches were waterside, in open-air
restaurants that served us at long communal tables _ local shrimp
in butter and oil, mussels in salsa, deep-fried whitefish, served
with plates of beets, shredded carrots and tomato, clay pots of
rich black beans, and crisp, deep-fried manioc root. When Barreto
realized that our ravenous American teen-agers kept passing on the
plates of fish and making faces, he arranged that they be served
chicken with rice and French fries instead.
</P>
<P>
   One evening we were taken to a cafe colonial, a Brazilian-style
high tea inspired by the customs of European immigrants in the 19th
century. On the beach, we snacked on corn on the cob served in the
husk and drank cool milk right from coconuts. The team's favorite
drink was Guarana, sweet green soda with lots of caffeine. (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   A cultural exchange had been arranged for us the afternoon
before we left at the Colegia Energia, a private school in
Florianopolis that prides itself on its English instruction. When
we arrived, we were met with wild cheers, as if we were a busload
of American movie stars. Our boys were a little stunned at such a
reception and we had to remind them to keep smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The school had prepared a short program and presented each of
our team members with souvenir notebooks. A soccer scrimmage was
held in which our girls soundly beat four Brazilian girls. While
our boys were outclassed on the field, they were mobbed by
Brazilian girls and boys asking for e-mail addresses and
photographs. Once our team got used to the attention, those who
spoke a little Spanish _ none spoke Portuguese _ tried to talk to
the students, who answered in their halting English.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, we lost our last match, against the Astel Futebol
Clube, but only by a single goal. Once, John collided with an Astel
player, knocking him to the ground. He reached down to help the
Brazilian to his feet, but was scolded by Barreto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you leave him alone,'' he said. ``Find him after the game
if you want.''
</P>
<P>
   When we returned to Cincinnati, the team went on to become
division champions, at least partly because of improved soccer
skills. But the trip had also provided the players with a surprise,
the opportunity to represent their country by their actions: how
they played the game did matter.

DAVID BLECHMAN, 76, DEVELOPED TWINLAB WITH HIS WIFE AND SONS  
 BY ERIC V. COPAGE  
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla.)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Blechman, a co-founder of the Twinlab Corp., a
nutritional supplement company that has grown with America's health
consciousness over 30 years, died on July 7 at New York
Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 76 and divided his time
between Commack and Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He died after complications from heart bypass surgery, a
spokesman for Twinlab said.
</P>
<P>
   Blechman founded Twinlab, based in Ronkonkoma, with his wife,
Jean, and they named it for their two sets of twin sons. The
Blechmans later had a fifth son, and eventually the entire family
worked for the business.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 interview with The New York Times, Ross Blechman, who
became chief executive of Twinlab when his father retired four
years ago, said the business began in 1968 with a liquid protein
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years later, Dr. Robert Linn wrote a book called `The
Last Chance Diet,' which involved a lot of liquid protein, and we
were swept up in the craze,'' Ross Blechman said.
</P>
<P>
   Today the company markets hundreds of vitamins, minerals, herbs
and sports nutrition products. Its worldwide sales are more than
$300 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   David Blechman was born on Sept. 22, 1923, in Brooklyn. He
attended Long Island University until he was drafted into the Army
during World War II and served with the Army Medical Corps in
Europe. After the war, he became a pharmaceutical salesman.
</P>
<P>
   With his sons approaching college age, Blechman realized he
could not afford tuition and took a gamble starting his own
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He figured he could always go back to the sales job and be
broke again,'' Ross Blechman said.
</P>
<P>
   David Blechman is survived by his wife of 54 years, the former
Jean Leopold; his brother, Dr. Harry Blechman of Manhattan; five
sons, Ross, Dean and Neil, all of Setauket; Steve of Poquott, and
Brian of Lloyd Harbor; and 10 grandchildren.

AS MORE AMERICANS TRAVEL TO CUBA, SUPPORT FOR LIMITS GROWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cuba has been off-limits for American tourists for almost 40
years, or ever since President John F. Kennedy imposed an economic
embargo on the island in 1962, and each of the next seven
Presidents has maintained it in varying degrees. But unless
President Clinton changes his mind, the ban on United States
tourist travel to Cuba is likely to be tightened sometime this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that only a few months ago support for lifting the
ban appeared to be growing, eroded by time and increasing exchange
programs between doctors, musicians, farmers, religious delegations
and athletes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, American farmers are eager to export their products
to Cuba, while airlines, hotel companies, tour operators and cruise
ships want a share of the island's growing tourist business, which
until now has gone mainly to Canada, Spain and Italy. Even the book
industry signaled its belief that the ban would be lifted when
within the past few weeks Fodor's, the Rough Guides and Michelin's
new Neos imprint each published guidebooks to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of this apparent groundswell, bills were introduced
in both the House and Senate to make it easier for U.S. citizens to
travel to Cuba, including one bill that would have allowed
unrestricted travel and ended Washington's authority to regulate
financial transactions involving such travel. The latter provision
was aimed at that portion of the existing Treasury Department
regulation that does not formally prohibit American tourists from
visiting Cuba but bars them from spending any money once there.
</P>
<P>
   But late last month the House of Representatives agreed to a
compromise that would ease some restrictions on sales of food and
medicine to Cuba, in return for writing into law the existing
policy regulating travel to the island. Clinton said he would be
``inclined'' to sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Travel from the United States to Cuba continues to increase.
While an undetermined number of American tourists enter from
Canada, Mexico, the Bahamas and other countries, others go as
members of cultural, educational, humanitarian or religious groups,
which are allowed in with few restrictions on regularly scheduled
charter flights from New York, Miami and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cuba's Tourism Ministry, the 1.6 million visitors
to Cuba last year included 165,000 Americans, 100,000 of them
naturalized Americans who were born in Cuba (still considered by
Havana to be Cuban citizens). Canadian tourists accounted for 17
percent of the total, Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain together
accounted for about 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Americans who visited Cuba last year was Jaimie Plog
of Mill Valley, Calif., who together with a friend flew from San
Francisco to Mexico City where they obtained visas, which were
stamped after they arrived at the airport in Havana. As they often
do to protect Americans who arrive from third countries, Cuban
immigration authorities did not stamp their passports, and on their
return home both women passed through United States immigration
without a hitch. In the interim they spent two and a half weeks on
the island ``hiking, scuba diving, riding horses and, at night,
dancing the merengue,'' Plog said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several entrepreneurs say they have figured out how
to take American tourists to Cuba without running afoul of United
States law. Last month, for example, the Valtur Prima, a
550-passenger Italian cruise ship, departed on the first of its
weekly cruises from Montego Bay, Jamaica, to Havana with American
tourists who booked through travel agents in Canada or Jamaica.
(American travel agents are forbidden to book cruises to Cuba.)
While in Cuba _ two days in Havana and a day at the beach on the
Isle of Youth _ Valtur Prima officials arranged for all shore
excursions to be ``hosted'' by a Canadian nonprofit foundation,
thereby assuring that American passengers were within the law.
Another ship, the 400-passenger Habana, is set to depart Nassau on
Nov. 16 on the first of year-round four-and five-day cruises to
Havana, but its strategy is somewhat different.
</P>
<P>
   ``An American company couldn't do it under U.S. law,'' said Sam
Blyth, the Canadian travel agent who has chartered the Greek-owned
ship (and who is the North American booking agent for the Valtur
Prima). ``And if foreign-owned ships got to Cuba, they wouldn't be
allowed to dock in the U.S. for six months.''
</P>
<P>
   But Blyth said that La Habana's cruises had been structured to
comply with United States regulations, including not just the
largess of the Canadian foundation but also shipboard lectures on
Cuban culture and politics.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposed ban does become law, it remains to be seen what
if any effect it will have on visits by educational, cultural and
humanitarian groups. In the meantime, Americans who qualify to
travel to Cuba need a valid passport, visa and a license from the
Department of the Treasury. Additional information, including Cuban
regulations governing visitors, is available at the following Web
sites: travel.state.gov/cuba.html;
www.state.gov/www/regions/wha/cuba/travel.html and
www.treas.gov/ofac.

BAN ON INTERNET GAMBLING FALLS SHORT IN HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a defeat for horse-racing interests and the
casino industry, the House Monday failed to approve a bill to ban
most forms of gambling on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of House lawmakers voted in favor of the bill _ 245
supporting it, with 159 opposed _ but advocates failed to reach a
two-thirds threshold required to speed its passage without
amendments. Thirty members abstained.
</P>
<P>
   The bill attempted to curb one of the fastest-growing activities
on the Internet, betting on casino-style games and sporting events.
There are more than 700 wagering sites on the Web, which generate
more than $1.2 billion a year, industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which was sponsored by Rep. Robert Goodlatte, R-Va.,
would also have prohibited the sale of lottery tickets online.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way to promote the Internet is to make sure that the seamy
side of life is dealt with on the Internet,'' Goodlatte said. He
compared the unregulated spread of cybergambling to the
proliferation of child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was backed by an unlikely alliance of Christian
evangelists, who invoked moral arguments against the explosion of
gambling at home, along with horse-track operators and liquor store
owners, who saw it as a direct threat to their profits.
</P>
<P>
   But an equally odd coalition thwarted the bill, including
Republican governors, online sports bookies and operators of
computer casinos based in Caribbean resorts and tax havens like
Antigua and Belize.
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing, greyhound racing and jai alai were exempted from
the bill after lobbyists persuaded lawmakers that it would
jeopardize the use of closed-circuit television for off-track
betting.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Schneider, the chairwoman of the Interactive Gaming Council,
praised the House defeat, telling The Associated Press that
``cooler heads have prevailed here.''
</P>
<P>
   While Internet gambling entrepreneurs concede that their
industry should be regulated _ and possibly even taxed _ Schneider
argued that the proposed ban would have been unenforceable because
technology is evolving so quickly and Internet operators are adept
at outpacing the federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider's organization called for legalizing and regulating
the practice, as has already occurred in 50 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the booming industry noted that online wagering is
making gambling available in states where it is not legal. The Web
sites are available to anyone with a credit card and a computer,
making them especially enticing for compulsive gamblers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 million Americans gamble online every day, according to
a recent telephone survey of Internet users by the Pew Internet and
American Life Project. About 5 percent of all Internet users, or
about 4.5 million Americans, have wagered online, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from Internet gambling are expected to exceed $3
billion by 2002, according to groups that track the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Monday's defeat, advocates of a ban said they might seek
to introduce another bill under terms where a simple majority would
prevail. They fell 45 votes shy of those needed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the groups supporting the ban are the National Association
of Attorneys General, the National Council of Churches, Focus on
the Family, the Family Research Council, Major League Baseball and
the National Association of Convenience Stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration opposed the bill, with officials
voicing concern over the exemptions for horse racing, dog racing
and jai alai.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bill lobbied heavily against it by drawing on
money from the gaming council, an association of dozens of online
betting sites whose business has grown at a pace to rival that of
some major Internet retailers like Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Many governors also registered their opposition to the
legislation, saying that the curbs might undercut the ability of
states to raise revenues through the sale of lottery tickets
online. Technology companies promoting in-home lottery sales spent
hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved a similar bill by voice vote in November.

N.J. SENATE CANDIDATE CORZINE FILES TO SELL $41 MILLION IN GOLMAN
SACHS STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jon Corzine, who spent a record $36.7 million to win the
Democratic primary in New Jersey for U.S. Senate, filed Monday to
sell $41 million worth of stock in Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., which he
once headed.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign spokesman said Corzine wanted to diversify his
investment portfolio.The candidate has lent his campaign $33
million so far.
</P>
<P>
   The stock sale is expected to take place in a public offering in
about two weeks. Goldman Sachs had offered its executives and
former partners the opportunity to sell up to 15 percent of their
shares, but in the end they were restricted to about 10 percent, or
411,668 shares in Corzine's case.
</P>
<P>
   But Corzine and other Goldman Sachs former and current
executives may get to sell another batch of shares if the company
finds demand for its shares great enough.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is selling more Goldman shares than any other
individual, Corzine, who resigned as co-chairman after the firm
went public in May 1999, will still be one of the biggest
individual owners of Goldman Sachs stock, owning about 4 million
shares worth about $400 million at Monday's closing price of about
$100 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Goldman Sachs' current and former partners have been
prohibited from selling any stock in the firm. In connection with
the May 1999 initial stock offering, Goldman Sachs said in filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission that those insiders
would hold their shares for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs allowed only one previous exception to the
restriction on stock transfers. Last year it allowed the current
and former partners to give shares away for charitable reasons, a
move that reduced the tax burdens the partners faced. Corzine
donated about 175,000 shares to public charities and private
foundations then, according to a document Goldman Sachs filed with
the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday, when the Corzine campaign filed its latest
financial disclosure with the Federal Election Commission, it had
spent $34.7 million and incurred an additional $2 million in debts,
easily surpassing the spending record for an entire Senate campaign
and more than quadrupling the previous record for spending in a
primary.
</P>

   Corzine has lent more than $33 million to his campaign, but Shea
said Corzine was in no hurry to pay himself back with proceeds from
the stock sale. ``He hasn't decided yet how to reinvest this money,
but he's not likely to use it to repay loans,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Corzine's opponent in the November election, Rep.
Robert Franks, released his own campaign finance filing showing
that he had spent $1.9 million to win the Republican primary. He
actually had more cash on hand at the close of the reporting period
Saturday _ $301,399 to Corzine's $211,862, according to the
campaign filings.
</P>
<P>
   But Franks, who earns $136,673 a year as a congressman, raised
$221,350 between the June 6 primary and the close of the reporting
period Saturday, including $122,100 from political action
committees and $99,250 in individual donations.

   Corzine's holdings in Goldman Sachs were worth about $234
million when Goldman Sachs went public in May 1999, ending the last
major partnership on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The price temporarily fell two weeks ago, when the company
announced that it would allow its current and former partners and
two institutions that own large stakes in the firm to sell a total
of about 40 million shares in a secondary public offering that is
expected to occur in about two weeks. The partners, who now are
being allowed to sell 16.4 million shares, could get the right to
sell another 6 million shares if the offering is oversubscribed by
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Goldman Sachs officials will begin a tour of major
financial centers to promote the stock offering. The price of the
shares being sold will be determined after that tour.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, which is expected to occur in early August, could push
down the price as the supply of stock available to the public
increases.

   THE POLLS
</P>
<P>
   BUSH LEAD GETS SMALLER  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three new polls taken over the weekend indicate that Gov. George
W. Bush's lead over Vice President Al Gore is narrowing. A CBS News
survey shows Bush leading Gore, 43 to 41 percent, down from his
47-to-39 edge in May. A Zogby poll has Bush holding a 45-to-41
lead, compared to a 47-to-39 edge a month ago. And a USA Today/CNN
Gallup poll has Bush leading Gore 45-to-43, compared to 50-to-41 a
week ago. The CBS poll covered 596 adults and had a margin of
sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, meaning the
Bush lead was statistically insignificant. Significantly, however,
Bush's potential voters were more likely than his rival's to say
they supported him enthusiastically. And when people who leaned to
Bush or Gore were added to those firmly committed, Bush led 46 to
43. When Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party and Ralph Nader of the
Green Party were added to the poll, Bush beat Gore, 42 to 37, and
Nader and Buchanan got 4 percent each. In the Zogby poll, which
surveyed 890 likely voters and had a three percentage point
sampling error, Bush led Gore, 43 to 37, when other candidates were
added, with Nader getting 6 percent and Buchanan receiving 3
percent. In the USA/CNN poll, which surveyed 1,063 registered
voters over the weekend and has a four percentage point error
margin, Bush led Gore, 45 to 43, when other candidates were added,
with Nader picking up 5 percent and Buchanan getting 3 percent. The
USA/CNN poll showed Gore gained support from women and independents
in the past week, apparently helped by the endorsement of former
Sen. Bill Bradley.

<P>
   It's only July and already the hard-fought congressional contest
in the Los Angeles suburbs between Rep. James E. Rogan, R-Pasadena,
and State Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, is on the verge of becoming
the most expensive House race in American history. With about $7.5
million raised so far, the candidates seem all but certain to
surpass the $8 million record set in Georgia in the 1996 contest
between then-Speaker Newt Gingrich and his Democratic challenger,
Michael Coles. Rogan, one of the House impeachment managers in the
case against President Clinton, is facing a stiff challenge in a
once-Republican district that has been trending more Democratic in
recent years. Liberal groups have made Rogan one of the year's top
targets in the Democratic effort to regain control of the House,
and by the time independent expenditures by outside groups are
factored in, the overall cost of the race is sure to be even
higher.

HILLARY CLINTON'S CREDIBLE RESPONSE 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 18,
2000:
</P>
<P>
   It is a sour coincidence that Hillary Rodham Clinton should be
accused of using anti-Semitic language while negotiations are under
way at Camp David that represent the best chance in decades for a
comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East. But in another
sense, this juxtaposition of domestic politics and foreign policy
provides an opportunity to examine a serious underlying principle.
There is no doubt, in our view, that Clinton, if elected to the
Senate, would be a firm supporter of Israel's security, its
aspirations for peace and its economic vitality. We say that
without imputing any weakness on these issues to her Republican
opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio. Our intent is simply to say that this is
one of those campaign moments when voters need to look at long-term
policy prospects rather than the controversy of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Clinton's handling of matters important to New
York's Jewish voters has been fraught with controversy since the
start of her candidacy to succeed her fellow Democrat, Sen. Daniel
Moynihan. But her early gaffes were not as shocking as depicted by
detractors who want to see her lose part of a constituency that is
essential to any Democrat in a tight statewide race. Clinton's 1998
remark that she would favor creation of a Palestinian state is now
not far afield from current Israeli and American policies. Both
governments are open to establishment of such a state as part of
the Camp David negotiations. Her appearance with Yasser Arafat's
wife, Suha, last year, while awkward, was nonetheless handled in a
way that did not disrupt sensitive negotiations between Israeli and
Palestinian leaders. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, was
among those defending Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The current complication centers on the report in a new book
about the Clintons' marriage, ``State of a Union,'' by Jerry
Oppenheimer, that she used an anti-Semitic slur in an argument with
the manager of her husband's losing congressional campaign in 1974.
Those not present can never be absolutely certain about what was
said at the campaign headquarters that day. But the circumstantial
evidence inclines us strongly toward believing Clinton when she
says she never used such language. The alleged remark took place
not long after Clinton's expansively humanistic commencement speech
at Wellesley, and after she had worked in a sophisticated legal
environment for the impeachment of a president, Richard Nixon, who
did use anti-Semitic language. Clinton by her own admission has a
volatile temper, but this kind of language seems out of keeping
with her philosophy and a well-documented history of public remarks
and private political conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Quinnipiac University poll shows Clinton getting 54
percent of the Jewish vote to 34 percent for Lazio. In order to
win, she probablyhas to come close to the 76 percent gained by
Sen. Charles Schumer in 1998. Her decision to abandon her usual
no-comment mode in favor of a passionate, almost teary response to
the allegation of anti-Semitic language was a sound one. President
Clinton's decision to step into the fray, while understandable as
husbandly concern, was probably less helpful to the political task
confronting Clinton. Her problem extends beyond any single
constituency group.
</P>
<P>
   This is going to be a grindingly brutal campaign. From now on,
Clinton will be under continuous pressure to assert her
independence from her husband and to fight her own fights. She also
has to explain her policies and reveal her personality to an
electorate that does not know her well. In this instance, we think
she made a convincing case that she did not use the language
ascribed to her.

JAPAN'S CENTRAL BANK LEAVES SHORT-TERM RATES ALONE

 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Despite signs of strength in Japan's economy, Bank of
Japan policy-makers voted Monday to prolong their policy of keeping
short-term interest rates at virtually zero, attributing the
decision to concerns over the fallout from the failure of a highly
indebted department store company last week.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement unusual for its attempt to explain the decision,
the central bank said it had decided to leave rates alone because
of continued uncertainty about employment and wages. Even more
unusual was its mention of the the failed department store
operator, Sogo Co., which declared bankruptcy under loans totaling
more than $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pointed out that the board needed to see how the
commencement of reconstruction proceedings of Sogo Co. could affect
market developments and business sentiment,'' the bank said in a
statement issued Monday afternoon after its nine-member policy
board concluded its regular monthly meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation had been building for weeks that the Bank of Japan
would nudge interest rates raise upwards Monday for the first time
in 10 years because of evidence that the world's second-biggest
economy is in a sustainable recovery from its worst period of
protracted economic weakness since World War II. Central bank
officials themselves have said that keeping rates so low is
abnormal and temporary, hinting that recent evidence of economic
strength like improved corporate profits, rising production and
higher business investment justified a rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   But the collapse of Sogo, which operates 25 stores and employs
10,000 people, dampened the optimism about Japan's recovery and
served as a sobering reminder of how much bad debt still infects
the Japanese banking system. Rising interest rates would make it
more expensive and difficult for debtors to repay loans, which
could lead to more insolvencies and business failures.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's decision to leave rates alone was welcomed by
economists, government officials and politicians, many of whom have
argued in recent weeks that the bank lacked a clear-cut rationale
for raising rates and ran the risk of short-circuiting the economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bank seemed adamant about raising rates last week,'' said
Ronald Bevacqua, senior economist at Commerz Securities in Tokyo.
``The fact that they didn't do it immediately was related to Sogo,
which reinvigorated uncertainty about the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the news was likely to have a positive impact on stock
and bond markets, which had been bracing for a slight increase in
rates, but weaken the yen.
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Koll, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, said he
believed Monday's decision would force the bank to postpone a rate
increase for at least another year and perhaps longer. ``I actually
think in terms of the business cycle, we're peaking out right about
now,'' he said. ``Industrial production is now growing 7 percent
compared to last year, but I think at the end of the year, we'll be
at about half that pace.''
</P>
<P>
   How the bank will determine that its concerns about Sogo can be
safely set aside is a bit of a mystery. There will be little
economic data released between now and Aug. 11, when the policy
board meets again, and the bank did not spell out which tea leaves
it would be watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic conditions are now strong enough to be compatible
with rising rates, so unless we see some unexpectedly weak
indicators over the next month, we could see an increase in
August,'' said Masaaki Kanno, senior economist at J.P. Morgan in
Tokyo. ``Stock prices are probably going to be quite important.''
</P>
<P>
   He said if the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index, which at
17,286.83 is now down 8.7 percent for the year, rises above 18,000
and stays there, the bank might raise rates next month. (By the
midday trading break on Tuesday, the Nikkei index was down 81.88
points, or nearly half a percent.)
</P>
<P>
   While there was widespread praise for the bank's restraint, the
decision raised questions about when the bank will carry through on
its intentions to eventually raise rates. ``The importance of the
decision is not so much about interest rates as it is about
credibility,'' said Marshall Gittler, a currency strategist at the
Bank of America in Hong Kong. ``The Bank of Japan is now the
central bank that cried wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   Masaru Hayami, the bank's governor, has made it clear that he
wants to raise rates and quickly, arguing that the so-called
zero-interest rate policy was adopted as an emergency measure in
February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Such an extremely loose monetary policy normally runs the risk
of fueling inflation. But Japan has the opposite problem _ prices
are falling here. Consumer spending is erratic at best, and
bankruptcies are rising to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Although business investment has picked up, companies are not
borrowing to finance their expenditures despite exceptionally low
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own view is that monetary policy in this current
environment when everyone is trying to pay down debt is largely
irrelevant,'' said Richard C. Koo, chief economist at the Nomura
Research Institute Ltd. ``So I think a little too much emphasis has
been placed on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Koo said the bank was right to delay a rate increase in the wake
of Sogo's demise. Sogo failed after the government abandoned plans
to use 97 billion yen, or nearly $900 million, in taxpayer money as
part of a plan to forgive some of Sogo's debts.
</P>
<P>
   That turnabout was initially hailed as a sign that politicians
would stand aside and allow painful structural adjustments to take
place in the economy, and while investors are generally still
applauding the government's decision, they have also begun trying
to assess the costs of that decision.
</P>
<P>
   What has become increasingly clear is that, whereas the original
plan would have required a handful of major banks and the taxpayers
to shoulder the burden of Sogo, allowing the retailer to fail under
court supervision will spread the pain to scores of smaller
financial institutions and trade creditors.
</P>
<P>
   The government will also presumably have trouble coming to the
rescue of other heavily indebted companies, now that it has set a
precedent with Sogo. ``If this kind of thing goes on unabated, we
could actually break the cycle of growth that the Japanese economy
is in,'' Koo said.

EDITORIAL: SHORTCHANGING FOREIGN AID 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 18,
2000:
</P>
<P>
   Although there are some positive elements in the foreign aid
bill that the House passed last week, it is still seriously flawed
and has rightly invited a veto threat from President Clinton. The
basic problem is that the overall allocation is far too low to meet
American foreign policy objectives. Both the House bill and the
Senate version that passed in June are nearly $2 billion below the
White House request for fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Both spending bills make severe cuts in White House funding for
multinational development banks that make basic infrastructure
loans to the poorest countries. They also fail to finance
international women's health programs adequately, and reduce
funding for peacekeeping and nuclear nonproliferation efforts. The
House, for instance, would cut the administration's contribution to
development loans by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the House bill contains an unacceptable provision
that would deny American assistance to any foreign organization
that uses its own money to provide abortions or engages in
political debate to change abortion laws. Under long-standing law,
no U.S. government funds may be used to pay for abortions or to
lobby on abortion policy in other countries. Last year Congress
went further, barring groups from using other funds to engage in
those activities. The Clinton administration accepted a one-year
restriction as part of a deal with congressional Republicans to pay
back dues owed to the United Nations. This anti-democratic gag rule
on abortion advocacy should now be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also calling on Congress to raise international
family planning aid overall. The House bill maintains funding at
the inadequate level of $385 million, which is 30 percent below
1995 levels, before Congress slashed the program.
</P>
<P>
   The House did, however, approve an amendment to increase funding
for debt relief for the world's poorest nations, to meet Clinton's
request of $225 million. Debt relief is crucial because the poorest
nations are spending up to 60 percent of their budgets to service
debt on old loans, and are unable to direct scarce resources toward
health and social investments that can reduce poverty. But the
House failed, as did the Senate, to provide $210 million for debt
relief in supplemental spending for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The House wisely adopted an amendment to finance global AIDS
programs at the president's request of $244 million. But those
funds came out of other important foreign operations accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill does not contain the anti-abortion provision,
but it has only a paltry $75 million for debt relief, and deserves
a veto for that funding shortfall. These unrealistic, crippling
cuts most likely mean that the final foreign aid numbers will have
to be part of the budget negotiations between the White House and
Congress later in the year.

MUNICIPAL ARTS COMMISSION PUTS `COWS ON PARADE' OUT TO PASTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PENN  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ``Cows on Parade'' in
Chicago and New York will not be hoofing their way to Kansas City.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After several hours of lively debate centering on the essence of
art, the Municipal Arts Commission voted 4-2 Monday to kill a
proposal that would have spread decorated, fiberglass cows around
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the commission decided to pursue a more original plan,
leaving the door open for suggestions on what that public art
display might look like. Dozens of people attended the hearing,
many to voice their opposition to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we endorse `Cows on Parade' we're saying this is the best
Kansas City has to offer,'' said commission member Richard Pierre
Nadeau. ``I'm profoundly saddened by that thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadeau had written a letter to the mayor that sparked the
hearing and the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I submit to you, serious public art is not decorated cows,''
said Nadeau.
</P>
<P>
   A sculptor who went only by the name ``Stretch'' and several
like-minded people attended the hearing, dressed in T-shirts
depicting a cow turned upside down with an X through it. Throughout
the hearing they waved signs that read, ``Cows are bad. Original?
Not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely a no vote on cows,'' said Stretch.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the hearing, Linda Off spoke on behalf of
the American Royal, the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art and the
Kansas City Zoo, the agencies that would have benefited from the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an excellent way for artists to be known,'' said Off.
``It's a very public, participatory event.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters argued that the project had been successful and
profitable in other cities where it had been tried, particularly in
Chicago. The Kansas City version of ``Cows on Parade'' would have
followed the Chicago model, which enlisted nearly 300 artists to
decorate fabricated fiberglass cow forms.
</P>
<P>
   Local corporations would have been invited to sponsor the cows
and have their names listed on accompanying plaques for $5,000
each, for a potential corporate outlay of $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $5,000 paid by a sponsor, $1,000 would have gone to the
artist; after expenses the rest would have gone to the Royal, the
Kemper and the zoo. Some of those against the project argued that
$1,000 was not enough money to compensate local artists.
</P>
<P>
   Off said no taxpayer dollars would have been spent on the
project, which had drawn the support of Mayor Kay Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   The cows would have been placed on city property next year from
May to August. After that the cows would have been auctioned, with
proceeds also going to the three beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is a worthwhile endeavor,'' Barnes wrote in a
letter to the commission. ``I view `Cows on Parade' as a community
arts project of a temporary nature, which allows a large number of
people to be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agreed with the mayor's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Holmes, a commission member, didn't like the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I don't like cows,'' Holmes said. ``But this is
too big a thing to be a follower. Frankly, I just don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the project were hoping to duplicate the success that
occurred in other cities. Chicago's event attracted global media
attention. And a 500-cow display has opened in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Kosloff, the commission chairman, told members he was
concerned that the decision was being based on good art vs. bad
art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arts Commission is asked to approve encroachment issues on
public property,'' Kosloff said. ``It's a temporary project. All of
us in our own hearts will decide whether it's good art or bad art
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosloff's argument was not enough to stem the tide of
discontent; one artist after another lambasted the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the vote was taken, its outcome prompting applause from
the artists in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a good project, but they went about it wrong,''
said Myra Morgan, an art gallery owner for 35 years who spoke
against the plan. ``If they would have gone to the arts community,
it could have been a great thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes thinks the right decision was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it was very original,'' said Holmes. ``And
the organizations that stood to benefit certainly don't need help
fund raising.''
</P>
<P>
   There was talk that maybe another idea might emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Posey, a commission member, was un sure what direction
supporters would go in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the project is dead or what,'' said Posey.
```But I do know, we all want to see a public exhibit of some
sort.'' ( 30 )

HARMON INDUSTRIES AGREES TO $425 MILLION PURCHASE BY GE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Harmon Industries
Inc., a Blue Springs, Mo., railroad safety equipment company
started more than 50 years ago, on Monday agreed to be bought by
General Electric Co. for $425 million.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harmon will be acquired for $30 a share, upon approval from
regulators and shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon's stock jumped Monday by $16.38 a share and closed at
$29.56 in heavy trading on the Nasdaq exchange. The buyout is
expected to be tax-free for Harmon shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Under the buyout, Harmon will become part of GE Harris Railway
Electronics, a joint venture of GE Transportation Systems of Erie,
Pa., and Harris Corp. of Melbourne, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A Harmon executive said Monday that it was too early to
determine the buyout's effect on Harmon's work force, which
includes about 800 Kansas City area employees and 2,000
companywide.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that drew us to GE is their people,
technology, quality of products and customer service,'' said
Stephen L. Schmitz, Harmon's chief financial officer. ``We will
work to put the two organizations together in the best possible
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing had been decided about the merger's effect on either
company's facilities, Schmitz said. In addition to its Blue Springs
corporate headquarters, Harmon has plants in Grain Valley, Mo., and
Warrensburg, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't take that as a negative; this could be very beneficial
for our area,'' Schmitz said of the merger. ``It's a good
combination for our employees and our customers. This will take the
technology we've been developing forward.''
</P>
<P>
   GE thinks the combining companies are complementary rather than
overlapping, said Susan Breon, a spokeswoman for GE Transportation
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``GE Harris Railway is in software development and systems
integration for rail-signaling equipment,'' she said. ``Harmon is
more the producer of the actual equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   The top executives of both companies said combining the two
businesses would reap benefits for both entities.
</P>
<P>
   John Krenicki, president and chief executive officer of GE
Transportation Systems, said Harmon's products corresponded to GE
Harris' product line and expanded General Electric's offerings in
railroad signaling and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorn E. Olsson, Harmon's president and chief executive officer,
said the merger would help the company reach its long-term goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all employees of Harmon can take pride in the fact
that we are joining forces with one of the best recognized
corporations in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would end the independence of a company started in 1946
by Robert C. Harmon, an engineer who persuaded Kansas City Southern
Railway to place an order for electronic equipment with his
fledgling company.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon was succeeded by his son, Robert E. Harmon, who became
president in 1969. The company went public in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Olsson joined Harmon Industries as president and chief operating
officer in 1990. He became chief executive officer in December
1994, when Robert E. Harmon stepped down from the company's daily
operations but remained chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon grew through the late 1990s, posting record sales and
profits in 1998. In recent years, Harmon also has acquired several
smaller companies and has established subsidiaries in Canada,
Mexico, Australia, England and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   However, big railroad mergers and the subsequent congestion led
to less demand for Harmon products in 1999, prompting a
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Harmon closed facilities in Lee's Summit;
Riverside, Calif.; and Long Island, N.Y. The closings and transfers
resulted in additional jobs for Harmon in Missouri, where it now
has about 1,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   GE Transportation had sales of more than $2 billion last year
and employs about 6,700. GE Harris Railway has about 460 employees,
mostly in Melbourne, Breon said. GE Harris Railway also has a
facility in Germany, she said. ( 30 )

EDITORIAL: UNBIASED ACCOUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 18,
2000:
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, would not appear to be asking for very much. He wants
independent audits of corporate financial statements to be just
that, independent. Yet his seemingly innocuous proposals aimed at
guaranteeing independence are drawing heavy resistance from the
accounting profession and, because the industry is rich and
powerful, from Capitol Hill. Ordinary investors should pull for
Levitt to win this struggle because the rules he has proposed are
calibrated to protect their financial interests.
</P>
<P>
   By law, public corporations hire outside auditors each year to
examine their financial statements. The idea is to reassure
investors that corporate reports on earnings and other measures of
financial health have been prepared according to professional
standards. Recently, public confidence in these outside audits has
been shaken by a number of explosive financial crises. Investors
lost a lot of money, in part because they relied on fraudulent or
misleading financial reports issued by companies and certified by
their auditors.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the corporate failures is the insidious appearance of
a conflict of interest. Accounting firms increasingly perform
lucrative consulting services for companies they audit. The
commission is now asking whether this relationship creates an
unhealthy incentive for accounting firms to perform less aggressive
audits. In some recent cases where a company's financial condition
turned out to be much worse than investors had been told, the
accounting firm that performed the errant audit had also provided
its client with substantial non-audit services.
</P>
<P>
   Is there proof that the non-auditing work caused auditors to
wink at impropriety? No. But suspicions lurk.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has now issued new rules for public comment and possible
adoption by the end of the year that address those suspicions. The
proposed rules would solidify two principles. One is that auditors
should not own stock in the companies they audit. The second is
that an accounting firm should not be allowed to audit other
services provided by the same firm.
</P>
<P>
   Toward those ends, the proposed rules would require auditors to
disclose non-auditing services they provide their clients and would
prohibit auditors from doing external audits for companies for
which they also provide internal audits. The new rules would also
prohibit accounting firms from designing computer systems that
generate financial statements for companies they audit.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the five major accounting firms oppose the chairman's
efforts. So does the major association of public accountants.
Several members of Congress from both houses have sent letters to
the chairman questioning the need for the proposed rules. But
Levitt is right to proceed. Investor confidence requires not only
the absence of conflicts of interest but the absence of the
appearance of such conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has proposed nothing draconian, only common-sense rules
to make sure that outside auditors perform and appear to perform
independent audits. For that the chairman deserves Congress'
enthusiastic support.

CONE STRUGGLES AGAIN IN LOSS TO PHILLIES
</HEADLINE>
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Cone wanted the baseball Monday night even
before the national anthem was played at Yankee Stadium. Cone's
shoulders were hunched and he looked as if he were walking uphill
as he strolled to the mound and waved his glove toward Umpire Mark
Hirschbeck. Hirschbeck did not respond and made Cone wait for the
ball. The wait only delayed the start of another depressing night.
</P>
<P>
   Once Cone got the ball, once Cone dug his cleats into the dirt
and tried to get comfortable, everyone stared at him and everyone
wondered how he would fare. Cone is a proud and ornery pitcher not
accustomed to failure, but this season has disappointed him and
caused the doubts and the questions about his future to escalate.
</P>
<P>
   Cone did little to stem those doubts and questions Monday night
as the Philadelphia Phillies belted two homers off the 37-year-old
right-hander and held on to beat the Yankees, 10-8. Monday is the
anniversary of Cone's magical perfect game against the Montreal
Expos last season, but aside from Cone's two crucial postseason
victories in helping the Yankees to a second straight World Series
title, his pitching since last July 18 has essentially been
imperfect.
</P>
<P>
   The spiral continued Monday night as Cone allowed six runs in
five innings and lost his sixth straight decision, a career high.
It also extended his streak without a victory to a career-worst 12
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Gooden has pitched well in two appearances and would be a
candidate to replace Cone in the rotation. But Manager Joe Torre
said before the game that Cone was not pitching for his spot last
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to pitch five days from now, as far as I'm
concerned,'' said Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Since Orlando Hernandez is expected to miss his start against
the Detroit Tigers Wednesday night because of a sprained right
elbow, Cone has a little more time to assert himself and remain in
the rotation. He stifled the Toronto Blue Jays, 3-0, on April 28,
his only victory in a 1-8 season. With the Yankees fighting the
Jays for first place in the American League East, how much longer
can Torre continue to use an ineffective Cone?
</P>
<P>
   After Pat Burrell smashed a slider that was just above his
ankles over the center field fence for a three-run homer in the
fifth last night, Cone put his hands on his hips and stared toward
the outfield. He looked exasperated and frustrated, which is how
the Yankees felt, too. They still felt that way when Bobby Abreu
ripped a grand slam off Jason Grimsley in the seventh to put the
Phillies ahead, 10-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think David Cone's mind-set is more of looking for an answer
right now,'' said Torre. ``I think the big thing bothering him is
how good he feels physically and it's not translating into what it
should translate into. It baffles him, why it's not there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cone has struggled, he has rarely had a decent slider. But
he used a nifty slider to strike out Kevin Sefcik and Abreu in the
first Monday night. One inning done, Cone must have thought. Five
or six more like that and he could talk about the beginning of a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   But by the second inning, Cone was in trouble as he walked Scott
Rolen on five pitches and Mike Lieberthal crushed his next pitch
into the left field bullpen for a 2-0 lead. Cone lifted his hands
above his head, dug around the rubber and kicked his left leg into
the air as he waited to resume pitching. His reddened face was
filled with a frown.
</P>
<P>
   David Coggin, who was pitching at Class AA Reading five weeks
ago, walked the bases loaded with two out in the Yankee third. Tino
Martinez lined a single to right, and after one runner scored,
Bernie Williams also tried to score on the hit. Abreu's strong
throw to Lieberthal was about 10 feet up the third base line and
beat Williams, but Williams crashed into the catcher with his left
shoulder and his left leg to jar the ball loose and tie the score,
2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Williams later bowled over Tom Prince, who replaced Lieberthal
(sprained left ankle), when he scored New York's fourth run. But
even though the Yankees scored the game's last four runs, they
could not catch the Phils on this night, and Coggin earned his
second victory in his fifth major league start.
</P>
<P>
   And Cone's woes went on. After a 1-2-3 third inning, he
encountered more problems during an ugly fourth. Abreu lined a
double to right and Rolen slapped a routine grounder to shortstop.
Derek Jeter darted to his left and had the roller glance off his
glove for what should have been an error, but it was ruled a single
and there were two runners on instead of one on and one out.
</P>
<P>
   Prince blooped a single to center to make it, 3-2 and Cone was
sweating now, trying to keep the Yankees in the game. Cone uncorked
a slider that bent beneath Burrell's knees, but the rookie did a
tremendous job of reaching down and driving the ball about 430
feet. It was tough for the Yankees to watch the ball soar, even
tougher for them to watch Cone sputter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coney is not going to quit,'' said Torre. ``He's going to
solve this. We're going to help him do that.''

RULING IN CALIFORNIA FAVORS MEDICINAL USE OF MARIJUANA 
 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Seriously ill patients with no alternative but
marijuana to alleviate their conditions will now be able to obtain
the drug legally from a group in Oakland, Calif., a federal judge
ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Modifying an injunction that shut down several marijuana clubs
two years ago, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer has given the
Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative a green light to distribute
marijuana to patients who meet certain requirements: They must have
a serious medical condition; they will suffer imminent harm without
marijuana; and they have no legal alternative to marijuana for
effective treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Breyer said the government had failed to prove
why seriously ill patients should not have legal access the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of medicinal marijuana use hailed the decision,
saying many patients would benefit. Specifically they said
medicinal marijuana could help curb weight loss in AIDS patients,
alleviate nausea induced by chemotherapy in cancer patients, treat
glaucoma and ease chronic pain associated with multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Jones, executive director of the Oakland club, called for
the federal government to take the next step and reclassify
marijuana as ``an accepted therapeutic plant.'' Jones said that his
club, with about 5,000 registered members, might reopen as early as
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Originally shut down by the Justice Department along with five
other clubs, the Oakland club was the only one to file suit.
Breyer's decision is expected to prompt many of the clubs to
reopen, as well as motivate the opening of new clubs, some
advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, California passed Proposition 215, an initiative
allowing the medicinal use of marijuana, but the measure has been
embroiled in legal battles ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative permits patients, with a doctor's recommendation,
to legally grow marijuana for their own treatment. This conflicts
with federal law, which does not recognize any medicinal properties
of marijuana, much less its legal use.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling Monday, Breyer noted that the 9th Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals in San Francisco had ordered him to consider an
exemption for patients who faced imminent harm and had no effective
alternative to marijuana, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said that in recent hearings the government had failed
to present new arguments against the medical use of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   John Entwistle, spokesman for Californians for Compassionate
Use, said that Breyer's decision was a breakthrough and that one
day marijuana ``will end up in our pharmacies and grocery stores.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you accept the underlying issue of the medical necessity
of marijuana,'' Entwistle said, ``it disqualifies the federal
argument against its medicinal use.''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokeswoman said officials were reviewing
the judge's decision and had no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medicinal properties have already been accepted at local
and state levels,'' Jones said. ``We're waiting for the federal
government to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that his club and others in the state would be
consulting their lawyers to figure out how best to open their
doors.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction still prevents the sale of marijuana to patients
who do not meet the criteria, and Jones said he did not know how
many of his club's members would qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to proceed cautiously,'' he said.

MISSOURI VOTERS SHOW REPUBLICAN LEANINGS, POLL INDICATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Missouri, long
recognized as a bellwether of the nation's political mood, appears
_ for now _ to be tilting Republican.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Polls commissioned by The Kansas City Star showed last week that
GOP candidates for president, U.S. Senate and governor were leading
their races. Although polls for the Senate and governor's races
were extremely close, in both cases the Republicans clung to leads.
</P>
<P>
   In bad news for Vice President Al Gore, who is visiting Kansas
City today and Wednesday, GOP opponent George W. Bush was leading
by 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Two other questions in The Star telephone poll also showed a
Republican tilt. One asked Missourians whether they would like to
see Democrats or Republicans control the U.S. House after the
November elections.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP came out on top with 46 percent to the Democrats' 39
percent. Fifteen percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Asked which idea they favored to ensure the future of Social
Security _ a plan similar to Bush's proposal or one like Gore's _
respondents picked the Bush method 37 percent to 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the Republicans do seem to have an edge,'' said Ken
Warren, a St. Louis University political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats shot back that the races would turn around once voters
became more fully engaged and started examining the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent it's easier to electrify your base if you're
the party out of power,'' said Roy Temple, executive director of
the Missouri Democratic Party. ``In the end, Democrats are
Democrats for a reason. When people start thinking about the
issues, it'll be clear which is the better choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore flies to Kansas City today to take aim at a state long
known for backing both Democrats and Republicans. He is scheduled
to attend a rally in downtown Kansas City at 5:30 p.m. today and
attend a private fund-raiser. On Wednesday he is to attend an
anti-crime event in Raytown.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the vice president hope that the events will help
him cut into the 48-percent-to-37-percent edge Bush recorded in The
Star poll. Although Missouri supported Bill Clinton in 1996, the
state found itself favoring the Republican candidate so far this
year. Other states in a similar position are Minnesota, Wisconsin
and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The Star poll also showed Republican John Ashcroft leading
Democrat Mel Carnahan in the U.S. Senate race by 47 percent to 43
percent, barely within the poll's four-point margin of error. In
the race for governor, Republican Jim Talent led Democrat Bob
Holden by 41 percent to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are proving to be more than competitive in a key area
_ fund-raising _ that could help them in November. So far Carnahan
has raised $6.2 million in his race to unseat Ashcroft, while the
senator has brought in $7.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the governor's race, Democrat Holden was leading with $6.6
million raised to Talent's $4.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   But in another indictor of potential GOP strength, Bush by
himself got more votes _ 275,366 _ in Missouri's March presidential
primary than the 260,654 votes that Gore and rival Democrat Bill
Bradley brought in together.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, though, have said that those numbers were skewed
because the Democratic primary race was largely over in March while
the GOP battle was in full force, thanks to Bush challenger Sen.
John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Missouri always had been a conservative state,
often led by conservative-to-moderate Democrats. Over time,
Democrats have become more liberal on issues such as taxes,
abortion and crime, said GOP spokesman Daryl Duwe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not where a lot of people find themselves any more,''
Duwe said of the Democrats. ``They realized the party they were
backing wasn't voting the way they would vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say proof of that can be found in the 163-member
Missouri House. Ten years ago the GOP had just 58 members. Today
they are at 76 and hope to get a majority come November for the
first time in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a sense, the GOP says, that Democrats are barely
clinging to their narrow majorities in the nine-member
congressional delegation and the 34-member state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Once longtime Democratic incumbents step aside because of term
limits or retirement, the GOP thinking goes, Republicans will claim
those largely rural seats and take majority status.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the rural areas the Democratic Party hasn't been what those
voters are about,'' Duwe said. ``Democrats are holding those seats
by force of personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Out on the hustings this year, Republicans say they sense
something new: Voters who once claimed to be Democrats are now
hedging, saying they plan to divide their votes between the
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing a swing,'' said Republican Danielle Moore, a
retired teacher from Fulton, who ran for the 20th District House
seat two years ago. ``I am noticing that more people seem to be
identifying themselves as split-ticket voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Jim Howerton, a House member running for the 31st
Senate district seat south of Kansas City, said he was getting a
positive reception from longtime Democrats as he went door to door.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why, Howerton said two words: Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether people feel like Clinton's done all the things he's
been accused of or not, they're just tired of it,'' Howerton said.
``It's left a sour taste in people's mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, veteran Democratic state Rep. Henry Rizzo said
he was confident of his party's chances in November. But he
acknowledged that he was encountering a lot of Democratic voters
who simply had not yet tuned in to the races. Democrats running
statewide must pull in big totals from the state's two largest
cities to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``What scares me worst than anything is voter apathy,'' said
Rizzo, who represents northeast Kansas City. ``I'm very concerned
about it. Democrats are not fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit to Kansas City today illustrates some of the same
problems he faces in other states. Instead of venturing out to
suburban areas that are in play this year, Gore will be spending
his time shoring up the Democratic base with his stops downtown and
in Raytown, known as good Democratic turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be reaching out toward the suburbs, toward trying to
broaden his base to ensure his victory,'' said Warren, the
political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, added Warren, already was doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan cautioned that a lot of time remained between now and
Election Day. Most voters trust Democrats more to handle issues
such as Social Security, Medicare, education and health care; once
that message sinks in, the polls will turn around, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the message we really need to get out,'' the governor
said. `We really have fought in the trenches for these issues.
These things just haven't fallen out of the sky.'' ( 30 )

INVESTMENT INCOME IS KEEPING SOME AREA HOSPITALS IN THE BLACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ With the health-care
industry engulfed in turmoil in recent years, some Kansas City area
hospitals have made millions of dollars in profits while others
have bled red ink.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an extreme example, financial losses and a weak asset base
prompted Health Midwest to close Park Lane Medical Center last
year, depriving some Raytown area residents of a neighborhood
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Yet according to financial disclosure documents filed with the
Internal Revenue Service, some area hospitals have logged healthy
profits, aided by an infusion of investment income.
</P>
<P>
   Such hospitals, however, lost money or barely broke even from
their primary function: taking care of sick people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investment income was the only thing that really saved us last
year,'' said G. Richard Hastings, president and chief executive
officer of the St. Luke's-Shawnee Mission Health System, which
includes St. Luke's Hospital and Shawnee Mission Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1998, investment income of $10.8 million turned
a loss of $1.3 million at St. Luke's Hospital into a net gain of
$9.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals elsewhere tell a similar story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hearing from our members around the country that the
difference between red ink and black ink this year has been
investments and philanthropy,'' said Richard Wade, a spokesman for
the American Hospital Association in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Wade blamed ``underpayments'' by private insurance and the
federal Medicare program for elderly patients. ``Sixty percent of
the nation's hospitals are losing money every time they treat a
Medicare patient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that, some hospitals depend on investment income to
heal their bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said hospitals typically invest in a balanced
mix of bonds, stocks and money market funds to limit fallout from
stock market swings.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there is cause for concern if hospitals depend too
much on investment income.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need growing patient revenue streams to adequately
compensate our employees and invest in new patient care
technologies,'' said Tom Cranshaw, senior vice president of
strategic planning for Health Midwest, Kansas City's largest
hospital system. The 15-facility system includes Research Medical
Center, Baptist Medical Center and Overland Park Regional Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Some local hospital officials say their financial situation has
improved in the last year or two because of cutbacks,
consolidations and, in at least one case, the removal of a hospital
from direct state control.
</P>
<P>
   Industry critics contend that hospitals are weighted down by
top-heavy administrations that drain valuable resources.
</P>
<P>
   But hospital officials here and around the country say they're
caught in a bind. Many of them are lobbying their elected
representatives and senators to reverse Medicare reimbursement cuts
tied to the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. If such relief does not come
through, they say they might have to cut services.
</P>
<P>
   One service that faces possible cuts is free care for indigent
persons. That worries Sheri Wood, executive director of the Kansas
City Free Health Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cause of concern for the community,'' Wood said.
``We've got a quarter of a million people in the Kansas City area
that are uninsured or underinsured.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial profiles of most area hospitals are outlined in
documents such as Form 990, which nonprofit hospitals are required
to file annually with the Internal Revenue Service. The most
recently filed Form 990s are from calendar year 1998 or fiscal year
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The results of for-profit hospitals can be obtained from
Medicare cost reports.
</P>
<P>
   According to its most recently filed Form 990, St. Luke's
Hospital and some affiliated operations had total revenues of $294
million during calendar year 1998. Total expenses were $284.5
million, and the hospital logged net income of $9.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But without investment income of $10.8 million, St. Luke's would
have lost $1.3 million at the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings blames the financial squeeze on the Balanced Budget
Act, which cut St. Luke's Medicare reimbursement by $9.6 million in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings' competitors have the same complaint. Cranshaw blames
the Balanced Budget Act for forcing Health Midwest to close Park
Lane Medical Center last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Balanced Budget Act reduced the patient revenue of Park
Lane for the same level of patient care activity in the range of $4
million between 1998 and 1999,'' Cranshaw said. ``Because of that,
it was impossible to reduce costs and maintain quality of care. The
hospital had run out of cash.''
</P>
<P>
   While they all provide health care, results can vary widely
among different hospitals. Location plays a role. For example, the
ill-fated Park Lane was in a low-growth area just north of Raytown.
</P>
<P>
   Research Medical Center, Health Midwest's biggest hospital,
earned net income of $15.9 million in 1998, including $8 million in
investment income.
</P>
<P>
   But Health Midwest's second-biggest hospital, Baptist Medical
Center, lost nearly a million dollars at the bottom line in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Research and Baptist are only 1.5 miles from each other. But
Cranshaw noted that Research performs more intensive, specialized
procedures, such as neurosurgery and open heart surgeries, that
generate more patient revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare cuts have eaten into the bottom line at St. Joseph
Health Center, said George Zara, president and chief executive
officer of Carondelet Health, which operates the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph is projected to have earned about $8 million in net
income during the fiscal year that ended June 30, with more than $7
million of that coming from investment income, Zara said. That's
down from the previous year, when St. Joseph posted $10.2 million
in net income, including $4.9 million in investment income.
</P>
<P>
   But things are improving at another Carondelet hospital, St.
Mary's Hospital of Blue Springs. Zara said St. Mary's is projected
to have earned about $1.5 million during the fiscal year that ended
June 30, up from $246,748 the previous year. The improvement was
mostly due to hefty increases in patient volume.
</P>
<P>
   Why the difference between the two hospitals? Zara said St.
Joseph has more Medicare patients than St. Mary's, and large
numbers of Medicare patients pose a financial liability in today's
hospital marketplace. (MORE)

METS DEFEAT BLUE JAYS, 7-5 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ If there had been a sarcasm detector strapped to
Manager Bobby Valentine as he answered questions before Monday
night's game, the machine would have been humming. Was there
anything really wrong with the New York Mets, or were they simply
playing well but losing close games? Is his team underachieving?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've underachieved, obviously,'' said Valentine. ``I
haven't gotten out of these guys what I could have. I think we
could have won a lot more games.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Valentine being serious, or just flip? One thing was
certain: the Mets were stumbling, having lost 9 of 12, and Monday
night's game against the Toronto Blue Jays and their rookie
starting pitcher was one they had to win.
</P>
<P>
   They finally prevailed, 7-5, when a fielder's choice grounder by
Mike Piazza and a single by Todd Zeile gave the Mets two runs in
the 11th inning. The Mets got six no-hit, shutout innings from
their bullpen, with John Franco (4-3) earning the victory and
Armando Benitez his 21st save.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Agbayani started the game-winning rally with a single off
losing pitcher Pedro Borbon (1-1), who walked the next two hitters
before Piazza and Zeile came up.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' bullpen overcame the erratic performance of the
veteran Rick Reed, who was returning from the disabled list against
Pasqual Coco, a 22-year-old who came up from Class AA to make his
major league debut. Neither starter was effective, but Coco
succeeded in keeping the Mets hitless with runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' first hit in that situation came in the eighth, off
John Frascatore. Lenny Harris, who had three hits, singled with two
outs, then stole second _ becoming the first Met this season to
steal two bases in the game. Derek Bell, who had been 1 for 21,
followed with a run-scoring single that tied the game, 5-5, and
ensured Reed of a no-decision.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was making his first start since June 29, when he broke his
left wrist and strained his left calf. Last season, injuries
unrelated to his pitching arm actually helped Reed pitch better
down the stretch, because he was rested.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are expecting the same effect this season, but they
will have to wait for it to happen. Reed was on a pitch count
Monday night _ he threw 101 pitches _ and the Mets had a 12-man
pitching staff on Monday night as protection against a short outing
by Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Reed lasted only five innings, giving up five runs (four earned)
on five hits and five walks. Reed's stuff looked good; he struck
out three, all swinging, and he got the last batter he faced to
ground to second after falling behind in the count, 2-0. But he
could not command his pitches with consistency, and though one of
the walks was intentional, the total of five matched a career high.
</P>
<P>
   Reed walked the first batter of the game, and by the end of the
inning the Mets trailed, 2-0. Joe McEwing quickly changed that.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the second, Todd Pratt drew a walk and McEwing,
a spry left fielder, came to bat. He suddenly sent a pitch
rocketing toward the upper reaches of the Skydome, and the ball
crashed into the netting well up the left field foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   That tied the score, 2-2, erasing a lead the Blue Jays had taken
in the first inning when Carlos Delgado belted his 30th home run,
leading the American League. With two outs, Delgado smoked a pitch
423 feet into the second deck, giving him four seasons in a row
with 30 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays regained the lead immediately when they batted in
the second. Reed fell behind Darrin Fletcher, 2-0, and Fletcher
drove the next pitch into the right field bullpen for a homer,
putting Toronto ahead, 3-2. Jose Cruz doubled off the wall in
left-center on the next pitch, but Reed retired the next three
hitters to escape more damage.
</P>
<P>
   Things worsened in the third. Reed walked Delgado and Brad
Fullmer with one out, and Tony Batista grounded to shortstop Melvin
Mora for a potential inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Mora did his part, but the normally sure-handed Edgardo Alfonzo
did not. An accurate relay throw would have easily beaten Batista
and ended the inning, but Alfonzo's throw bounced in the dirt and
got by Todd Zeile as Delgado scored to give the Blue Jays a 4-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Batista, on second base because of the error, was able to score
when Fletcher followed with a single up the middle. Jay Payton
might have had a chance to throw him out at the plate, but his
throw was several feet to the right of Pratt, the catcher.
</P>
<P>
   It was 5-2 Toronto, and Coco was somehow keeping the Mets from
mounting successful rallies. He had gotten Alfonzo and Mike Piazza
to ground out with a runner in scoring position to end in the first
inning. He had induced a pop-up from Derek Bell with a man on
second to end the second and gotten another pop-up from McEwing
with the bases loaded and two outs in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets got a run in the fourth, when Lenny Harris tripled and
scored on a wild pitch, but the Mets were 0 for 6 with runners in
scoring position off Coco.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza doubled off the top of the fence in left-center leading
off the fifth, and Coco was removed after he hit Zeile. Paul
Quantrill came in, and the Mets scored a run on a ground ball to
make it 5-4. But they managed no more hits in the inning and left
runners at second and third.

 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ``in today's hospital
marketplace.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Medicare cuts have been especially hard on academic medical
centers, which have suffered reductions in special payments
designed to subsidize the cost of training medical interns and
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Truman Medical Center, the primary teaching hospital for the
University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, lost $6.7
million during the year that ended April 30, 1999, after earning
$363,875 the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Medicare cuts caused by the Balanced Budget Act,
Truman chief financial officer Allen Johnson pointed a finger at
lower payments from Missouri's Medicaid managed care program.
Truman and other academic medical centers typically treat a large
volume of Medicaid patients and uninsured patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts us in a very big hole,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Kansas Medical Center, which also is an
academic medical center, has seen its financial fortunes improve in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   President and chief executive officer Irene Cumming said KU
Medical Center cut costs several years ago to meet the challenges
of tighter reimbursements. In addition, KU officials say the Kansas
City, Kan., medical center has enjoyed improved financial results
since it was removed from direct state control and placed under an
independent public hospital authority in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But times have been tough for Bethany Medical Center in Kansas
City, Kan. Bethany lost more than $9 million from December 1998
through May 1999, the first six months of operations under its
current owner, the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth Health System.
Its performance improved during the next 12 months, but it still
lost $13.6 million during the year that ended May 31 of this year,
said Jim Paquette, chief executive officer of the Sisters of
Charity's Kansas City region.
</P>
<P>
   Paquette said he expects further improvement this year and said
Sisters of Charity, which also operates St. John Hospital in
Leavenworth and Providence Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan., is
determined to keep Bethany open to serve its resident base in the
urban core of Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Luke's-Shawnee Mission Health System, which includes St.
Luke's Hospital, responded to the financial squeeze in September
1999 by laying off nearly 300 employees, the majority of whom did
not work directly in patient care. The cuts included social workers
and the hospital's Wanna Be Well child-care program for sick
children. Some programs within the system were consolidated at one
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings said the belt-tightening has contributed to a financial
turnaround at the health system, which expects to make an operating
profit of $6.4 million and a net profit of $7 million or $8 million
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Hastings worries about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress and the president don't come through with more
money, then there is only one other choice, and that's to reduce
the amount of free care we provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Many hospitals provide free care to indigent patients who lack
health insurance. Hastings said St. Luke's provided $29 million
worth of such care in 1999. Cranshaw said Health Midwest provided
tens of millions of dollars worth of free care last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a zero-sum game,'' Cranshaw said. ``As reimbursement
declines, there is the challenging need to sort through the
available funds for charity care and reinvestments into
state-of-the-art technology we need to continue our mission of
quality patient care.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Karen McCarthy of Kansas City said hospitals received
some relief from Medicare cuts under legislation passed in 1999,
and more such legislation is on the table.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy is a co-sponsor of the Hospital Preservation and Equity
Act of 2000. Now in the House Ways and Means Committee, the bill
would restore $6.7 billion in Medicare reimbursements to hospitals
in 2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must correct this inequity,'' McCarthy said. ``We are
seeing increased needs in health care, with patients in underserved
and unserved areas, because hospitals do not have the ability to
operate and subsidize the growing Medicare patient population. It
is critical that the unintended consequences of the 1997 (Balanced
Budget) Act be reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   Other co-sponsors include Rep. Pat Danner of Smithville, Rep.
Dennis Moore of Lenexa and Rep. Ike Skelton of Lexington, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   A similar proposal in the Senate, the Hospital Preservation Act,
is co-sponsored by Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri and Sens. Sam
Brownback and Pat Roberts, both of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The additional $7.7 billion that our new bill will provide
over five years is further action to protect and preserve
Medicare's ability to meet the needs of the American people,''
Ashcroft said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hospital officials watch and wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, we're going to have to reach a consensus on
what is a reasonable payment for the services we're providing,''
Zara said. ( 30 )
