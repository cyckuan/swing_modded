COURT CURMUDGEON BIDS A TYPCAL GOODBYE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is possible thatJustice Burton Roberts, the
departing chief administrative judge of state Supreme Court in the
Bronx, has learned from his friend Tom Wolfe, who modeled the
irascible judge in ``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' after him, that
it is always more effective to show than to tell. Thus, Roberts may
simply be trying to help out the reporter by displaying a flash of
his famous temper.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe he's just irritated.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you do, pull out a story that's 20 years old?''
Roberts is yelling, in a voice that has been described by one Bronx
courthouse regular as a couple of decibels below the roar of an
airplane engine, and that is when he is not angry. ``The Times is
true to form! God forbid you write a nice story about me as I go
bye-bye.''
</P>
<P>
   The story later. First, the words that no story about Burton
Roberts can be without: ``colorful,'' ``outspoken,'' ``legendary.''
Also, as the judge reminds you, when you mention this to him,
``feisty.''
</P>
<P>
   He has spent five decades in the judicial system, first as an
assistant district attorney under Frank Hogan in Manhattan, then as
the Bronx district attorney, then as top justice in the Bronx, and
one thing nobody ever accused him of was lack of nerve.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki took
a swipe at him for setting a bail they considered low, Roberts
dismissed their comments as ``the bleating of public officials who
possibly are seeking political advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Roberts has been fighting mandatory sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the mandatory minimums, you make the sentences too harsh,
and the defense will opt to go to trial and one can only try 6.5
percent of our cases now,'' Roberts says in what sounds like the
beginning of a speech, and, as it turns out after about 20 minutes,
is.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to interject questions fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me finish,'' the judge says.
</P>
<P>
   So, while he's holding forth, the story _ which he did not
dispute _ that earlier got him bothered: Some years ago, Roberts,
who often called up reporters and alerted, praised or berated them
regarding coverage, had a case about which he was particularly
proud and scheduled a news conference. The New York Daily News,
either because of excellent reporting (The News' version) or
failing to honor an embargo (the Roberts version), ran an article
the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the TV and newspapers that would normally show up at the
press conference showed up and Burt got very peeved,'' says Dick
Oliver, a reporter at WNYW-TV who was at the time the assistant
city editor at The News. ``At the press conference he railed on
about the `anti-Semitic Daily News, this rag downtown.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So the decision was made: For the next 90 days the words
`Burton Roberts' would not appear in The Daily News. It was
`according to the Bronx DA's office.' During the middle of this
thing, Roberts _ who I love _ he calls the reporter who, good
reporter that he was, taped the call and you can hear him pleading,
`Please give me a shot, it's too much,' so the decision was made to
commute his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also want to say he's the most straightforward judge and
person I've ever run into in 30 years in this business,'' Oliver
says.
</P>
<P>
   Another word frequently used about Roberts: ``caring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite his image as a tough guy, he's really compassionate,''
says the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer.
</P>
<P>
   Where that temper and that compassion come from is hard to say.
One clue may lie with Roberts' mother, who raised him in Washington
Heights after she and his father separated. If a student was
trouble, Roberts said, his mother would escort him to the library,
pick up a big book, give him ``a shot in the head'' and he ``would
be good as gold.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who saw action in World War II, got through law
school on the GI Bill. A signal moment came later, when a law firm
withdrew a job offer after it learned that Roberts was Jewish.
``That hurt me terribly,'' he says. He took a job in the district
attorney's office and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Another old story now, from a 37-year-old man who first met
Roberts on the wrong side of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came before Judge Roberts when I was 16,'' says the man, who
asked to maintain his privacy. ``From a very young age I started
getting involved in some bad stuff. Robbing restaurants, things of
that nature. Life seemed sort of hopeless. I never thought I'd see
21.''
</P>
<P>
   His first meeting with Roberts was, the man says, ``not a pretty
meeting _ as a matter of fact he threw me out of the courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Later on,'' the man says, ``he came to me and said, `You're
just a kid and you have a long life ahead of you; this doesn't have
to be the end.' He started writing me. We wrote each other from
Rikers.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man served two years as a youthful offender. Later, he
graduated from Pace University with honors. When he needed
references, the judge wrote them. Today the man earns $60,000 a
year as an energy analyst in the New York Mercantile Exchange. He
has lunch or dinner with Roberts, or with the judge and his wife,
every few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just seemed to care what happened to me,'' the man says.
``It wasn't like the usual assembly-line type of approach in
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Bye-bye, Justice Roberts.

IT'S INSTANT OFFENSE FOR WAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ If it was practice, Al Minahan would hit the
jump shot. No question about it.
</P>
<P>
   He's a shooter. It's his forte, which he developed at Inglemoor
High in Seattle. He's not a great defender, not a rebounder and not
a passing genius.
</P>
<P>
   Minahan's a shooter. Plain and simple.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was his success in practice never transferred to the
game, and because he's a defensive liability, it wasn't feasible to
give the Pepperdine sophomore many minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the opponent was NAIA Southern California College,
Minahan was so good, he's forced Waves coach Lorenzo Romar to
reconsider the playing time factor. Minahan hit six 3-pointers and
scored 24 points in 21 minutes as Pepperdine beat the Vanguards
94-64 Thursday at Firestone Fieldhouse to end a losing streak at
three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting for someone to break out and make baskets
for us,'' Romar said. ``He's earned more minutes. That's what you
do. You come in and show the coach why you should be getting more
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   How unlikely was Minahan's outburst? Consider he scored 18
points in six contests before the game. And Minahan scored 26
points his freshman year, and made six 3-pointers that season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised a little bit,'' said the 6-foot-3 Minahan.
``What I have to do is stay solid on defense. That's how I'll stay
in there. Usually, I'm in the right position, but on-ball pressure
is what I need to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense is rarely compensated for with offense. But given the
Waves' inability to score consistently, Minahan's shortcomings
might be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves (6-3) are atrocious from the perimeter, shooting a
hair above 30 percent for the season on 3-pointers. David
Lalazarian and Tommie Prince were supposed to supply that
ingredient of the offense, but Prince didn't play because of a sore
foot and Lalazarian is 5 of 28 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed a dreadful figure and one that signifies how wretched the
Waves have been. Just look back to the 1-for-13 performance on
3-pointers in the loss to Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Al can shoot it. He's a pure shooter,'' Pepperdine
point guard Jelani Gardner said. ``It's a little bit tougher when
you're coming off the bench getting limited shot attempts and
you're not in your rhythm every time you come in the game. But that
guy's a pure shooter, and every time he's on the court I'm looking
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Minahan's 6-of-8 shooting from 3-point range is a long-overdue
dividend from a few summers worth of work in his native Seattle.
During the average workout, Minahan would fire 400 to 500 shots,
mostly 3-pointers. He'd do it three times a week, mixing in a few
games of pick-up ball.
</P>
<P>
   Do the math and during Minahan's first season at Pepperdine, he
took 200 to 250 jumpers per summer workout week for every 3-pointer
he made with the Waves. The ratio wasn't quite that ugly this
season, but it wasn't sparkling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes my arm would get tired,'' Minahan said with a slight
smile. ``I never worried about it. I've been doing it since I was a
freshman in high school. It paid off in high school so I figured
eventually it had to start dropping here.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The details are blurry now, so many seasons, such tumultuous times
forced in between those heady days and the fifth anniversary that
slipped by.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was the narrow win at Phoenix, the two-point overtime
victory at Utah. The showdown/Finals preview at New York. There
have been too many games since for every night five years ago to
stand out over other memories. Instead, Hakeem Olajuwon remembers
the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' he said, ``easy to win.''
</P>
<P>
   If it didn't turn around the franchise, the Rockets'
season-opening 15-game winning streak five years ago showed it had
changed. The standard, the expectations had been elevated.
</P>
<P>
   Before the championships, before the uniforms were midnight
blue, the Rockets began the season winning their first 15 games,
lost at Atlanta and won seven more. And ever since that first month
of the season five years ago, they considered only a championship
good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what happened the year before, we were ready, focused,
determined not just as individuals but as a team,'' Olajuwon said.
``We picked it up where we left off. The communication was just
there. We were prepared. And after a while, we had something to
defend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won games three, four, five. `We have something going here.
Let's keep it here.' There was a concept. We didn't want to lose
it. It got to eight, nine, 10. We knew we had something to defend.
We had the drive. Everything was working. Everything kept building.
We had something to keep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourteen. 15. When you're playing as a team, you want to go
somewhere, to be a championship team. Everything comes easy because
no one is forcing the issue. Everybody is doing the right thing. We
were just playing, having fun on the court and off the court. It
flows. And it's easy to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' 15-game winning streak matched the longest run to
begin an NBA season, tying the Washington Capitols of 1948-49. For
the Rockets, it matched the best run in franchise history, set just
the season before.
</P>
<P>
   But the transformation of the Rockets did not begin with the
15-0 start to the 1993-94 season. That is when the change became
public, obvious. The Rockets changed the season before when events
transformed the team into champions-in-waiting, and the franchise
into one that would accept nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   The previous season, Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich's first full
season as head coach, the Rockets had a seven-game losing streak
that forced examination of their style of play and tested their
faith in their system.
</P>
<P>
   They finished the regular season with a 41-11 run that raised
expectations. But they lost the Western Conference semifinals in
Game 7 in overtime in Seattle, leaving them hungry for more and
determined not to enter another crucial series without the
home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team, that summer we grew,'' former Rockets forward Otis
Thorpe said. ``Everybody had a year under their belt with Rudy.
That maturity came to the team. We finished up the second half of
the season better than anybody in the league, and over the summer
we had a chance to think about what we could accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   To Tomjanovich, victory was built upon defeat. In that
seven-game losing streak, the Rockets lost to some of the dregs of
the NBA: Golden State (twice) and Denver. And Tomjanovich, anxious
to install his philosophies, called meetings that changed his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (losing streak) was the turning point of that team,''
Tomjanovich said. ``We went through that seven-game losing streak,
and it was to all sorts of teams. We were getting our butts beat
all over the place. We had gotten into a mindset we could just take
the floor. We had confidence in our offense, but we weren't
concentrating on our defense. People were scoring 130 points on us.
We had three or four team meetings. We would have tape sessions. I
would say, `We have to become a team, and a defensive team.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We said the right things but went out and got beat again. We
got pushed into a corner and came back home to play some tough
teams and played Utah and had a great defensive game there, and we
just built on that. The rest of that season, we went 41-11. Then,
you add 15 in a row and 22-1 (to start the next season). That's
where the foundation of the Rockets was built, how we win. They
understood defense had to be a very big part of how we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 1992-93 regular season ended with an overtime loss at
San Antonio in which the game-winning basket was shot just after
the buzzer. The Rockets believed they lost the home-court advantage
on a bad call and that they had lost to Seattle because they didn't
have the home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had won their three home games in the series by an
average of 14 points and had two late shots at the victory in Game
7. Combined with the strong finish to the season, the Rockets used
the early finish to drive them through the summer and preseason
practices to the rapid start to the 1993-94 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see the disappointment like Game 7, when we lost the
series in Seattle after we won three games pretty handily, we
thought if we got home-court advantage, it would have been
different,'' said Rockets vice president Carroll Dawson, then an
assistant coach. ``That was a motivation. We felt not having
home-court advantage cost us, and we didn't want it to happen
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we could have gone (to the NBA Finals) the year before.
The confidence started to rise. Everybody saw the potential. The
system was wholeheartedly endorsed by the players. Our talent level
was good, but more importantly the chemistry was really good.''
</P>
<P>
   The streak began innocently enough, against non-contenders New
Jersey, Portland, Golden State and Minnesota. The Rockets beat
Charles Barkley and the Phoenix Suns 99-95 in the fifth game before
a home sellout, then a rarity (only one of the other five home
games in the streak was sold out).
</P>
<P>
   A three-game road trip to Philadelphia, New Jersey and Indiana
pushed the steak to eight, the Rockets overcoming a 12-point
fourth-quarter deficit to beat the 76ers. The Rockets whipped the
Clippers at home in the fourth game in six nights. They beat the
Bulls, the three-time defending NBA champions who were without
Michael Jordan at the start of his baseball sabbatical, 100-93.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest test was expected to be at Utah, in the second game
of a back-to-back. The Rockets won 95-93 in overtime, Olajuwon
getting 29 points and 17 rebounds. With the streak at 11, the
Rockets remained on the road to beat the Kings and Clippers, nearly
letting the streak end on the fourth game in five nights, an 82-80
win in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   They ended the month with an impressive 102-91 win at home
against the Bucks, only the second time in 20 years any NBA team
had an unbeaten month. Olajuwon was named Player of the Month as a
matter of course, having averaged 25.4 points, 13.5 rebounds, 4.1
blocked shots and 3.3 assists.
</P>
<P>
   But the team was more balanced than it had been in previous
years. Vernon Maxwell had averaged 14.6 points and a team-leading
4.9 assists. Thorpe averaged 14 points, making 61.1 percent of his
shots, and 9.9 rebounds. Robert Horry averaged 10.4 points.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Sam Cassell started four games when Kenny Smith was hurt,
averaging 11 points in the starts. Mario Elie, in his first season
with the Rockets, and Scott Brooks combined to average 16.1 points
off the bench. And the Rockets played the sort of defense
Tomjanovich had called for in all those tape sessions the year
before: No opponent reached 100 points or shot 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the Rockets 14-0, the Knicks were considered the
heirs apparent to the Bulls. Knicks forward Anthony Mason predicted
the end of the streak and referred to it in the past tense. Knicks
fans in Madison Square Garden chanted, ``14-1, 14-1.'' The Rockets
responded with one of their best games of the season, leading by 10
at halftime and by 19 going into the fourth quarter of a 94-85
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 15-game winning streak changed the way people looked at
us, in Houston and around the league,'' Dawson said. ``And our
confidence decidedly went up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the streak, nine wins had come on the road, three in the
second game of back-to-backs. The Rockets had traveled to both
coasts twice. And though the travel was grueling, it was in many
ways a key to building the team that would win its first NBA
championship six months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a home game, you win and your team goes home,''
Tomjanovich said. ``On the road, you're out there together. You're
on the plane going to the next city or you're on the road and you
probably go out with a couple of team members. That brings you
close together.''
</P>
<P>
   The next night, the team had too much togetherness. The flight
to Atlanta was delayed and did not arrive until 3:30 a.m. The team
did not get to sleep until dawn and sleepwalked through a 133-111
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But the streak proved not to be a fluke. The Rockets won seven
consecutive games before losing again. And though they eventually
would slump, briefly even losing their Midwest Division lead, they
had been changed.

MTN. VIEW'S LATIMORE BEGINS ANEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, ARIZ. - Etched on Dennis Latimore's right shoulder is
``Kansas,'' a tattoo he obtained soon after leaving Halstead late
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a reminder of where I'm from,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, home is Mesa, where the 16-year-old lives with his father
and plays basketball like no other sophomore in Arizona _ or most
of the land, for that matter _ for top-ranked Mountain View High.
</P>
<P>
   He looks and plays older than his years. He is 6-foot-8{, 235
pounds. He has soft hands and an aggressive nature around the
backboard, which he once shattered in eighth grade with a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, he must focus on something bigger than just a game.
He is trying to develop a relationship with a man who has been only
an occasional visitor since he was 2.
</P>
<P>
   As he tries to adjust to a bigger universe than the one he left,
Latimore learns more each day about his father, Denver, who this
summer was awarded custody of Dennis from a Kansas court.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Dennis said, the judge left him to decide for himself
which parent to live with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to let go, but I knew it was my decision,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He left behind an older brother, many friends, a new coach at
Halstead High who was counting on him, and, more important, a
mother he loves dearly.
</P>
<P>
   He says he talks to his mother, Melinda, on the phone every
Sunday, and they communicate regularly via e-mail. She tries to
keep up with her son's basketball on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't the same. She was supposed to have him during
Thanksgiving, but Mountain View was playing in its tournament. It
was the first Thanksgiving they ever spent apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports is just a small part of life,'' said his mother, who
teaches special education at a high school in Wichita. ``We don't
have Thanksgiving tournaments. We don't have tournaments up to New
Year's Eve. Where is the family? That part was very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Divorce and custody battles are rarely easy. The children often
are victims.
</P>
<P>
   Denver Latimore Sr., who divorced his wife before Dennis was 2,
said he tried for years to gain custody of his two sons. Denver Jr.
recently joined his father and brother in Mesa after playing out
his senior football season at Halstead.
</P>
<P>
   Denver Sr., who teaches at Mesa Community College, said he moved
to Mesa in 1989 for a better career opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I regret when I left there, I didn't get a
chance to see them on a regular basis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to make up for lost time. This summer, Dennis said
he wanted to know more about his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want what is important for me and him. I want him to be
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The door is left open. Dennis says there is no pressure, that he
can go back to his mom any time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Melinda worries that the Valley might be too big for
her son, that he could fall prey to temptations that aren't found
in Halstead, a small, close-knit community 35 miles outside
Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   When Dennis returns to Halstead for Christmas, Melinda will see
a son who grew half an inch since he left and the tattoo that he
didn't tell her about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids don't get tattoos here,'' she said. ``If you do, you have
to cover it up during games.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis, who averages 13.8 points and nine rebounds for the Toros
(8-2), who play in the Reebok Holiday Classic in Las Vegas starting
today, said the move hasn't changed him. He still gets up the
moment the alarm clock rings. He doesn't need a workout partner to
push him in the weight room or on the court.
</P>
<P>
   After a late workout, he studies in the Mountain View locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little more challenging out here, academically,'' said
Dennis, who left Halstead with a 4.0 grade-point average. ``It's a
good school.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said he's not sure if he'll finish his high school career
in Mesa. He says he worries about his mother now that his older
brother left. He said he wants to make sure somebody is there to
take care of her.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain View Coach Gary Ernst is happy to have Latimore but
realizes it may be temporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock to see him,'' Ernst said. ``All of a sudden he
just showed up in the gymnasium. He seems very well adjusted after
all he went through this summer. As good a player as he is, what
impresses me is the quality of the young man he is.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year his mother has missed one of Dennis'
games.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers how he first dunked in the sixth grade, how he
came home one day that year with a broken wrist for dunking the
basketball so hard. One of the first things she captured on a new
camcorder was Dennis shattering the backboard glass during a game
in eighth grade.

LATEST NBA OFFER GOES POSTAL  
 MAILED LETTER DIVISIVE, SCHAYES SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB Young  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his latest effort to take his case directly to players, NBA
Commissioner David Stern Thursday sent them an outline of the
latest labor proposal from owners.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also was distributed to media outlets, including
``The Arizona'' ``Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Stern tells players it is ``important that there
be no doubt about the precise terms you consider to be such a `bad
deal' that you would prefer to lose the entire season.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, 45 days of the regular season and about $480 million in
player salaries have been lost to the lockout, and the earliest a
shortened season could begin is probably late January.
</P>
<P>
   All in a battle over how to split $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as another attempt to divide the players,'' said
Danny Schayes, a member of the players' negotiating team. ``It
seems like they're waving it in the players' faces, `Look how hard
we're trying. Contact your union representative.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to think the players are not informed, and they
certainly are informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern's letter outlines what the league perceives as concessions
that owners have made since the lockout began July 1, including
agreeing to keep the so-called Larry Bird exception to the league's
salary cap, backing off a ``hard'' salary cap, modifying their
position on ``timing rules,'' which would affect how the Bird
exception could be applied, and limiting an ``escrow'' system and
``luxury tax'' on players if the percentage of revenues that go to
salaries exceed a predetermined limit.
</P>
<P>
   The league also provided players several charts that illustrate
that the average salary of an NBA player is higher than athletes in
the NFL, NHL and Major League Baseball, another that plots a
projected increase in that average salary to $4.569 million by
2003-04 and a third that shows the maximum salaries players may
receive under the Bird exception over the life of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Kleine _ a former officer in the Players Association who
lives in the Valley _ said the letter fails to address one of the
major issues in the negotiations. It details at what percentage of
revenue an escrow tax would be implemented starting in 2001-02, but
it does not stipulate what percentage of salaries may be placed in
escrow. Nor does it say what tax would be imposed upon teams that
exceed the percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are big issues,'' he said. ``The amount of the tax and
how it will be paid go a long way in determining how hard of a cap
it is. Those are pretty huge links in the chain.''
</P>
<P>
   An NBA spokesman said that neither Stern nor deputy commissioner
Russ Granik would be available to comment on the letter.
</P>
<P>
   According to the league, the latest proposal would mean that
average player salaries will grow to $4.5 million by the end of the
deal, 10-year veteran players would be guaranteed a minimum salary
of $1 million, and superstars still could get contracts valued at
more than $100 million for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of big pieces of the puzzle left out,''
Schayes said. ``Unfortunately, in this sound-bite world we live in,
people don't get the details. You have to look at the details to
make heads or tails of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Schayes said a lot of veteran players will be
hurt, not helped, by a new minimum-salary scale and that owners are
claiming to be making concessions and compromises on items they
don't have.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's letter, he points out, says the owners have backed off
one proposal for splitting up group licensing money and instead
will accept the elimination of a guaranteed percentage of that
money for players.
</P>
<P>
   ``That agreement isn't up for another five years,'' Schayes
said. ``They're acting like they're giving something up when they
don't even have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kleine found the outline to be incomplete, he's still
optimistic that a deal can be reached before the season is lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we can tweak it just a little, we might have a
deal,'' he said. ``The biggest thing is still the percentage of
(basketball-related income applied to salaries).
</P>
<P>
   ``If both sides would just agree to meet halfway on that, say
54.5 percent or 55 percent, whatever it is, I think we would have a
deal pretty quickly. But the escrow makes me nervous. They seem to
want to gloss over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Stern allowed team owners to communicate directly
with players to inform them about the owner's proposals at that
point, and Kleine said the escrow issues were similarly ignored in
those conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Kleine said the current proposal would be good enough for him,
but players have to consider more than their own interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, what they've proposed is fine,'' he said. ``I'm at the
end of my career. But if you look at the young guys coming into the
league and the up-and-coming players, they would be hurt.'' &QL;

PLAYING WITH PAIN: SUCCESS, SUFFERING COIN CIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty-three years later, Cardinals Hall of Famer Larry Wilson
remains the NFL's poster boy for playing hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who intercepted a pass in a 1965 game against Pittsburgh
despite having two broken hands, doesn't think he was tougher than
modern players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just in those days, if you could run, you played,'' said
Wilson, now a Cardinals vice president. ``The rest didn't make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals middle linebacker Ronald McKinnon can relate. He was
so furious when he suffered a sprained knee last month at Kansas
City, he grabbed teammate Mark Maddox's knee brace and placed it on
his injured right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronnie yelled, `Get it (the knee pad) off him (Maddox),' ''
defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis said. ``He was told he couldn't
go back in. He said, `No, I can play. I can play.' I've never seen
anybody do that.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon eventually left the game and has been out the past two
weeks. He is expected to return Sunday against New Orleans at Sun
Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``McKinnon's college coach, Bobby Wallace, told me, `I never
could keep (McKinnon) out of practice,' '' McGinnis said. ``He said
they won a lot of games because he wouldn't come out.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon isn't the only Cardinals defender with a high pain
threshold. Outside linebacker Jamir Miller has played the past 11
games with a dislocated wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pain is relative to the person,'' Miller said. ``Some people's
threshold is a lot higher than others'. I think as athletes, we can
deal with pain more than average people. I just felt that if I
could go, I'd go. It hurt bad for a while, but it wasn't hindering
me to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of defensive tackle Eric Swann having
season-ending ``elective'' knee surgery last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people forget he tried to play hurt,'' a Cardinals
official said. ``His knees were sore, and he kept trying to play on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals physician Wayne Kuhl said that it's easier to play
with injuries at some positions than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The likelihood of a running back who has a fractured hand
benefiting a team is much less than a defensive lineman with a
fractured hand,'' Kuhl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football players, as a whole, are mentally very tolerant of
pain. Still, it's such an individual thing, and as a physician, you
have to have the acceptance and belief of what the player is
telling you.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuhl said Cardinals offensive tackle Lomas Brown has the highest
threshold of pain he has seen.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Brown played at Baltimore despite a kidney stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a stent running from his kidney through the bladder to
the outside,'' Kuhl said. ``It was removed subsequently, without
anesthesia, and he played. It was amazing.'' &QL; 
A different era &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a 14-year pro, said the honor is one he'd rather not have
earned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, more than anything, it was the era I was brought
in,'' Brown said. ``In the mid-1980s, there was no scout team. You
did all the offensive plays in practice. The game was built on
toughness.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Vice President Bob Ferguson said the toughest guy he
has been around is Denver offensive lineman Mark Schlereth, who has
had 22 surgeries, including 17 knee operations.
</P>
<P>
   When Schlereth was with the Washington Redskins, he would often
wake up in the middle of the night, screaming in pain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when Ferguson was with the Broncos, Schlereth passed a
kidney stone in the morning and played that night against the
Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he suffered torn knee cartilage at training camp
but continued to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only sissies need all their cartilage to play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said former Buffalo Bills offensive lineman Jim Ritcher
once played with a broken neck. ``We didn't know it was broken,''
Ferguson said. ``MRIs (magnetic resonance imagings) weren't
available in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddox, who formerly played with the Bills, said linebacker
Darryl Talley had such a bad back late in his career, he couldn't
sleep on a bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He slept on the wooden floor, a hardwood floor,'' Maddox said.
``Come Sunday, he was ready to go.'' &QL; 
The Bradshaw course &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals defensive-line coach Joe Greene, a Hall of Fame tackle
with the Pittsburgh Steelers, remembered that Cleveland's Turkey
Jones spiked Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw on a sack in 1976.
Bradshaw suffered a bruised collarbone, an injury that was supposed
to keep him out for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw came back and played the next week, prompting a team
doctor to say, ``I'm going to have to go back to college and do the
course `Bradshaw.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Bradshaw played with a cast on his left arm. In another
game, he was carried off the field on a stretcher at halftime and
returned in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he went down, we thought he was down for the count,''
Greene said. ``He flopped like a chicken. But he was there when we
needed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals center Mike Devlin said his roommate when he was on
the Bills, offensive lineman John Davis, was in such pain when he
played that ``both knees and shoulders were bone to bone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He would get shot up, pilled up'' to kill the pain, Devlin
said. ``He would be down every play. You'd say, `He's not getting
up.' He'd be back up. Then you'd say, `He's not getting up this
time.' He'd get back up and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said former Lions defensive back Duane Galloway once had a
tooth knocked out and stayed in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He picked the tooth off the ground and put it in and played
the rest of the game,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying guys these days are not as mentally tough, but
it's different. You were expected to play with pain and injuries,
even in practice.'' &QL; 
Wadsworth a throwback &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals rookie defensive end Andre Wadsworth, the team's $42
million first-round draft choice, must be a throwback. He stayed in
the game against the New York Giants on Dec. 6 despite a calf
injury that prevented him from running.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends what's on the line,'' Wadsworth said. ``There's a
lot of stuff right now on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson smiled when he heard Wadsworth's remarks. Then he
explained how he broke the finger on his left hand against the New
York Giants in 1965 when he was trying to make a tackle. Doctors
taped it up, and he stayed in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know it was broke,'' he said. &QL; 
Look ma, broken hands &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Later in the game, he was lying on the ground when a Giants
player stepped on his right hand, breaking it. Again, trainers did
a taping job.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors placed a cast on his left hand the next day. They wanted
to put a cast on his right one, but Wilson convinced them to put a
``portable'' one on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I've got to go to the bathroom and do other things,'
'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   He intercepted Pittsburgh quarterback Bill Nelsen the next week
and returned the ball 34 yards despite the two broken hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``People played with a lot more pain during my era,'' Wilson
said. ``The money has gotten such that people think of their
careers every time they have pain and think that injuries will
shorten it. But that's not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``In football, you have to play with pain. If you don't have
some, you haven't played the game.'' &QL;

`MR. BEIGE' BREATHES LIFE INTO CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Ask him whether he feels certain the Cardinals are
going to win Sunday, and this would be his reaction:
</P>
<P>
   First, he would squint, his blue Irish eyes narrowing into
slits. Then he would turn his head slightly to one side while his
lips formed the first words of a guarded reply which predictably,
invariably began, ``Oh, I . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know if I would use the word ``certain'' . . .''
</P>
<P>
   He never lets others put words into his mouth. He won't be
baited. Or steered with questions down a road he doesn't want to
go.
</P>
<P>
   He is thoughtful, careful, diplomatic. He reveals only as much
of himself as he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had beaten the Eagles. After the group interview,
after TV cameras left and writers on deadline rushed off to file
their stories, I asked him how he planned to unwind after what may
have been the most important win in his three seasons here.
</P>
<P>
   A glass of wine perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   Vince Tobin gave a half-pained expression. Then he said, not
unkindly, ``Oh, I don't really want to get into that . . .''
</P>
<P>
   There I stood, pressing this man labeled by some as Mr. Beige,
for some personal tidbit I could put in the newspaper. Vince
glanced at my open notebook. A corner of his mouth turned up in a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have a tomato juice.'' &QL; 
What he's not &QL; 
Since he took over the mess Buddy Ryan left, Vince Tobin has been
defined by who and what he isn't.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't colorful. Or very quotable.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't a ``personality'' who fills up a room, like Mike Ditka.
Tobin has talked at length this week about the Saints' coach, a
longtime friend. You can hear the admiration and affection in his
voice when he describes Ditka's quick wit and snappy one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Ever wish you were more glib, Vince?
</P>
<P>
   Tobin paused, as if caught off guard by the question. He gave
that little smile, almost sheepish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, not really . . .''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't a self-promoter. He doesn't have a TV show. Or a radio
show. (His predecessor once told a caller who had criticized him on
the air, ``There's a lotta good jobs in the NFL. Why don't you go
git yourself one?''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin is too much a gentleman to rip into a fan. He won't permit
himself to react to media criticism, the second-guessing, and he
has drawn his share.
</P>
<P>
   He's not rah-rah. He won't wrap his arms around a player in a
fierce hug. Nor will he berate a player in public view.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't run off the field after a win, pumping his fist in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Tobin what he likes most about his job. ``It's the
thrill of victory,'' he says. That moment after the gun sounds when
he removes his headset and looks at the scoreboard. ``That's what
makes it all worthwhile.'' He may not show his joy to our
satisfaction, but he feels it more intensely than we know.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Tobin is who he is.
</P>
<P>
   The fire's inside &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He is the first person at the office the morning after a game.
Unable to sleep, he usually shows up on Mondays by 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   He is an organizer. A sound football coach with an attention to
detail.
</P>
<P>
   He is predictable in the best sense of the word. Players know
the man they deal with today is the man they will see tomorrow. He
is even-keeled. With Tobin, there are no surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Deep within, a fire is burning brightly. ``With Vince, it
doesn't matter if you're playing cards, pool or golf,'' one
assistant coach said. ``He wants to beat you. He's like one of
those snapping turtles that bite you. You've got to cut his head
off to get him to let go.''
</P>
<P>
   We don't see that Irish temper. But the coaches do. The players
do. He can't stand mental mistakes. He will not tolerate lack of
effort.
</P>
<P>
   All Tobin has done is slowly, quietly put together an
oh-I-don't-know-if-I'd use-the-word exceptional team. The Cardinals
are far from that.
</P>
<P>
   But they are improving. They are headed in the right direction.
They have a chance to make the playoffs. For that, the man with the
whistle deserves some credit. &QL;

D-BACKS PURSUING TRADE FOR VAUGHN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - While signing 10 minor league free agents on
Wednesday, the Diamondbacks continued to talk with the San Diego
Padres about a trade for slugger Greg Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr. confirmed the discussions but
shot down a rumored trade broadcast by a Valley radio station.
According to the report, the club was close to landing Vaughn, a
left fielder who hit 50 home runs last season, in exchange for
pitcher Brian Anderson, outfielder Bernard Gilkey and a player to
be named.
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola acknowledged talking about Vaughn with San Diego
General Manager Kevin Towers but said the report was way off. He
said two of the components of the proposed trade, Gilkey and the
player to be named, were erroneous. He added that talks with Towers
will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola also is talking with Pittsburgh, but he ruled out
obtaining outfielder Jose Guillen, who previously had been
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Guillen thing is shut down,'' Garagiola said.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks and the Cincinnati Reds have discussed
outfielder Reggie Sanders, but the Reds' asking price is believed
to be too high.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming names, Garagiola said he might be interested in
obtaining an outfielder and possibly a middle reliever. He said he
is willing to wait until spring training if the right deal doesn't
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the club signed former major leaguers Pete Incaviglia
and Ernie Young to minor league contracts, along with eight others.
</P>
<P>
   Incaviglia, a 34-year-old outfielder, has hit 206 home runs in
11 major league seasons with Texas, Detroit (twice), Houston
(twice), Philadelphia, Baltimore and the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   He played in seven games with Detroit and 13 games with Houston
in 1998, going a combined 3 for 30. He also played for Triple-A New
Orleans, batting .324 in 76 games.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 29, hit .189 for Kansas City in 25 games last season.
After hitting .242 with 19 homers for Oakland in 1996, he was the
A's opening day starter in center field the next season. But he hit
.223 for the A's and spent part of year at Triple-A Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Also signed were two former Firebirds, pitcher Dan Carlson and
first baseman Desi Wilson. Carlson appeared in 10 games for the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays last season. Wilson, who saw action in 41
games with San Francisco in 1997, played in Japan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Other free agents include infielder Scott Coolbaugh (Texas, San
Diego, St. Louis), catcher Izzy Molina (Oakland), pitcher Matt
Ruebel (Pittsburgh, Tampa Bay), pitchers George Glinatsis and Al
Kermode and catcher Marcus Hanel. &QL;

RETURN A FLOP FOR CUMMINS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Jim Cummins' anticipated return to the Coyotes'
lineup went about as well as waiting all day for your holiday
turkey dinner and then watching it fall off the stove and get
devoured by the family dog.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mess. And it almost made you want to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody feels as bad as Jimmy, I'm sure,'' Coyotes Coach Jim
Schoenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out 13 straight games as a healthy scratch,
Cummins' lasted only four shifts in his first game back, getting
thrown out of Wednesday's game in Toronto for not having his jersey
tied down during a fight with the Maple Leafs' Tie Domi.
</P>
<P>
   Cummins, who was back in the lineup Thursday when the Coyotes
met the St. Louis Blues, cursed his misfortune, although he was
pretty sure he had his sweater fastened to the back of his pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty disappointed I got thrown out,'' Cummins said.
``What can you do? Things are going to happen. That's sports.
Sometimes, things are going to go your way. Sometimes they're not.
It's how you deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cummins, who had declined to discuss his situation publicly in
recent days, dealt with being out of the lineup as well as could be
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough. I've never sat out this many games in a row,''
he said. He wasn't crazy about getting into a fight with Domi so
early.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me on the first couple shifts, `Cmon, let's go,' ''
Cummins said. ``I said, `Not right now, Tie. I want to get some ice
time first. I want to play some freakin' hockey first.' Oh,
well.'' &QL; 
Waite 'til next year &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Backup goalie Jimmy Waite, who made his ninth start on Thursday
in his 100th NHL game, will be a Group V unrestricted free agent
after the season and likely will draw offers from other clubs if he
continues to play as well as he has.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the possibility of him getting picked up by the
Atlanta Thrashers in the expansion draft in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens, there's a chance I could be a No. 1 goalie,''
said Waite, who was unbeaten at 6-0-2 before Thursday's 3-2 loss.
``If not, I wouldn't want to go anyplace else. If I can't be a No.
1 somewhere, I'd rather stay in Phoenix.'' &QL; 
Schoenfeld an All-Star? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the Coyotes win three of their next five games, Schoenfeld
should be a lock to be one of the two head coaches at next month's
All-Star Game in Tampa Bay. The coach whose team has the best
winning percentage in each conference on the morning of Dec. 29
gets the honor. The runner-up in each conference will serve as an
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Schoenfeld should probably pack his bags and get
ready for a trip to the Sunshine State. &QL;

PSYCHICS WON'T PREDICT OUTCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - If you think the Cardinals showdown with the New
Orleans Saints is being met with raging apathy by the ticket buying
public, which had purchased just 41,126 as of 2 p.m. Thursday, it's
nothing compared with the reaction of Valley psychics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republic'' searched Wednesday to find a Valley psychic
willing to forecast the outcome of Sunday's game and the Cardinals'
playoff chances.
</P>
<P>
   Even those claiming a 98 percent accuracy rate refused, one
saying, ``I'm not interested. I don't waste my time on trivial
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Valley of ``elitist'' psychics. Calls to several
psychics listed in the telephone book were greeted by, ``The number
you are dialing is no longer in service, or has been
disconnected.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes perfect sense. Why does a truly good psychic need a
phone, anyway? &QL; 
McKinnon improved &QL; 
Middle linebacker  &UR; Ronald McKinnon is on the cusp of providing the
Cardinals with their first good injury news in a month. McKinnon
practiced for the second consecutive day with the aid of a brace on
his sprained right knee.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook isn't so good for defensive tackle  &UR; Mark Smith and
cornerback
 &UR; Tommy Knight. Smith's sprained ankle kept him out of Thursday's
practice. Knight practiced, but Coach &UR; Vince Tobin is leery of
allowing him to play on an injured hamstring connector and adding
to the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's iffier for Smith, but McKinnon practiced a bit and looks
like he's moving all right,'' Tobin said. ``He's not 100 percent,
and we'll have to see where he is closer to game day.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon said he hopes to play. ``It feels pretty good right
now,'' he said. ``I have to get used to this brace, so I'll have to
see at the end of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon's replacement,  &UR; Mark
 &UR; Maddox, took some criticism and was pulled in the second half of
last week's victory over the Eagles. Guess what? After reviewing
his performance (10 tackles on 25 plays, including a touchdown
saving stop at the goal line), coaches apparently apologized to him
during Monday's team meeting. &QL; 
Mind games?
</P>
<P>
   Saints Coach  &UR; Mike Ditka was quoted as saying this about &UR; Jake
Plummer: ``If I didn't know better, I'd think it was the young  &UR; Joe
Montana. I mean it. He looks like Joe, and he throws like Joe. And
he moves around. He's just going to get better and better as time
goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer was asked if he thinks Ditka has lost his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean has he recently lost his mind?'' Plummer asked,
smiling. ``He's a great coach, and he's been around a lot of great
players. Last year, he came up to me, hit me on the chest, and
said, `Stand in there. You're going to be a great quarterback.'
That's an honor coming from a guy who has coached so long.' '' &QL; 
Hands full &QL; 
Offensive left tackle  &UR; Lomas Brown expects a big challenge Sunday
from Saints defensive end  &UR; Joe Johnson, who has seven sacks and 49
unassisted tackles on the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough deal,'' Brown said. ``He's a Pro
Bowler who has been playing great. He was tough last year when we
played. He has the size and strength to be a defensive tackle, and
the quickness to play end. That's what makes him so tough on the
inside or on the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Tackle  &UR; La'Roi Glover, who profits from the constant double-team
attention given tackle  &UR; Wayne Martin, leads the Saints with 10
sacks. &QL; 
3rd time's a charm &QL; 
Tailback  &UR; Adrian Murrell needs 48 yards Sunday to become only the
eighth active running back to gain 1,000 yards in three consecutive
seasons or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's meaningful in that you've been somewhat
productive for a couple years,'' Murrell said. ``I guess 1,000
yards is a bench mark for running backs. Most running backs look
for more and beyond, but I'm satisfied with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1,000-yard mark has diminished somewhat with a 16-game
schedule, but it really will be only a 14-game season for me.'' &QL;

 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Less than a week ago, Los Angeles Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone signed Kevin Brown to the most lucrative
contract in baseball history _ a seven-year, $105 million
earth-shaker.
</P>
<P>
   But while baseball executives and players are trying to figure
out what it will mean to the game's financial structure in years to
come, Malone is moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have six legitimate starting pitchers _ Brown, Chan
Ho Park, Carlos Perez, Darren Dreifort, Ismael Valdes and Dave
Mlicki. They have a formidable lineup with Eric Young, Devon White,
Gary Sheffield, Eric Karros, Todd Hundley and Raul Mondesi. But
they do need help in certain areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing now is fine-tuning,'' Malone said from his
Dodger Stadium office Thursday afternoon. ``We're trying to upgrade
the bench and the bullpen. It's what we've really been working on
all along.''
</P>
<P>
   With a surplus of starters, the Dodgers can use one _ probably
Mlicki _ in a trade to fill a need. There have been reports that a
trade with the Giants is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams have expressed interest in Mlicki,'' Malone said. ``I
can't be specific about the Giants.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed relief is a priority, and among the free agents
available are Mike Munoz and Norm Charlton.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the bench is concerned, the Dodgers are close to
coming to terms with infielder Dave Hansen.

COYOTES SUCCUMB TO FATIGUE  
 DEMITRA'S GOAL ENDS BLUES' 6-GAME SLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ They had no Keith Tkachuk, who is still nursing a
sore groin. They had no Shane Doan, who flew back to Phoenix to be
with his wife, who's nursing a baby boy born earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, the Coyotes simply had no gas left in the
tank.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way Coach Jim Schoenfeld saw it after his team ended
a four-game trip with a 3-2 loss Thursday night to the St. Louis
Blues at the Kiel Center. It came on the heels of a win in Ottawa,
a tie in Montreal, and a 5-2 blowout loss Wednesday at Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, I was thrilled with the effort because you
had to be on the bench to know how hard everybody tried,'' said
Schoenfeld, whose red-hot club finally cooled down, losing two in a
row for the first time all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just no fuel in the tank. We're a tired group right
now. It'll be good to get home and get a couple of days to regroup.
We didn't have a good performance in Toronto, and maybe that was
where fatigue was starting to set in. I'm not trying to make
excuses for our guys, but you get to know your players well enough,
and you get to know when they're giving it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavol Demitra won it for the Blues, scoring the only goal in the
third period when he beat Jimmy Waite from the slot with 3:21
minutes to play. Rookie Lubos Bartecko, playing in his third NHL
game, was in and out of the crease during the play, but a review
upstairs showed the goal was legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Demitra, whose 15 goals lead the Blues, has had four similar
goals called back this season due to crease violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I got so happy. I got so nervous,'' Demitra said. ``They
never give me goals like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld wasn't sure it should count until he watched
videotape of the goal in his office after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bartecko) just got his skate out and went back in for the
rebound, which is a legal goal,'' Schoenfeld said. ``It was pretty
close. But that's why you have the video goal judge, and they made
the right call.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes (17-5-4) got goals from Teppo Numminen, his sixth,
and Rick Tocchet, whose 10th gave Phoenix a 2-1 lead at the 5:37
mark of the second period, but they never really put a ton of
pressure on Blues goalie Grant Fuhr. The veteran faced just 22
shots, only six in the final period, when Phoenix truly seemed to
have lost its legs.
</P>
<P>
   But that was nothing. Fatigue, after playing eight of their past
nine games on the road, is understandable. Losing your legs is one
thing. Center Jeremy Roenick, though, nearly lost his head at the
neck.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes star was the victim of what he freely referred to
later as a vicious cheap shot from Blues defenseman Chris Pronger.
Thirty-four seconds into the second period, the 6-foot-6 Pronger
wielded a two-handed slash that slammed across the side of
Roenick's head, just below the helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievably, Roenick wasn't injured. Pronger, though, got
kicked out with a match penalty for intent to injure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dumb play. It was a bonehead move, period,'' said
Roenick, the Coyotes' leading scorer with 31 points. ``That's
endangering somebody's health. . . . That's bush league, if you ask
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronger left the Kiel Center without speaking to reporters.
Roenick, for one, expects the Blues player to get a stiff
suspension from Colin Campbell, the NHL's senior vice president in
charge of hockey operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' he said. ``You've seen some of the incidents this
year. Rob Blake (of the Los Angeles Kings) got suspended for three
games (for a slash), but what (Pronger) did tonight was worse.''
</P>
<P>
   What was almost as bad was the Coyotes' feeble attempt on the
ensuing five-minute power play. Phoenix, which will meet the New
York Islanders on Sunday at America West Arena, could muster only
two shots during the golden opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the way the power play has gone all season for the
Coyotes. They were 0 for 5 with the man advantage Thursday,
including a two-man advantage for 57 seconds in the first when they
failed to register a single shot on Fuhr.
</P>
<P>
   The victory ends a six-game winless streak (0-4-2) for the
Blues. &QL;

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Speculation surrounding some provisions of Roger Clemens' contract
with the Toronto Blue Jays is expected to lead to an investigation
by Major League Baseball, sources said Thursday night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At issue are the contents of a side agreement among Clemens, his
agents and former Toronto president Paul Beeston made when Clemens
signed with the Blue Jays in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In question are undocumented contractual rights _ a no-trade
clause, a must-trade clause and a clause that would grant Clemens
free agency if a trade is not completed within 90 days of his Dec.
2 trade demand.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, an official for Major League Baseball said no such
trade agreements are in the five-time Cy Young Award winner's
contract. Clemens has two years remaining on a four-year deal worth
$31.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger Clemens does not have anything along those lines
attached to his contract,'' said Brian Small, the American League
director of waivers and records.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball prohibits side agreements that do not
accompany the contract when it is filed with the American League or
National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Side letters are technically not allowed,'' said Small, saying
a club could be fined if found in violation of baseball rules.
</P>
<P>
   If an investigation by MLB determines the presence of an unfiled
addendum to Clemens' contract, MLB could declare the agreement null
and void.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do side agreements, it's kind of impossible for them to
be enforced,'' Small said. ``When you shake hands, wink, pat on the
back, those are the type things that happen in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an existing (side) agreement (involving Clemens),
I couldn't tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto general manager Gord Ash, who reopened trade talks with
the Astros on Wednesday, strongly denies any extra language exists
in Clemens' contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a misinformation campaign going on to lower his
(Clemens') trade value,'' Ash said before leaving the winter
meetings in Nashville on Tuesday. ``I know how this happens. There
are too many scouts and too many media standing around with not
enough going on. The kind of dollars mentioned that he is looking
for has been wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there is the self-righteous talk from some clubs that `We
don't talk to agents' and how some agents are running the game. The
reality is that agents play a large part in this. Anyone who says
they don't does not understand the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Hendricks, one of Clemens' agents, called Astros owner
Drayton McLane Jr. on Saturday and suggested that if the Astros
were interested in Clemens, they could extend his contract for one
year at $27.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   That would amount to Clemens getting a $43.5 million, three-year
deal. Such a contract would make Clemens baseball's
second-highest-paid player ($14.5 million average), trailing only
the $105 million, seven-year contract signed last weekend by
pitcher Kevin Brown and the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, Yankees, Indians and Rangers continue to be the most
interested in acquiring Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker reopened
negotiations with the Blue Jays _ his first contact with Toronto
since the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed players, but I can't say we made progress,''
Hunsicker said. ``I can only say Toronto has a good understanding
about players we're willing to discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks said Clemens was given the contractual right by
Beeston, now president of Major League Baseball, to make the trade
request after any season when he signed two years ago. As for the
rumors, he responded by saying it would be difficult to explain
``every nuance'' of Clemens' complex contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``People start to ask, `What about this, what about that?'''
Hendricks said. ``I'm not going to confirm or deny one thing,
because it doesn't get us anywhere; it doesn't serve any purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this, an Easter egg hunt for a hidden clause?''
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks said the goal continues to be to restructure Clemens'
contract while at the same time providing the Blue Jays with
acceptable compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start asking about paragraph two, paragraph 10 (in
the contract), that seems to be missing the point,'' Hendricks
said. ``When all is said and done, Roger will be traded to
somebody,'' Hendricks said.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens won Cy Young Awards with the Boston Red Sox in 1986,
1987 and 1991 and in his only two seasons with the Blue Jays in
1997 and 1998. He also was the American League Most Valuable Player
in 1986.

CYNICISM THRIVING IN WAKE OF CLINTON-DIRECTED BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN VAN DER WERF  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Lyndon B. Johnson's Vietnam policy was so unpopular
that he limited his public appearances to military bases and other
``safe'' venues. President Truman was a pariah for getting troops
involved in Korea, and he was lambasted as a failed haberdasher.
</P>
<P>
   Once, there was a bona fide crook in the White House, Richard
Nixon, whose errors were legion. But no one had the temerity to
suggest that he could, or would, manipulate the military to save
his political hide.
</P>
<P>
   That took President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   What was once a healthy skepticism about the president has
become for a growing number of people an overwhelming cynicism, a
belief that Clinton never does anything out of principle but only
out of self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the day after Clinton ordered the bombing of
Baghdad, the most popular debate in town was questioning his
motivation, his timing, his resolve. But then raising fundamental
questions about Clinton and his character has become the hallmark
of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Even among veterans groups, who arguably might be the most
supportive of American troops at war, there were lingering
questions and suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it could have been orchestrated to create a diversion
from the fact that there was about to be an almost certain vote of
impeachment,'' said Paul Gaulocher, 53, of Scottsdale, who was an
Army infantryman in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected the argument that such an action would require the
complicity of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the British government and
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you would have to do is to coordinate the time that report
is released,'' Gaulocher said, referring to chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler's criticism of Iraqi cooperation. ``And
that wouldn't be that hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler gave a strong defense of his report Thursday, denying
that it was timed to trump the impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Melvin, 28, a Glendale locksmith who was a Marine sniper
during the Gulf War, said he, too, was suspicious about the timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have waited,'' Melvin said. ``It's been going on for
a long time, and they could have taken action long before now.''
</P>
<P>
   In most military actions, it is expected that criticism will
cease as Congress and the people join the commander in chief in
supporting the troops.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there were deep suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Had Clinton orchestrated this to stave off the House impeachment
vote and perhaps give himself the time to reverse the momentum?
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty for Clinton is, even when he does the right
thing, he opens himself up to questioning,'' said James W. Davis, a
professor of political science at Washington University in St.
Louis. ``President Clinton, by his own actions, has either
incredibly damaged or destroyed his credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., was quick to back
away Thursday from his comments Wednesday, when he said he did not
back the bombing because the timing of it was so suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be emphatic that I am in support of the troops,''
Lott said Thursday. ``I believe that there is no relationship''
between the bombing and the timing of the impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott's cynicism was catching.
</P>
<P>
   At the Carl T. Hayden Veterans Affairs Medical Center in
Phoenix, just about every television was tuned to coverage of the
bombing campaign, and the air was filled with suspicion about
whether it was really necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton pulled this off to save his ass,'' said George L.
Smith, 82, of Queen Creek, a retired postal worker and World War II
Marine.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and most other veterans did not question the wisdom of the
action. If anything, the veterans wished it had happened long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to do this. We should have finished him (Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein) off in Desert Storm,'' said Joe Makowski,
51, of Tempe, who was also in the Army infantry in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Holding back on Saddam was President Bush's decision.
Supposedly, Clinton's aim is to knock him from power this time. But
because it is Clinton, even an aim that most people agree with
raises what else? More questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people out there who think he (Clinton) is the first
cousin to the Antichrist. If he were to walk up to them and hand
them a $1,000 bill, they would wonder what part of the last
left-wing conspiracy he just passed on to them,'' said Mike
Breslin, a political campaign consultant in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules of the day have really changed from 20 or 30 years
ago. People are a little more fast, a little more rigid in their
opinion. The level of reasonable discourse in politics has really
gone down because we live in an age when there is so much
competition to get a message out. If you are going to be heard, it
pays to be hard-edged and sharp and polarizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton isn't helped any by his personal foibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a (expletive) draft dodger who can't keep his pants on,''
said Thomas R. Barnes, 47, a Vietnam veteran from Phoenix, who
otherwise believes Clinton is ``doing right by the country.''
</P>
<P>
   People criticized the failed military plot to rescue U.S.
hostages in Iran hatched by President Carter, but they couldn't
criticize him personally. He is a former Navy commander. Bush was
also seen as a weak leader, but his military record is impeccable
and heroic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has no heroic military background to recall in times of
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a lawyer to a fault, too slick by half,'' said
Davis, the professor. ``He has always been able to use words and
persuasion to talk his way out of jams, and that's all he has.
Slick is not a compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Strauss has been one of Clinton's biggest public supporters
locally, but now he has given up. He found he didn't know what
Clinton stood for anymore, other than self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The host of a talk show on KXAM-AM (1310), Strauss was a rare
voice among the conservative-dominated radio community in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss doesn't believe Clinton orchestrated the bombing raid to
save his hide, but he bailed out over Clinton's statements
regarding his relationship with former intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have a problem with being lied to to my face,'' Strauss
said. ``I feel betrayed. I was on radio for hour after hour
defending his character. I was telling people they were crazy for
not giving him more credit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Strauss cannot forget Clinton wagging his finger at the
cameras in January denying that he had ``sexual relations with that
woman, Miss Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what? People believe less today than they did
yesterday,'' Strauss said. ``I believe less today than I did
yesterday. I'm sorry to say it, but it's true. It makes a horrible
statement about where we've come and where we're going.'' &QL;

TOUTING CURRY'S TALENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walking on campus on her way to the library one afternoon
recently, Edniesha Curry encountered a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   The man walked a few steps with her before asking out of the
blue, ``So when's your next game?''
</P>
<P>
   Taken aback, Curry stopped and looked at him suspiciously. She
answered.
</P>
<P>
   The man asked, ``Aren't you Edniesha Curry?''
</P>
<P>
   Curry acknowledged herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Good luck and keep up the big numbers,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for an athlete to become a known quantity on a
commuter campus like Cal State Northridge. But the sophomore from
Palmdale High School has accomplished it because the women's team
is winning (it's 4-3 heading into Saturday's game at Cal Poly) and
she is averaging 24.9 points a game. That's tops in the Big Sky
Conference and fifth in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Her 40 points against Loyola Marymount is the third- highest
total by a Division I player this season. Her three and a half
3-point field goals a game leads the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just being an on-campus celebrity isn't enough. It's time
to take her show public. For the first time, and at the suggestion
of former coach Michael Abraham, there is an All-America campaign
being waged at Northridge on behalf of a women's basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   Some might wonder why, considering Curry was named All-America
by the Women's Basketball Journal last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to promote her as much as possible,'' said sports
information contact Bruce Christensen.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Northridge is doing what many Division I schools do
_ send out information packets to those voting for All-America
teams. The most prestigious of these is the award sponsored by
Kodak. So, every other week, Christensen sends out a Curry summary
sheet to the eight coaches and one chairperson who will select the
Kodak team.
</P>
<P>
   Included are Curry's national ranking, her All-America honor
last year as a freshman, her Big Sky Conference numbers, her school
records and what other coaches are saying.
</P>
<P>
   Quoted are Utah Starzz assistant and former USC head coach Fred
Williams, Northern Arizona coach Meg Sanders and Iowa coach Angie
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, Lee might carry the most weight. She is one of the
eight Kodak-selecting coaches and saw first-hand what Curry could
do last year, when Curry scored 28 points in the Matadors' 67-56
loss to the No. 20-ranked Hawkeyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is just a great player,'' Lee said. ``She can shoot from
the outside, from the inside and drive to the basket. She is a
tremendous athlete who knows how to get the ball into the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Christensen said Curry is happy with the campaign, but Curry
added that it is worth less if the team doesn't win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual accolades mean nothing if we're not winning,
and not until I make the big ones _ win the Big Sky and go to the
NCAA Tournament,'' she said. ``Until then, it will be like last
year: `I got All-America? Oh, thanks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   __ UCLA update: The UCLA women are in the midst of a six-game
win streak heading into Saturday's game at Texas. The No. 8-ranked
Bruins (6-2) have to be careful not to look past the 3-3 Longhorns
to Monday's matchup at at No. 2 Tennessee, the game in which UCLA
coach Kathy Olivier said, ``We'll see where we are as a basketball
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Where are they now?
</P>
<P>
   Strong in the post but weak on the perimeter and susceptible to
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Maylana Martin (18.5 ppg, 11.6 rpg) and Janae Hubbard (14.8 ppg,
8.6 rpg) have been solid inside, but the outside shooting hasn't
been at the same level. No guard averages more points per game than
backup LaCresha Flanagan's 9.4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to get in foul trouble,'' Olivier said. ``We need to
take better care of the ball. If we can come out of Texas with a W,
we'll give Tennessee a real run.''
</P>
<P>
   __ What it takes: The Bruins are the only Pac-10 team ranked
nationally. That's all well and good, and it surely brings some
excitement to the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee coach Pat Summitt has noticed, saying the strong guard
play of Erica Gomez and the inside jobs Martin and Hubbard are
doing what is needed to begin to build a successful program.
</P>
<P>
   But, Summitt stressed, it's only a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it takes to be considered among the elite is to get into
the final eight and the Final Four,'' Summitt said. ``Once you
become part of March Madness, people recognize you as a national
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, a team has to do it year in and year out. Summitt
has led the Lady Vols to the last three national championships.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA won the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women
title in 1978. Last year, the Bruins just missed making the final
16 on a controversial call that cost them a second-round win over
Alabama.

ANOTHER FIGHT TO THE FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Welcome to Pepperdine women's basketball, where
no lead is safe.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Waves are 7-2 after beating Florida State 75-72
Thursday at Firestone Fieldhouse. But it has been a struggle every
game.
</P>
<P>
   This time, against an aggressive and quick Florida State squad,
the outcome wasn't decided until there were 1.7 seconds left. With
Pepperdine leading 74-72, freshman forward Nadja Morgan missed two
free throws _ but grabbed the rebound and was fouled again. She
made one free throw to seal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't quit,'' Pepperdine coach Mark Trakh said. ``They
played hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine has struggled because it has several transfer and
young players learning how to play together. Plus, the Waves lost
their point guard earlier this season with a knee injury. That has
left Trakh no choice but to move shooting guard Rasheeda Clark to
the point.
</P>
<P>
   Clark responded with 23 points, but she wasn't the only hero.
There was Dee Braxton muscling inside and getting nine of her 11
points in the second half. There was Kate Crane helping Clark at
the point and getting nine points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Braxton, Clark, Crane, tonight, you saw them play,'' Trakh
said. ``They played hard. They played together.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that way in the first half. Florida State (3-5)
makes up for a lack of height with plenty of quickness and an
ability to get inside. The Seminoles played North Carolina to
overtime before losing and also made a decent showing against
Louisiana Tech, also a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Trakh knew all about the Seminoles' quickness and lousy outside
shooting (17 percent from 3-point land). So the Waves played a zone
and dared the Seminoles to shoot outside.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State didn't want to, instead opting to try and get the
ball inside. But Pepperdine read it and turned 10 first-half
Florida State turnovers (six by intercepting passes) into a 28-9
run. An 11-4 deficit became a 32-20 lead and the Waves led 36-27 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   In that span, Pepperdine also scored 10 straight points and held
the Seminoles scoreless for more than four mintues.
</P>
<P>
   Clark scored 12 points in the first half, and the defense held
Florida State's Latavia Coleman (she averages 20 a game) to eight.
Florida State shot 32 percent from the field, well below its
45-percent average.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second half, Florida State's aggressiveness came out.
The Seminoles started intercepting Pepperdine pases inside and ran
off 10 of the half's first 12 points, then built the run to 19-7
and 23-9. With 12:39 to play, Florida State led 50-45. Coleman was
a key, scoring nine points in a span of 2:21. She finished with 21.
</P>
<P>
   Just as always, however, Pepperdine didn't give up. A 14-6 run
cut gave the Waves a 61-60 lead with 5:19 remaining. It was close
the rest of the way.

ROSA BLOOMS, BUT NOTHING ELSE ROSY FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ One day, you're in the minor leagues
patiently awaiting your chance to break into the NHL. The next,
you're in the National Hockey League and you've scored more goals
in two periods than 11 of the 18 forwards who've played for your
new team this season.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case with 21-year-old right wing Pavel Rosa, who
scored two goals for the Los Angeles Kings on Thursday night in his
NHL debut and even threw a solid body check that belied his
reputation for shying away from physical play.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa's performance, however, wasn't enough to keep the Kings
from sinking deeper into this sewer of a season, as Bryan Berard's
goal two-minutes into overtime gave the New York Islanders a 5-4
victory over the Kings before an announced crowd of 9,872 at the
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille and Steve Duchesne also scored for the Kings
(8-19-3), who are 2-1-1 in their last four games. Robitaille's goal
was his 15th this season (he had 16 last year) and the 493rd of his
career. Duchesne's goal was just his second in a thus-far
disappointing year.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Storr, playing for the first time in more than two weeks,
was shaky in goal for the Kings the entire night. Along with
Berard, Eric Brewer, Ted Donato, Mike Watt and Barry Richter scored
for the Islanders (12-19).
</P>
<P>
   The story of an otherwise dismal night for the Kings was Rosa,
who was called up from the Long Beach Ice Dogs on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Rosa said of being recalled. ``At
first, I was shaking for a couple of hours inside, and I had
butterflies. It was nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the decision to recall Rosa, Coach Larry Robinson
said of his offensively-challenged team: ``We've got to get some
goals. We've been getting some chances but we're not getting goals.
That's this kid's forte. We're not going to expect him to light the
tree on fire in one game. But I think he'll get some chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Rosa lit the tree.
</P>
<P>
   With the Islanders up, 1-0, in the first period, Rosa found some
open space all to himself to the right of goalie Tommy Salo, and
Vladimir Tsyplakov passed him the puck. Showing skill indicative of
the reputation that preceded him to the Kings, Rosa used one motion
to receive the pass, cradle the puck and slip it between Salo's
pads.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the second period, Rosa stole the puck from defenseman
Berard at the Islanders' blue line, faked Salo off his feet and
slipped the puck into a virtually empty net, giving the Kings the
4-3 lead they carried into the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Richter tied the score early in the third, beating Storr with an
unscreened 50-foot slap shot.
</P>
<P>
   In overtime, Duchesne got caught up ice, the Islanders gained an
outnumbered rush, and after Marius Czerkawski's shot hit the post,
Berard blasted the puck into the net.
</P>
<P>
   For Rosa, a native of the Czech Republic who was a second-round
choice in the 1995 draft, it was a grueling journey to Thursday
night and his flirtation with becoming only the third player in
history to record a hat trick in his first NHL game. Montreal's
Alex Smart in 1943 and Atlanta's Real Cloutier in 1979 are the only
ones to score three goals in their NHL debuts.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Rosa produced 153 points in the Quebec junior
league. But last year, Rosa suffered a concussion when checked by
Colorado's Rene Corbet during a preseason game, and he ended up
appearing in only three minor-league games.
</P>
<P>
   This season, after a strong training camp, Rosa was assigned to
the Ice Dogs, for whom he had 13 points in 16 games. But Rosa also
missed a stretch of time when symptoms of post-concussion syndrome
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big lesson,'' Rosa said of his medical problems. ``It
was nothing nice, but it was a big lesson. I know the symptoms, I
know my body more, I know if I feel bad what I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Rosa said he's learned is to take two Advils before
every game. Thursday night, he gave the Islanders headaches.
</P>
<P>
   As for finally making it to the NHL, Rosa said: ``I've been
waiting for this since I knew the NHL existed. I went step by step
through junior and getting drafted. I dreamed that one day I would
get the call.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ Someday, when he retires and is ushered into the Hockey
Hall of Fame, Ray Bourque will look back proudly on the milestones
he reached during his two decades in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, the ever-youthful Bourque intends to keep
plugging along and will stop and smell the roses later.
</P>
<P>
   There were a couple of more Thursday night as he helped the
Bruins beat the Ottawa Senators, 5-2, at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, who became the 10th player in league history to play
1,400 games, set up a pair of power-play goals and tied Gordie Howe
for third on the NHL's all-time assist list with 1,049.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he plays,'' said coach Pat Burns, ``he has earned
everything he has. The loyalty of Ray Bourque to the team is
probably the best example across the board of any professional
sport. He capped that milestone. He never talked about it. He never
really came out and stated nothing. He goes out and plays the game.
He doesn't stop at those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, the Bruins' all-time leading scorer, played 21 shifts
totaling 24 minutes 26 seconds, and both his shots led to goals.
</P>
<P>
   Boston went into the game nip-and-tuck in the Northeast Division
standings with Ottawa. The Bruins ended their losing streak at two
games and are now 3 points ahead of the Senators.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins jumped into the lead just 23 seconds into the game
when P.J. Axelsson picked off former Bruin Shawn McEachern and beat
goalie Damian Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators tied it at 5:48, the result of a nifty move off the
rush by left wing Andreas Johansson, who signed with the club as a
free agent in late September. Johansson took a pass from Daniel
Alfredsson and charged down the slot. He deked defenseman Darren
Van Impe, lifting his stick in the process, and proceeded right to
the net, switching from his forehand to his backhand and sailing a
shot past Byron Dafoe inside the right post. It was the 11th goal
of the season for Johansson, who was with the Penguins last year.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes later, the Bruins took the lead for good
on a goal by sophomore center Joe Thornton. Bourque fired a slap
shot from the right point that Thornton redirected past Rhodes for
the 2-1 edge at 7:45. It was Thornton's third tally of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, the Bruins boosted their lead to 3-1,
thanks to Sergei Samsonov's seemingly infinite patience.
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov, positioned along the left wing boards, worked a
give-and-go with Jason Allison. He dished the puck to Allison, who
gave it right back to him from the left circle. Samsonov then cut
from left to right, skating across the top of the crease and down
below the right circle. He had Ottawa's defense mesmerized, and
when he got all the way across, he flipped the puck into the far
side of the net at 6:18 for his 10th goal.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Bruins went to sleep. It was as if the ice had
tilted toward Boston's defensive zone. The Bruins had four shots in
the second, none after Samsonov's goal, which was the only shot by
a forward. It was all Ottawa as the Senators poured 12 shots on
Dafoe, although midway through the period, there was a four-minute
span when neither goalie faced a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins emerged from their slumber for the final period,
picking up the pace. McEachern pulled the Senators within one, 3-2,
at 13:33, but only 15 seconds later, Rob DiMaio came through with
his first goal of the season. The Bruins closed out the scoring at
17:38 when Dmitri Khristich beat Rhodes on a backhander, burying a
rebound of a Bourque shot from the right point. That assist tied
Howe's mark.
</P>
<P>
   At the 19-minute mark, DiMaio completed his Gordie Howe hat
trick (a goal, an assist, and a fight) when he battled Bill Berg.
He was ejected because the officials said his sweater wasn't tied
down. However, DiMaio said it was.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. For the team, it was a victory. More significantly,
it was Bourque's night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hockey,'' said Bourque, referring to Howe. ``It's pretty
special, I think. Not too many people get to enjoy something like
this. When it all started, you never think of these things. You
want to go out and establish yourself as a solid NHL player. So
many things have gone on through these years that you enjoy, but
maybe not as much as I will once it's all said and done.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    In Florida, the Sunshine State, Christmas is an enduring
anomaly. The best Christmas is a day of belonging, of familiarity
and of old kinship, all of which make Florida an alien place for
the real thing.
 &HT;    Conventional wisdom tells us that nearly everyone here is from
``somewhere else.'' Reality or not, this impression has come to
define us, and even natives sometimes forget that they are the
natural children of the sun.
 &HT;    What I am leading to is this: Given time and place, Christmas in
Florida is a state of mind, causing many transplants to suffer
Yuletide angst in paradise. Indeed, the state itself is the source
of untold fantasies that routinely come tumbling down like
raindrops during a summer afternoon thunderstorm.
 &HT;    Florida is a peninsula, not quite an island, not quite
landlocked either. And so Christmas here is like the state itself,
an unfinished sculpture or painting _ a thing in search of meaning.
 &HT;    Like Florida, Christmas down here is a tropical bazaar.
 &HT;    As a native of Fort Lauderdale, I was condemned to perpetual
heat, humidity and year-round greenery until I moved away for short
periods. Even as a child, I knew that Christmas in Florida was a
substitution, a contradiction, an over-compensation.
 &HT;    We hung too many lights when I was a child. We still hang far
too many.
 &HT;    I knew what Christmas should resemble from magazines, books and
movies. I knew that it was a time for Jack Frost, hot chocolate,
snow and snowmen, horse-drawn sleighs and bells, kids sledding down
steep inclines, carolers braving bone-chilling cold.
 &HT;    Today, few things have changed in the Sunshine State. Like most
other South Floridians, I sweat on Dec. 25. We can be seen fishing,
golfing, tanning, water-skiing, swimming. And believe it or not,
many of us drink lemonade beneath sprawling banyans on Christmas
day. Some of us even mow the lawn, side-stepping plastic pink
flamingos all the while.
 &HT;    Nothing, however, captures the spirit of Christmas in South
Florida like our annual boat parades. Instead of sleigh rides,
Floridians deploy thousands of decorated water craft along our
natural rivers and channels gouged out of the ground by the Army
Corps of Engineers.
 &HT;    Whenever I am in Fort Lauderdale or Miami or St. Petersburg for
Christmas, I never miss the boat parade, a bona fide Florida
spectacle that attracts crowds as energetic as those at New York's
Time Square celebration on New Year's Eve. Most of the boats are
man-made wonders unto themselves. They are decorated with countless
blinking lights in complex designs and topped-off with live
Christmas trees fastened to their guide towers. Seasonal music
pumps from huge speakers.
 &HT;    The obscene, aerodynamic cigarette boats and their cargo are my
favorite. Invariably, handsome young men, their deep tans the
picture of health and wealth, guide these glossy, rumbling machines
over the lightly chopping water. The wake must be kept down, you
know, so as not to disturb the seawalls protecting million-dollar
homes along the route.
 &HT;    Hanging onto the men are beautiful, bikini-clad women, showing
off perfect teeth as they smile and flawless flesh as they wave to
the admiring crowds. Male parade-goers, many of them sloshed from
too much booze and the up-and-down motion of the scene, especially
love the flirtatious female boaters wearing those little
red-and-white Santa caps and tight tank tops.
 &HT;    As the evening grows darker, the colorful flotilla dips and
twists like a long water creature coming apart. This is Christmas
in sun-drenched South Florida.
 &HT;    So, too, are the mega-celebrations in and around Disney World,
in the shadow of the now-familiar Earffel Tower, the municipal
water tower decked out with Mickey Mouse ears. At the Magic
Kingdom, Epcot, Universal Studios, Sea World and other sites,
carolers and spectators holding candles throng the narrow walkways
and plazas. Parades, complete with elaborate floats and human and
animated celebrities, pass by with eye-popping regularity.
 &HT;    Here, commercial giants compete for who can do the grandest
public display of Christmas.
 &HT;    Some years ago, when I visited Mousedom during the Yuletide
season, Sea World boasted that its 400-foot metal sky tower was
Central Florida's biggest Christmas tree. Not to be outdone, the
folks over at Universal Studios hauled in tons of fake snow that
looked very real on the park's life-like New York Street set.
 &HT;    Disney-MGM Studios, never runners up on earth or in heaven,
sported a 70-foot tree with 2-million lights. This monstrosity,
called The Wall of Angels, blocks off a portion of the horizon.
And, still in the Yuletide spirit, Disney-MGM flew in Buzz
Lightyear, Woody, Bo Peep and other characters from the hit movie
Toy Story of that year.
 &HT;    This Christmas, I am not going near the Disney World area, so I
will not be able to count the lights or measure the height of the
metal trees or fight the gridlock that comes with this mass of
humanity. I will miss South Florida's boat parades, too.
 &HT;    I have come north, to Virginia, where the weather is cooler,
where the leaves have changed color or have fallen to the ground,
where most lawns are no longer green, where smoke rises from real
fireplaces, where people are actually wearing sweaters, coats and
headgear, where a hot drink in the middle of the day is not a
strange act, where snow may be on the ground.
 &HT;    Here _ where the weather is cold and life slows down at least
temporarily _ Christmas is not a mere state of mind. It is as real
as the spirit of the season.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Why is our house different from all others on the block? Instead
of a traditional Jewish Menorah or Christian Christmas tree, we
have combined the two to create a universal religious display _ and
celebration.
 &HT;    Although this is only my second holiday tree, I have learned
after 14 years, that intermarriage does not have to be a struggle.
With proper respect and communication, it is more a campaign of
compromise.
 &HT;    Until last year, I was both stubborn and skeptical. While I
refused to consider a tree of any kind, I visited friends in
all-Jewish households who were proud to flaunt their glittering
pink and silver or blue and gold ``Hanukkah bushes.''
 &HT;    While I grew up in a reformed Jewish home, we celebrated
Hanukkah. Not Christmas. Decorations were limited to a modern
Menorah, dreidels, Jewish picture books, jewelry, and the
occasional blue and gold banner proclaiming the holiday.
 &HT;    We indulged all eight nights of Hanukkah complete with presents
and frosted cookies, candied fruits, colored bagels, flavored
popcorn, painted walnuts and dark chocolate fudge.
 &HT;    Despite the fact that we lived in a small Indiana town where
there were more schoolhouses than Jews, Christmas decorations or
gift-giving like the gentile children enjoyed, were way off-limits.
 &HT;    Unlike my classmates' homes, our wood burning stove was not
bedecked with a Christmas wreath. My mother, who grew up in Chicago
and Shreveport with only Jews as friends and family, was determined
to raise us in a Jewish home. We would celebrate all the Jewish
holidays, and not any of the Christian ones.
 &HT;    Obviously, my mother would not understand my flirtation with the
holiday tree. After her death in 1990, I continued her tradition
until last year when the two holidays fell on the same dates.
 &HT;    After living in New York and now south Florida, I am constantly
amazed at the number of Jewish homes which have made holiday trees
a part of their December decor. That, together with a little urging
from my husband, convinced me to finally relent. I agreed to a
holiday compromise.
 &HT;    I even invited my father over to inaugurate the blue, gold,
silver and white tree. He snickered, but made no disparaging
comments. I know my husband relished this neo-holiday scene as he
recalled past holidays from his boyhood homes.
 &HT;    We plugged in the lights of the tree and lit the candles of the
Menorah while singing ``'TWas The Night Before Christmas'' followed
by ``Rock of Ages.''
 &HT;    With Hanukkah beginning early this year, we have even more
opportunity to fully celebrate both holidays by enjoying and
exploiting our differences.
 &HT;    But American rabbis and other religious leaders are still
struggling with ever more frequent Jewish intermarriage. According
to recent surveys, intermarriage has increased from about 10
percent in 1965 to between 38 and 52 percent today.
 &HT;    The World Jewish Congress (WJC) has projected that the Jewish
population outside of Israel, which has about 8 million people,
will decline to about 4 million in the next 30 years.
 &HT;    In this country, the WJC reports that about half of all Jews
marry non-Jews. And the children of a large majority of those
intermarried couples do not remain Jewish.
 &HT;    Why is that? Conventional wisdom finds it easier to be
Christian. There is more publicity for Christmas celebrations.
Television programming for Christmas is much more frequent than
that for Hanukkah. And many divorced families celebrate Christmas
over Hanukkah because they are busy shuttling kids from one home to
another in different cities around the nation.
 &HT;    With all of these diversions, it is even more important for the
Jewish half of the intermarriage to make sure Jewish traditions
don't die out.
 &HT;    This year we have bought a Concolor Fir, a beautiful and full
branched tree grown in Michigan that glints with a blue-white
sheen. Decorations are seasonal and creative instead of religious.
 &HT;    We are trimming the tree with red, white and blue wooden sailor
children, pink ice scenes, tiny snowmen, sterling silver sleds,
gazebo candles, Finnish snowflakes, mini ice skates, twinkling
trinkets, gold and silver balls, bows, ribbons and ties, blue and
gold wreaths, porcelain dolls, and small silver satin slippers from
Miami City Ballet's Nutcracker.
 &HT;    We have a brick fireplace with a mantle for both the red and
green and blue and gold stockings. Our Jack Russell terrier has a
`mixed breed' stocking which celebrates the colors of both
holidays.
 &HT;    My husband bought me a new Menorah this year which depicts the
synagogues of Europe in loving memory of lost communities. Flanking
the long Menorah are wreaths adorned with berries, cones, colored
velvet bows, tiny wrapped packages and silver-blue frosted leaves.
 &HT;    I can't help but believe that my mother would understand that
days pass, years go by, and things change. We must live in the
present while remembering the past. It is the only way to ensure
our future.
 &HT;    I hope she would approve.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Christmas couldn't always be left up to parents _ or even Santa
Claus. Sometimes an 8-year-old had to take matters into his own
hands, especially when what he wanted most was a Dick Tracy toy.
 &HT;    My brother, Chris, kept a No. 1 rule in mind: Begin to wear down
the opposition in early December.
 &HT;    ``A gun that shoots plastic bullets? Why, that's no plaything,''
my father announced at breakfast. ``It could put an eye out.''
 &HT;    The toy didn't become safer as the month gained momentum _ only
more familiar. Thanks to my brother, it showed up more often in
family conversation than the names of relatives. Did the rest of us
know, for instance, that it came with a shoulder holster? Did we
know that it came with a Dick Tracy wallet and badge?
 &HT;    Rule No. 2: To increase the chances of receiving your heart's
desire, add more items to your ``wish'' list.
 &HT;    By constantly updating and padding his gift suggestions, Chris
hoped that our overwhelmed parents would remember one item _ the
one that mattered _ when they stood, confused, in the toy store.
 &HT;    Rule No. 3? My brother was about to teach us.
 &HT;    In his day, instead of having to be driven to a far-away mall,
all Chris had to do was walk several blocks down to the toy store.
Parting with his hard-earned money was difficult. Even more so was
getting the Dick Tracy toy and all its glorious trappings through
the back door without their being detected.
 &HT;    Luck was on his side: Chris entered unnoticed and crept down to
the basement.
 &HT;    Next, as luck further had it, a family rule came to his rescue.
Each December, to protect anyone who might be wrapping presents in
the recreation room, anyone approaching had to ask at the top of
the basement steps, ``Is it OK to come down?''
 &HT;    ``No,'' came a squeaky response to my inquiry that day. ``I'm
wrapping a present.''
 &HT;    My brother spoke the truth.
 &HT;    ``The package took a long time to wrap,'' Chris recently
recalled, four decades later, ``because I had to make it look as if
an adult had done it. I tried making my handwriting look old, too,
when I signed the card, ``To Chris/From Santa.''
 &HT;    Who knows when he slipped his prized possession under the
Christmas tree, beneath the other presents? It remained hidden,
though, until something occurred that he hadn't anticipated.
 &HT;    Each Christmas Eve, the children were allowed to open one gift
apiece.
 &HT;    ``Look, Chris already has one from Santa,'' one said as the
others were sifting through the pile, trying to decide which to
open.
 &HT;    ``From Santa? How could that be? Santa doesn't leave presents
until later tonight,'' another said in case our brother still
believed.
 &HT;    Chris stayed cool. Better to wait until morning, he cautioned
himself, and open his present amid the confusion.
 &HT;    And so, early on Christmas Day, during a tumultuous moment of
merrymaking, his voice rose above the racket.
 &HT;    ``Wow _ thanks, Santa!'' he shouted as he strapped on the
holster.
 &HT;    My mother shot an accusatory glance at my father.
 &HT;    ``Don't look at me,'' he seemed to say, returning a similar
look.
 &HT;    ``Not me,'' her eyes darted back.
 &HT;    Both parents then studied their daughters, who shrugged their
shoulders. That left only Santa.
 &HT;    We marveled at the mystery of Christmas, all of us, that is,
except Dad whose irritation rose.
 &HT;    ``Never, ever aim that toy at someone,'' I heard him scold above
the din as my brother set us _ and the season _ in his sight.
 &HT;    That night, a tired but happy ``Santa'' clasped under his pillow
the Dick Tracy holster set, badge and wallet.
 &HT;    He had plenty of years left to learn that giving held even
greater joy than receiving.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Christmas couldn't always be left up to parents _ or even Santa
Claus. Sometimes an 8-year-old had to take matters into his own
hands, especially when what he wanted most was a Dick Tracy toy.
 &HT;    My brother, Chris, kept a No. 1 rule in mind: Begin to wear down
the opposition in early December.
 &HT;    ``A gun that shoots plastic bullets? Why, that's no plaything,''
my father announced at breakfast. ``It could put an eye out.''
 &HT;    The toy didn't become safer as the month gained momentum _ only
more familiar. Thanks to my brother, it showed up more often in
family conversation than the names of relatives. Did the rest of us
know, for instance, that it came with a shoulder holster? Did we
know that it came with a Dick Tracy wallet and badge?
 &HT;    Rule No. 2: To increase the chances of receiving your heart's
desire, add more items to your ``wish'' list.
 &HT;    By constantly updating and padding his gift suggestions, Chris
hoped that our overwhelmed parents would remember one item _ the
one that mattered _ when they stood, confused, in the toy store.
 &HT;    Rule No. 3? My brother was about to teach us.
 &HT;    In his day, instead of having to be driven to a far-away mall,
all Chris had to do was walk several blocks down to the toy store.
Parting with his hard-earned money was difficult. Even more so was
getting the Dick Tracy toy and all its glorious trappings through
the back door without their being detected.
 &HT;    Luck was on his side: Chris entered unnoticed and crept down to
the basement.
 &HT;    Next, as luck further had it, a family rule came to his rescue.
Each December, to protect anyone who might be wrapping presents in
the recreation room, anyone approaching had to ask at the top of
the basement steps, ``Is it OK to come down?''
 &HT;    ``No,'' came a squeaky response to my inquiry that day. ``I'm
wrapping a present.''
 &HT;    My brother spoke the truth.
 &HT;    ``The package took a long time to wrap,'' Chris recently
recalled, four decades later, ``because I had to make it look as if
an adult had done it. I tried making my handwriting look old, too,
when I signed the card, ``To Chris/From Santa.''
 &HT;    Who knows when he slipped his prized possession under the
Christmas tree, beneath the other presents? It remained hidden,
though, until something occurred that he hadn't anticipated.
 &HT;    Each Christmas Eve, the children were allowed to open one gift
apiece.
 &HT;    ``Look, Chris already has one from Santa,'' one said as the
others were sifting through the pile, trying to decide which to
open.
 &HT;    ``From Santa? How could that be? Santa doesn't leave presents
until later tonight,'' another said in case our brother still
believed.
 &HT;    Chris stayed cool. Better to wait until morning, he cautioned
himself, and open his present amid the confusion.
 &HT;    And so, early on Christmas Day, during a tumultuous moment of
merrymaking, his voice rose above the racket.
 &HT;    ``Wow _ thanks, Santa!'' he shouted as he strapped on the
holster.
 &HT;    My mother shot an accusatory glance at my father.
 &HT;    ``Don't look at me,'' he seemed to say, returning a similar
look.
 &HT;    ``Not me,'' her eyes darted back.
 &HT;    Both parents then studied their daughters, who shrugged their
shoulders. That left only Santa.
 &HT;    We marveled at the mystery of Christmas, all of us, that is,
except Dad whose irritation rose.
 &HT;    ``Never, ever aim that toy at someone,'' I heard him scold above
the din as my brother set us _ and the season _ in his sight.
 &HT;    That night, a tired but happy ``Santa'' clasped under his pillow
the Dick Tracy holster set, badge and wallet.
 &HT;    He had plenty of years left to learn that giving held even
greater joy than receiving.

University.) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   There is nothing like a trip overseas to remind us how much we
are Americans. And to witness how Christmas has spread to other
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I, married this past summer, visited Taiwan
recently. As we traveled through the country, we saw how different
we are from our cousins, as well as how Christmas has translated
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, Taiwan has become very much like the United
States. We could not avoid the fast food restaurants with familiar
logos and menus, the 7-Eleven convenience stores on every corner in
the city, and advertisements for the movie ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Taiwan remains its own society. The sight of hundreds of
motorcycles and scooters lined up at intersections during rush
hour, the sounds of the Mandarin Chinese conversations, the smell
of tofu sold by street vendors, all contrast with even the busy
crowds of America's Chinatowns. You would not mistake Taipei, with
its three million inhabitants, for New York City or Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   As we walked around, we could not help but realize how much we
were tourists. While we looked like everyone else, it didn't take
long for everyone else to recognize that we somehow didn't belong.
We didn't know the customs and could barely speak the language.
Many people eventually asked, ``where are you from?''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have a notion of ``overseas'' Chinese, a global
diaspora that remains essentially Chinese no matter where its
location. To them, I am an ``ABC,'' an ``American Born Chinese,''
or in a Chinese phrase, someone who is ``over the bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Their idea that we are bound together across generations and
geography is literally foreign to the United States. In the New
World, we imagine that all of us are able to claim our own
identity, that the race does not overwhelm the individual.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, who is a third generation Japanese American, was
especially puzzling. Some people guessed, perhaps based on vague
stereotypes about facial features, that she was of Japanese
ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   As Dec. 25 draws near, the Taiwanese are preparing for
Christmas. Many thousands are converts to Christianity. For them,
the season has special meaning.
</P>
<P>
   For most Taiwanese, however, Christmas is simply another ritual
borrowed from Western civilization. They may have the day off from
work. A few will exchange token gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But Lunar New Year, which falls in February of next year, is a
much more important occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The major hotels, which have more Western business travelers
than native Taiwanese vacationers as guests, all had holiday
decorations. Where we stayed, several Santa Clauses strolled
through the lobby ringing bells; tinsel hung from the ceiling; and
a gingerbread house graced the hallway. But their celebration was
the secular version, abbreviated to ``Xmas'' on their banners; it
was as devoid of religious significance as American Christmas now
often seems.
</P>
<P>
   We also visited the east coast, where there is a spectacular
series of gorges, and which explains why the Dutch called the
colony Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
</P>
<P>
   Though a recent typhoon had damaged some of the roads, the
resort was still open. And the signs of Christmas were no less
subtle: They blared German classical carols all day long. Christmas
good cheer had carried over.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be the same as firecrackers and the red envelopes
of money for the Lunar New Year, but the trappings of Christmas
inspire people to be friendly and festive.
</P>
<P>
   The adaptation of Christmas in Taiwan shows how a new
international culture is developing. It blends parts of various
traditions, mixing and matching, weaving them together _ sometimes
with more sincerity than success.
</P>
<P>
   As for us? Returning to the United States, we are planning to
spend the weekend putting up a real tree, roasting chestnuts as our
mothers did when we were children, and writing our cards to family
and friends in front of a blazing fire.

Notre Dame/St. Mary's College, and serves on the board of directors

</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone knows the story of Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer. The 1939 Christmas classic, written by Robert L. May,
tells the tale of a good, little reindeer, teased by his peers for
his unusual bright red nose and not allowed to ``play in any
reindeer games.'' Rudolph gets a chance to prove himself, however,
when Santa Claus chooses him to lead the sleigh through the fog,
one special Christmas Eve Night.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in the form of story or song, Rudolph is primarily a
children's parable. Like all good parables, it teaches us _
children and adults alike _ important lessons about life. What,
then, does a closer reading of Rudolph teach us about being gay?
</P>
<P>
   Well, like ``poor, little Rudolph'' gay people know what being
different is all about. We can relate: we've cried, too, as
children, when ``all of the other reindeer used to laugh and call''
us ``names.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of us still get called ugly names. Others fare far worse,
the victims of anti-gay violence. Even as adults we still feel like
Rudolph because we are not yet permitted to participate in the
institutions of civil marriage and the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Rudolph, though, whose difference was visible, our
differing sexual orientation was primarily invisible during
childhood and early adolescence. Whereas he stood out, we had not
yet come out of the closet. Like Rudolph, though, many of us knew
we were different; and we knew that at least some of the other
reindeer sensed that difference, too.
</P>
<P>
   But being different did not dampen Rudolph's holiday spirits.
Though ridiculed, rejected, and lonesome, Rudolph ``always was
good, obeying his parents as good reindeer should!''
</P>
<P>
   That's how it is for gay people, growing up, feeling different,
yet trying hard to fit in. There is an adult book on this subject,
too, called ``The Best Little Boy in the World.'' Published in
1973, it tells the real-life story of one gay man. The book is
all-about coming to terms with being gay and being good when the
rest of the world says you are not.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rudolph is luckier than some gay reindeer. His parents truly
love him. This unconditional parental love is illustrated vividly
in my storybook by one picture where Rudolph's mother kisses him on
his shiny red nose _ with a doting father at their side.
</P>
<P>
   In real life gay people are not always so lucky. Rarely is our
differing sexual orientation so readily accepted or understood by
our parents, although some good families eventually come around to
full acceptance. When the holiday season rolls around this time of
year, for many of us those lonely and painful Rudolph-like feelings
_ being shunned and cast outside the reindeer fold _ often surface
unexpectedly. In the worst cases, our families of origin have long
ago abandoned us _ simply for being gay. In other cases, the
stress, loneliness, financial worries, dead-end or lost jobs,
broken relationships, and loved ones lost to AIDS pile up, one on
top of the other, making the holiday season a matter more of
survival than of celebration.
</P>
<P>
   In Rudolph even Santa Claus becomes ``filled with gloom,''
overwhelmed at first by the various and demanding tasks of
Christmas preparation. The gray skies and darkness, however, did
not stop Santa, who worried about how to get his sleigh through the
fog and recognized the potential in Rudolph's unusual bright red
nose.
</P>
<P>
   When given the chance to prove himself, our hero Rudolph comes
out of the closet on the job the minute Santa hires him for that
special work assignment on Christmas Eve. It's all right here in
the story:
</P>
<P>
   ``So Rudolph pranced out through the door, very gay,
</P>
<P>
   And took his proud place at the head of the sleigh.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the night ... well, what would you guess?
</P>
<P>
   Old Santa's idea was a brilliant success.
</P>
<P>
   And brilliant was almost no word for the way
</P>
<P>
   That Rudolph directed the deer and the sleigh.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the fog, they flew quickly and low,
</P>
<P>
   And made such good use of the wonderful glow.''
</P>
<P>
   In the make-believe world of reindeer and rhymes, a bearded, old
white man, dressed in a funny red suit, sees the worth of the
wonderful glow, giving one good, gay reindeer a chance to use his
difference for everyone's benefit.
</P>
<P>
   It's Rudolph who makes Christmas possible ``for good little
animals, good girls and boys.'' By the end of the story, all the
other reindeer come around to respect him and prize his special
talents for the holiday task at hand. That's why the other reindeer
``shouted out with glee: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, you'll go
down in history.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be this way in real life, too. There are lots of
Rudolph's out there.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    The pinata, a Mexican invention, is specially designed for
Christmas. It can be found everywhere in the Southwest, where it
preceded the Anglo-Saxon Christmas tree in the former Mexican
territories of Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah
and California.
 &HT;    And, following the path of Mexican immigrants to the Midwest,
the Southeast and even New York City, the ubiquitous Mexican pinata
has surfaced everywhere and is fast becoming part of the American
culture of birthday parties and Christmas celebrations.
 &HT;    So, what is a pinata? In Mexico, the pinata is an `olla' (a clay
pot) that is covered over with gaily painted paper mache in the
form of animals, stars, birds and cartoon characters. In the clay
pot are candies, fruit, nuts and sometimes even small toys.
 &HT;    At the party, the pinata is tied to an overhanging rope that is
controlled by someone at each end pulling it in different
directions. A child is blindfolded and given a stick with which to
swing at the forever moving and manipulated `Big Bird' or `Star of
Bethlehem.' Onlooking partygoers hoot and holler, yelling
encouragement to the child blindly flailing at the evasive swinging
pinata.
 &HT;    Children stand ready to pounce on the candy and goodies when
their blindfolded sibling, cousin or friend makes a `hit,' cracking
open the pinata. The candy and toys spill out to the delight of all
the children who dive for the goodies.
 &HT;    On America's southern border and in the United States, the
pinata and its use has been transformed as it moved north. Tijuana,
Mexico, probably the most visited tourist city in the world, is
also, probably, the pinata capitol of the world. In Tijuana,
efficiency, mass marketing and costs have changed the pinata into
an all paper mache creature that mirrors American pop culture far
more than Mexican culture of old.
 &HT;    Donald Duck, Daffy Duck, Mickey Mouse, Bernie, Big Bird, the
good ship Titanic, Navy jet-fighter planes, glittery disco-style
balls and myriad other contemporary pop icons abound on the streets
of Tijuana and in the pinata markets where thousands of pinatas
hang from ceilings. They are hand-made by Indians in their shacks,
Indians who have moved to Tijuana from the interior of Mexico for
work and a better life. A cottage industry in Tijuana, it employs
as many as 5,000 people, mostly women and children. They wholesale
for a dollar or two, retail for $4 to $10.
 &HT;    U.S. Customs reports that as many as 10,000 pinatas are declared
by individuals every day at Christmas time and bona fide importers
bring across up to 25,000 a day for commercial sale in
Mexican-oriented shops and mainstream American supermarkets.
 &HT;    We know what a pinata is, how they are used and we know that
they are used thoughout Mexico and now widely in the United States.
But, a pinata didn't just spring from a corn field.
 &HT;    It's chief role is in ``las posadas,'' Christmas celebrations of
Spanish-America that start in early December and run through the
``Dia de Los Reyes,'' Day of the Three Kings on Jan. 6, the
traditional day that children receive their toys.
 &HT;    The ``posadas'' are easy to stage. A boy plays the role of
Joseph and a girl that of Mary, the mother-to-be of the baby Jesus.
Family and neighbors follow the costumed boy and girl, the Holy
Family, as they go from house to house singing the question, ``Do
you have room in the inn?'' They are answered by other participants
from behind closed doors who sing back ``no,'' until finally Joseph
and Mary settle in a stable. Lots of songs, lots of singing.
 &HT;    In America, the posadas aren't as ubiquitous as they once were
as Mexicans become more assimilated. Energies are directed more to
the Christmas feast _ tamales (corn meal, stuffed with pork or
chicken and salsa, wrapped in corn shucks and steamed), bacalao (a
dish brought from the `Old World' Spain, made from dried codfish,
olive oil, tomatoes, onions, garlic, olives and herbs) and other
delicacies that are time consuming to make _ and to the family
gatherings on Christmas Eve and the overflowing Roman Catholic
midnight Mass.
 &HT;    Christmas Eve, rather than Christmas Day, remains the core of
the Mexican and Mexican American Christmas, when gifts are
exchanged and Christmas dinner is served. In Mexico, children
receive all their presents then, except for toys, which they
receive on Jan. 6.
 &HT;    So, how does a pinata fit into the feasts of food, Midnight
mass, presents, the German Christmas tree, the English fruit cake
and mistletoe?
 &HT;    Professor John O. West of the University of Texas, El Paso,
wrote in his ``Mexican American Folklore'' about the origin of the
pinata:
 &HT;    ``One parish priest noted that the pinata ... is just something
the Mexican people threw in for the kids ... They added the pinata
to try to get kids to come to the celebration and maybe learn
something about the true meaning of Christmas.''
 &HT;    Worked for me.

good ship Titanic, Navy jet-fighter planes, glittery disco-style
balls and myriad other contemporary pop icons abound on the streets
of Tijuana and in the pinata markets where thousands of pinatas
hang from ceilings. They are hand-made by Indians in their shacks,
Indians who have moved to Tijuana from the interior of Mexico for
work and a better life. A cottage industry in Tijuana, it employs
as many as 5,000 people, mostly women and children. They wholesale
for a dollar or two, retail for $4 to $10.
 &HT;    U.S. Customs reports that as many as 10,000 pinatas are declared
by individuals every day at Christmas time and bona fide importers
bring across up to 25,000 a day for commercial sale in
Mexican-oriented shops and mainstream American supermarkets.
 &HT;    We know what a pinata is, how they are used and we know that
they are used thoughout Mexico and now widely in the United States.
But, a pinata didn't just spring from a corn field.
 &HT;    It's chief role is in ``las posadas,'' Christmas celebrations of
Spanish-America that start in early December and run through the
``Dia de Los Reyes,'' Day of the Three Kings on Jan. 6, the
traditional day that children receive their toys.
 &HT;    The ``posadas'' are easy to stage. A boy plays the role of
Joseph and a girl that of Mary, the mother-to-be of the baby Jesus.
Family and neighbors follow the costumed boy and girl, the Holy
Family, as they go from house to house singing the question, ``Do
you have room in the inn?'' They are answered by other participants
from behind closed doors who sing back ``no,'' until finally Joseph
and Mary settle in a stable. Lots of songs, lots of singing.
 &HT;    In America, the posadas aren't as ubiquitous as they once were
as Mexicans become more assimilated. Energies are directed more to
the Christmas feast _ tamales (corn meal, stuffed with pork or
chicken and salsa, wrapped in corn shucks and steamed), bacalao (a
dish brought from the `Old World' Spain, made from dried codfish,
olive oil, tomatoes, onions, garlic, olives and herbs) and other
delicacies that are time consuming to make _ and to the family
gatherings on Christmas Eve and the overflowing Roman Catholic
midnight Mass.
 &HT;    Christmas Eve, rather than Christmas Day, remains the core of
the Mexican and Mexican American Christmas, when gifts are
exchanged and Christmas dinner is served. In Mexico, children
receive all their presents then, except for toys, which they
receive on Jan. 6.
 &HT;    So, how does a pinata fit into the feasts of food, Midnight
mass, presents, the German Christmas tree, the English fruit cake
and mistletoe?
 &HT;    Professor John O. West of the University of Texas, El Paso,
wrote in his ``Mexican American Folklore'' about the origin of the
pinata:
 &HT;    ``One parish priest noted that the pinata ... is just something
the Mexican people threw in for the kids ... They added the pinata
to try to get kids to come to the celebration and maybe learn
something about the true meaning of Christmas.''
 &HT;    Worked for me.

 By RAOUL LOWERY CONTRERAS 
 &HT;    (Raoul Lowery Contreras, Mexican American, is a columnist and
editorial board member of La Prensa San Diego. He hosts his own
radio talk show on KOGO-AM.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The pinata, a Mexican invention, is specially designed for
Christmas. It can be found everywhere in the Southwest, where it
preceded the Anglo-Saxon Christmas tree in the former Mexican
territories of Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah
and California.
 &HT;    And, following the path of Mexican immigrants to the Midwest,
the Southeast and even New York City, the ubiquitous Mexican pinata
has surfaced everywhere and is fast becoming part of the American
culture of birthday parties and Christmas celebrations.
 &HT;    So, what is a pinata? In Mexico, the pinata is an `olla' (a clay
pot) that is covered over with gaily painted paper mache in the
form of animals, stars, birds and cartoon characters. In the clay
pot are candies, fruit, nuts and sometimes even small toys.
 &HT;    At the party, the pinata is tied to an overhanging rope that is
controlled by someone at each end pulling it in different
directions. A child is blindfolded and given a stick with which to
swing at the forever moving and manipulated `Big Bird' or `Star of
Bethlehem.' Onlooking partygoers hoot and holler, yelling
encouragement to the child blindly flailing at the evasive swinging
pinata.
 &HT;    Children stand ready to pounce on the candy and goodies when
their blindfolded sibling, cousin or friend makes a `hit,' cracking
open the pinata. The candy and toys spill out to the delight of all
the children who dive for the goodies.
 &HT;    On America's southern border and in the United States, the
pinata and its use has been transformed as it moved north. Tijuana,
Mexico, probably the most visited tourist city in the world, is
also, probably, the pinata capitol of the world. In Tijuana,
efficiency, mass marketing and costs have changed the pinata into
an all paper mache creature that mirrors American pop culture far
more than Mexican culture of old.
 &HT;    Donald Duck, Daffy Duck, Mickey Mouse, Bernie, Big Bird, the
good ship Titanic, Navy jet-fighter planes, glittery disco-style
balls and myriad other contemporary pop icons abound on the streets
of Tijuana and in the pinata markets where thousands of pinatas
hang from ceilings. They are hand-made by Indians in their shacks,
Indians who have moved to Tijuana from the interior of Mexico for
work and a better life. A cottage industry in Tijuana, it employs

GAY RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER

 By CHUCK COLBERT 
 &HT;    (Chuck Colbert is a founder of the Gay and Lesbian Alumni of
Notre Dame/St. Mary's College, and serves on the board of directors
of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Almost everyone knows the story of Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer. The 1939 Christmas classic, written by Robert L. May,
tells the tale of a good, little reindeer, teased by his peers for
his unusual bright red nose and not allowed to ``play in any
reindeer games.'' Rudolph gets a chance to prove himself, however,
when Santa Claus chooses him to lead the sleigh through the fog,
one special Christmas Eve Night.
 &HT;    Whether in the form of story or song, Rudolph is primarily a
children's parable. Like all good parables, it teaches us _
children and adults alike _ important lessons about life. What,
then, does a closer reading of Rudolph teach us about being gay?
 &HT;    Well, like ``poor, little Rudolph'' gay people know what being
different is all about. We can relate: we've cried, too, as
children, when ``all of the other reindeer used to laugh and call''
us ``names.''
 &HT;    Some of us still get called ugly names. Others fare far worse,
the victims of anti-gay violence. Even as adults we still feel like
Rudolph because we are not yet permitted to participate in the
institutions of civil marriage and the armed forces.
 &HT;    Unlike Rudolph, though, whose difference was visible, our
differing sexual orientation was primarily invisible during
childhood and early adolescence. Whereas he stood out, we had not
yet come out of the closet. Like Rudolph, though, many of us knew
we were different; and we knew that at least some of the other
reindeer sensed that difference, too.
 &HT;    But being different did not dampen Rudolph's holiday spirits.
Though ridiculed, rejected, and lonesome, Rudolph ``always was
good, obeying his parents as good reindeer should!''
 &HT;    That's how it is for gay people, growing up, feeling different,
yet trying hard to fit in. There is an adult book on this subject,
too, called ``The Best Little Boy in the World.'' Published in
1973, it tells the real-life story of one gay man. The book is
all-about coming to terms with being gay and being good when the
rest of the world says you are not.
 &HT;    Now Rudolph is luckier than some gay reindeer. His parents truly
love him. This unconditional parental love is illustrated vividly
in my storybook by one picture where Rudolph's mother kisses him on
his shiny red nose _ with a doting father at their side.
 &HT;    In real life gay people are not always so lucky. Rarely is our
differing sexual orientation so readily accepted or understood by
our parents, although some good families eventually come around to
full acceptance. When the holiday season rolls around this time of
year, for many of us those lonely and painful Rudolph-like feelings
_ being shunned and cast outside the reindeer fold _ often surface
unexpectedly. In the worst cases, our families of origin have long
ago abandoned us _ simply for being gay. In other cases, the
stress, loneliness, financial worries, dead-end or lost jobs,
broken relationships, and loved ones lost to AIDS pile up, one on
top of the other, making the holiday season a matter more of
survival than of celebration.
 &HT;    In Rudolph even Santa Claus becomes ``filled with gloom,''
overwhelmed at first by the various and demanding tasks of
Christmas preparation. The gray skies and darkness, however, did
not stop Santa, who worried about how to get his sleigh through the
fog and recognized the potential in Rudolph's unusual bright red
nose.
 &HT;    When given the chance to prove himself, our hero Rudolph comes
out of the closet on the job the minute Santa hires him for that
special work assignment on Christmas Eve. It's all right here in
the story:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``So Rudolph pranced out through the door, very gay,
 &HT;    And took his proud place at the head of the sleigh.''
 &HT;    The rest of the night ... well, what would you guess?
 &HT;    Old Santa's idea was a brilliant success.
 &HT;    And brilliant was almost no word for the way
 &HT;    That Rudolph directed the deer and the sleigh.
 &HT;    In spite of the fog, they flew quickly and low,
 &HT;    And made such good use of the wonderful glow.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the make-believe world of reindeer and rhymes, a bearded, old
white man, dressed in a funny red suit, sees the worth of the
wonderful glow, giving one good, gay reindeer a chance to use his
difference for everyone's benefit.
 &HT;    It's Rudolph who makes Christmas possible ``for good little
animals, good girls and boys.'' By the end of the story, all the
other reindeer come around to respect him and prize his special
talents for the holiday task at hand. That's why the other reindeer
``shouted out with glee: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, you'll go
down in history.''
 &HT;    It should be this way in real life, too. There are lots of
Rudolph's out there.

 &HT;    Now Rudolph is luckier than some gay reindeer. His parents truly
love him. This unconditional parental love is illustrated vividly
in my storybook by one picture where Rudolph's mother kisses him on
his shiny red nose _ with a doting father at their side.
 &HT;    In real life gay people are not always so lucky. Rarely is our
differing sexual orientation so readily accepted or understood by
our parents, although some good families eventually come around to
full acceptance. When the holiday season rolls around this time of
year, for many of us those lonely and painful Rudolph-like feelings
_ being shunned and cast outside the reindeer fold _ often surface
unexpectedly. In the worst cases, our families of origin have long
ago abandoned us _ simply for being gay. In other cases, the
stress, loneliness, financial worries, dead-end or lost jobs,
broken relationships, and loved ones lost to AIDS pile up, one on
top of the other, making the holiday season a matter more of
survival than of celebration.
 &HT;    In Rudolph even Santa Claus becomes ``filled with gloom,''
overwhelmed at first by the various and demanding tasks of
Christmas preparation. The gray skies and darkness, however, did
not stop Santa, who worried about how to get his sleigh through the
fog and recognized the potential in Rudolph's unusual bright red
nose.
 &HT;    When given the chance to prove himself, our hero Rudolph comes
out of the closet on the job the minute Santa hires him for that
special work assignment on Christmas Eve. It's all right here in
the story:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``So Rudolph pranced out through the door, very gay,
 &HT;    And took his proud place at the head of the sleigh.''
 &HT;    The rest of the night ... well, what would you guess?
 &HT;    Old Santa's idea was a brilliant success.
 &HT;    And brilliant was almost no word for the way
 &HT;    That Rudolph directed the deer and the sleigh.
 &HT;    In spite of the fog, they flew quickly and low,
 &HT;    And made such good use of the wonderful glow.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the make-believe world of reindeer and rhymes, a bearded, old
white man, dressed in a funny red suit, sees the worth of the
wonderful glow, giving one good, gay reindeer a chance to use his
difference for everyone's benefit.
 &HT;    It's Rudolph who makes Christmas possible ``for good little
animals, good girls and boys.'' By the end of the story, all the
other reindeer come around to respect him and prize his special
talents for the holiday task at hand. That's why the other reindeer
``shouted out with glee: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, you'll go
down in history.''
 &HT;    It should be this way in real life, too. There are lots of
Rudolph's out there.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    There is nothing like a trip overseas to remind us how much we
are Americans. And to witness how Christmas has spread to other
cultures.
 &HT;    My wife and I, married this past summer, visited Taiwan
recently. As we traveled through the country, we saw how different
we are from our cousins, as well as how Christmas has translated
abroad.
 &HT;    In many respects, Taiwan has become very much like the United
States. We could not avoid the fast food restaurants with familiar
logos and menus, the 7-Eleven convenience stores on every corner in
the city, and advertisements for the movie ``Titanic.''
 &HT;    Yet Taiwan remains its own society. The sight of hundreds of
motorcycles and scooters lined up at intersections during rush
hour, the sounds of the Mandarin Chinese conversations, the smell
of tofu sold by street vendors, all contrast with even the busy
crowds of America's Chinatowns. You would not mistake Taipei, with
its three million inhabitants, for New York City or Los Angeles.
 &HT;    As we walked around, we could not help but realize how much we
were tourists. While we looked like everyone else, it didn't take
long for everyone else to recognize that we somehow didn't belong.
We didn't know the customs and could barely speak the language.
Many people eventually asked, ``where are you from?''
 &HT;    The Chinese have a notion of ``overseas'' Chinese, a global
diaspora that remains essentially Chinese no matter where its
location. To them, I am an ``ABC,'' an ``American Born Chinese,''
or in a Chinese phrase, someone who is ``over the bridge.''
 &HT;    Their idea that we are bound together across generations and
geography is literally foreign to the United States. In the New
World, we imagine that all of us are able to claim our own
identity, that the race does not overwhelm the individual.
 &HT;    My wife, who is a third generation Japanese American, was
especially puzzling. Some people guessed, perhaps based on vague
stereotypes about facial features, that she was of Japanese
ancestry.
 &HT;    As Dec. 25 draws near, the Taiwanese are preparing for
Christmas. Many thousands are converts to Christianity. For them,
the season has special meaning.
 &HT;    For most Taiwanese, however, Christmas is simply another ritual
borrowed from Western civilization. They may have the day off from
work. A few will exchange token gifts.
 &HT;    But Lunar New Year, which falls in February of next year, is a
much more important occasion.
 &HT;    The major hotels, which have more Western business travelers
than native Taiwanese vacationers as guests, all had holiday
decorations. Where we stayed, several Santa Clauses strolled
through the lobby ringing bells; tinsel hung from the ceiling; and
a gingerbread house graced the hallway. But their celebration was
the secular version, abbreviated to ``Xmas'' on their banners; it
was as devoid of religious significance as American Christmas now
often seems.
 &HT;    We also visited the east coast, where there is a spectacular
series of gorges, and which explains why the Dutch called the
colony Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
 &HT;    Though a recent typhoon had damaged some of the roads, the
resort was still open. And the signs of Christmas were no less
subtle: They blared German classical carols all day long. Christmas
good cheer had carried over.
 &HT;    It might not be the same as firecrackers and the red envelopes
of money for the Lunar New Year, but the trappings of Christmas
inspire people to be friendly and festive.
 &HT;    The adaptation of Christmas in Taiwan shows how a new
international culture is developing. It blends parts of various
traditions, mixing and matching, weaving them together _ sometimes
with more sincerity than success.
 &HT;    As for us? Returning to the United States, we are planning to
spend the weekend putting up a real tree, roasting chestnuts as our
mothers did when we were children, and writing our cards to family
and friends in front of a blazing fire.

 By TIM GIAGO (Nanwica Kciji) 
 &HT;    (Tim Giago, Lakota Indian, is publisher and editor-in-chief of
Indian Country Today. His Indian name is Nanwica Kciji.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Do Indians celebrate Christmas? Most of us Indians have been
asked that question at some point in our lifetime.
 &HT;    Let me respond from my perspective.
 &HT;    The celebration of Christmas was one Christian holiday that fit
very comfortably into the lifestyles of the Indian people.
 &HT;    We seldom visited friends or relatives without taking gifts.
When tribal leaders met for a conference, or a pow wow as the white
man calls it, they always began with an exchange of gifts.
 &HT;    When a young Indian seriously courted a young lady and wanted to
ask her to be his mate and companion, he gave gifts to her parents.
 &HT;    I recall attending a meeting many years ago when Ada Deer, who
would later become assistant secretary of Indian Affairs in the
Clinton administration, was standing at the podium about to give a
speech. Any of us old timers (male) would surely tell you that Ada
was an extremely beautiful Menominee woman. Of course, she is still
beautiful. Just prior to her speech she heard three Lakota men
seated at a nearby table comment, ``I would give one dozen horses
for that one.'' Horses, of course, were the most valued of gifts.
 &HT;    Creating and hanging beautiful decorations during Christmas also
fit into the ancient lifestyles of the American Indian. Every
longhouse, hogan, or tipi was decorated with various items of the
cultural creations of each tribe during special occasions. The
exterior of the tipis of the Plains Indians were often painted with
beautiful scenes of buffalo, horses and eagles.
 &HT;    Preparing sumptuous feasts for special occasions was also very
much a part of the Indian culture. At weddings, wakes, or to
commemorate a special day, great feasts were prepared.
 &HT;    Tribal people would travel for many miles to attend these
feasts. They would bring their leather pouches to take home
``wateca,'' food that was left over after the feast concluded. We
often joke amongst ourselves that in these modern times, some
Indian people show up with hubcaps for their wateca.
 &HT;    So, you see, it was very easy for the Christian missionaries to
impress the Christmas spirit upon the hearts and minds of the
Indian people. Especially after Indian missions were constructed on
Indian reservations across this land, where Indian children were
institutionalized for nine months of the year. It was at these
missions that we attended mass or other Christian services and we
were instructed in the teachings of the Bible.
 &HT;    After Indians began moving away from their reservations to
attend college, join the military, or to take jobs in other states,
many Indian families took advantage of the vacation days offered by
the holiday to return home to the reservations and to, once again,
be with their family and friends. And so, Christmas became a time
of family reunions. This was true across most of Indian country.
 &HT;    As many tribal people restored their traditional spiritual
beliefs _ practices that were at one time outlawed by the
government of the United States _ they took a new look at the
process that forced them to accept a religion not a part of their
traditions or culture.
 &HT;    They knew Christmas was a Christian holiday to celebrate the
birth of a Jewish baby named Jesus Christ; and there are many
Indians who have embraced Christianity as their own and are quite
comfortable celebrating the birth of Jesus as a significant
religious event.
 &HT;    Many Indian people, however, are returning to their traditional
spirituality. But I believe that although most will no longer look
upon Christianity as a part of their religious practice, they will
still continue to celebrate the holiday of Christmas as a time to
gather together as a family and to exchange gifts.
 &HT;    Many have already incorporated the custom of decorating their
homes as something that is fun to do and beautiful to look at, so I
believe this Christian practice will continue to be a part of what
Christmas means to Indian people today.
 &HT;    Honoring Tanka (the Lakota words for Great Spirit) is something
most traditional Indians do every day.
 &HT;    There is no single day set aside for this. Wakan Tanka was
always here. He is timeless. There is no day set aside to honor his
birth.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, I would like to wish people of all religious
beliefs _ Jews, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and others _
Peace On Earth!

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Do Indians celebrate Christmas? Most of us Indians have been
asked that question at some point in our lifetime.
 &HT;    Let me respond from my perspective.
 &HT;    The celebration of Christmas was one Christian holiday that fit
very comfortably into the lifestyles of the Indian people.
 &HT;    We seldom visited friends or relatives without taking gifts.
When tribal leaders met for a conference, or a pow wow as the white
man calls it, they always began with an exchange of gifts.
 &HT;    When a young Indian seriously courted a young lady and wanted to
ask her to be his mate and companion, he gave gifts to her parents.
 &HT;    I recall attending a meeting many years ago when Ada Deer, who
would later become assistant secretary of Indian Affairs in the
Clinton administration, was standing at the podium about to give a
speech. Any of us old timers (male) would surely tell you that Ada
was an extremely beautiful Menominee woman. Of course, she is still
beautiful. Just prior to her speech she heard three Lakota men
seated at a nearby table comment, ``I would give one dozen horses
for that one.'' Horses, of course, were the most valued of gifts.
 &HT;    Creating and hanging beautiful decorations during Christmas also
fit into the ancient lifestyles of the American Indian. Every
longhouse, hogan, or tipi was decorated with various items of the
cultural creations of each tribe during special occasions. The
exterior of the tipis of the Plains Indians were often painted with
beautiful scenes of buffalo, horses and eagles.
 &HT;    Preparing sumptuous feasts for special occasions was also very
much a part of the Indian culture. At weddings, wakes, or to
commemorate a special day, great feasts were prepared.
 &HT;    Tribal people would travel for many miles to attend these
feasts. They would bring their leather pouches to take home
``wateca,'' food that was left over after the feast concluded. We
often joke amongst ourselves that in these modern times, some
Indian people show up with hubcaps for their wateca.
 &HT;    So, you see, it was very easy for the Christian missionaries to
impress the Christmas spirit upon the hearts and minds of the
Indian people. Especially after Indian missions were constructed on
Indian reservations across this land, where Indian children were
institutionalized for nine months of the year. It was at these
missions that we attended mass or other Christian services and we
were instructed in the teachings of the Bible.
 &HT;    After Indians began moving away from their reservations to
attend college, join the military, or to take jobs in other states,
many Indian families took advantage of the vacation days offered by
the holiday to return home to the reservations and to, once again,
be with their family and friends. And so, Christmas became a time
of family reunions. This was true across most of Indian country.
 &HT;    As many tribal people restored their traditional spiritual
beliefs _ practices that were at one time outlawed by the
government of the United States _ they took a new look at the
process that forced them to accept a religion not a part of their
traditions or culture.
 &HT;    They knew Christmas was a Christian holiday to celebrate the
birth of a Jewish baby named Jesus Christ; and there are many
Indians who have embraced Christianity as their own and are quite
comfortable celebrating the birth of Jesus as a significant
religious event.
 &HT;    Many Indian people, however, are returning to their traditional
spirituality. But I believe that although most will no longer look
upon Christianity as a part of their religious practice, they will
still continue to celebrate the holiday of Christmas as a time to
gather together as a family and to exchange gifts.
 &HT;    Many have already incorporated the custom of decorating their
homes as something that is fun to do and beautiful to look at, so I
believe this Christian practice will continue to be a part of what
Christmas means to Indian people today.
 &HT;    Honoring Tanka (the Lakota words for Great Spirit) is something
most traditional Indians do every day.
 &HT;    There is no single day set aside for this. Wakan Tanka was
always here. He is timeless. There is no day set aside to honor his
birth.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, I would like to wish people of all religious
beliefs _ Jews, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and others _
Peace On Earth!

 &HT;    
 &HT;    As a child I never had peaches that were not from a can and
packed in syrup. Likewise our Christmas tree was not green unless
the color wheel was passing the green segment and reflected on the
aluminum Christmas tree.
 &HT;    I never understood the drama of purchasing and decorating a
Christmas tree. When my family was ready for the tree, we simply
removed the box from the storage area, set up the pole and inserted
the branches in their matching color coded slots. We didn't have
special ornaments, just multicolored metal balls. But culturally,
in our community, that's how everyone decorated for Christmas.
 &HT;    I don't recall ever believing in Santa Claus because we never
had a chimney. Our presents, which were plentiful were all neatly
wrapped under the aluminum tree with name tags clearly marked
``to'' and ``from.''
 &HT;    I grew up until the age of 11, in an African American (then
`black' or sometimes still `Negro' or `colored') middle-class
household originally in Kansas and then in Alabama. I do recall
seeing Santa at a shopping center, but not being allowed to
approach, make requests or stand in line because that was reserved
for ``whites only.''
 &HT;    So maybe it wasn't so much the lack of a chimney but rather
segregation that caused me not to believe in Mr. Claus. I do recall
seeing black Santa Clauses but I knew that they were fake because
all of the images in print or in the movies were of white Santa
Clauses.
 &HT;    Maybe I thought that the notion of wanting a ``white Christmas''
was just that, a Christmas for whites only. Certainly at that time,
George Wallace, the governor of Alabama, would have wished for such
a white Christmas.
 &HT;    But then a scant nine years after my birth, Kwanzaa was created,
in 1966 to be exact. I probably wasn't immediately aware of its
existence, but when I first heard of it, it was referred to as the
``black Christmas'' Surely this was invented in the segregated
south, where for so long there had only been ``white Christmases.''
At age 19 I moved to New York and learned more about this ``black
Christmas.'' But it wasn't really a ``black Christmas'' despite the
fact that it was celebrated by and invented by and for African
Americans. And it hadn't been invented in the south, but rather in
California.
 &HT;    But now as our societies and communities become more
multicultural and cross-cultural we all celebrate numerous holidays
in December even those historically or originally reserved for
ethnicities other than our own. There is Hanukkah, Winter Solstice,
Christmas, and Kwanzaa all usually in the second half of December.
 &HT;    I regularly get invited to Hanukkah gatherings and I am never
the only non-Jewish person there. Christmas is not relegated to the
Christians anymore, and it is a cultural phenomenon unto itself
replete with all its commercialism.
 &HT;    And now, Kwanzaa is constantly being attacked for being
separatist and even worst, black nationalist. But, at the last few
celebrations I have attended there have been quite a few
non-African Americans present.
 &HT;    I do not see Kwanzaa, a Swahili word meaning ``first fruit'' as
separatist or promoting black nationalism. Rather, I celebrate
Kwanzaa as a nod to my African roots. An acknowledgment that I am
of African descent despite the fact that I do not know from which
country in that vast continent I am from. In many ways this is why
Kwanzaa is so attractive to me. That it borrows from numerous
African cultures is appropriate to the nonspecificity of the
cultural and ethnic heritage of most African Americans. There is
cultural pride in Jewish holidays, Irish holidays, and so the
descendants of the African diaspora should also have and celebrate
cultural pride.
 &HT;    Kwanzaa has seven principles which many of us try to embody year
round and not just during the seven days of Kwanzaa, Dec. 26 to
Jan. 1. Umoja/unity, Kujichagulia/self-determination,
Ujima/collective work, Ujamaa/cooperative economics, Nia/purpose,
Kuumba/creativity, and Imani/faith. The symbols of Kwanzaa are
representative of the history and future of African Americans,
those of race, bloodshed and struggle, family, and hope.
 &HT;    Now in its third decade of celebration, Kwanzaa is recognized by
more than the 18 million who celebrate it annually. Last year the
United States Post Office honored Kwanzaa with a stamp. Hallmark
sells Kwanzaa cards and many media outlets mention Kwanzaa in the
same breath as Hanukkah and Christmas.
 &HT;    But after my painful beginnings of ``white'' Christmases, it is
liberating and joyful to celebrate Kwanzaa and to have public
recognition of it. So many images in the media beyond Santa Claus
are white and exclusive and not reflective of people of color.
 &HT;    I am an advocate of acknowledging and celebrating our
multicultural roots. So there is room for Hanukkah, Christmas, and
Kwanzaa. I will celebrate them all to various degrees, but Kwanzaa
is the one I feel most connected with.
 &HT;    So I simply wish everyone: ``Happy Holidays!''

 &HT;    Mr. Jose Marti, the customs agent, won't let me in. ``You don't
have a hotel or registered address while you visit Cuba,'' he
scolds me while I cool my sandals at the airport in Havana.
``You're a tourist, and we can't just let you stay anywhere you
want.''
 &HT;    But of course I did. After several hours of talking politics and
explaining why a Chicana from Texas decided to take the long way
from her mother's Mexico to visit Cuba, Mr. Marti and I became good
friends. As his black eyes glistened with old humiliation, he knew
that I knew his country was desperate for my dollars. He let me
pass.
 &HT;    So where's the white people, asks my friend, Gerald, whose
scheme it was to come here. Havana is like an American inner city
with Hispanic colonial arches instead of brownstones. There are
black people everywhere who seem poor by our standards, only here
they swallow my Spanish instead of English, so that the vowels are
gulped smoothly like my first mulata rum.
 &HT;    Slavery entered the new world through Cuba in 1513, and ended
almost 400 years later in 1886. ``We were not allowed in Habana
before the Revolution,'' my new Cuban friends tell me. Now they
hang their clothes to dry on the balconies of the palatial homes
that the Spanish descendants had to abandon after Castro's
takeover.
 &HT;    Cuba may be a Communist society, but it is free from billboards,
traffic jams and MTV in this self-made nation. There is no `Just Do
It' on the Malecon, the ocean-front boulevard that curves like a
rhumba dancer's hips to where you can almost touch the sky between
here and Miami. But then Cuba has already done it, hasn't she? Just
do it. The revolution happened. And it wasn't a dream.
 &HT;    ``People pick up guns when there is no hope left,'' the Cubans
tell me. Forty percent of them had no education at all before the
Revolution. Now 97 percent of the population can read. Didn't
George Washington rebel against foreign tyranny? ``The mafia and
the United States controlled Cuba during the Batista regime,'' they
tell me. They know that they have paid a high price for their
independence. During the ``Special Period,'' before the dollars of
tourism, they barely had one chicken to eat in a month. I tell them
that many children in the United States go hungry, but that the
rest of Americans are still fatter than ever. If that is the price
of our prosperity, then they don't want it, they say.
 &HT;    ``Is America a racist country,'' they ask me. ``Yes and no,'' I
answer. Yes, if you recognize that race is the reason we have
suffered as a nation, and no, if you have Black friends. Of course,
if you are a millionaire, race hardly matters.
 &HT;    My new friends tell me that they are afraid of what the Cuban
exiles will do, with America's support, if they ever return. But
the old Cuba, the one the exiles dream of, is gone forever.
 &HT;    In the United States we have the American dream, and that means
that we are free to watch television night after night, go
shopping, and forget about voting. Most of the Cubans I met hunger
for a conversation with a foreigner or a good book. A luxury for
them would be a taxi ride or a leotard for a daughter's dance
class. Here in the United States, one can get rich while children
go hungry, people sleep in the streets, and teenagers drop out of
high school. We have our choice of museums, symphonies and
theaters, but often they starve for visitors, while millions obsess
over football.
 &HT;    To me, Cuba and the United States each have a truth about
humanity, half of a heart that needs the other to become whole.
Can't we honor the paradox of freedom as we face our inevitable,
and mutual destiny?
 &HT;    As I departed from the airport, I ran into Jose Marti. ``Ay,
forgive me for thinking that you were named after the airport
dedicated to Cuba's greatest poet.'' I give him one of my
contraband cigars. He laughs and pretends to stamp my passport.
 &HT;    ``Tell the U.S. that the only blockade I fear, is the internal
one. That is the one that keeps us from being truly free.'' Jose
Marti taps his heart.
 &HT;    In America we agonize for the simple life, too much stuff, we
say, enslaved by our fashions, junkfood and a Christmas that begins
at Halloween.
 &HT;    Most of all, we ache for something that we can't name. I see it
in the faces of the crowds who have so many gifts and so little to
give. It is a season of love, but to find it, the Cubans taught me,
we will have to surrender our hearts to those we have not loved in
the past.

   CHRISTMAS IN THE SUNSHINE STATE. Christmas in Florida is a
tropical bazaar, writes columnist Bill Maxwell. ``As a native of
Fort Lauderdale, I am condemned to perpetual heat, humidity and
year-round greenery,'' he grumbles. As a child, he knew it was a
time for Jack Frost, hot chocolate, snow and snowmen, sleighs-bells
and sleds, carolers braving the freeze. ``But like most other South
Floridians, on Dec. 25 we can be seen fishing, golfing, tanning,
water-skiing, swimming, and drinking cold lemonade beneath
sprawling banyans,'' he says, with a smile.

   A HOLIDAY TREE FOR MY JEWISH HOME. Instead of a traditional
Jewish Menorah or Christian Christmas tree, columnist Linda Marx
and her non-Jewish husband have come up with a compromise. ``My
husband bought me a new Menorah which depicts the synagogues of
Europe in loving memory of lost communities,'' she writes.
Alongside the Menorah are Christmas and Hanukkah decorations. ``I
can't help but believe that my mother would understand that days
pass, years go by, and things change,'' she adds. ``We must live in
the present while remembering the past. It is the only way to
ensure our future.''

   A BOY'S GIFT FROM `SANTA.' Christmas couldn't always be left up
to parents. Sometimes an 8-year-old had to take matters into his
own hands, writes columnist Kirsten Chapman, especially when what
he wanted most was a Dick Tracy toy gun. After pursuing several
strategies in his quest to acquire it, her brother decided on a
novel approach: `Santa.' And much to the consternation of his
mother and father, he was successful!

   MEXICAN AMERICAN CHRISTMAS: THE PINATA RULES. The `pinata' can
be found everywhere in the Southwest, where it preceded the
Anglo-Saxon Christmas tree in the former Mexican territories,
explains columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras. ``Following the path of
Mexican immigrants to other areas, the pinata is fast becoming a
regular feature of American Christmas celebrations nationwide,'' he
writes. He tells you how they're made, by whom, what they're filled
with and what makes it so much fun to smash them!

   THE `HOLIDAYS' THEN AND NOW. As a child, columnist Akilah Monifa
thought a ``white Christmas'' was really for whites only. But in
1966 Kwanzaa _ often called the ``black Christmas'' _ was created.
Celebrated by more than the 18 million Americans annually, Kwanzaa
was featured on a U.S. Post Office stamp last year, and Hallmark is
selling Kwanzaa cards. ``So there is room for Hanukkah, Christmas,
and Kwanzaa,'' she writes. ``And I will celebrate them all to
various degrees, but Kwanzaa is the one I feel most connected
with.''

Christmas, Indians are often asked. ``Traditionally, we seldom

Gallego writes, ``and there were always feasts prepared for great
occasions, and tipis decorated for special events.'' So, he
explains, the celebration of Christmas was one Christian holiday
that fit very comfortably into the lifestyles of the Indian people.

Christmas has special meaning, notes columnist Frank Wu who
recently visited the country of his parents. But for most
Taiwanese, however, Christmas is simply another ritual borrowed
from Western civilization. ``There is nothing like a trip overseas
to remind us how much we are Americans. And to see how Christmas
has spread to other cultures,'' he writes.

   CHRISTMAS IN THE SUNSHINE STATE. Christmas in Florida is a
tropical bazaar, writes columnist Bill Maxwell. ``As a native of
Fort Lauderdale, I am condemned to perpetual heat, humidity and
year-round greenery,'' he grumbles. As a child, he knew it was a
time for Jack Frost, hot chocolate, snow and snowmen, sleighs-bells
and sleds, carolers braving the freeze. ``But like most other South
Floridians, on Dec. 25 we can be seen fishing, golfing, tanning,
water-skiing, swimming, and drinking cold lemonade beneath
sprawling banyans,'' he says, with a smile.

   A HOLIDAY TREE FOR MY JEWISH HOME. Instead of a traditional
Jewish Menorah or Christian Christmas tree, columnist Linda Marx
and her non-Jewish husband have come up with a compromise. ``My
husband bought me a new Menorah which depicts the synagogues of
Europe in loving memory of lost communities,'' she writes.
Alongside the Menorah are Christmas and Hanukkah decorations. ``I
can't help but believe that my mother would understand that days
pass, years go by, and things change,'' she adds. ``We must live in
the present while remembering the past. It is the only way to
ensure our future.''

   A BOY'S GIFT FROM `SANTA.' Christmas couldn't always be left up
to parents. Sometimes an 8-year-old had to take matters into his
own hands, writes columnist Kirsten Chapman, especially when what
he wanted most was a Dick Tracy toy gun. After pursuing several
strategies in his quest to acquire it, her brother decided on a
novel approach: `Santa.' And much to the consternation of his
mother and father, he was successful!

   MEXICAN AMERICAN CHRISTMAS: THE PINATA RULES. The `pinata' can
be found everywhere in the Southwest, where it preceded the
Anglo-Saxon Christmas tree in the former Mexican territories,
explains columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras. ``Following the path of
Mexican immigrants to other areas, the pinata is fast becoming a
regular feature of American Christmas celebrations nationwide,'' he
writes. He tells you how they're made, by whom, what they're filled
with and what makes it so much fun to smash them!

   THE `HOLIDAYS' THEN AND NOW. As a child, columnist Akilah Monifa
thought a ``white Christmas'' was really for whites only. But in
1966 Kwanzaa _ often called the ``black Christmas'' _ was created.
Celebrated by more than the 18 million Americans annually, Kwanzaa
was featured on a U.S. Post Office stamp last year, and Hallmark is
selling Kwanzaa cards. ``So there is room for Hanukkah, Christmas,
and Kwanzaa,'' she writes. ``And I will celebrate them all to
various degrees, but Kwanzaa is the one I feel most connected
with.''

explains, the celebration of Christmas was one Christian holiday
that fit very comfortably into the lifestyles of the Indian people.

from Western civilization. ``There is nothing like a trip overseas

A RAY OF ACHIEVEMENT FOR BOURQUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It took 10 minutes to play the final minute of Thursday
night's Bruins-Senators game. Half the delay was caused by
penalties. The other half was devoted to a salute from the
FleetCenter crowd for the hero of the festivities, Ray Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard flashed Bourque's grinning face and the crowd
reacted, cheering as loudly as they had at any time during the
preceding 59 minutes of action. His Bruins teammates slammed their
sticks against the boards approvingly and looked toward their
captain.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the 20-year veteran raised his stick and acknowledged
his fans, all 13,646 of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard all sorts of cheers here,'' he said afterward.
``Some for just stepping out on the ice and others for my wife
having a baby. It's always a thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque reached his first milestone when he stepped on the ice
for the opening faceoff. He thus became the 10th NHLer ever to play
1,400 games. Among active players, he trails only Wayne Gretzky and
Larry Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   At 17:38 of the third period came milestone No. 2. Bourque
registered his second assist of the game, setting up Dmitri
Khristich with the final goal in the Bruins' 5-2 victory. It was
the 1,049th assist of his career, tying Gordie Howe for third place
on the all-time NHL list.
</P>
<P>
   In between those achievements, he was the Bourque of his youth _
checking opponents into the boards, dousing potential breakaways,
firing blistering slap shots from the point, and saving shots
before they got to the net.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, coach Pat Burns lauded his dedication. ``It
seems as if I talk about him on a weekly basis,'' said Burns.
``It's such a proud thing to coach him. I think the way he plays,
he has earned everything he has. His loyalty to the team, his
dedication. Everything about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque savored the moment. ``The milestones are something I'll
enjoy tonight and tomorrow,'' he said. ``But come Saturday, it's
another game and all this will be behind me. You've got to move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   And it seems there is always another milestone for Bourque, who
tries to minimize his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this level, the only thing that is important is winning,''
he said, ``and if we didn't win tonight, these milestones wouldn't
mean as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns agreed. ``I'll tell you, he wouldn't be happy if we
lost,'' said the coach. ``Between the first and second periods, he
was shouting at the team. Winning is important. Other players worry
about ice time, how many points they get, how many shots they get.
But not him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said milestones are part of the game. One does not mean
more than another. ``Except one,'' he said. ``The Cup. You want to
win the Stanley Cup because it is the last game of the year and you
can enjoy it for the whole summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth leaving Boston to join a team with a better shot at
the one prize that has eluded Bourque?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said emphatically. ``If it is going to happen, it is
going to happen here in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's memories of his first NHL game are as fresh as those
of his 1,400th. ``I can remember everything about it,'' he said.
``I was paired with Dick Redmond. I guess that shows how long ago
it was. But playing in that first NHL game is something all hockey
players dream about.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns compared his star to the other legends of the game. ``You
don't know you are in the presence of greatness when they are
here,'' he said. ``It is when they are going that you realize how
great they really were, and Ray Bourque is one of those players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to be lucky to last as long as I have,'' said Bourque.
``You have to avoid serious injuries, and I appreciate going out
there every day.''

SEAHAWKS EMBRACE 3-YEAR-OLD CANCER PATIENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ He arrived at the team's complex in a police
car driven by former Seahawk safety turned Seattle cop Vic Minor.
Lights flashing and siren squealing.
</P>
<P>
   He and his entourage were escorted to the locker room, where he
changed into his uniform before hurrying out to practice.
</P>
<P>
   He was called into the team's post-practice huddle by Dennis
Erickson, where he helped the coach lead the traditional ``1-2-3,
Seahawks'' chant and was greeted by applause and high-fives from
the players.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' newest free-agent acquisition?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. The ``player'' in the miniature No. 84 uniform Thursday
was 3-year-old Sterling Grover, who has rhabdomyosarcoma, which is
a long name to describe the malignant cancer cells that are
ravaging Sterling's bones and soft tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling's day among his heroes was made possible by the
Make-a-Wish Foundation and the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool,'' he said when asked he was enjoying himself.
</P>
<P>
   The coolest player, as far as Sterling is concerned, is wide
receiver Joey Galloway. Sterling was wearing Galloway's number and
using a locker that was set up next to Galloway's just for him.
After being welcomed by the players at practice, Erickson asked
Sterling if he wanted to say anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' Sterling said. ``I want to see Joey Galloway.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Galloway? ``Cuz I like him,'' Sterling offered, a
how-can-you-even ask? expression replacing the look of wonderment
on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling's mother, Lisa, explained that her youngest son's
infatuation with Galloway started last month after he attended the
Seahawks' game against the Raiders at the Kingdome. Since then,
Sterling has watched the team's other games with his grandfather,
Jed Grover, at the Ronald McDonald House.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad's down here with us, so he and Sterling watch football
games together on Sundays,'' Lisa Grover said. ``Sterling puts his
uniform on every Sunday and runs around the Ronald McDonald
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling has been living at the Ronald McDonald House since
July. He has had surgery and is now receiving chemotherapy
treatments. As a show of support, his 10-year-old brother, Spencer,
has shaved his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was bald first,'' Sterling quickly pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   As Sterling darted from player to player in the locker room,
having his picture taken with each, it was difficult to tell who
was having more fun, Sterling or the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different, but it's exciting,'' Galloway said as he
watched Sterling work the locker room as if he belonged there. ``As
you can see, all the players are smiling. When he first came out,
we were all laughing. It's cute.''
</P>
<P>
   Offered Erickson, ``This is something special. It's a great
thing. That's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling's big adventure is far from over. He will attend
Sunday's game at the Kingdome and ride in the team's helmet cart _
the second part of his Make-a-Wish request. Sitting next to
Sterling as he circles the Kingdome will be Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   But then that shouldn't be too surprising. Sterling and his
family are from North Pole, Alaska.

TAR HEELS STOMP HOLY CROSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ North Carolina has better leapers, faster
players, stronger shooters, and a much deeper bench. That's why the
Tar Heels are ranked No. 7 in the country in women's basketball.
Holy Cross, with only its freshmen having athletic scholarships, is
not in that class.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise that North Carolina did everything better
in Thursday night's 89-66 rout of the Lady Crusaders at the Hart
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels outrebounded HC, 57-35. They outshot HC, 43.9-42.4
percent, including 46.7-35.3 in the first half. And they harassed
HC into 21 turnovers, 12 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   It all made for a sweet homecoming for UNC senior point guard
Jessica Gaspar of North Dartmouth, who helped her team build a
20-point lead late in the first half and keep the Lady Crusaders at
bay.
</P>
<P>
   Five Tar Heels scored in double figures. Chanel Wright led the
way with 20 points. LaQuana Barksdale added 16 to go along with an
arena rec-ord of 19 rebounds. Juana Brown (13), Jackie Higgins
(12), and Nikki Teasley (12) joined them in twin figures.
</P>
<P>
   For Holy Cross (6-5), Amy O'Brien collected a game-high 32
points on 12-for-19 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off exams Wednesday, North Carolina looked quite ordinary
early, hitting on one of five field goal attempts and committing a
turnover. There were five ties in the opening seven minutes, the
last at 10-10 when O'Brien canned an 8-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to pick up the tempo,'' said UNC coach Sylvia
Hatchell. ``We didn't want them to get into a half-court game. We
were trying to make it uptempo, which is in our favor. We wanted to
take advantage of our quickness through the transition game. We had
the open shots, but we just weren't making them.''
</P>
<P>
   But then North Carolina (12-1), getting fast breaks when a
player switched to offense each time Holy Cross shot, started
rolling. The lead gradually reached double figures, climbing to 11
points, 28-17, on a Wright 3-pointer from the top of the key with
8:15 left in the first half. It got to 20, 43-23, on two Brown free
throws 2:37 before the break and was a comfortable 22, 50-28, at
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got lax late that first half,'' said Holy Cross coach
Bill Gibbons. ``We knew about their cutter and we didn't do a good
job on that, plus we missed a lot of layups as well as foul shots
(2 for 8 in the first half, 7 for 13 in the game). Once we missed,
they got out on the fast breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Tar Heels kept grabbing rebounds _ 25 on the offensive
boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wore them down with our rebounds,'' said Hatchell. ``Our
quickness helped, as did our bench.''

RACE NO ISSUE IN NBA LOCKOUT, JUST SUBTEXT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The race card has now been played in this NBA lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, it was a real quick hand, with both sides sanguinely
reporting that the most important color in this fight is green, not
black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Not a big surprise, since about $2 billion is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   After a week's worth of news clippings that caused this issue of
race to come trickling to the surface, NBA players union chief
Billy Hunter gave the union's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think race is (the problem),'' Hunter told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the problem is you've got a group of extremely
successful businessmen who own these teams, most of whom are
billionaires. On the other side of the table, you've got a group of
players who are predominantly African-American in origin, so I
think people can read into it anything they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subliminally, it may be there, but I think it's about dollars,
it's all about hard economics,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for a few days, the door was cracked open on an issue
that is imbedded in almost every aspect of American life and
certainly in sports. It began when an NBA union leader, Alonzo
Mourning, was quoted in a Newsweek article. Mourning's comments
gave rise to an examination of the role race might be playing in
the NBA negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owners think we're blacks who should be happy with what we
got. I'm not saying it's all about race, but it plays a factor,''
Mourning said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, any time a contentious dialogue such as this NBA
battle gives the appearance of breaking down along racial lines,
the issue is tough to avoid. No doubt, perceptions and stereotypes
about race are laced somewhere in these tense talks, just as they
are laced through so many aspects of sports.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, why do assistant coaches in the NFL who happen to
be African-American have a harder time getting a shot as a head
coach? Same in the NBA or Major League Baseball, where the
overwhelmingly majority of owners are white, most of whom are
obviously more inclined to hire and recycle familiar _ and mostly
white _ coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Double standards exist that make at least a hint at the race
issue unavoidable. For example, if Latrell Sprewell was given a
full-year suspension (later reduced by an arbitrator to a
season-long suspension) for choking Golden State coach P.J.
Carlesimo, then what about Carolina linebacker Kevin Greene?
</P>
<P>
   After physically attacking his position coach _ Carolina
assistant Kevin Steele _ on the sideline last week, Greene, who is
white, was given a one-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   One game vs. basically a year's worth of salary.
</P>
<P>
   Granted we are talking different leagues, but some would argue
that Greene deserved to sit out longer.
</P>
<P>
   And granted, Sprewell's actions were pre-meditated. He came back
into the gym after already having a skirmish with the acid-tongued
Carlesimo. But Greene's attack looked no less menacing, especially
on national TV.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mourning and Patrick Ewing and any other NBA union
member, they would have been dishonest if, in the face of questions
from the media, they had completely shrugged off the question of
how perceptions and stereotypes might come into play, even if they
are far from being the main stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about money and what bothers me most is that the
fans and the media are misinformed about the issues of this
lockout,'' said Eric Goodwin, an agent who represents Gary Payton,
Damon Stoudamire and Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, there are some comments that I think have been unfair or
stereotypical. I might question the comments directed at Kenny
Anderson, who might have said tongue-in-cheek that if he could not
earn a living this season because of the lockout, then he might
consider selling one of his cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the stereotype portrayed in the widely publicized story
of Anderson during the lockout has been the crux of the NBA owners'
strategy. An African-American player with ``lavish'' spending
habits was portrayed in the media as a representative for all or
most NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of thing might be why most fans think this is a
strike, not a lockout.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the belief by NBA officials and owners that these
so-called lavish spending habits will be the reason why the rank
and file will be broken.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see John Stockton or Hersey Hawkins flaunting those
things. Not every NBA player has oodles of platinum and diamonds
dripping off their bodies,'' Goodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   All these issues _ about race, stereotypes, who spends their
money where _ are subtext, hardly the main point. Goodwin said the
owners' unwillingness to make the same sort of concessions as the
players has stood in the way of a deal. Still, he is optimistic
there will be a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both sides understand that it is in the best interest
of basketball not to lose the season. Everyone knows the risk is
losing fans if the season is canceled,'' Goodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally _ a message pulsing from the lockout fight that everyone
can agree upon.

PALFFY ENDS HOLDOUT WITH ISLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Zigmund Palffy ended his two-month contract
standoff with the New York Islanders on Thursday, signing a
five-year deal worth about $5 million a season several hours before
the Islanders played the Kings at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, 26, a three-time 40-goal scorer, is expected to join the
Islanders in time to make his season debut Tuesday night at home
against the St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Kings general manager Dave Taylor acknowledged that he inquired
about Palffy's availability in a trade when he learned of the
signing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Islanders might have signed Palffy to trade him,
Taylor said, ``They didn't sign him to trade him to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Or anyone else, apparently, though there had been rumors that
the Islanders and Vancouver Canucks might make a deal that would
send disgruntled winger Pavel Bure to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thrilled to have Ziggy back in our lineup,'' Islanders
general manager and coach Mike Milbury said. ``He is our most
explosive offensive players and one of the most dynamic players in
the game today.''
</P>
<P>
   Contacted in his native Slovakia, Palffy said, ``I'm very happy
to have this come to a conclusion. In my heart, I always wanted to
be a New York Islander. I want to make it clear that I didn't say I
wanted to be a New York Ranger. I said I wanted to beat the New
York Rangers. And I want to thank Islanders fans. I cannot wait to
get back on the ice and play in front of them.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Taylor talks: The Kings and Tampa Bay Lightning recently had
discussions about a deal involving veteran right wing Stephane
Richer. Taylor declined comment, but a source in the Kings'
organization confirmed that talks were held.
</P>
<P>
   Richer, 32, has scored 382 goals in his career, most of them
with the Montreal Canadiens, where for a time he was a teammate of
Kings coach Larry Robinson. Richer also played for Robinson when
Robinson was an assistant coach with the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's dead now,'' the Kings source said of the Richer talks.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said there is less than a 50-percent chance that he will
make a trade between now and Saturday, when the NHL's eight-day
holiday roster freeze takes effect. But he added, ``I suppose
anything is possible. I wouldn't say `No.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the constant trade rumors involving the Kings were a
distraction to the players, Taylor said, ``I'd just like to see the
players focus on playing, not on anything else. The rumors cause
confusion and apprehension in the players.''

KELLEY FINISHES OFF RAMIREZ AFTER CAUTIOUS BEGINNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GERRY GITTELSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The punch came fast, hard and by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Cautious for 8{ rounds, New York lightweight Kevin Kelley put
veteran Jorge Ramirez away for a good with an overhand left that
ended their main event with one a single punch at the Country Club
in Reseda on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the same punch I've used to knock out a lot of
fighters,'' said Kelley (48-3-2, 23 KOs), who needed a win after
losing two of his last three.
</P>
<P>
   Both were cautious in the early going, extending the feeling-out
process through four rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley got more busy as the bout progressed, but he had trouble
nailing Ramirez with anything worthwhile. Ramirez showed good
quickness and just enough snap in his punches to give Kelley
something to think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't fight as consistently as I used to,'' Kelley said.
``So it was hard to comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez of Sonora, Mexico, fell to 67-13-3.
</P>
<P>
   In the undercard, junior lightweight Roger Medal (8-1)
outclassed Angel Mata (6-2), winning all six rounds. Medal used a
series of short, sneaky lefts and rights to keep Mata at bay.
Neither fighter was hurt, but Medal was in control all the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Richard Gonzalez-Thomas Hinde middleweight match was called
after two rounds when managers and seconds from both sides brawled
in the ring. The melee started after the fighters continued
punching following the end of the second round. Both fighters
officially were disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to pull their manager off my fighter and I got
cold-cocked,'' said Eddie Gonzalez, manager of Richard Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Yguado (1-0) beat Norris Ellington (0-4) by technical
knockout at 3:00 of the fourth round in a wild super-welterweight
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Holewyne (3-2) defeated Robyn Covino (1-7) by technical
knockout in the third round of their female welterweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   Light heavyweights Jose Chico and Rigoberto Plascencia of
Pacoima fought to a four-round draw in the professional debut for
both.

 &HT;    COST OF A PRESIDENTIAL BID: $2,500 AN HOUR THROUGHOUT 1999

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Any presidential candidate who wants to win a major
party's nomination in 2000 will have to raise at least $22 million
in 1999, campaign finance experts say.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republican or Democratic hopeful who starts New Year's
Day, that comes to more than $2,500 an hour, 24 hours a day, seven
days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising that much doesn't mean you're going to win, but it
means you have a chance,'' said political scientist Herbert
Alexander, who has published book-length studies of the financing
of each presidential election since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some scholars have come to regard fund-raising in the
pre-election year as the invisible primary,'' agreed John Green,
director of the University of Akron's Bliss School of Applied
Politics.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate who raised the most early money has captured his
party's nomination in every presidential election since 1976, when
reporting of pre-primary finances was first required.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard reality that will drive next year's quest for money
is that candidates will be so busy campaigning during the heart of
the 2000 primary season that they simply won't have much time to
raise funds.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 states may hold their caucuses or primaries on or
before March 11, 2000. If they do, candidates will have to appeal
to three-fourths of the nation's voters by that date.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous election years, candidates won't be able to
concentrate solely on the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire
primary for the first two months. They'll have to buy lots of ads
or make expensive campaign trips to attract news coverage in huge
states such as California, Florida and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you do well in Iowa or New Hampshire, you'll have only
a week or two before New York and California,'' Alexander said.
``You can't possibly raise big bucks in that short a time, so
you'll need money in the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander set the realistic minimum to be raised in 1999 by ``a
serious contender'' at $25 million. The $22 million estimate came
from accountant Stan Huckaby, whose Virginia-based firm has kept
the books for hundreds of Republican campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Democrat and two Republicans definitely could raise
that much in 1999, said political scientist Paul Herrnson(cq) of
the University of Maryland. The Democrat is Vice President Al Gore
of Tennessee. The Republicans are Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and
publisher Malcolm ``Steve'' Forbes of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly Al Gore has a national network of people he can call
on, and the same is true of George W. (Bush), who will inherit the
Bush dynasty'' from his father, former President George H.W. Bush,
Herrnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has spent the last two years honing his fund-raising
ability and is rich enough to use his own money if he comes up
short, Herrnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other hopefuls believe they would have a chance if they
raise at least $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can be viable with $15 million to $20 million,
(if) you husband your resources and don't spend them on straw polls
and other distractions in 1999,'' said Ed Gillespie, communications
director for the leadership PAC of Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio. ``If
John runs, we'd hope to have $12 million on hand on Jan. 1, 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans whose records indicate they might raise that
much include conservative activist Gary Bauer of Virginia, former
Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, former Vice President Dan Quayle
of Arizona, and Sens. John McCain of Arizona and John Ashcroft of
Missouri. All have raised at least $3 million for their own
campaigns or their personal political organizations in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats with a solid national fund-raising reputation include
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri and Sen. John Kerry
of Massachusetts, who met the $3 million threshold in the past two
years, as well as two others who raised that much in the past. The
two are former Sens. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Paul Wellstone
of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're outspent four to one, you're cooked,'' Wellstone's
campaign manager, Dan Lucas, said. ``But if you're only outspent
two to one, you're in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   All those calculations include only ``hard'' money, which under
federal rules can be raised from individuals giving no more than
$1,000 apiece, plus federal funds to match the first $250 from any
of those donors.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcement of campaign finance laws has become so lax and
haphazard that Green said he can't even guess at how much
unregulated ``soft'' money will be raised for indirect help to some
of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing fast and loose with the rules will be easier than ever
in 2000,'' Green predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of financing their political travels during 1998 solely
through the small hard-money contributions raised by their
federally regulated committees, at least six hopefuls also formed
state committees or taxable corporations to help out. The federal
committees could accept only non-corporate gifts of $5,000 or less,
but the other organizations could accept soft money from any source
in any amount. Some may use these unregulated organizations to
finance activities in 1999 as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft money's been useful before,'' Green said. Democrat
``Walter Mondale spent a lot early in 1984, but then Gary Hart came
out of nowhere in mid-spring when Mondale was almost out of money.
So labor unions (spending an estimated $5 million) bankrolled
Mondale delegates in various states.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said, ``I just see the creative use of soft money in 2000
as being like 1984 or 1996, but squared or cubed.''

 &HT;    Rabbi's predicted reforms welcome converts, gays
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO (mug)
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The next generation of Jews will be
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to elect to be Jewish because there is so much
freedom for Jews in America and countless options available to
them.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer corps will wrestle with God in an emerging Jewish
life driven by compassion and justice rooted in authentic spiritual
experience.
</P>
<P>
   And it will shape a Judaism that energetically recruits
converts, recognizes women fully, welcomes and ordains practicing
homosexuals, presides over same sex unions and embraces
intermarried couples.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Alexander Schindler thinks that's what the future holds
for the ancient religion. And what Schindler thinks has shaped much
of American Jewish thought for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   He was president of the governing body of Reform Judaism from
1973 to 1996. He continues to influence Jewish ideas in significant
ways.
</P>
<P>
   He is a sought-after speaker on the lecture circuit, frequently
a scholar-in-residence and serves on a half-dozen national and
international Jewish organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Schindler, 73, came south from his home in Connecticut last week
to speak in honor of the 75th anniversary of Temple Israel in West
Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he preached at Temple Beth Torah in Wellington and
blessed the 30-year marriage of Rabbi and Mrs. Stephen Pinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He honors the past on both occasions as he honors the tradition
of his faith, but both must give way to the future as necessary, he
insists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judaism is always changing,'' Schindler said in an interview.
``Reform means that Judaism is always in the process of becoming.
It is never a state of being. It is always a relentless going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Unparalleled freedom, increased knowledge and the imperative of
compassion will shape the future of Judaism, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jews are no longer forced to be Jewish through persecution and
prejudice. They are no longer defined by others. But freedom has a
price. Jews may choose not to be Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``To them, Judaism in the future can only issue an invitation,
not a summons,'' Schindler said.
</P>
<P>
   And that invitation must be rooted in an embrace of Torah
(Jewish scripture) that is informed by contemporary understanding
and the search for justice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Orthodox Jewish conviction, Schindler believes the Torah
is the record of a ``God-inspired people to know God'' and was
fashioned by human beings.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the holy book is not a record of God's dictation to
Moses and must be interpreted. Scripture includes both soaring
ideals and human ignorance, profound truth and deplorable bigotry,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the right and, indeed, the obligation to make
distinctions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, responsible studies demonstrate that homosexuals do
not choose to be gay. Their sexuality is a given, he said.
Compassion insists they be embraced by the Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that discerning God's will is demanding. He recalled
the story of Jacob wrestling through the night with an angel in the
book of Genesis.
</P>
<P>
   God changed Jacob's name to Israel, which means ``struggle with
God.''
</P>
<P>
   But the root of the word implies the future tense, Schindler
said. All Jews must wrestle with God.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the task imposed upon us when we accept the name,
Israel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His own journey is an example of that challenge. He escaped to
the United States from Nazi Germany in 1937 and served as a ski
trooper in Europe during World War II. He planned to study
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   While stationed near Yugoslavia at war's end, he went to Munich
on a pass to search for surviving family members, if any, and found
himself at the death camp, Dachau.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, unconsciously, I knew I wanted to know why what
happened happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He told another story to explain his perspective from that
extraordinary experience.
</P>
<P>
   A rabbi asked Elijah, the prophet, where to find the Messiah
expecting to see him surrounded by glory. The Messiah would be
found at the city gate, Elijah said.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi asked what the Messiah was doing at that unlikely
place. Elijah replied that the Messiah was sitting among the
wounded changing their bandages one by one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the essence of Torah,'' Schindler said. ``Compassion.

 &HT;    Rustic furniture just needs the right woodworker for great
results
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sitting here at my desk looking at a new book called
``Simple Rustic Furniture,'' subtitled ``A weekend workshop with
Dan Mack,'' I had a sudden change of heart about this stuff.
</P>
<P>
   I have not actually seen much of this stuff, which is called
rustic only euphemistically. It used to be called twig furniture,
which sort of downsizes it, but is closer to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Basically it is furniture made of green found wood, generally
altered only just enough to get the pieces together.
</P>
<P>
   As I said, I haven't seen much, and most of what I have seen has
been relegated to odd dark corners of people's houses and allowed
to collect a lot of dust, which it does with a vengeance. Bark,
after all, is hard to keep clean.
</P>
<P>
   I expect much of what I've seen hasn't been very well finished,
either, or perhaps the finish was never renewed. At any rate, it
had that sad gray look of old kindling.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look very strong, either.
</P>
<P>
   So I always looked upon this rustic furniture as something young
adults might be forced to construct during summer camp, just to
prove that, by Neddy Dingo, it can be done. If you're set adrift in
the limitless forest with nothing but a hatchet and a pocket knife,
you can make yourself a nice chair and a table, whether you want to
or not.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I've been missing something. I can see now that if the
right woodworker gets into this stuff, the results can be something
remarkable. But it requires an honest-to-goodness artist, because
everything has to be original. You couldn't copy most of this stuff
if your life depended on it, because you couldn't find the same
sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Thus there is no telling where some of the ``weekend projects''
in Mack's book are going to end up.
</P>
<P>
   But one of them, a bentwood chair by a gentleman named Andrew
Gardner, is just about as handsome a seating piece as I've seen
anywhere. It's a very graceful, regal thing, with a classic sort of
sweeping design.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably fairly brutal to sit in _ most of these chairs
look that way _ and since it is largely held together with nails, I
suspect a lot of sitting in it is going to turn it into firewood.
(I'm sorry, but I just don't believe nails can hold things together
if they're subject to racking stresses.)
</P>
<P>
   Some things here are more rustic than others. There are some
very attractive pieces which don't look rustic at all until you
realize that a few pieces are, in fact, somewhat lumpy sticks with
the bark peeled off, sanded and finished.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of furniture is going to appeal to relatively few
people, and look at home in relatively few houses. But real art is
possible within its confines.
</P>
<P>
   The book that brought about this little epiphany is published by
Lark Books, 50 College Street, Asheville, NC 28801, at $19.95 in
hardback.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Warner writes a column about woodworking every week for The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He can be reached at
jwarner(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    We've got `Mail,' but its cute idea doesn't deliver
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Cute is: Meg Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Cute isn't: Meg Ryan mugging so hard you want to mug her.
</P>
<P>
   Charming is: Ineffable.
</P>
<P>
   Charming isn't: Earnest. And it isn't ``You've Got Mail,'' a
listless romantic comedy set in the age of e-mail, but with all the
carry of a canceled stamp.
</P>
<P>
   The film reunites the crew who made ``Sleepless In Seattle'' _
Ryan, Tom Hanks and director Nora Ephron. The story is based on
``The Shop Around the Corner,'' a 1940 movie starring Jimmy Stewart
and Margaret Sullavan as feuding shopworkers who don't realize
they're lonely-hearts pen pals. Very charming.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) and Joe Fox (Hanks) are in the book
business. She owns a tiny bookstore called _ you guessed it _ The
Shop Around The Corner. He runs a chain of superstores. When he
opens one near her, it threatens to run her cute little
establishment right out of New York's cute little Upper West Side.
The pair do not get along.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but all along they have been exchanging anonymous, computer
e-mail. They live contentedly with others (Hanks with bratty Parker
Posey; Ryan with Greg Kinnear, in another good performance as a
rather feckless soul). At least the pair think they're contented
until they become infatuated with each other's thoughts. This
attraction is a mystery, since their e-mail reads like the musings
of Andy Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Hanks learns the identity of his
mistress-of-the-modem. This gives him an advantage over her, and
gives the film some oomph and the possibility of good-natured
deviltry. But the Pillow Talk premise isn't exploited, and the
movie grinds to a predictable _ and predictably cute _ conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong? Director Ephron, who also co-wrote the
screenplay, is intent on imposing charm from the top down.
Everything feels forced, including the dog who sits watching Hanks
compose his messages. Schmaltz isn't a brand of yeast, and it
doesn't make a film rise.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ryan and Hanks seem more like ciphers than full-bodied
characters. And the dialog isn't very sprightly. It's smart-alecky
rather than smart; smug rather than sassy.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the movie drags with unnecessary scenes that seem
included because the filmmakers thought they were, well, cute. An
example is a bull session about women between Hanks and his father
(Dabney Coleman).
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who always seems to have a saintly aureole of light around
her, overacts in spades. Bored viewers might amuse themselves by
counting how many different faces she makes without once looking
into the camera with any sort of conviction. Hanks is blase and
bemused, but doesn't bring anything to the film we haven't seen
before.
</P>
<P>
   Even New York looks cute and over-scrubbed, as if the film were
produced by Mayor Giuliani and the city's tourist board. But is
this the image New York really wants to project? Not ``Sleepless in
Seattle,'' but ``Witless on the West Side?''

 &HT;    Gorgeous and star-studded, `Prince of Egypt' delivers
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Palm Beach Post
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Deliver Us'' is the opening musical
number in the visually spectacular animated Bible story, ``The
Prince of Egypt.'' And by the movie's mood, look and subject
matter, it clearly wants to deliver us from the omnipresent Disney
model for feature-length cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Ten Commandments'' remake, boiled down to an
hour-and-a-half and souped up with action sequences, is impressive.
Still, it is best defined by what is not there: the usual cutesy
sidekick characters or ingratiating comic interludes. And it takes
such a grown-up approach to the story of Moses leading his people
to freedom that its reverent, serious tone is virtually unleavened
by humor.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``The Prince of Egypt'' knows it is an
entertainment, not an illustrated Sunday school sermon. It
emphasizes adventure aspects: Baby Moses' travel down the Nile in a
basket is so fraught with peril it could be a sequel to ``The River
Wild.''
</P>
<P>
   When the story doesn't have enough action opportunities, they
are invented. A teen-age Moses and pharoah-to-be Rameses are
depicted as boisterous sibling rivals, particularly in a
thrill-ride chariot race with terrific perspective-shifting
computer graphics. In one of the film's few playful moments, their
reckless hot-rodding suggests a new theory on how the Sphinx statue
lost its nose.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, though, the script is walk-on-eggs careful.
The movie shouldn't feel so strait-jacketed. And while the look of
the characters is highly realistic, one wonders exactly what was
gained by making this story in animation. Some cost-cutting on the
parting of the Red Sea?
</P>
<P>
   Only one scene is truly re-imagined for animation, and it is
stunning. As Moses awakens to his Jewish heritage, the wall
hieroglyphs come alive and menace him with evidence of the
pharoah's murderous ways. It is the best sequence in the movie and
the best argument for its existence.
</P>
<P>
   With live-action special effects having evolved so much since
Cecil B. DeMille's ``Ten Commandments'' days, other moments seem
less awe-inspiring. Moses turning his staff into a serpent is no
better than Saturday morning cartoons. But the burning bush has a
downright heavenly glow, a sandstorm in the wilderness will parch
your throat, and the climactic Red Sea crossing is a marvel.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks did not stint on hiring voice talent, including Val
Kilmer (Moses), Ralph Fiennes (Rameses) and Michelle Pfeiffer
(Moses' wife Tzipporah, who looks like a cousin of Hunchback's
Esmeralda). Whether encouraged so or not, they all lose themselves
in their roles rather than letting their star personalities come
through. This is most evident with Rameses' Mutt-and-Jeff magician
henchmen, voiced by Steve Martin and Martin Short but without any
of the antics such casting seems to promise.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, after telling a story of squabbling brothers who
grow up, with one continuing a dynasty and the other serving a
heritage he had long denied, ``The Prince of Egypt'' does become a
cartoon about faith and spirituality. It ends abruptly without any
mention of what is written on those tablets Moses carries down from
the mountain, but it certainly suggests the Jews' deliverance came
about from their belief and adherence to a higher being.
</P>
<P>
   Now, quick: What's the last animated movie that tried to send
out that message?

 &HT;    Looking for love in all the cyberspaces
 &HT;    WITH CYBERSEX, MOVIES-MAIL

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``I'm not some Internet weirdo,''
SirCoffee insists. ``I'm not some nerd who doesn't have some social
skills who has to hide behind the computer. I just thought it'd be
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   We can't look into SirCoffee's eyes and evaluate the truth of
his protests. But we can stare at the photo he posted on line when
he was looking for love via the Internet classifieds, an
increasingly popular pastime.
</P>
<P>
   And there he is, an attractive 27-year-old from New Jersey who
had broken up with his 22-year-old girlfriend and wanted to move
on.
</P>
<P>
   He began navigating through the online chat rooms _ he hated
them _ and the ever-widening world of online romance. Then he
discovered that hotbed of cybermating on America Online:
Love(AT)AOL.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people have posted classified ads at this
extremely popular meeting place since America Online opened it on
Valentine's Day 1996, according to Bill Schreiner, director of
programming for Love(AT)AOL.
</P>
<P>
   And many more are apt to gravitate there and to other online
love connections when the new movie ``You've Got Mail,'' with Meg
Ryan and Tom Hanks as two online addicts who find love.
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't just the nameless masses that play on line.
Talk-show host Rush Limbaugh hooked up with wife Marta online. And
author Tom Clancy found himself facing divorce after his online
trysts moved off-line, his wife said. (He's now hoping to marry
another woman, whom he didn't meet online.)
</P>
<P>
   SirCoffee is a classic cyberlover. He says he fell hard for his
lady before they ever met in person.
</P>
<P>
   Her online name was She 11 Ra, and she turned out to be a
beautiful 28-year-old blonde with a great smile.
</P>
<P>
   SirCoffee admits he would never have approached her if they had
met at a bar or a party. Too beautiful and intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   But online? Well, they searched each other's profiles and
classified ads. They talked through instant messages that flashed
on their computer screens and communicated via carefully
constructed e-mail notes. And, eventually, they talked by phone.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's Schreiner says this is the appeal of online connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you actually get to know somebody slower, it gives you
more opportunities to get a sense of truth of how somebody is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something about the written word that reveals a lot.
If you're a jerk or not funny, it will come across in written
communications. People are very self-revealing online.''
</P>
<P>
   After just three months of cyber-courtship, SirCoffee and his
lady were ready to take it to the next level: meeting in person.
</P>
<P>
   SirCoffee, aka Erik Jacobsen of Essex County, N.J., flew to
California in late October to meet Cherokee (She Ra), the woman of
his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   He waited impatiently to find out whether flesh and blood could
equal fantasy and ``cybersex.'' (Cybersex is a way of being
sexually intimate, but instead of talking or touching, you type.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, let's just say we're very happy!'' he said via an
e-mail. ``Everything we told each other was absolutely true! We're
compatible on every level! For what it's worth, you can chalk this
one up as a definite match!''
</P>
<P>
   AOL's Schreiner says the classified-ad site acquires 700
personals every day. ``It's a reflection of how much unmet demand
and desire there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Ketly Blaise-Sapp and her husband of two years, Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   The couple lives in West Palm Beach, but they, like Erik and
Cherokee, had a distance problem to resolve before their online
matchup ended in marriage.
</P>
<P>
   And they had more baggage to carry into their relationship than
the never-married twenty-somethings.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby was divorced, with a teen-age son, when he found Ketly's
online ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't been dating anybody really seriously for two years,''
Ketly, 41, says. ``I was kind of coming to a peace about it. But my
sister, Joanne, encouraged me to go on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ketly posted an ad on AOL looking for an African-American from
the Northeast. She figured she had worn out her prospects nearby,
she jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby lived in New Jersey and fulfilled Ketly's qualifications
for a single man who was ``spiritually based'' and family-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Technology, while the facilitator of this affair, was also
almost the death of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby typed too slow!'' Ketly says of her husband's ability to
communicate through instant messages. She was ready to call it all
off.
</P>
<P>
   But Bobby kept e-mailing her until she responded. It was a lark
for him, he said, a fun way to get in touch with someone new.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they started talking by telephone. Ketly, always a
cynic, was not overly impressed until that pivotal one-hour phone
call he placed while driving to see a newborn nephew.
</P>
<P>
   She liked the way he talked about his family and the way he
revealed himself to her. It had taken a lot to get to that point.
Ketly had given him beeper numbers and cell-phone numbers, always
careful not to give out too much personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he arranged to meet her on his way to a vacation in the
Bahamas. She had not even seen a photo of him at that point. Bobby
was new to the Internet and didn't know how to post a photo online,
so he mailed it. Confusion over addresses kept the picture from
arriving before Bobby did.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he's ugly?'' Ketly kept worrying.
</P>
<P>
   But three days before he arrived, Bobby sent her three roses
with an endearing message: ``Take a deep breath. It's gonna be all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Ketly, ``The photo actually came two days after I met him.
It was a good thing. The photo looked nerdy!''
</P>
<P>
   Their meeting went well, and they flew back and forth getting to
know each other. Ketly was nervous about taking on his 15-year-old
son, but then Bobby decided he would move to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they eloped nine months after meeting online, they
hadn't spent more than 10 days together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first year was very difficult,'' Ketly confesses. ``It
hasn't been a picnic.'' Eventually, Bobby's son returned to New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But neither regrets how they met.
</P>
<P>
   Says Bobby, ``I think our situation is unique. I do see it as a
viable way to meet people. But you need to know what you're looking
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Dupree, a University of Florida graduate who now
lives in Washington, wasn't looking for any kind of love match when
she met her live-in beau of five years, Bill Walsh, through a
tennis bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   This was back in 1992, when online connections weren't so
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   But they ``talked'' back and forth on the board, posting
messages, and eventually chatting by phone the night before they
met for lunch in D.C. They hadn't even exchanged photos when they
got together, not the way romances are usually cooked up online
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up and said, `hello,' and lunch was 2 1/2 hours long,
and (then) he called in to take off work. That was pretty much it.
We realized very quickly we were extremely compatible.''
</P>
<P>
   They recently bought a house together and have a ``30-year,
fixed commitment,'' Dupree laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before 1995, it was hard to explain to people how we met,''
she says. ``We were trendsetters.''
</P>
<P>
   Today? Well, just go to the movies.

 &HT;    Is Web romance cheating? Not always, expert says
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ All your clothes are on. So are the
lights. There's no one else in the room _ especially not your
significant other. It's just you, your computer, a keyboard and a
few million impure thoughts screaming through your head. There's a
name on the computer screen, an anonymous love bird with whom
you've been flirting on line. Your naughty repartee would make a
White House intern blush, but you don't even know what the person
looks like, much less what he or she feels like in the dark or
sounds like the morning after.
</P>
<P>
   Does this qualify as cheating?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, says cybersex expert Deb Levine. Her new book, ``The Joy
of Cybersex'' ($12, Random House), is both a sexual rule book and a
guide for getting it on online. Think of ``The Joy of Sex'' without
all those embarrassing charcoal drawings and with a modem instead
of motion lotion.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the question at hand. Levine fields it down the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each situation is different,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone goes online to have a sexual experience or a
fantasy or to push their creativity a little farther, and they do
it once and process it and then decide to move on from there and
not do it again ... I do not consider that cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   But...
</P>
<P>
   ``But if a person goes on line for a regular rendezvous with the
same person for an intimate relationship ...'' she says, pausing
for a breath. ``Yes ... That would be cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine, 35, has carved a niche for herself online as a referee
on a sprawling social playing field that has few boundaries. A
combination of Miss Manners and Dr. Ruth, she provides sexual
advice in a persona known as Delilah on her World Wide Web site
(www.thrive-online.com/sex/delilah.today.html). Levine got her
start at Columbia University five years ago, when she developed the
Go Ask Alice site, which was designed to answer questions about
safe sex and relationships. She's not a trained sex therapist, but
much of what she espouses comes from years spent observing behavior
on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Levine's book provides a how-to for using the Internet to
enhance your sex life, as well as tips on flirting and suggestions
for sites to visit when looking for an online partner.
</P>
<P>
   As Levine sees it, whether cheating or not, the ultimate goal
should be to use cybersex as an aid, not a replacement or
substitute for the real thing. Whatever thrill you might get from a
temporary dip into the murky waters of cyberfantasy should be
channeled back into your existing relationship.
</P>
<P>
   That clears it up, right?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no, since people keep finding new ways to play online.
</P>
<P>
   Dicey thing, this Internet. As easy as it is to find a recipe or
a stock quote or even a funny joke or two, it can plug a computer
user into a subculture where sex and intense relationships are just
a few keystrokes away. Chat-room conversations, message-board
correspondence or even a few spicy volleys of e-mail can quickly
evolve into a relationship that has all the emotions and mindplay
of sex, if not any of the physical contact.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of accessibility is changing the sexual landscape,
Levine says in her book.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the privacy of your own home, you can get the advice and
support you need to overcome shyness. You can even flirt with
strangers in your pajamas! No one will ever know if you haven't
slept a wink, if you have stubble on your face or if you haven't
put on your makeup. The anonymity also means you never have to see
a particular person again if you flub it.''
</P>
<P>
   But assuming the real thing is available, why would someone opt
to pluck forbidden fruit in such a sterile den of iniquity, where
the most common pickup line is: ``Are you hot? What are your
measurements?''
</P>
<P>
   ``People tell me the No. 1 reason for going on line is to feel
desired,'' she said. ``They say they've been in a relationship
off-line and have started to take each other for granted, and
they're not feeling like a sexual being. Going online allows them
to be in a nonjudgmental place where they can be considered a
sexual being and be desired.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, the emotions felt during online encounters can be brought
to a person's primary relationship,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I encourage is that the computer not take the place of
real life, that it instead complement real life,'' Levine said.

 &HT;    Gods' peers inside forgotten Hollywood
 &HT;    By Staff report
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ An aging, nearly forgotten Hollywood
fixture sits at home in repose, until a young man arrives and
becomes involved in the icon's twisted existence. And by the
fade-out, there is a dead body floating ominously in the swimming
pool.
</P>
<P>
   Sunset Boulevard? Of course, but it also applies to an
engrossing new movie, ``Gods and Monsters,'' about a real-life
equivalent of silent star Norma Desmond. Based on a novel by
Christopher Bram, it is a fictional speculation on the last months
of director James Whale, who carved out a monster of a career with
the 1930s horror films ``Frankenstein'' and ``Bride of
Frankenstein'' and then was left to flounder on the dream factory's
reject pile.
</P>
<P>
   As Whale, a snowy-haired Ian McKellen gives a haunted, haunting
performance as the stroke-impaired, prissy Brit on the verge of
physical and mental decay, unable to control the monstrous images
that run through his brain. Left ambiguous by director Bill
Condon's clever script is whether Whale was ostracized for some gay
sexual scandal or the more heinous Hollywood crime of making an
unprofitable movie.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the movie is set in 1957, as Whale whiles away the
time in his Pacific Palisades home, chasing the demons in the
movies of his mind. His main human contact is his doting but often
disapproving housekeeper Hannah (a stolid, dumpy Lynn Redgrave with
a thick German accent) and the occasional, fawning interviewer,
avid for Whale to spin out stray recollections of the Frankenstein
films.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day, Whale notices the newly hired gardener, a slab of
uneducated, ex-Marine beefcake named Boone (Brendan Fraser).
Whale's first thoughts are carnal, but as he lures Boone inside to
pose for his sketchbook, an unexpected symbiotic relationship
begins, not unlike that between Dr. Frankenstein and his laboratory
creature.
</P>
<P>
   Boone's fascination with Whale's moviemaking lore seems to
unlock other buried memories _ bitter recollections of his
brutalized childhood, horrific flashbacks of World War I combat,
tender thoughts of his foxhole lover and wistful remembrances of
all-male pool parties.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the movie's dark recesses, Condon maintains a tone of
ironic and occasionally playful humor, not unlike the comic serum
that Whale injected into his Frankenstein movies. In a few
instances, the comedy gets too broad, as in Whale's early encounter
with a fan-reporter.
</P>
<P>
   But a Hollywood garden party scene is sublime. First, there is a
whimsical encounter with a bewildered Princess Margaret and a
fuming, closeted George Cukor. This leads to an awkward, but
touching surprise reunion between Whale and ``his monsters,'' Boris
Karloff and Elsa Lanchester. Initially buoyed by this return to the
Hollywood social whirl, particularly with the hunky Boone on his
arm, Whale's energy eventually flags. And with simple, telling
gestures, McKellen masterfully grows ashen and recedes into his
shell.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser, an underrated actor best known for George of the Jungle,
holds his ground remarkably well alongside McKellen. Although not
terribly verbal, he lets us see Boone's awakened inner feelings,
again paralleling Whale's cinematic monster. Still, when McKellen
is off the screen, the movie tends to go slack, as in a hollow
subplot with barmaid Lolita Davidovich, seemingly included to
underline Boone's heterosexuality. Also unpersuasive is an epilogue
featuring a mature Boone with his wife and child.
</P>
<P>
   Such lapses aside, ``Gods and Monsters'' is an unexpected treat,
an illumination of a life worth some recognition, a period perfect
look at bygone Hollywood, a surprisingly touching friendship and a
brush with death. It is entertaining and thought-provoking in equal
measure.

 &HT;    `Prince' just a Sunday School lesson with stadium seating
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In DreamWorks' thunderous and magnificently
sandy cartoon epic ``The Prince of Egypt,'' no animals talk or
sing, but a flaming bush is sure a Chatty Cathy.
</P>
<P>
   And what attitude. Buffeting a young Moses with haughty demands,
the shrub acts like it thinks it's God or something.
</P>
<P>
   You get a twinge that the makers of ``The Prince of Egypt'' _
Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, et al. _ are also afflicted
with a tiny God complex, cocksure their version of the Moses tale
is carved in stone: final, permanent, encrusted in stentorian
self-importance.
</P>
<P>
   And, may we add, not bad. If not quite the knee-buckling opus it
believes it is, the stunningly handsome Exodus retelling erupts on
the screen for the first hour with a tonic exuberance sprung from
the liberating terrain of speculative fiction _ namely, imagining
Moses as a rambunctious, prank-hatching adolescent in Pharaoh's
court. (Funny stuff, Moses, until someone gets hurt.)
</P>
<P>
   But then, in the last third, the story unfurls in halting
episodes, ticking off those highly cinematic miracles from the Good
Book in a finish-line sprint. This part of ``Egypt'' could be
dubbed Exodus' Greatest Hits, and that's a small problem. Most of
us know what happens next, and we start peeking around the corner
for each familiar stunt _ the surly bush flambe, the
staff-cum-cobra, the wacky plagues _ checking them off in
anticipation of the granddaddy of all magic tricks, ripping the Red
Sea asunder.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, it gets tedious. The sights are marvels of imagination
and state-of-the-art animation (the sea-parting is a wet, wondrous
bit of cartoon majesty), but the narrative thins drastically here,
building as it does to more important climaxes the movie doesn't
get to, such as Moses' earth-rumbling receipt of the ``Ten
Commandments,'' glimpsed in a fast-forward blink just before the
end credits.
</P>
<P>
   So, Moses rescues his people from the maw of Pharaoh, and then
it's over. Cue credits and a very loud blast of synthetic R&AMP;B,
courtesy of Boyz II Men. (This is Satan's single appearance in the
film.)
</P>
<P>
   After a lovely sequence showing baby Moses' perilous journey
down the Nile to Pharaoh's palace, the movie unleashes an
exhilarating rush of images and gasping Spielbergian action in a
chariot race between the teen-age Moses (voice by Val Kilmer, all
generic virility) and his ``brother'' Rameses (the
mellifluous-tongued Ralph Fiennes).
</P>
<P>
   Though the movie is directed by a trio of animation veterans,
Spielberg exerted his expert instincts on this scene, specifically
adding the vertiginous downhill plunge of the barreling chariots
that has the effect of a gut-gulping roller-coaster dip.
Spectacular 3-D computer animation gives the sequence dioramic
intensity. But the scene isn't all about eye-popping tableaux.
</P>
<P>
   Providing a cyclonic tour through ancient Egypt, it is packed
with narrative information, denoting time, place and wonderful
characterizations of the two rowdy brothers who, we learn, are
bound as much by a healthy rivalry as by deep-seated love.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Moses and the exotic Rameses (the
Egyptians are as golden brown as baked chicken, with spiffy
geometric haircuts) is the crux of the story, and the inevitable
circumstances that threaten it provide narrative thrust. That and,
of course, the fireproof bush, whose directives Moses carries
through with more than a dot of skepticism. Enter all those
miracles.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of forgettable songs by Hans Zimmer (``The Lion
King'') and Stephen Schwartz (``Pocahontas'') waft through the
movie to mixed effect. Many of the stars are enlisted to handle
their own vocal duties, including Steve Martin and Broadway crooner
Martin Short, Michelle Pfeiffer, and even Fiennes. They're all
fine; it's the songs that are blah.
</P>
<P>
   The sumptuous visual buffet far outclasses the show tunes. Like
recent breakthroughs in computer-animation, the film heralds an
evolutionary step in traditional animated features. An elaborate
beauty suffuses every scene in a palette of golds, bronzes and
browns. When Moses makes his initial departure from Egypt, he
draggles through a desert that conjures the craggy, burnt-orange
surface of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' is finally a vibrant but dowdy
spectacle. That's really no fault of the minds at DreamWorks but of
the ossified narrative, which no one wants to get too cute with,
hence the almost 600 experts, Bible scholars to Egyptologists, the
filmmakers summoned for counsel.
</P>
<P>
   And hence the cartoon's sometimes stifling gravitas and
cute-creature-free stodginess _ no singing donkeys, no wisecracking
camels _ which will surely glaze the little ones. Think of it as
Sunday school. With stadium seating. Chris Garcia is the film
critic for the Austin American-Statesman.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: So long, BB's Mexican Cafe r&AMP;r to design
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Austin lost a funky little family business
Thursday when Andrew ``B.B.'' Castan(tilde)on closed his
restaurant, BB's Mexican Cafe, at 616 Nueces St.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody will ask me what B.B. stands for and I'll tell 'em it
stands for Bird Brain,'' said B.B., who is known for his goofy
quips. Actually, B.B. doesn't stand for anything. It's a nickname
B.B. picked up as a baby.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, B.B. will auction off his furniture and supplies at
the restaurant. B.B. is getting out for a couple of reasons. For
one, he had lease problems with his landlord. Also, the man needs a
break. B.B. has been slinging migas for so long that he may have
developed migas-slinger's elbow. He's been working in Austin
restaurants since the day the spatula was invented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just hanging it up right now,'' said B.B., 64. ``Maybe in
a year from now we'll come back. I'm going to take a little rest.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing you could never accuse B.B. of was being trendy. I
don't know of any other place in town that served a sandwich called
an ``Egg Burger.'' ``I've never seen anybody else,'' B.B. said.
``And enchiladas with the eggs on top _ a few other restaurants may
have that, but I think I started it.''
</P>
<P>
   Decor at B.B.'s no-frills Tex-Mex restaurant included a sign
outside that told you flour tacos were 85 cents on Wednesday _
``all makes, all day.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no blue corn tortillas in this place, folks. And
nowhere on the menu would you find the words ``vegetarian
choices.'' Dinner types included ``regular,'' ``short'' and
``special.'' French fries were listed under appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   And when the waiter or waitress brought your food to the table,
he or she uttered the two-word warning that tells the diner he's in
an authentic Tex-Mex joint: ``hot plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows, B.B. deserves a rest. The restaurant he closed
Thursday was his third in Austin. In 1948, at age 14, he started
his career busing tables at El Matamoros, on the southbound
frontage road of I-35. B.B. recalls that the place had an outdoor
patio with a sawdust floor. The delivery truck wasn't much to look
at, either.
</P>
<P>
   Veronyca Castan(tilde)on-Horst, 38, B.B.'s eldest daughter,
remembers riding around in the '60s as a 5-year-old in El Mat's
junky pickup while her dad was making deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truck had no seat,'' she said. ``There were springs
sticking out. So my dad had to put telephone books in there so I
could sit down. I loved the smell of the food in the cab of the
truck.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, B.B. opened his own place _ Instant Burger, on Sixth
Street where Maggie Mae's is now. These days, this address is in
the heart of what we call the entertainment district. Back then, it
was in the middle of a beer joint zone. You had the Wander Inn, the
E.G. Bar and the Green Spot, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a beer permit there 'cause I already had enough
drunks coming in as it was,'' B.B. said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, B.B. went a little more upscale when he opened a place
on South First Street that started out as a burger joint, then
later became a Mexican food place. Ten years ago, B.B. moved the
restaurant to the location he closed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   All kinds of folks ate at B.B.'s. Autographed photos of retired
U.S. Rep. Jake Pickle, Longhorn football legend Earl Campbell and
former Gov. Ann Richards hang on the wall by the front door.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, most of the customers were regular Joes. On many
days, said Carmen Belmarez, a waitress who has been working for
B.B. off and on since the 1970s, the same penniless guy would come
in for a bean and egg taco. Since the guy was broke, Carmen and
waiter Joey Carmona would cover it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to tell him today was his last taco,'' Carmen said
Thursday.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Leaves are dropping at a rapid clip
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ The leaves are falling quickly now, after
an unexpected fine autumnal display. Turns out the drought made the
fall colors even brighter than usual. Trees under distress, because
of too much heat and too little water, quit producing chlorophyll
early on, resulting in a riotous display of dying foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Ma Nature has put on an impressive cabaret
of color for several weeks, even if the rest of the weather hasn't
cooperated until lately. I have a half-cord of firewood recently
purchased but hardly used, and the air conditioner still runs
regularly. But I won't complain, as long as the good Lord keeps
bringing rain and holds the temperature under 90. That's the deal I
made with God during the midst of our summer season of hell, to
never complain about rain or cold weather again. I've kept my part
of the bargain thus far.
</P>
<P>
   The warm winds of last weekend stripped most of the trees in my
neighborhood of their leaves, save for stubborn red oaks, which
stubbornly try to hold on as long as possible. The pin oaks that
border my house on the west side gave up the battle easily and now
stand stripped and stark against a gray sky. Small, pear-shaped
leaves blanket the lawn, resistant to either raking or mulching.
</P>
<P>
   There's a game I played as a child, and I played it again the
other day while taking a break from reading outside. As a kid, I
would choose a large oak leaf, and then take a twig and puncture it
in two to three places, depending on its size. Then I would pull up
blades of grass and weave them through the holes in the leaf, three
blades horizontally, then three more vertically. As a child, I
considered this Leaf First-Aid, as if I was bandaging a wounded
soldier. Soon I would have a platoon of MASH patients, all doctored
up.
</P>
<P>
   The game doesn't last as long these days, but it's not a bad
diversion _ safer than whittling, for example.
</P>
<P>
   I'm lucky to be immune in this neighborhood from Leaf
Maintenance Mania. I only have one neighbor whose yard I can see.
Tall wooden fences separate my house from those behind, so their
lawn obsessions, if they have any, are of no concern to me. The lot
to the west and across the street are both vacant, still heavily
wooded. The neighbor whose yard borders mine has the same laissez
faire attitude about leaf maintenance I have. My philosophy is to
let all the leaves fall, chop up as many as possible with the lawn
mower, and eventually get around to raking the rest. Or not.
</P>
<P>
   In some neighborhoods, Leaf Maintenance Mania runs rampant. A
subdivision
</P>
<P>
   where all the yards are covered with leaves has a certain charm
to it. Then an overly ambitious resident ruins the ambience by
cleaning his yard, leaving an oasis of green amidst a sea of brown.
The other neighbors, within a few days, grudgingly join in, though
there's always at least one house whose curmudgeonly owner refuses
to bow to peer pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Sad to say, I was never the curmudgeon when I lived in town. I
aspire to be a curmudgeon, but I'm afraid I don't have the proper
sour disposition. Maybe that will come with age.
</P>
<P>
   I was never the first to clean up the yard, either, but I was
easily shamed into going along with the crowd. An entire weekend
would be wasted raking and bagging, mulching and blowing. Then by
Sunday afternoon, a warm front would bring in a 30-mph wind that
sent down a new cascade of pine needles and oak leaves, so that the
yard looked just as windswept as before.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, I passed through a subdivision and spied a
pretty, small blond woman using a leaf blower. It was one of those
high-dollar affairs that require the user to strap the motor on his
or her back. The poor woman looked like one of the characters from
the movie ``Ghostbusters,'' leading me to make up a new ditty:
``Who you gonna call? Leaf Busters!''
</P>
<P>
   I'm quite sure she wasn't enjoying herself.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf blowers are obnoxious machines. I own one and use it
reluctantly and rarely. (It's not the backpack model, thank
goodness.) The sound disrupts an entire neighborhood, and I'm quite
sure eventually a medical study will disclose that leaf blowers
cause impotence, impetigo and irascibility. Give me a broom and
some time. The swishing of the whisk against concrete is a good,
honest sound.
</P>
<P>
   I won't burn leaves either, or bag them. I dump them in the
vacant lot next door and let them turn back to earth. There's
nothing worse than a cacophony of leaf blowers and a few smoldering
piles of wet leaves to send one inside on even the most glorious of
days.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I am turning into a curmudgeon. I felt like stopping,
shaking that poor Leaf Buster woman by the shoulders, and telling
her to stop this foolishness, let the leaves fall until they're
through, then rake them into a compost pile and let them rot.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt she would have thought I was mad.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Journalists need the courage to change
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ A few weeks ago a relatively new Marshall News
Messenger reporter came to me with an exciting report: Someone had
agreed to tell us what had gone on in a closed-door meeting of a
local governmental agency.
</P>
<P>
   It was good, if odd, news. Newspapers can print almost anything
that is true, but public officials in private meetings can get
charged with a misdemeanor for telling us. If some public official
is willing to take that remarkable step, I might well print what
they have to say if it is newsworthy _ and if they understand that
we are going to use their name.
</P>
<P>
   When I related this to the reporter, his enthusiasm fell. ``We
have to use the person's name?'' he asked me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' I told him. ``We don't use stories with unnamed
sources.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a lie, of course. For most of the last year our paper
has had at least one story every day using an unnamed source. It is
how the press _ and the Republicans _ built their case against
President Bill Clinton. Come next year, somebody is going to win a
Pulitzer Prize based on stories they wrote rarely naming anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne corks will pop and journalistic legends made because
almost all of the really important facts were correct. Forget the
few big times that we screwed up; forget the dozens of minor errors
that subtly misled the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Because, by golly, were it not for the bending and breaking of a
few journalistic rules, the world never would have known about
Monica Lewinsky. We would never have known she performed oral sex
on Bill Clinton had not these brave reporters brought it all to
light.
</P>
<P>
   Say what? You mean we could have perhaps avoided this national
nightmare, this absolutely meaningless scandal, this televised
impeachment drivel, if only any of us had had some standards?
</P>
<P>
   I hope that Pulitzer will not be for Meritorious Public Service.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. This is not an indictment of the reporters.
Oh, no, for a fact, there was a cadre of sub-editors, editors and
publishers who could have _ and should have _ stopped this long
ago, or at least stopped it until people were willing to go on the
record.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, there were wire service editors who could have
said: ``This doesn't meet our standards. We aren't going to ship it
to the rest of America.'' So far as I know, there is not one wire
editor so brave.
</P>
<P>
   But do you know where the cowardice finally comes home to roost?
</P>
<P>
   Me.
</P>
<P>
   Me and several thousand journalists like me across the country
who don't believe in using unnamed sources except in the most
extreme of circumstances. (Forget it. You'll never convince me that
any two people on Earth having free and consensual oral sex is
newsworthy, much less extreme.)
</P>
<P>
   All of us had the power to make individual judgments not to run
these stories and every one of us still published every word. We
did it because we worried that everyone else was running the story
and heaven forbid that we do anything differently. We must be like
everyone else, lest our journalistic brethren think we are somehow
odd or, worse yet, going soft.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the report by special counsel Kenneth Starr was
released, all of us rushed to print the prurient details because
this was an Official Government Report. As an open record we had a
duty to print it.
</P>
<P>
   Never have so many journalists been so brilliantly manipulated.
Not even Bill Clinton has done it so well.
</P>
<P>
   Polls from every source show that, blah, blah, blah, the
American people, blah, blah, blah, are beginning to hate the press
and all journalists, blah, blah, blah.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares what the American people think?
</P>
<P>
   What concerns me is that I am beginning to hate myself.
</P>
<P>
   The people can adore you, worship you, but you still have to
face yourself in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   What all of us did was wrong, wrong, wrong, and I can't help but
wonder when I'm going to muster the courage to stand up against
this frightening wave.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Ill will from the nation's capitol
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - I call them Christmas messages we didn't want our
children to hear.
</P>
<P>
   While church bells toll good will to men, ill will resounds from
our nation's capitol. The president's lies are bad example enough
for America's children. The response from partisans in Congress is
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the wrong lessons our elected representatives
are teaching:
</P>
<P>
   In one nation under God, representatives must take sides
according to political party.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Bill McCullum of Florida, a member of the House
Judiciary Committee, speaks always of what ``the other side'' is
doing. But his ``side'' and ``the other side'' are us, Americans
all. We teach our children in civics that a representative votes on
behalf of all constituents, not just those of one political party.
</P>
<P>
   Do as I say, not as I do.
</P>
<P>
   That lesson from from Georgia GOP Rep. Bob Barr, who claims the
moral high ground as well as the cloak of ultimate legal authority.
(Nevermind that Justice John Marshall declared in 1803 that it's up
to the judiciary not the legislature to decide what's
constitutional.) Barr saw nothing immoral about agreeing to be the
keynote speaker at a meeting of the Council of Conservative
Citizens, an avowed white supremacist group. In his closing remarks
in the Judiciary Committee, he said, ``It's time for America to
learn Constitution 101.'' It may also be time for him to read the
Fourteenth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to listen to the president even if national
security is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, House majority whip, said
on ``Meet the Press'' that if President Clinton alerted
congressional leaders to a serious threat from Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein, he, for one, wouldn't believe him. The presidency isn't
the only institution for which DeLay shows disrespect. He regularly
calls the federal Environmental Protection Agency, ``the Gestapo.''
</P>
<P>
   No need for politicians to acknowledge hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mary Bono of California has publicly attributed her
husband's death in a ski accident to his prescription drug
addiction. The late Rep. Sonny Bono, whose seat she took, was
taking 20 different drugs, she said. She asked Gregory Craig, one
of the lawyers who presented the president's defense to the
Judiciary Committee, what he was going to tell his young children
about the president's behavior. What did she tell her children
about her husband's drug habit? Craig said he told his children the
reason the president is in so much trouble is because he didn't
always tell the truth. Children probably get that _ and they also
associate wrongdoing with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joanna Adams, pastor of Atlanta's Trinity Presbyterian
Church, told me of the 7-year-old who piped up in her Sunday School
class as the teacher talked about the Ten Commandments and said,
``Adultery_that's Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams believes some religious leaders have been hasty to defend
the president, to confirm his penitence. ``Only God knows if he has
truly repented,'' she said. Nevertheless, Adams doesn't believe a
political body is suited to taking a referendum on a leader's
character. She's critical of the self-rightousness of many House
members. ``It's scoundrels responding to a cad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As I listened to the president's opponents, I couldn't help
thinking how out of sync the tone with the humility the Christmas
story teaches. I read again the penitence references in the prayer
Rev. Adams sent me: ``We have done those things we ought not to
have done. And there is no health in us ... Spare Thou those, O
God, who confess their faults. Restore Thou those who are
penitent.'' Words worth considering as religious observances
commence amidst a national tragedy.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Fully compensated county officials need to put in a
full day's work
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``What is enough for a public official?'' asked
Montgomery County Recorder Joy Clark, in response to a reporter's
questions about her irregular office hours. ``Enough to get the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may take A.J. Wagner an hour a day, it may take me two
hours a day, it may take Joe Litvin 12 hours a day. I think I've
done an excellent, excellent job.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark went on to defend her record, saying she often works at
home and it's a ``24-hour job.'' But it was her initial quote _
``it may take A.J. Wagner one hour a day, it may take me two
hours'' _ that stopped me. Could she be more out of touch with the
average worker? With her own employees?
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry, but nobody who works two hours a day should be
earning $53,292 a year. Not on the taxpayers' tab, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's remarks showed little understanding of what most people
have to do to scrape together a living. Ironically, the story
appeared on the same day as the newspaper's ``Equal Work, Less
Pay'' series, which documented the two-tier pay system developing
in many workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Lieffring of Miamisburg, 25, is at the bottom of the pay
tier at the GM plant in Moraine. His wife is expecting the couple's
second child. ``We got sold out,'' he said. ``And the future
doesn't look any better for guys like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Stan Flaherty makes $8 an hour on the assembly line at the
Dayton Chrysler Corp. plant. The guy on either side of him makes
$20 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Colette Smith of Kettering quit her job at Taco Bell, with
dreams of earning big bucks at the Chrysler plant. A year later,
she earns $8.50 an hour _ a dollar raise.
</P>
<P>
   These workers, one suspects, would be thrilled to work full-time
_ heck, overtime _ for $53,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the county recorder's appearances are apparently so
infrequent they are referred to as a ``Joy Clark sighting.'' Clark
can talk all she wants about her comfy ergonomic chair at home, and
her many appointments in the community, but this is an office job.
It's a record-keeping job. It's not the kind of job that requires
the official to be out talking to schoolkids or visiting nursing
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder's office, as Clark argues, seems to be running
well. ``I'm obviously putting in the time and doing what is needed
to run one of the top offices in the state,'' she said. But is that
because of her leadership? Or is it because she has a good staff?
Current low-interest rates have created an avalanche of work.
Chances are staffers are putting in long weeks, for a lot less pay,
than Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the job for 15 years, and it was a 40-hour-a-week job,
and in peak times, more than that,'' said former county recorder
Vicki Pegg, now a Montgomery County Commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike you or me, county officials can't be fired if they fail
to show up for work. Show up once every 90 days, as state law is
now written, and county elected officials are in the clear.
</P>
<P>
   That might have made sense when the law was drafted, and the
officeholder may have been a farmer coming in from the fields. Not
now. State law should be changed to reflect modern times, and
modern salaries. The day of the political sinecure should be just
about done.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, though, the taxpayers are the only real boss.
We're paying their salaries so we need to pay better attention to
who they are and what they're doing. Maybe party chairs could use
some of their muscle as well, if elected officials aren't doing
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Am I picking on Clark? Her office runs well, after all, despite
her frequent absences.
</P>
<P>
   She earns $53,292 a year. For my tax dollar, that's a full-time
wage.

 &HT;    Amid rumblings over Clinton's Iraq motviation, give benefit of
doubt
 &HT;    By Roland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ On the eve of Monica Lewinsky's scheduled
testimony before a federal grand jury, my editor notified me that
President Clinton had ordered missile strikes against terrorist
bases.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped what I was writing and instead wrote that Americans
should support their commander in chief once U.S. troops are
ordered into harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of President Clinton's scheduled impeachment vote in
the House of Representatives, my editor notified me that Clinton
had ordered missile strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   I spiked what I had written and instead wrote that once the
bombs start to fall Americans need to put aside their political
differences and rally behind their men and women in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   It's a coincidence, I'm sure, that this reluctant-warrior
commander-in-chief studiously avoids the use of military force
until those moments when they conveniently provide him with needed
political cover.
</P>
<P>
   While denying that Clinton would manipulate national security
issues and jeopardize American lives for personal political
advantage, Clinton supporters nevertheless have been quick to point
out that those same accusations have been leveled at Republican
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   No excuse today
</P>
<P>
   If past presidents _ Republican or Democratic _ ordered military
combat for personal political benefit, their actions constituted a
betrayal of a sacred trust, not an excuse for future presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's the Pentagon's job to constantly be on the lookout
for enemies and be prepared to meet all threats, presidents will
never have a hard time justifying an order to send troops into
action. Generals and admirals would be out of a job if they
reported there were no threats to U.S. security.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein richly deserves the
missile attacks launched against his dangerous war machine, it's
natural that people will question Clinton's motives since the man
has systematically squandered his credibility with his near
pathological inability to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times describes Clinton as ``a man blessed with
great talent and afflicted with a mysterious passion for lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Partisan Democrats defend Clinton by first admitting that his
repeated lies ``violated the trust of the American people'' and
dishonored the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   With that sort of rousing defense of Clinton's character, no one
should be surprised that many Americans find it difficult to
believe a man who has never shown a reluctance to lie when a lie
would benefit him.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the troops Clinton sends into battle would feel better
about putting their lives on the line if they could trust the
motives of their commander in chief. It was telling that Clinton
felt it necessary to defend the timing of his decision to attack
Iraq when he addressed the nation.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk that Clinton pulled a ``Wag the dog'' trick the
last time he was in political trouble and ordered the missile
attack on terrorists bases in Sudan and Afghanistan. It didn't help
his credibility when the plant blown away in Sudan did nothing more
threatening than make vitamins and nutritional supplements and that
Osama bin Laden was elsewhere when U.S. missiles hit the targeted
terrorist camps in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to this latest attack on Iraq buttresses the belief of
many governmental scholars who say a president's most valuable
asset is his moral authority. With it, presidents can lead the
nation through the worst of times. Without it, they have no ability
to lead.
</P>
<P>
   All Americans should support their troops while they are risking
their lives to defend this nation.

 &HT;    Kudzu putting the squeeze on Christmas spirit
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kudzu. The name rings ominously. Thinking of it this
time of year always reminded me less of the spirit of peace and joy
than of the grinch that spreads misery. Until I met Dorothy
Greason.
</P>
<P>
   I visited her southwest Atlanta home on a recent Saturday and
discovered a kudzu Christmas; she collects the evil weed and turns
it into symbols of the season, including trees and wreaths and
baskets.
</P>
<P>
   Greason, a retired elementary school teacher, began her kudzu
craft in the 1980s in Memphis after noting the ``awful prices''
that artisans charged for baskets and other items at arts and craft
shows. ``I was going to take a basket-weaving class,'' she recalls,
``and then, one day I was walking by a field of kudzu, and I said,
`I can weave a basket from this.' I never took the class.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, James, moved to Atlanta (back, for him)
about 10 years ago, and she began collecting kudzu from a nearby
tennis court, which amounts to performing a public service. She
strips the vines of leaves, then works with them while they're
fresh and flexible.
</P>
<P>
   To baskets she added the Christmas items, which look much like
those woven from grapevines (ironic, as the kudzu blossom smells so
much like the Nehi grape soda that I still can taste from
childhood).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a huge wreath, decorated with plastic black and
green grapes and red birds, Greason showed me a strand of lights
woven into red-painted kudzu vines, a piece she recently had
completed.
</P>
<P>
   The piece de resistance, however, is at a friend's house.
(Greason used to make kudzu Christmas gifts for all her friends but
has cut back in recent years.)
</P>
<P>
   Off we go, driving to the other side of I-285, to Dorothy Jones'
home near Niskey Lake. There, hanging from the ceiling is a
10-foot-tall spiral tree made of kudzu. Greason made it five years
ago, and Jones has displayed it every year since, patching it when
necessary to keep it hanging tall. Too, she decorates it in
different colors each season.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the imposing tree, erected for Thanksgiving, has gold
decorations with white lights and drips dozens of carefully chosen
ornaments, including stars, birds, balls, each repeated several
times on the tree. ``Next year, I'll probably go red,'' says Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual tree naturally draws attention from holiday guests.
``Usually, it's the topic of conversation,'' Jones says.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, anything connected to kudzu inspires talk _ and in
many cases, fear. Gallows humor surrounds it: How do you make kudzu
grow? Feed it daily with used motor oil.
</P>
<P>
   Like dwarf bamboo, this vine wants to be the only plant in any
space. Yet, both can be as beautiful as they are invasive. Few
sights along the highway captivate like trees covered in deep
green, undulating drifts of kudzu _ trees getting smothered to
death.
</P>
<P>
   So much kudzu. Even as Greason and other artisans collect it all
through the year, it relentlessly marches north. Still, I ask
whether she's ever considered growing her own, to have a handy
supply right at her back door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord, no,'' Greason says quickly, chuckling. ``My husband
says, `Please make sure there are no seeds on any of the vines you
bring home.' If I started growing kudzu, he'd run me away from
here.''
</P>
<P>
   I take comfort in knowing that, as we joke, there is a serious
message: Not even the Christmas spirit can make anyone embrace the
vine we love to hate.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Evidently the people who came up with the George
Washington exhibition now at the New-York Historical Society had
two things in mind. First, they were moved by the assumption that
despite the more than two centuries in which the Father of Our
Country has been wildly lauded and lionized, few of us really know
him, or like him very much. Then they concluded that this state of
affairs might be changed if they showed us stuff like his false
teeth and his letters to his tailor ordering new breeches.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I have seen ``Treasures From Mount Vernon: George
Washington Revealed,'' I think both these notions were good ones.
As I walked in, I realized that although like all Americans, I had
probably been exposed to more icons, legends and lore about
Washington than about any other figure of national renown, my
feelings for the man were not really very different from those I
had for, say, James Madison or James Polk, respectful but hardly
warm. His image was at once as commonly accessible as a dollar bill
and as distantly aloof as that serious face looming from Mount
Rushmore. This was in contrast to the far more likable, maybe even
lovable, likes of Lincoln, Jefferson, Franklin and the Roosevelts.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I left the show, not only was I less estranged from
Washington, but in ways not unknown to aging sons, I had also come
to feel something close to sympathy for our venerable progenitor. I
even came up with a theory to explain why he has been held in such
tepid and less-than-heartfelt esteem, but more of that later.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, which is at the museum until Feb. 22 on the
first leg of a nationwide tour, includes items both predictable and
surprising. There are several portraits by Charles Willson Peale; a
life mask made as the president breathed through tubes stuck up his
nose, and the Spartanly outfitted tent he used in battle with an
intricate folding camp bed. There are swords and the key to the
Bastille that Washington received from Lafayette. There is the
battle sash that the wounded and dying Gen. Edward Braddock gave to
Washington along with the command of his British troops, then
besieged by French and Indian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Much more revealing are the various letters written by
Washington that are interspersed through the exhibition. For
instance, on July 18, 1755, nine days after Braddock's death.
Washington wrote to his brother John: ``As I have heard a
circumstantial account of my death and dying speech, I take this
early opportunity of contradicting both, and of assuring you that I
now exist and appear in the land of the living by the miraculous
care of Providence, that protected me beyond all human expectation;
I had 4 Bullets through my Coat, and two Horses shot under me, and
yet escaped unhurt.``
</P>
<P>
   How delightful. Here is the 23-year-old Washington, clearly
flushed in the excitement of battle, subordinating clear evidence
of bravery and boldness to expressions of modesty and piety. With
subtlety and grace he had combined the stoic ``aw, shucks, there
was nothing to it,'' sentiment with the rather dramatic facts of
the case, which involved four bullets and two horses.
</P>
<P>
   Uncharitably, it occurred to me that the youthful Washington,
unaware that Parson Weems would one day fabricate the legend of his
never lying about chopping down cherry trees or anything else, had
perhaps been tempted to exaggerate. After all, a year earlier in
another letter to his brother that is on display he had exulted,
``I heard the bullets whistle, and, believe me, there is something
charming in the sound.'' What if, in fact, only one horse had gone
down under him and only two bullets went harmlessly through his
jacket. I had no reason to doubt his account other than human
nature, life experience and self-awareness. Of course it could have
happened just the way he wrote it, but the very idea that in his
active youth he might have succumbed to an impulse to embellish
further endeared him to me.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the letter Washington wrote to Charles Lawrence,
his London tailor, in 1763 while he was managing Mount Vernon and
his vast land holdings. ``Be pleased to send me a genteel suit of
clothes made of superfine broadcloth handsomely chosen; I should
have enclosed my measure but in a general way they are so badly
taken here that I am convinced it would be of very little service;
I would have you therefore take measure of a gentleman who wears
well-made clothes of the following size _ to wit _ six feet high &AMP;
proportionally made; if anything rather slender than thick for a
person of that height and pretty long arms &AMP; thighs.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrific. Here is Washington, sending away to Old Fish Street in
London, willing to wait for the months it must have taken for his
letter to get there and more months for the suit to be made and
come back. Clearly impatient with the inability of finding good
help who could get the inseams right, he improvises a way to
communicate his needs. As the exhibition makes clear, once he
became president, he had his clothes made in the country he
fathered, sacrificing European style and craftsmanship to set a
patriotic example. Also commendable. One of Washington's
British-made suits is included.
</P>
<P>
   There are also letters by others that convey a Washington much
less standoffish than the one commonly portrayed. After a dinner at
Mount Vernon in 1777, Martha Dangerfield Bland, the wife of a
colonel, wrote to her sister: ``Gen. Washington throws off the hero
and takes on the chatty agreeable companion. He can be downright
impudent sometimes _ such impudence, Fanny, as you and I like!!!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   So let us sum up what we have learned so far. Washington does
not shy from derring-do and knows how to project himself favorably
though modestly. He is vain about his appearance and clothes. And
he knows how to flirt quite well. All of which is to his credit.
</P>
<P>
   Now is there any mystery or are there any unexplained details
that might add to his mystique? Well, what about the hundreds of
letters he wrote to his wife, which she burned upon his death? One
was tucked behind a drawer and survived, and it is in the
exhibition. Written in 1775 as the general was leaving Philadelphia
to take command of the army in Boston, it reads, ``I retain an
unalterable affection for you, which neither time or distance can
change.``
</P>
<P>
   What was in the burned material? Was it hot? Did he ask her to
burn the letters? Did Martha, who by the way always called her
husband the general, at least in front of others, do it on her own?
Was it right of her to do it? Did she violate posterity's right to
know? If so, to know what? Did she protect her husband's privacy or
his reputation? Without belaboring the issue, these are obviously
timely questions.
</P>
<P>
   And now we come to the unquestioned highlight of the show. The
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at George Washington's false teeth, George Washington's
bridge, so to speak, is a profound experience. It evokes a feeling
not unlike the one that dawns with the realization that your
parents and even your grandparents must have had sex at least once.
You cannot look at the teeth and not realize the humanity of their
owner. They are not of wood as some have described them; they are a
quite handsome set of choppers, fashioned from human teeth, cow
teeth and elephant ivory all embedded in seemingly heavy plates of
gray lead-based metal. The uppers and lowers are hinged at the
corners by small springs. Washington told John Adams that he had
lost his natural teeth after using them to crack too many walnuts
in his youth.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the teeth there is a letter Washington sent to Dr.
Greenwood, their maker, in 1797 when he was president. Like the
others on display it is written in his own hand, a forceful, neat
and legible script free of the curlicues and flourishes that then
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must again resort to you for assistance. The teeth herewith
enclosed have, by degrees, worked loose; and, at length, two or
three of them have given away altogether. I would thank you for
returning them as soon as possible for although I now make use of
another set, they are both uneasy in the mouth and bulge my lips
out in such a manner as to make them appear considerably swelled.''
</P>
<P>
   As I observed the teeth and read the letter, I felt another
surge of sympathy. I also began to develop my theory why I and
maybe others had not been more inspired by Washington and his life.
Bad teeth and swollen lips are not a tragedy, but they do reveal
suffering and they are just about the only sign of something having
gone wrong with Washington's life, unless you also consider the
line in his will in which he wrote that his ``Expectation of having
Issue has ceased.''
</P>
<P>
   As generally portrayed, his was a life of successive triumphs
and compounded virtues and what challenges there were, like that
winter at Valley Forge, always led to greater victories. Washington
performed truly great deeds, salvaging a revolution and defeating
the army of the world's most powerful state and later spurning
offers to make him king. But without humanizing weaknesses and
without the touch of tragedy, can heroes be lovable, particularly
in our time?
</P>
<P>
   What in Washington's life was comparable to Lincoln's depression
and marital conflict and to the national tragedy of his
assassination or FDR's wheelchair? It occurred to me as I left the
museum that those who had handled Washington's spin, either by
burning his letters or writing the hagiographic early biographies,
had done a brilliant job, at least for the 19th century, when a
blameless life of steady triumphs tended to enhance a leader's
popularity. But after Freud, when sins and guilts and failures
became so much more important in taking the full measure of a man,
that obviously no longer worked so well.
</P>
<P>
   Quite correctly, the exhibition stopped short of turning the
first president into a complex modern hero deserving of compassion
as well as admiration. It was not at all an iconoclastic case of
warts and all, and the subject emerged still eminently worthy of
respect. But he is brought down to earth and humanized. With teeth
like that, it is very hard to remain a plaster saint.
</P>

   INTERNATIONAL NEWS (``i'' category)
</P>
<P>
   REPORTER-MURDERED (Undated) _ Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo
ordered a second autopsy of San Antonio Express-News journalist
Philip True after authorities said he died of strangulation, not a
fall down a mountain slope as originally believed. By CARMINA
DANINI.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL NEWS (``a'' category)
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-BIRTHS (Sacramento, Calif.) _ San Francisco residents have
fewer babies than anywhere else in the state, making the city the
only place in California destined to lose population over the next
40 years, a new state report predicts. By ROBERT SALLADAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOLARS-IMPEACHMENT (San Francisco) _ The majority of Americans
may think a vote to impeach President Clinton is unfair, but
presidential and constitutional law scholars say Congress has every
right to buck public opinion and vote to oust the president. By
ZACHARY COILE.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS-FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   WORKING-COLUMN (Undated) _ If you want to look into someone's
soul, just take a close look at his face. According to a
self-styled face reader, the wrinkles, dimples and droops reveal a
life of happiness, tragedy and everything in between. Eyelids are
the barometer of life, said Mac Fulfer, a lawyer from Fort Worth
who taught himself how to ``read'' faces. By L.M. SIXEL.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ It's gearing up to be another banner
season for shopping on line. Some analysts estimate that 40 percent
of all Internet users will buy something over the World Wide Web.
Two masters of direct consumer-PC sales, Gateway and Micron
Electronics, have made the process of selecting and purchasing a
computer system on the Web not just painless, but fun. By DWIGHT
SILVERMAN.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-HELPLINE (Undated) _ A reader wants to know about the
rumors he has heard about Windows 95 and 98 and it not being able
to hold more than 64 megabytes of memory. It's not true. By DWIGHT
SILVERMAN.
</P>
<P>
   FASTFOOD-MINORITIES (Houston) _ The fast-food industry is
sizzling with talk of ``emerging markets.'' These hotbeds of
opportunity are not in Brazil, Thailand or Poland. Their emerging
markets are minority neighborhoods in urban America, according to
International Franchise Association lingo. But while the largest
fast-food restaurants have been adding minority owners, minority
ownership still lags. By REBECCA MOWBRAY (Photos available on the
NYT database.)
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   THEME-RESTAURANTS (San Antonio) _ San Francisco, a perennial
contender for world's greatest restaurant city, is curiously short
on one kind of restaurant that has swept over much of the rest of
the world: the big-bang, big-theme, show-biz restaurant. Actually,
the city _ with its 3,400 licensed restaurants, only two of which
are themed _ may not need the theme restaurants that flourish
elsewhere. By DAVID ARMSTRONG.
</P>
<P>
   MONOPOLY-NAVY (Houston) _ Millions of landlubbers have fallen
under the spell of its pastel-colored paper money and plots of land
from Mediterranean Avenue to Boardwalk. Now Monopoly is reeling in
sailors with a new U.S. Navy edition and the opportunity to buy
aircraft carriers and the Blue Angels. By DAI HUYNH.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-EGYPT (Undated) _ ``The Prince of Egypt'' is a hard
sell. Critics know it. The studio knows it. Probably even Moses
knows it, or he would if he were around to dwell on such things. A
biblically inspired, resolutely unsilly animated musical aimed at
grown-ups is not the sort of movie generally paired with the term
``blockbuster.'' By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-EGYPT-PROFILE (Dallas) _ Will ``Prince of Egypt'' be king
of the box office? DreamWorks' Jeffrey Katzenberg talks about the
studio's gamble with the animated Biblical epic. By LOUIS PARKS.
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-MONKEYS-PROFILE (Undated) _ Actor Michael Ontkean talks
about ``Summer of the Monkeys,'' a family film that went straight
to video and is being issued under Disney's name. By BRUCE
WESTBROOK
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-MAIL (Undated) _ ``Youv'e Got Mail'' has two
absolutely beguiling stars in Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, a clever,
straight-from-the-news premise, and New York's Upper West Side at
Christmas time. That's a lot for any movie to have going for it. By
JANE GAHAHL.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-ISLAND (Undated) _ ``The Island on Bird Street,'' a
movie about a boy who survives on his own for week after week in
the ruined shell of the Warsaw Ghetto, is maddeningly true to its
hero. By EDVINS BEITIKS.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Count me out. I never got the
memo. I'm not impeaching anyone and I'm not launching cruise
missiles at anyone. But I've thought about the latter. Just as I
was making my list of people who deserve to be hit by cruise
missiles, unlike Iraqi civilians, one landed on House
Speaker-designate Robert Livingston. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Two are selling scotch, one a
luxury car, another an inexpensive wine and the worst of the bunch,
tequila. What the five current ads have in common is, they drive me
seriously nuts. Each insults my intelligence, two insult my dignity
as a woman and one is a raised middle finger to all but a
privileged, white, upwardly mobile class. By STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-ATTACK (San Francisco) _ Watching President William
Jefferson Clinton give his speech on Wednesday, an hour after Iraqi
bombing was initiated, I realized I haven't been this upset
listening to a president since the days of Lyndon Johnson. I wanted
to rush out and yell, ``No! You can't slaughter people to save your
career. Stop, stop, stop!'' By JOAN STEINAU LESTER.

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ The leaves are falling
quickly now, after an unexpected fine autumnal display. Enjoying
them necessarily means leaving them on the ground. (Borders,
Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   EZZARD-COLUMN _ ATLANTA - I call them Christmas messages we
didn't want our children to hear. While church bells toll good will
to men, ill will resounds from our nation's capitol. The
president's lies are bad example enough for America's children. The
response from partisans in Congress is worse. (Ezzard, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Austin lost a funky little family
business Thursday when Andrew ``B.B.'' Castan(tilde)on closed his

has yet to be conquered. (Latham, Marshall News Messenger) MOVED
FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ All Americans should support
their troops while they are risking their lives to defend this
nation. And, as difficult as it may be, they should give President
Clinton the benefit of their considerable doubts that this time he
really meant what he said. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED
FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ State law should be changed to
reflect modern times, and modern salaries. The day of the political
sinecure should be just about done. Am I picking on Montgomery
County Recorder Joy Clark? Her office runs well, after all, despite
her frequent absences. But she earns $53,292 a year. For my tax
dollar, that's a full-time wage. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED
FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The bombing in Iraq not only degraded Saddam
Hussein's ability to wage chemical, biological and nuclear war. It
also further degraded American politics _ however much that might
have seemed impossible beforehand. (Tom Teepen is national
correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ ``General Faversham is a director of Her
Majesty's Royal Chelsea Flower Show and senior fanfare officer for

   HEALTH-XMASDINNER _ What's in that Christmas dinner you're about
to wolf down that causes that full, lethargic feeling? (Lore,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTO. FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   WARNER-ON-WOOD _ ATLANTA _ I've been missing something about
rustic furniture. I can see now that if the right woodworker gets
into this stuff, the results can be something remarkable. (Warner,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   RABBI-FUTURE _ The next generation of Jews will be volunteers.
The volunteer corps will wrestle with God in an emerging Jewish
life driven by compassion and justice rooted in authentic spiritual
experience. And it will shape a Judaism that energetically recruits
converts, recognizes women fully, welcomes and ordains practicing
homosexuals, presides over same sex unions and embraces
intermarried couples. Rabbi Alexander Schindler thinks that's what
the future holds. And what Schindler thinks has shaped much of
American Jewish thought for more than 20 years. (Gushee, Palm Beach

in hospital intensive care unitts do. And many poor people do.
(Sibley, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). FOR SUNDAY

   FASHION
</P>
<P>
   HERRERA _ Photo-driven centerpiece on designer Carolina Herrera,
who staged a show recently at the Ritz to show her spring/summer
'99 collection. Herrera, 58, didn't start designing until age 40,
and now that her most loyal clients are aging, she's shifting gears
and targeting women under 40. (Walton, Atlanta

<P>
   ATLANTA-ARTS _ Was 1998 the Year of Atlanta in arts and letters?
And, if so, was it a good one or a bad one? The city served many
purposes for the bi-coastal engines of national media and
communiations. Tom Wolfe and Alfred Uhry (twice) used it as a pulpy
story setting, a well of ambition, greed, intolerance and animal
high spirits; Disney used it as test-market without a troublesome
sense of discernment; D.C.-based Americans for the Arts booked it
for their June 99 confab. Kenny Leon, Pearl Cleage and other local
figures jumped to the national stage, while the NBAF fell off it
(and the Arts Festival, never having made it, fell, period). Are
there meaningful patterns to be read in these entrails? What if
anything does it say about Atlanta? (Hulbert, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). WITH COLOR ILLUSTRATIONS . FOR SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   GODS-DIRECTOR _ Writer director Bill Condon talks about ``Gods
and Monsters,'' his complex, sorrowful meditation about the final
days of the life of ``Frankenstein'' director James Whale, who was
found drowned in his pool in 1957. (StMurray, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). FOR SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   SKUBE-BOOKS _ The books we keep are ones that read us as much as
we read them. More than any gift that comes to mind, they are a
reflection of our taste and our curiosity, our capacity for
discrimination and enjoyment. On my shelves are books read and
unread, books by the hundreds that I want to keep for as long as I
live and at least as many that I should winnow out before the start
of a New Year. But there are seven that at various points of my
life meant, and still mean, something special. They sit, unnoticed
on most days, like signposts to Christmases past _ and to ties
everlasting. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). FOR SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-PETS _ Gatsby never had it so great. Natalie Spalding of
Atlanta and her faithful Jack Russell terrier had a grand time in
France on a Dordogne Doggie Walk organized by Europeds. The
Monterey, Calif., tour operator, which has organized walking and
cycling tours in Europe for 17 years, became an industry pioneer
when it inaugurated doggie walks in Dordogne and Provence last
year. (Thrasher, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH COLOR PHOTOS.
FOR SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-PETS-BOOKS _ A roundup of books and other resources for
folks traveling with pets. (Thrasher, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). FOR SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   BALSAMINN _ The Balsam Mountain Inn is a place of comfort and
joy throughout the year, but at Christmastime, a special cheer
enfolds the 42,000-square-foot North Carolina inn nestled on 26
acres less than a mile from the Blue Ridge Parkway and surrounded
by peaks rising to more than 6,000 feet. (Thrasher, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS and B/W LAYOUT. FOR SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   HOME &AMP; GARDEN
</P>
<P>
   LANDSCAPE-DESIGNER _ Meet Dan Franklin, the Atlanta landscape
architect whose tongue is as acid as Georgia soil and as well known
as his award-winning designs and much-visited garden. Gardening is
what keeps him young (he's 83) _ that and enjoying his work,
staying active in his industry, peddling his stationary bike 20
minutes a day and swilling a cocktail in his Collier Hills back
yard. There, he spent eight years developing the bones of a garden,
which Franklin knew was critical before the first daffodil could
ever be planted. A How the Pros Live. (Flanders, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). WITH COLOR PHOTOS and LAYOUT. FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   MAY-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Kudzu. The name rings ominously. Thinking
of it this time of year always reminded me less of the spirit of
peace and joy than of the grinch that spreads misery. Until I met
Dorothy Greason. I visited her southwest Atlanta home on a recent
Saturday and discovered a kudzu Christmas; she collects the evil
weed and turns it into symbols of the season, including trees and
wreaths and baskets. (May, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED FOR

   ATLANTA-ARTS _ Was 1998 the Year of Atlanta in arts and letters?
And, if so, was it a good one or a bad one? The city served many
purposes for the bi-coastal engines of national media and
communiations. Tom Wolfe and Alfred Uhry (twice) used it as a pulpy
story setting, a well of ambition, greed, intolerance and animal
high spirits; Disney used it as test-market without a troublesome
sense of discernment; D.C.-based Americans for the Arts booked it
for their June 99 confab. Kenny Leon, Pearl Cleage and other local
figures jumped to the national stage, while the NBAF fell off it

FATHOMING THAT COMPLEX CREATURE, WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ My moment of enlightenment happened as I stood at a
railing on the third floor of the Marshall Field department store
here in the Loop recently. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was looking down through the Christmas decorations onto the
first-floor cosmetic counters. There I saw two women sitting on
tall chairs. Other women who worked in the store were applying
makeup to these women as countless Christmas shoppers wandered by. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amazing, I thought. I do not know one male who would subject
himself to such a public spectacle in pursuit of looking better
through chemistry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That, clearly, is one of the primary differences between the
sexes. Try to imagine a man you know _ or even you yourself, if,
like me, you are male _ sitting in a busy department store and
having some clerk brushing here and painting there to improve the
looks of that man. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have seen too much in life to insist it would never happen.
But I have never seen it happen. I did not see it happen in
Marshall Field's store. And I don't expect to see it happen before
I get carted off to the home and equipped with my own drool apron. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've been thinking about the differences between males and
females as the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal has unfolded, including why
it was so easy to believe that the Tripp-Lewinsky conversations,
caught on tape, were real. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I grew up as the only boy in a house full of four children,
which, by my count, means three were sisters. (And to the best of
my recollection, they were.) And I helped rear two daughters and no
sons. So I know some things about women that men without my vast
experience may not appreciate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing I know _ and love _ about women is that they often are
really good at talking with each other about private things.
Somehow women find it helpful and maybe even therapeutic to discuss
with other women their feelings about deeply intimate emotions. I
envy that, though I recognize that I may not be capable of it
because of some genetic structure related to my being male. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Men may be better about engaging in this kind of talk than they
used to be, but as a rule, the level of sharing about such things
among men rarely rises above the level of this question: ``So,
Harvey, tell me: You keeping as busy in the bedroom as you always
want us to believe?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, in turn, is likely to respond: ``You guys only wish you
were a stud like me.'' The next question, with barely time for a
breath, is likely to be: ``Yeah? Well, how about them Denver
Broncos?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's why, when women send daughters out into the world, they
prefer a long weekend together in which they may share private
hopes, dreams and advice. Men, generally, are content to walk a son
to the door as he leaves the nest, pat the kid on the butt and say,
``Go get 'em, Ace.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My own father was even briefer. As I left home permanently in
1967, he walked me out to the 1964 Rambler he had traded me for my
1958 Chevy, looked to see that the tires were full of air, shook my
hand and said, ``Write.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the paper hiring me is paying me to do,'' I said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that, knuckle-head. Write HOME once in a while.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My mother, meanwhile, stood behind him crying. I didn't
understand then why she was crying. But I know now she was upset I
wasn't a daughter who would engage in deep emotional sharing with
her. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This was the same mother who, when I reached the age when I had
quit growing in length and would grow only in breadth, took me to
this same Marshall Field's store in Chicago to buy me a decent
sports coat I could take to college and not embarrass myself if I
had to get semi-dressed up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a deep forest-green, herring-bone coat. All wool. I was
aghast at its cost _ $60 or so, an unimaginable fortune to me in
1963. I loved that jacket so much as an 18-year-old kid that I
wanted to wear it home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So I put it on and went down to Field's first floor cosmetic
counter to see if it would attract women. But they were too busy
getting made up to notice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I should have stood up on the third floor and whistled
down at them. Or told them some day we'd have a president named
Bill and it might be me. (Would that have risen to the level of
impeachable perjury?) &QL;

<P>
   Four decades ago a Third World dictator threatened American
interests in a crucial region. Unwilling to pay the costs of an
invasion or settle for containment, U.S. policymakers convinced
themselves that a cheap and easy third option existed: support for
some of the dictator's domestic opponents, whose efforts would
supposedly spark a popular uprising and topple the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting invasion attempt by Cuban exiles at the Bay of
Pigs turned into one of the worst fiascoes in the history of
American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Recently _ perhaps incredibly _ one of the hottest
foreign-policy ideas in Washington has been to use the Iraqi
opposition to overthrow Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   From congressional leaders to former government officials, this
option _ to ``roll back'' the power of Saddam Hussein by supporting
opposition groups within Iraq, has been touted as the way to go.
From the pages of The Weekly Standard, National Review and
Commentary to The New Republic and columnists at The New York
Times, The Washington Post and The Nation, support for the Iraqi
opposition has become the leading alternative to the Clinton
administration's policy.
</P>
<P>
   One recent letter urging the president to back Saddam's foes
more strongly was signed by three former Republican national
security advisers, three former Republican secretaries of defense,
and seven former Republican subcabinet officials. Yet another
prominent supporter of the idea has been Clinton's first CIA
director, R. James Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, in October Congress even rushed to embrace an Iraq
Liberation Act, authorizing a whopping $97 million in military aid
to democratic Iraqi resistance groups. The president's staff was
unenthusiastic, but Clinton signed rather than pick a fight.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea behind the option is simple: The United States
should refuse to accept the continued rule of Saddam Hussein and
help install the Iraqi opposition in his place.
</P>
<P>
   As Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) put it, ``The
doctrine here has to be rollback, not containment.''
</P>
<P>
   In The New Republic, former Under-Secretary of Defense Paul
Wolfowitz wrote, ``Toppling Saddam is the only outcome that can
satisfy the vital U.S. interest in a stable and secure Gulf region,
because, to a degree unique among contemporary tyrannies, the Iraqi
regime is Saddam Hussein. ... The vast majority of Iraqis want him
out, though only those with a death wish say so openly. We must
help them.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that Saddam could supposedly be replaced at
relatively low cost _ even, many advocates argue, without ever
committing American ground troops. The world could be free of
Saddam, Wolfowitz argued in recent testimony before Congress, if
the Clinton administration would only ``muster the necessary
strength of purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The fly in the ointment is that this is simply not true. Even if
mere ``rollback'' were desirable, any policy to bolster a
successful attack by the Iraqi opposition would have to be
militarily feasible, amenable to American allies whose cooperation
would be required for implementation, and acceptable to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   Those who tout this prescription as superior to existing U.S.
policy are either engaging in wishful thinking or cynically playing
politics. For the United States to undertake a policy of rollback
in Iraq _ using any of already stated plans, at least _ would be a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the impression sometimes given by backers of the
Iraqi opposition, there is no single, simple rollback plan.
Instead, three competing variants of the idea have been put
forward: using airpower to oust Saddam, helping the opposition
seize large chunks of Iraq or sponsoring a guerrilla war by his
foes.
</P>
<P>
   In the airpower approach, the United States would team up with
the Iraqi opposition for a decisive military campaign against the
regime. The problem here is that almost all the heavy lifting would
be done by the United States, which would incur huge costs without
being assured of success in return.
</P>
<P>
   It would be undertaken after the United States had helped the
Iraqi opposition recruit, train and equip tens of thousands of
soldiers for limited conventional warfare. Ultimately, when this
opposition army was ready to take the field, the United States
would launch an air offensive against Saddam's forces to devastate
Iraqi combat formations, logistics, command and control, and
rear-echelon positions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would require the opposition to capture Iraq's cities
from the regime's armed forces. Opposition troops would have to
fight these battles largely on their own, because it would be
difficult for U.S. planes and missiles to destroy Iraqi ground
units hiding in the concrete jungles of modern cities and because,
in order to limit civilian casualties, U.S. rules of engagement
would prohibit bombing urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even battered Republican Guard divisions would be too much
for the weak opposition forces to handle in urban combat. Saddam's
foes would probably lose on the ground even if the United States
were to devote a massive air campaign to aiding them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the approach might lead Saddam to unleash his chemical
and biological weapons _ his jealously guarded ace in the hole _
against the United States and its Middle Eastern allies. Saddam was
never close enough to being toppled during the Gulf War to use
these weapons of last resort. Slowly pushing him to the wall would
give him every reason to lash out with his arsenal, while removing
all incentives for restraint.
</P>
<P>
   This plan, in short, would involve fighting a preventive war
against Iraq from a standing start but using opposition troops
instead of U.S. ground forces. Its costs and risks would make it an
extremely grave and unpopular endeavor, even if it were sold as a
way to settle the problem of Saddam once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the opposition might well lose, leaving the
administration with the agonizing choice of either leaving Saddam
to crow over his escape, continuing the air campaign or sending
U.S. troops to occupy Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   To have attempted a rollback of Iraq's regime by relying on an
opposition ground attack, along with U.S. airpower, then, would
have been incredibly risky and more likely to box in Washington
than liberate Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the generous assumptions that only 12 of Iraq's 23
divisions would actually fight (six army and six Republican Guard)
and that each division could be effectively destroyed with 500 air
sorties, it would take 6,000 sorties to deal with these units
alone. About the same number would be required to attack Iraqi
military installations, logistical support and tactical
command-and-control assets _ a combined total of 12,000 sorties, or
just over half of the 22,000 flown against similar targets by
coalition aircraft during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   An air campaign supporting an Iraqi opposition ground offensive
would also require significant attention to targets that were not
high priorities in Desert Storm. The United States would have to
move to stop periodic counterattacks by Iraqi heavy divisions
against the lightly armed opposition formations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. air forces would have to pummel a handful of Iraqi units
for weeks until they cracked, wait for the opposition forces to
move in and brace themselves for counterattack, then start pounding
the next set of Iraqi ground formations, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's pace would also be dictated by the weakness and
inexperience of opposition units. Because Iraqi targets and combat
formations would have to be kept suppressed and dispersed for
months, the air campaign in question would probably require 80,000
to 100,000 sorties.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it is best unproven and at worst foolish to argue that
U.S. airpower could eliminate Iraqi ground forces and enable an
opposition army to march on Baghdad virtually unopposed.

<P>
   Yet even battered Republican Guard divisions would be too much
for the weak opposition forces to handle in urban combat. Saddam's
foes would probably lose on the ground even if the United States
were to devote a massive air campaign to aiding them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the approach might lead Saddam to unleash his chemical
and biological weapons _ his jealously guarded ace in the hole _
against the United States and its Middle Eastern allies. Saddam was
never close enough to being toppled during the Gulf War to use
these weapons of last resort. Slowly pushing him to the wall would
give him every reason to lash out with his arsenal, while removing
all incentives for restraint.
</P>
<P>
   This plan, in short, would involve fighting a preventive war
against Iraq from a standing start but using opposition troops
instead of U.S. ground forces. Its costs and risks would make it an
extremely grave and unpopular endeavor, even if it were sold as a
way to settle the problem of Saddam once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the opposition might well lose, leaving the
administration with the agonizing choice of either leaving Saddam
to crow over his escape, continuing the air campaign or sending
U.S. troops to occupy Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   To have attempted a rollback of Iraq's regime by relying on an
opposition ground attack, along with U.S. airpower, then, would
have been incredibly risky and more likely to box in Washington
than liberate Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the generous assumptions that only 12 of Iraq's 23
divisions would actually fight (six army and six Republican Guard)
and that each division could be effectively destroyed with 500 air
sorties, it would take 6,000 sorties to deal with these units
alone. About the same number would be required to attack Iraqi
military installations, logistical support and tactical
command-and-control assets _ a combined total of 12,000 sorties, or
just over half of the 22,000 flown against similar targets by
coalition aircraft during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   An air campaign supporting an Iraqi opposition ground offensive
would also require significant attention to targets that were not
high priorities in Desert Storm. The United States would have to
move to stop periodic counterattacks by Iraqi heavy divisions
against the lightly armed opposition formations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. air forces would have to pummel a handful of Iraqi units
for weeks until they cracked, wait for the opposition forces to
move in and brace themselves for counterattack, then start pounding
the next set of Iraqi ground formations, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's pace would also be dictated by the weakness and
inexperience of opposition units. Because Iraqi targets and combat
formations would have to be kept suppressed and dispersed for
months, the air campaign in question would probably require 80,000
to 100,000 sorties.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it is best unproven and at worst foolish to argue that
U.S. airpower could eliminate Iraqi ground forces and enable an
opposition army to march on Baghdad virtually unopposed.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In Washington recently, three separate plans have been advanced
by which the U.S. armed forces would support Iraqi opposition
groups in an effort to overthrow Saddam Hussein. One of these
unwise ideas is called the ``enclave option.''
</P>
<P>
   Its proponents argue that the United States essentially would
help the opposition umbrella group known as the Iraqi National
Congress (INC) seize and hold large enclaves inside Iraq, from
which it would proceed to undermine Saddam's rule.
</P>
<P>
   This plan, however, is militarily ludicrous and would almost
certainly end in either direct American intervention or a massive
bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
   The enclave approach calls for the United States to declare the
rebel group, INC, as the legitimate government of Iraq, provide it
with the Iraqi regime's frozen assets, and help it recruit, train
and equip a highly mobile light infantry force of 10,000 to 20,000
troops, most of whom would be former Iraqi military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   These forces would then invade and occupy Iraqi Kurdistan, in
the country's north, and all of Iraq west of the Euphrates River
and south of the 32nd parallel, which would collectively be
declared ``Free Iraq.'' The United States would lift economic
sanctions on these zones and use airpower to help defend them from
Iraqi counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   By providing a haven for defectors and reducing Saddam's area of
control to the Mesopotamian river valleys, Baghdad and some of the
northwest, the INC argues, this strategy would either make the
Iraqi regime disintegrate or leave it vulnerable to an independent
rebel military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The INC has suggested that the entire operation would cost
little, take only a year or two and require such scant direct U.S.
military involvement that there would be almost no risk of
substantial American casualties.
</P>
<P>
   As the INC's president, Ahmed Chalabi, told a Senate hearing
last spring, ``Give the Iraqi National Congress a base protected
from Saddam's tanks, give us the temporary support we need to feed
and house and care for the liberated population, and we will give
you a free Iraq, an Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction, and a
free-market Iraq. Best of all, the INC will do all this for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the plan promises a huge payoff at a tiny cost, it has
unsurprisingly become the darling of Congress and critics of the
Clinton administration. It could well become popular with the
American public too.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that the plan is so flawed and unrealistic that it
would lead inexorably to a replay of the Bay of Pigs. U.S.
officials would ultimately face the choice of intervening directly
or watching the rebels get butchered _ as happened with the INC's
last attempt to spark an insurrection, in northern Iraq from 1992
to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As the Middle East Institute's Andrew Parasiliti has observed,
``the INC enjoys more support along the Potomac than the
Euphrates.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-nine percent of the opposition's combat power comes from
two Kurdish militias operating in the north, Massud Barzani's
Democratic Party of Kurdistan (DPK) and Jalal Talabani's Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK), and one Shiite militia operating in the
south, the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq
(SAIRI).
</P>
<P>
   Each group has its own agenda, and all have distanced themselves
from the umbrella organization. The leaders of all three groups
have said they are willing to coordinate their efforts but will not
follow the lead of Chalabi.
</P>
<P>
   Internal opposition squabbling aside, America's regional allies
hate the plan. The Kuwaitis, Saudis, Jordanians and Turks adamantly
oppose all rollback efforts that do not include the direct use of
U.S. military power to ensure victory, fearing that half-hearted
efforts will fail and leave them facing Saddam's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that this plan is not just militarily
infeasible but downright dangerous. Even if one believes that
Kurdish forces alone, say, could hold the north, the plan still
would require some 10,000 to 20,000 lightly armed opposition troops
to control roughly 1,000 kilometers of land inside southern and
western Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   This is an absurd force-to-space ratio. In contrast, U.S. Army
doctrine calls for a 20,000-man armored division to defend no more
than 15 to 35 kilometers of front.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the entire regular Iraqi army were to just remain
passive _ which has not been the case over the last eight years _
opposition troops would still face attacks from Saddam's 70,000-man
Republican Guard and 25,000-man Special Republican Guard. They
would have to hold vast stretches of territory without armor and at
a five-to-one numerical disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a strategy of defending enclaves inside Iraq cedes the
initiative to Saddam once the opposition forces reach the Euphrates
and the 32nd parallel, letting him choose the time and place of
subsequent battles.
</P>
<P>
   Even U.S. air support could not protect the opposition troops
because Iraqi attacks could come during bad weather or simply at
night, when the U.S. ability to interdict ground troops is greatly
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The United States simply does not have enough all-weather strike
aircraft to keep enough warplanes in the Persian Gulf to respond
instantaneously to regime attacks on opposition units inside Iraq
for the months and perhaps years that it would take to topple
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Iraq is also particularly ill suited to this kind of
insurrection. The south's open desert terrain would be ideal for
Iraqi armored operations, and the area southwest of the Euphrates
is extremely sparsely populated. New opposition recruits would have
to come from Basra, Iraq's second-largest city, which Saddam would
be certain to defend furiously.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Saddam could muster 10,000 to 15,000 loyal troops in
Basra's defense _ and remembering that U.S. air support would be of
limited help in urban operations, because of the doctrine to limit
civilian casualties _ Basra poses an insurmountable obstacle. A
tiny Iraqi rebel army could not survive without taking it but would
almost certainly be destroyed if it tried.
</P>
<P>
   For this enclave approach to have even a remote chance of
success, one of two assumptions would have to prove correct: that
the Iraqi regime and its armed forces would simply fall apart when
presented with a serious challenge, or that a few inexperienced
opposition light infantry brigades could somehow rise up to defeat
several Iraqi heavy divisions in open combat. Both are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   During the Gulf War, Iraq's armed forces were subjected to 39
days of incessant bombing, leaving them thoroughly demoralized. But
during the ground war, key units like the Republican Guard still
fought extraordinarily hard. These troops would fight once more
against the Iraqi opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider the Iraqi rebels' military track record to date.
At Basra and Kirkuk in 1991 and again at Irbil in 1996, Iraqi army
and Republican Guard units easily crushed dug-in rebel Kurdish and
Shiite light infantry. The only opposition success came against the
Iraqi 38th Infantry Division _ the worst formation in the Iraqi
army, and at a time when that unit was demoralized, depleted,
surprised and without much armor or artillery support.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the INC bravely claims that it could emulate the success
of Chad in 1986-87, whose rebel forces smashed Libyan armored
power. But the Chadian army was made up of battle-hardened veterans
who had fought together for years and developed a high degree of
unit cohesion. Its military leadership was superb. And the enemy
Libyan army in 1986 was one of the most inept on earth.
</P>
<P>
   While hardly first-rate, the Iraqi army is more professional,
more experienced and better trained. And the combined Iraqi
opposition has no military organization at all. If the past is any
guide, it probably could not field a competent force even if given
years to train and recruit.
</P>
<P>
   The INC leadership has shown little flair for field command,
identifying competent leaders, or honing their command skills. And
the finest soldiers the Iraqi opposition could boast would be Iraqi
army defectors, collected in dribs and drabs, and then thrown
together with political dissidents, tribesmen, intellectuals and
other opponents of Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Such men are unlikely to suddenly discover a capability for
maneuver warfare that they heretofore utterly lacked. Worst of all,
many of these turncoats would be Saddam's spies, who would help
scuttle this bid to oust him just as informants have destroyed
every past opposition effort to do so. Clearly, relying on the
INC's battlefield prowess would be the mother of all mistakes.

   The Afghan approach calls for the United States to help the
Iraqi opposition establish a safe haven next to the theater of
operations. It would then recruit, train and equip a force that can
conduct a guerrilla insurgency against Saddam's regime. Guerrilla
warfare is the strategy of the weak, who can win only by slowly
wearing down their opponents' strength while slowly building up
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Following Mao's classic three-step approach _ start on the
defensive, force a stalemate, then go on the offensive _ the
opposition would start small and avoid conventional battles with
the Iraqi army until the rebels had a good chance of winning. After
many years, the insurgents would topple Saddam's regime and gain
control of the country.
</P>
<P>
   One can surely surmise that this plan, which requires only a
modest commitment of outside resources and no risk of substantial
American casualties, would be acceptable to the United States,
where it could be sold to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that the Afghan plan is unacceptable to U.S.
regional allies, and their cooperation would be needed for it to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Successful guerrilla insurgencies require a secure rear area
where the rebels can train new recruits, shelter dependents, care
for their wounded, stockpile weapons and supplies, prepare for new
operations, and retreat and regroup in the face of government
offensives.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan played this role for the Afghan mujahideen, Honduras
did so for the Nicaraguan Contras, South Africa for UNITA, China
and later North Vietnam for the Viet Cong and so on. But no country
on Iraq's borders will host the opposition today. None of them is
prepared to live in a state of open warfare with Iraq for as long
as the rebellion takes to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to prove _ most of the candidates for the job can
be dealt with quickly. Saudi officials have repeatedly stated that
they are not willing to go to war with Iraq indefinitely. Besides,
the Saudi territory bordering Iraq is sparsely populated desert _
awful terrain for mounting an insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait, while eager to see Saddam go, is also chary about a
long-term state of belligerency _ and also has uninhabited desert
on its Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, which supported past measures to overthrow Saddam, has
consistently balked at allowing direct military moves against Iraq
from its territory, and it too has a vast unpopulated desert on its
Iraqi frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Syria was always only a half-hearted member of the anti-Saddam
coalition and has never been willing to participate in direct
military operations against Iraq, even during the Persian Gulf War.
It too has mostly uninhabited desert on its Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves only two plausible candidates, Turkey and Iran.
Turkey is certainly geographically suitable; the Turkish-Iraqi
border area consists of forested mountains and is well populated.
Unfortunately, the Turks have removed themselves from the running
because they know that any anti-Saddam insurgency based in Turkey
and northern Iraq would center around the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   Ankara worries that supporting such an insurrection would fuel
Kurdish political aspirations in general and embolden its own
Kurdish rebels. Despite repeated pleas from U.S. officials, the
Turks actually prefer to keep Saddam Hussein in power and have even
favored his efforts to reassert control over Iraqi Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, the final possibility, is the ideal staging ground for an
Iraqi insurgency. Indeed, it has sponsored both Kurdish and Shiite
guerrillas over the last four decades. Iran's border with Iraq runs
through abundant mountains, hills, forests and swamps; many
communities actually straddle the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Yet since the United States and Iran are barely on speaking
terms these days, getting them to cooperate in sponsoring an
anti-Saddam insurgency would pose a formidable obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems with the Afghan approach stem from the lengthy
time frame it would take to work. First, a long, drawn-out
guerrilla war in Iraq would eventually stick in the craw of world
opinion. The United States would find itself increasingly isolated
at the United Nations and elsewhere, which would affect other
foreign-policy issues _ including maintaining the sort of sanctions
and inspection regimes that keep Saddam relatively weak and
contained.
</P>
<P>
   Second, this plan might eventually get rid of Saddam, but it
says nothing about how to manage the challenge he poses in the
present and foreseeable future. By embracing the Afghan approach,
the United States could easily find itself stuck in a couple of
years with a rebellion still in its larval stage and a resuscitated
Iraq increasingly free from international restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, even if the Afghan approach succeeded, it might open up
a Pandora's box of new troubles. Destabilizing Saddam is not the
same as installing a pro-U.S. government in Baghdad. Instability in
Iraq could eventually lead to a military or security-service coup,
but this would not necessarily help the Iraqi National Congress,
the country's umbrella opposition group, or any other pro-Western
group gain power.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Iraq might even collapse into civil war. The result of
an Afghan-like insurgency, in other words, could be an Afghan-like
descent into chaos.

   Proponents of toppling Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq have
advanced an option known as ``the Afghan approach.'' They argue
that the United States could simply help the Iraqi opposition mount
an insurgency on the model of the Afghan mujahideen, the Nicaraguan
Contras or the Viet Cong.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is that one key to successful guerrilla
war is a friendly neighboring country willing to provide the
insurgents with a secure base _ and none of Iraq's neighbors are
viable candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan approach calls for the United States to help the
Iraqi opposition establish a safe haven next to the theater of
operations. It would then recruit, train and equip a force that can
conduct a guerrilla insurgency against Saddam's regime. Guerrilla

<P>
   In the past year, a handful of Washington business lobbyists
have waged a blistering campaign to persuade the world that
Congress has been engaged in a spasm of sanctions proliferation.
Reliance on unilateral sanctions, these lobbyists warn us, is a
disturbing new epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Their campaign has sparked dozens of news articles and
editorials decrying the ``sanctions frenzy'' and castigating
Congress' ``voracious appetite'' for sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Normally responsible journalists parrot statistics _
conveniently furnished by these business lobbyists _ alleging that
in the last few years the United States has placed anywhere from
one-half to two-thirds of the world's population under the yoke of
economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Clinton jumped on the antisanctions bandwagon,
announcing in 1998 that the United States has gone ``sanctions
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   This is sheer nonsense. The statistics peddled by the lobbyists
are grossly inflated and intentionally misleading. Half of the
world is not living under American sanctions _ nowhere near it.
There is no epidemic. Congress has been cautious and circumspect,
passing just a handful of carefully targeted sanctions laws. And
unilateral economic sanctions are by no means new. They have been
vital weapons in America's foreign-policy arsenal for more than 200
years.
</P>
<P>
   I have been and continue to be a friend of American business.
But the distortions spread by this small cabal of lobbyists in the
name of American business are inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   One statistic is by now conventional wisdom: In just four years
the United States has imposed sanctions 61 times, burdening 2.3
billion people (42 percent of the world). That would be pretty
awful, save for one thing _ it is not true. These figures have been
circulated by the anti-sanctions business group USA Engage, based
on a study by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). They
are a fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   At my request, the Congressional Research Service (CRS)
evaluated the NAM claim that from 1993 through 1996, ``61 U.S. laws
and executive actions were enacted authorizing unilateral sanctions
for foreign policy purposes.'' CRS reported that it ``could not
defensibly'' justify the number.
</P>
<P>
   How did NAM come up with 61 sanctions? The study alleges that 20
laws were passed by Congress and 41 were imposed by presidential
action. This is a gross distortion. Nearly three-quarters of the
congressional measures were not sanctions at all but conditions,
limitations or restrictions on U.S. foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   One measure placed conditions on assistance to the Palestine
Liberation Organization. Another barred aid for military or police
training to Haitians involved in drug trafficking or human-rights
abuses. One ``sanction'' blocked assistance to countries knowingly
harboring fugitives wanted by the international war-crimes
tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Still another
prohibited Defense Department aid to countries supporting
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Are these the measures that NAM and USA Engage want Congress to
curtail? Let's hope not.
</P>
<P>
   But what about those 41 ``sanctions'' imposed by the executive
branch? Five are not unilateral, as NAM charges, but rather
represent U.S. compliance with U.N. Security Council sanctions _
multilateral, by definition. In seven cases, the NAM study counts
the same sanction repeatedly, identifying it each time as a
separate sanction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the measure declaring Sudan a terrorist state is
counted five times. NAM lists two cases when no sanction was ever
imposed, including a November 1994 executive order that even NAM
concedes in fine print ``did not impose any specific new sanctions
on any countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight cases represent mere restrictions on U.S. foreign aid.
Five are limited bans affecting only military exports to Zaire,
Nigeria, Sudan, Haiti and Angola. Thirteen affect only a specific
foreign company or person _ not an entire country, not an entire
industry, but one specific entity _ for example, banning imports
from the Chinese Qinghai Hide and Garment Factory for its use of
prison slave labor or seizing the assets of individual Colombian
drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   These actions are obviously not what most people think of as
``sanctions.'' They think of broad trade bans affecting whole
countries, entire industries, vast populations or access to large
markets _ not of blocking imports from a single prison factory in
China, seizing the assets of drug barons or halting the sale of
lethal weapons to terrorist states.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that 42 percent of the world's population has been
affected is also bogus. The study lists the entire population of
the former Zaire (now the Congo) as being under U.S. sanction
because the United States barred sales of defense items to the
government. The same goes for China, Nigeria, Mauritania and
Pakistan, where CRS notes that such highly targeted actions ``put
the entire populations of these countries into NAM's calculation,
even though most people ... are not likely to experience
significant impact from or awareness of (the) imposition.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the reality? Between 1993 and 1996, Congress passed and
the president signed a total of five new sanctions laws: the
Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994, the Cuban Liberty and
Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, the Antiterrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act of 1996, the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 and
the Free Burma Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, the president imposed just four new
sanctions: declaring Sudan a terrorist state; banning imports of
munitions and ammunition from China; tightening travel-related
restrictions, cash remittance levels and the sending of gift
parcels to Cuba (restrictions that have since been lifted); and
imposing a ban on new contractual agreements or investment in Iran.
Nine new sanctions. That is it.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation of a sanctions epidemic is demonstrably false _ a
myth spread with the intention of misleading Congress, the American
public and the American business community.
</P>
<P>
   What the lobbyists dislike is not the idea of sanctions but the
reason some sanctions are imposed. They tacitly admit that
sanctions work but insist that sanctions are good only if they
defend business interests, not national interests.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lobbyists, the United States should be
hamstrung when a government proliferates weapons of mass
destruction, commits genocide, tortures its people or supports
terrorists. But if that same government floods the American market
with cheap TV sets, America should throw the book at it.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, the business lobbyists cannot say that, so they
attempt to confuse the issue with cooked-up data and claims of an
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions have always been an American foreign-policy weapon.
Economic sanctions were imposed by the American colonies against
Britain in response to the Stamp and Townsend Acts, in both cases
forcing their repeal. Jefferson and Madison both passionately
advocated economic sanctions, believing not only that they were
legitimate but that they should be America's primary diplomatic
tools.
</P>
<P>
   There are three tools in foreign policy: diplomacy, sanctions
and war. Take away sanctions and how can the United States deal
with terrorists, proliferators and genocidal dictators? Our options
would be empty talk or sending in the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Without sanctions, the United States would be virtually
powerless to influence events absent war. Sanctions may not be
perfect and they are not always the answer, but they are often the
only weapon.
</P>
<P>
   There should be sanctions on companies and governments that
proliferate nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and countries
that murder women and children and pile them into mass graves.
America should not hesitate for one second to place a cost on these
reprehensible acts and to restrain those few American companies who
would actually conduct business with the perpetrators of such
heinous crimes.
</P>
<P>
   With their antisanctions crusade, the lobbyists are fighting for
business as usual with thugs, tyrants and terrorists. They do not
represent the views of the American people or most American
businesses. They should be ashamed.

counted five times. NAM lists two cases when no sanction was ever
imposed, including a November 1994 executive order that even NAM
concedes in fine print ``did not impose any specific new sanctions
on any countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight cases represent mere restrictions on U.S. foreign aid.
Five are limited bans affecting only military exports to Zaire,
Nigeria, Sudan, Haiti and Angola. Thirteen affect only a specific
foreign company or person _ not an entire country, not an entire
industry, but one specific entity _ for example, banning imports
from the Chinese Qinghai Hide and Garment Factory for its use of
prison slave labor or seizing the assets of individual Colombian
drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   These actions are obviously not what most people think of as
``sanctions.'' They think of broad trade bans affecting whole
countries, entire industries, vast populations or access to large
markets _ not of blocking imports from a single prison factory in
China, seizing the assets of drug barons or halting the sale of
lethal weapons to terrorist states.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that 42 percent of the world's population has been
affected is also bogus. The study lists the entire population of
the former Zaire (now the Congo) as being under U.S. sanction
because the United States barred sales of defense items to the
government. The same goes for China, Nigeria, Mauritania and
Pakistan, where CRS notes that such highly targeted actions ``put
the entire populations of these countries into NAM's calculation,
even though most people ... are not likely to experience
significant impact from or awareness of (the) imposition.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the reality? Between 1993 and 1996, Congress passed and
the president signed a total of five new sanctions laws: the
Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994, the Cuban Liberty and
Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, the Antiterrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act of 1996, the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 and
the Free Burma Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, the president imposed just four new
sanctions: declaring Sudan a terrorist state; banning imports of
munitions and ammunition from China; tightening travel-related
restrictions, cash remittance levels and the sending of gift
parcels to Cuba (restrictions that have since been lifted); and
imposing a ban on new contractual agreements or investment in Iran.
Nine new sanctions. That is it.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation of a sanctions epidemic is demonstrably false _ a
myth spread with the intention of misleading Congress, the American
public and the American business community.
</P>
<P>
   What the lobbyists dislike is not the idea of sanctions but the
reason some sanctions are imposed. They tacitly admit that
sanctions work but insist that sanctions are good only if they
defend business interests, not national interests.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lobbyists, the United States should be
hamstrung when a government proliferates weapons of mass
destruction, commits genocide, tortures its people or supports
terrorists. But if that same government floods the American market
with cheap TV sets, America should throw the book at it.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, the business lobbyists cannot say that, so they
attempt to confuse the issue with cooked-up data and claims of an
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions have always been an American foreign-policy weapon.
Economic sanctions were imposed by the American colonies against
Britain in response to the Stamp and Townsend Acts, in both cases
forcing their repeal. Jefferson and Madison both passionately
advocated economic sanctions, believing not only that they were
legitimate but that they should be America's primary diplomatic
tools.
</P>
<P>
   There are three tools in foreign policy: diplomacy, sanctions
and war. Take away sanctions and how can the United States deal
with terrorists, proliferators and genocidal dictators? Our options
would be empty talk or sending in the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Without sanctions, the United States would be virtually
powerless to influence events absent war. Sanctions may not be
perfect and they are not always the answer, but they are often the
only weapon.
</P>
<P>
   There should be sanctions on companies and governments that
proliferate nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and countries
that murder women and children and pile them into mass graves.
America should not hesitate for one second to place a cost on these
reprehensible acts and to restrain those few American companies who
would actually conduct business with the perpetrators of such
heinous crimes.
</P>
<P>
   With their antisanctions crusade, the lobbyists are fighting for
business as usual with thugs, tyrants and terrorists. They do not
represent the views of the American people or most American
businesses. They should be ashamed.

   In October, Congress rushed to embrace an Iraq Liberation Act,
authorizing a whopping $97 million in military aid to democratic
Iraqi resistance groups. President Clinton's staff was

<P>
   Oil is a magnet for conflict. The problem is simple _ everyone
needs energy, but the sources of the world's transportation fuel
are concentrated in relatively few countries.
</P>
<P>
   Well over two-thirds of the world's remaining oil reserves lie
in the Middle East (including the Caspian basin), leaving the rest
of the world dependent on the region's collection of predators and
vulnerable autocrats.
</P>
<P>
   This unwelcome dependence keeps U.S. military forces tied to the
Persian Gulf, forces foreign-policy compromises and sinks many
developing nations into staggering debt as they struggle to pay for
expensive dollar-denominated oil with lower-priced commodities and
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, oil causes environmental conflict. The possibility
that greenhouse gases will lead to catastrophic climate change is
substantially increased by the 40 million barrels of oil burned
every day by vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol has always provided an alternative to gasoline. In terms
of environmental impact and fuel efficiency, its advantages over
gasoline substantially outweigh its few disadvantages. But until
now it has only been practical to produce ethanol from a tiny
portion of plant life _ the edible parts of corn or other feed
grains.
</P>
<P>
   Corn prices have fluctuated around $100 a ton in the last few
years, ranging from half to double that amount. Ethanol has thus
been too expensive to represent anything but a small, subsidized
niche of the transportation fuel market. In spite of recent
reductions in the expense of ethanol processing, the final product
still costs roughly a dollar a gallon, or about double today's
wholesale price of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Recent and prospective breakthroughs in genetic engineering and
processing, however, are radically changing the viability of
ethanol as a transportation fuel.
</P>
<P>
   And if the hundreds of billions of dollars that now flow into a
few coffers in a few nations were to flow instead to the millions
of people who till the world's fields, most countries would see
substantial national security, economic and environmental benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, energy is vital to a country's security and material
well-being. A state unable to provide its people with adequate
energy supplies or desiring added leverage over other people often
resorts to force.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, driven by his
desire to control more of the world's oil reserves, and the
international response to this threat. The underlying goal of the
U.N. force, which included 500,000 American troops, was to ensure
continued and unfettered access to petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Oil permeates every aspect of our lives, so even minor price
increases have devastating impacts. The most difficult challenge
for planners, policymakers and alternative-energy advocates is the
transportation sector, which accounts for more than 60 percent of
U.S. oil demand.
</P>
<P>
   The massive infrastructure developed to support gasoline-powered
cars is particularly resistant to modifications. It precludes rapid
change to alternative transportation systems and makes America
highly vulnerable to a break in oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
   During a war or embargo, moving quickly to mass transit or to
fuel-cell or battery-powered automobiles would be impossible. For
most countries, excluding only those few that will be the next
century's oil suppliers, the future portends growing indebtedness,
driven by increasingly expensive oil imports.
</P>
<P>
   New demand for oil will be filled largely by the Middle East,
meaning a transfer of more than $1 trillion over the next 15 years
to the unstable states of the Persian Gulf alone _ on top of the
$90 billion they received in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Dependence on the Middle East entails the risk of a repeat of
the international crises of 1973, 1979 and 1990 _ or worse. This
growing reliance on Middle Eastern oil not only adds to that
region's disproportionate leverage but provides the resources with
which rogue nations support international terrorism and develop
weapons of mass destruction and the ballistic missiles to carry
them.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi VX nerve gas and Iranian medium-range missiles show how
such regimes can convert oil revenues into extensive and
sophisticated armament programs.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists about world oil reserves, such as the Department of
Energy, are getting increasingly lonely. The International Energy
Agency now says that world production outside the Middle Eastern
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will peak in
1999 and world production overall will peak between 2010 and 2020.
</P>
<P>
   This projection is supported by influential recent articles in
Science and Scientific American. Some knowledgeable academic and
industry voices put the date that world production will peak even
sooner _ within the next five or six years.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists who project large reserve quantities of over one
trillion barrels tend to base their numbers on one of three things:
inclusion of heavy oil and tar sands, the exploitation of which
will entail huge economic and environmental costs; puffery by OPEC
nations lobbying for higher production quotas within the cartel; or
assumptions about new drilling technologies that may accelerate
production but are unlikely to expand reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Once production peaks, even though exhaustion of world reserves
will still be many years away, prices will begin to rise sharply.
This trend will be exacerbated by increased demand in the
developing world. Even assuming a substantial recession, increased
Asian needs alone will add enough demand by 2010 (9 million barrels
per day) to more than equal Saudi Arabia's current daily
production.
</P>
<P>
   The nations of the Middle East will be ready to exploit the
trend of rising demand and shrinking supply. The Gulf states
control nearly two-thirds of the world's reserves; the states
bordering the Caspian Sea have another several percent. Barring
some unforeseen discoveries, the Middle East will control something
approaching three-quarters of the world's oil in the coming
century.
</P>
<P>
   But if genetically engineered biocatalysts and advanced
processing technologies can make a transition from fossil fuels to
biofuels affordable, the world's security picture could be
different in many ways. It would be impossible to form a cartel
that would control the production, manufacturing, and marketing of
ethanol fuel.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomacy and policies in the Middle East could be guided
more by a respect for democracy than by a need to protect oil
supplies and accommodate oil-producing regimes. Our intrusive
military presence in the region could be reduced, both ameliorating
anti-American tensions and making U.S. involvement in a Middle
Eastern war less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Other states would also reap benefits. Ukraine, rich in fertile
land, would be less likely to be dominated over time by oil-rich
Russia. China would feel less pressure to befriend Iran and Iraq or
build a big navy to secure the oil of the South China Sea. The
ability of oil-exporting countries to shape events would be
increasingly limited.
</P>
<P>
   The recent report by the President's Committee of Advisers on
Science and Technology (PCAST) predicted that U.S. oil imports will
approximately double between 1996 and 2030, from 8.5 million
barrels per day, at a cost of $64 billion, to nearly 16 million
barrels per day, at a cost of $120 billion.
</P>
<P>
   They estimated, however, that with concentrated efforts in
fundamental energy research and investment in renewable fuel
technologies, this could be reduced to 6 million barrels per day in
2030.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded, ``A plausible argument can be made that
the security of the United States is at least as likely to be
imperiled in the first half of the next century by the consequences
of inadequacies in the energy options available to the world as by
inadequacies in the capabilities of U.S. weapons systems.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is striking that the federal government spends about
20 times more money for research and development of new weapons
than energy options.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the United States is not funding a vigorous program
in renewable technologies. The Department of Energy spends under
two percent of its budget on renewable fuels; its overall work on
renewable technologies is at its lowest level in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Because private investment often follows federal commitment,
industrial research and development has also reached new lows.
These disturbing trends occur at a time of national economic
prosperity when America has both time and resources for investing
in biofuels.
</P>
<P>
   The United States cannot afford to wait for the next energy
crisis to marshal its intellectual and industrial resources. Our
growing dependence on increasingly scarce Middle Eastern oil is a
fool's game _ there is no way for the rest of the world to win. Our
losses may come suddenly through war, steadily through price
increases, agonizingly through developing-nation poverty,
relentlessly through climate change _ or through all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   It would be extremely short-sighted not to take advantage of the
scientific breakthroughs that have occurred and that are in the
offing, accelerate them and move smartly toward ameliorating the
risks.
</P>
<P>
   If we do, we will make life far less dangerous and far more
prosperous for future generations. If we do not, those generations
will look back in angry wonder at the remarkable opportunity that
we missed.

<P>
   Oil is a magnet for conflict. The problem is simple _ everyone
needs energy, but the sources of the world's transportation fuel
are concentrated in relatively few countries.
</P>
<P>
   Well over two-thirds of the world's remaining oil reserves lie
in the Middle East (including the Caspian basin), leaving the rest
of the world dependent on the region's collection of predators and
vulnerable autocrats.
</P>
<P>
   This unwelcome dependence keeps U.S. military forces tied to the
Persian Gulf, forces foreign-policy compromises and sinks many
developing nations into staggering debt as they struggle to pay for
expensive dollar-denominated oil with lower-priced commodities and
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, oil causes environmental conflict. The possibility
that greenhouse gases will lead to catastrophic climate change is
substantially increased by the 40 million barrels of oil burned
every day by vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol has always provided an alternative to gasoline. In terms
of environmental impact and fuel efficiency, its advantages over
gasoline substantially outweigh its few disadvantages. But until
now it has only been practical to produce ethanol from a tiny
portion of plant life _ the edible parts of corn or other feed
grains.
</P>
<P>
   Corn prices have fluctuated around $100 a ton in the last few
years, ranging from half to double that amount. Ethanol has thus
been too expensive to represent anything but a small, subsidized
niche of the transportation fuel market. In spite of recent
reductions in the expense of ethanol processing, the final product
still costs roughly a dollar a gallon, or about double today's
wholesale price of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Recent and prospective breakthroughs in genetic engineering and
processing, however, are radically changing the viability of
ethanol as a transportation fuel.
</P>
<P>
   And if the hundreds of billions of dollars that now flow into a
few coffers in a few nations were to flow instead to the millions
of people who till the world's fields, most countries would see
substantial national security, economic and environmental benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, energy is vital to a country's security and material
well-being. A state unable to provide its people with adequate
energy supplies or desiring added leverage over other people often
resorts to force.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, driven by his
desire to control more of the world's oil reserves, and the
international response to this threat. The underlying goal of the
U.N. force, which included 500,000 American troops, was to ensure
continued and unfettered access to petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Oil permeates every aspect of our lives, so even minor price
increases have devastating impacts. The most difficult challenge
for planners, policymakers and alternative-energy advocates is the
transportation sector, which accounts for more than 60 percent of
U.S. oil demand.
</P>
<P>
   The massive infrastructure developed to support gasoline-powered
cars is particularly resistant to modifications. It precludes rapid
change to alternative transportation systems and makes America
highly vulnerable to a break in oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
   During a war or embargo, moving quickly to mass transit or to
fuel-cell or battery-powered automobiles would be impossible. For
most countries, excluding only those few that will be the next
century's oil suppliers, the future portends growing indebtedness,
driven by increasingly expensive oil imports.
</P>
<P>
   New demand for oil will be filled largely by the Middle East,
meaning a transfer of more than $1 trillion over the next 15 years
to the unstable states of the Persian Gulf alone _ on top of the
$90 billion they received in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Dependence on the Middle East entails the risk of a repeat of
the international crises of 1973, 1979 and 1990 _ or worse. This
growing reliance on Middle Eastern oil not only adds to that
region's disproportionate leverage but provides the resources with
which rogue nations support international terrorism and develop
weapons of mass destruction and the ballistic missiles to carry
them.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi VX nerve gas and Iranian medium-range missiles show how
such regimes can convert oil revenues into extensive and
sophisticated armament programs.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists about world oil reserves, such as the Department of
Energy, are getting increasingly lonely. The International Energy
Agency now says that world production outside the Middle Eastern
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will peak in
1999 and world production overall will peak between 2010 and 2020.
</P>
<P>
   This projection is supported by influential recent articles in
Science and Scientific American. Some knowledgeable academic and
industry voices put the date that world production will peak even
sooner _ within the next five or six years.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists who project large reserve quantities of over one
trillion barrels tend to base their numbers on one of three things:
inclusion of heavy oil and tar sands, the exploitation of which
will entail huge economic and environmental costs; puffery by OPEC
nations lobbying for higher production quotas within the cartel; or
assumptions about new drilling technologies that may accelerate
production but are unlikely to expand reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Once production peaks, even though exhaustion of world reserves
will still be many years away, prices will begin to rise sharply.
This trend will be exacerbated by increased demand in the
developing world. Even assuming a substantial recession, increased
Asian needs alone will add enough demand by 2010 (9 million barrels
per day) to more than equal Saudi Arabia's current daily
production.
</P>
<P>
   The nations of the Middle East will be ready to exploit the
trend of rising demand and shrinking supply. The Gulf states
control nearly two-thirds of the world's reserves; the states
bordering the Caspian Sea have another several percent. Barring
some unforeseen discoveries, the Middle East will control something
approaching three-quarters of the world's oil in the coming
century.
</P>
<P>
   But if genetically engineered biocatalysts and advanced
processing technologies can make a transition from fossil fuels to
biofuels affordable, the world's security picture could be
different in many ways. It would be impossible to form a cartel
that would control the production, manufacturing, and marketing of
ethanol fuel.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomacy and policies in the Middle East could be guided
more by a respect for democracy than by a need to protect oil
supplies and accommodate oil-producing regimes. Our intrusive
military presence in the region could be reduced, both ameliorating
anti-American tensions and making U.S. involvement in a Middle
Eastern war less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Other states would also reap benefits. Ukraine, rich in fertile
land, would be less likely to be dominated over time by oil-rich
Russia. China would feel less pressure to befriend Iran and Iraq or
build a big navy to secure the oil of the South China Sea. The
ability of oil-exporting countries to shape events would be
increasingly limited.
</P>
<P>
   The recent report by the President's Committee of Advisers on
Science and Technology (PCAST) predicted that U.S. oil imports will
approximately double between 1996 and 2030, from 8.5 million
barrels per day, at a cost of $64 billion, to nearly 16 million
barrels per day, at a cost of $120 billion.
</P>
<P>
   They estimated, however, that with concentrated efforts in
fundamental energy research and investment in renewable fuel
technologies, this could be reduced to 6 million barrels per day in
2030.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded, ``A plausible argument can be made that
the security of the United States is at least as likely to be
imperiled in the first half of the next century by the consequences
of inadequacies in the energy options available to the world as by
inadequacies in the capabilities of U.S. weapons systems.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is striking that the federal government spends about
20 times more money for research and development of new weapons
than energy options.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the United States is not funding a vigorous program
in renewable technologies. The Department of Energy spends under
two percent of its budget on renewable fuels; its overall work on

ADS THAT DRIVE US NOT TO DRINK 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two are selling scotch, one a luxury car,
another an inexpensive wine and the worst of the bunch, tequila.
</P>
<P>
   What the five current ads have in common is, they drive me
seriously nuts. Each insults my intelligence, two insult my dignity
as a woman and one is a raised middle finger to all but a
privileged, white, upwardly mobile class.
</P>
<P>
   Let's discuss that one first.
</P>
<P>
   The product: an upscale scotch. Pictured in the ad is a smiling,
chiseled-face man, toasting someone with a glass of whisky. His
aura shouts, ``Prep school, Ivy League college, job on Wall Street,
family money, summer house in Tuscany, and a well-bred wife already
ripe with the first of many kidlets to perpetuate the dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad copy: ``Politically correct? Here's to just being
right.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be a more arrogant and smug put-down of the economic
and social struggles of ethnic and racial minorities, the working
class and anyone else who isn't white and rich, but I haven't seen
it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's to just being right? According to whom, the ruling-party
elite? So much for listening to one another, for respecting
differences, for affording each person value and intellectual
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you think this is all about class envy, let me describe the
radio ad for inexpensive wine.
</P>
<P>
   A woman with a disgusted, had-it-up-to-here voice delivers a
prolonged screed about how hard ``they'' make it to buy a ``good
bottle of wine.'' Vintages, grape varieties, growing regions and
the conditions that affect the quality of wine, well, all of that
stuff is just pretentious b.s., according to the tough-talking
whiner.
</P>
<P>
   She likes to go into a store and pull something off a shelf; the
only effort she wants to put out is to choose red or white. The
monologue is a paean to self-perpetuating stupidity, to the belief
that ignorance is a badge of honor. Just what we need more of in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of ignorant: a radio commercial for a $30,000 imported
luxury car. Two parents are worried sick because their little
darling is so depressed, he won't get out of bed. The doctor comes
and discerns the cause: The boy (with a piping grade school-age
voice) wants his family to buy a specific model of the luxury car.
</P>
<P>
   Is that all? The much-relieved parents promise to acquire the
car, and the little darling bursts into a shrill song of joy.
</P>
<P>
   This ad is about as cute as an open sore.
</P>
<P>
   The other scotch ad just bums me out. It shows a nice-looking
young couple, photographed in Woody Allen black-and-white. She,
long of hair and swollen of lips, is deep into bliss, trying on
clothes in a boutique. He, with tip-tinted short hair and sweater,
sits at his lady's knees, his arms already overloaded with filled
shopping bags. Chin in hand, he stares, wistful and bored, at the
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``A full day of shopping?'' says the ad. ``Now that calls for a
drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Who turned the time machine back to 1954, when poor, put-upon
males got dragged around like check-writing packhorses by their
dippy, frock-crazy little women? Is this how the Ally McBeal
generation relates? As their grandparents did?
</P>
<P>
   Are there pretty young women so desperate for male companionship
that they can't even go shopping for their own clothes without
being joined at the hip to a thoroughly uninterested beau? Did I
dream the women's movement?
</P>
<P>
   The tequila ad tells me I did.
</P>
<P>
   It features a dark-haired beauty, lying on her back and looking
up with a slight defiance. Her shoulders and chest are bare as far
as you can show on a public billboard. Next to her head is a bottle
of tequila. On one of her shoulders is a shot glass, on the other,
a wedge of lime. Ad copy: ``BODY SLAM.''
</P>
<P>
   If I need to explain what is so offensive about this ad, may you
find a seat in that luxury automobile and enjoy the ride to the
bottom of the San Francisco Bay.

 &HT;    Forbes questions Lockheed plant's future
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich's departure as speaker of the House may be a
blessing to Lockheed Martin, since it will remove the last
protector of Lockheed's giant _ but costly _ Marietta, Ga. assembly
plant, Forbes (Dec. 28) says.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Forbes contends, Lockheed Martin Chairman Vance Coffman
will be able to apply the cost-cutting knife even to the World War
II-vintage aircraft plant that employs 9,600 _ a plant Forbes calls
``an albatross'' for Lockheed Martin. According to Forbes, the
company's third-quarter financial report lists a write-down of $350
million to $400 million for the first quarter of 1999, ``mostly to
cover cost overruns on the latest update of the C-130 Hercules,
which is built in Marietta.'' Forbes suggests this may be ``a first
installment'' on the cost of closing the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes says the plant is also in trouble developing the Air
Force F-22 stealth fighter, a joint $40 billion program with
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Blackwell, president of Lockheed Martin's aeronautics
division, rejects the idea of closing the Marietta plant, because
it would be too costly to do so, although he is closing 40 smaller
factory units in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts keep coming
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 forecast sweepstakes continue with magazines offering
their best bets for the year ahead.
</P>
<P>
   -- Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine (January) is out with
its annual forecast issue, which concludes ``there is more promise
than peril'' for investors in the year ahead. As for the ``Year
2000'' problem _ when computers will be confused by a year ending
in double zeros _ Kiplinger's says ``most things will still work.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Individual Investor (January) says the outlook for stocks
``is as uncertain as it's been in awhile,'' which is why the
magazine suggests investors spread their risk. The magazine
recommends stocks in five groups: corporate titans (Time Warner),
turnaround plays (Motorola), on the move (Gulfstream Aerospace),
special situations (Monsanto) and bargain bin (Ford Motor).
</P>
<P>
   More consumer delights
</P>
<P>
   Glorious TV pictures, portable phones that operate anywhere,
artificial skin for treating disease, and Viagra, Pfizer's
impotence pill, are among the best new products of 1998, Business
Week (Dec. 21) reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be they lightweight computers, clever toys or medical marvels,
the products touch every part of our daily lives,'' says the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Others include Gillette's triple-bladed razor, Yamaha's silent
violin that the musician hears via headphones, and without
disturbing the neighbors, and, of course, Furby, Tiger Electronics'
gremlin-like doll.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning . . .
</P>
<P>
   -- Success (January) offers readers a ``guide to the 21st
century,'' complete with advice on raising capital, hiring and
tapping new markets.
</P>
<P>
   -- Barron's (Dec. 14) looks at the best and worst of new stock
offerings in 1998, noting that IPOs _ initial public offerings _
looked dead in the water about five months ago only to come roaring
back, powered by the Internet.

NEW LOOKS FOR MONOPOLY 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Millions of landlubbers have fallen under the spell of
its pastel-colored paper money and plots of land from Mediterranean
Avenue to Boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   Now Monopoly is reeling in sailors with a new U.S. Navy edition
and the opportunity to buy aircraft carriers and the Blue Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be an excellent marriage between two
colorful organizations,'' Carman Cedola, business development
director of USAOPOLY, said of the first Monopoly game dedicated to
a military service.
</P>
<P>
   Parker Brothers has sold more than 200 million copies of the
classic board game since 1935. Translated into 26 different
languages, it's the best-selling game in history.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro-owned Parker Brothers granted USAOPOLY the license to
develop different versions of the game in 1994. The company has
hatched 65 so far, half of which were released this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the games that came out this year have been very well
received,'' said Dane Chapin, chief executive officer of the
family-owned business.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the special editions, retailing for $30 and up in
specialty stores, have been good. The California-based company
expects to sell more than 1 million games in 1998 _ up about 50
percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge national affinity for the Monopoly game,''
Chapin said. ``Now that we've personalized it for a lot of people,
I think they're more apt to get involved with the game again.''
</P>
<P>
   The first specialty versions created by Chapin and his two
sisters were for the cities of Atlanta, Boston, New York, San Diego
and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The company now has 25 cities, including Chicago, Dallas,
Denver, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Mo., Las
Vegas, Philadelphia, Seattle, St. Louis and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the city-themed games, USAOPOLY has universities,
states and special-interest editions for fans of everything from
bass fishing and dinosaurs to Harley-Davidson, NASCAR, national
parks, ``Star Trek'' and the U.S. space program.
</P>
<P>
   NASA doesn't endorse commercial products, but it does review
them for accuracy. The verdict on the space program edition?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's historically accurate,'' said Burt Ulrich, the NASA
visual identity coordinator in Washington who evaluated the game.
Game pieces include the space shuttle, Hubble Space Telescope and
the Mars Sojourner rover.
</P>
<P>
   USAOPOLY spends six months to a year developing, designing and
researching each new version.
</P>
<P>
   The company hired a dedicated Trekker, or Trekkie, to pore over
the volumes at Paramount's ``Star Trek'' library for its ``Star
Trek: The Next Generation'' edition. Characters from the popular
show _ Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker and Data
_ take the place of the top hat, thimble and car from the original
game.
</P>
<P>
   For the U.S. Navy edition, USAOPOLY enlisted help from several
U.S. Navy sailors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I appreciate about the game is the accurate presentation
of all the elements of the U.S. Navy,'' said Petty Officer 1st
class Todd Stevens, a Navy spokesman in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the photos. They bring the game to life,'' he added
about the game's artwork by U.S. Navy photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated to the men and women in the Navy, the game's pewter
playing tokens include an anchor, jet fighter plane, sailor hat and
a partially submerged submarine.
</P>
<P>
   As in all Monopoly versions, the traditional four corners of the
game remain the same: Go (Collect $200), Free Parking, In Jail and
Go to Jail. No ``Go to the Brig'' on the Navy version.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Fleet and Pacific Fleet cards, however, have replaced
the Chance and Community Chest cards in the Navy game. And as in
all the special versions, properties on the game board are
different. They include the Naval Academy, Norfolk Naval Base,
Seawolf submarine, a sub-chasing P3 Orion and the aircraft carrier
USS Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   So far, people have responded positively to the nautical
version.
</P>
<P>
   It has sold out at many of the Navy stores, Stevens said.

TIME TO END CLINTON'S WAR IN IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOAN STEINAU LESTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Watching President William Jefferson Clinton
give his speech on Wednesday, an hour after Iraqi bombing was
initiated, I realized I haven't been this upset listening to a
president since the days of Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson got up, repeatedly, to defend the U.S. military
role in Vietnam, we used to chant, ``Hey hey, LBJ, how many kids
did you kill today?''
</P>
<P>
   One of my most ecstatic memories was hearing the news that
Johnson wasn't going to run for re-election. I was in a movie
theater on the Lower East Side in New York City. The show was
interrupted, the announcement made, and the theater broke out in
wild cheers. We had made it impossible for him to govern! We
thought the war would soon be over.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't wanted to get out in the streets to demonstrate for
years, but as soon as I heard about the Iraqi bombing _ on the eve
of the scheduled House impeachment vote _ I wanted to rush out and
yell, ``No! You can't slaughter people to save your career. Stop,
stop, stop!''
</P>
<P>
   There are no surgical strikes in war. Thousands of Iraqi
citizens could die _ on top of 6,000 expiring each month from lack
of food and medicine (a result of the vigorous U.S. blockade). So
saying that ``our quarrel is not with the Iraqi people'' is
meaningless. The deja vu is astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's stated goal of ``bringing change in Baghdad'' through
this massive air attack is reminiscent of Johnson's similar (and
ultimately futile) rationale: The U.S. will bring democracy to
Vietnam through war. Surely we have learned new skills since those
dark days: How to begin cooperative relationships with Third World
countries, how to resolve conflict without bombs and how to assist
local people in making democratic change rather than imposing it,
literally, from above.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder how the American people will grapple with casualties
this time around. Immediately after the bombing started, thousands
began protesting publicly in many cities.
</P>
<P>
   Peace workers _ and those of us who haven't been involved _ are
activating telephone trees all over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 20 years, I say, ``Take it to the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   We have to vote with our feet.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped the war in Vietnam. Let's stop this one too.
</P>

WILL `PRINCE' BE A BOX-OFFICE KING? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In 1956, movie audiences were eager to accept Charlton
Heston as Moses in Cecil B. DeMille's ``The Ten Commandments,''
making that Bible-based film a major hit.
</P>
<P>
   Will 1998 audiences be willing to do the same for an animated
Moses with the voice of Val Kilmer in ``The Prince of Egypt?''
</P>
<P>
   Will viewers accept a singing Bible story aimed at adults with
themes of slavery, sacrifice and heavenly vengeance in an art form
that has usually been the playground of cute comic animals and
happy children's songs?
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen _ the SKG
of DreamWorks SKG _ are betting they will. They aren't quite
betting the farm, but close to it.
</P>
<P>
   Only 4 years old, with many of its major setup expenses yet to
come _ including a major new studio in Playa Vista near Los Angeles
_ DreamWorks can use another hit, like its ``Antz'' and ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' and can ill afford a major failure.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Prince of Egypt' is a very important corner stone,'' said
Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   The studio did even better than expected with ``Antz'' (about
$145 million worldwide to date), its first animated film. Like
``The Prince of Egypt,'' ``Antz'' was aimed at a more mature
audience than Disney animated films. But it was still of the
familiar fantasy adventure format, not far from the animation norm,
that children could enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' is something else again.
</P>
<P>
   The PG-rated movie offers the usual animated mix of comedy,
adventure and plenty of songs, not to mention a fabulous look,
capped by a show-stopping hieroglyph dream sequence.
</P>
<P>
   But the overall tone is serious and sincere. There are no cuddly
singing animals. There are plagues, beatings, suffering and even
The Almighty, as personified in a cleverly animated burning bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a kiddie movie,'' said ``Prince'' co-director Brenda
Chapman. ``Kids can go, but a parent needs to be there with them
(to explain) what happens with the death of the first-born and the
plagues. It will probably bring up some questions.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Hebrews' enslavement in Egypt to their arrival in the
Promised Land, ``Prince'' tells the story of Moses, who progresses
from a babe set afloat in a wicker basket through wild teen years
as an adopted prince to an aged and wise leader of a wandering
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moses is such a dynamic character,'' said Kilmer of his role.
``I really loved thinking about him when I was a young man, because
it's a story of hope. It's such a human story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here he is thinking he is in the most elite group in Egypt.
But out of his frustration and anger, he kills a man. It always
gave me hope in Sunday school that you could do something that bad
and still things could work out in your life. I loved that.''
</P>
<P>
   The central focus is the loving relationship between Moses and
his brother by adoption, Rameses (voiced by Ralph Fiennes), and how
that relationship is affected by Moses' attempts to lead the
Hebrews from bondage.
</P>
<P>
   Disney may be able to alter fairy tales and even give ``The
Hunchback of Notre Dame'' a happy ending, but this is a story from
the Old Testament and you fiddle around with that at your own risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first moment, we recognized how important this story
is to many people around the world, and we had an obligation to
become knowledgeable,'' Katzenberg said. ``David Geffen gave me the
best advice I've ever been given by anybody in my professional
career. David said, `Jeffrey. if you are going to tell this story:
one, it must be absolutely faithful; two, it must be absolutely
accurate.'''
</P>
<P>
   Religious groups of the '90s are far more outspoken and more
easily offended when they disagree on fine points of faith than
when ``The Ten Commandments'' was released. In trying to make an
animated musical film from the Bible, however serious the effort
is, DreamWorks is treading on potentially treacherous ground.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the story-development process, the studio began
consulting with experts from a broad range of fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to Egyptologists, archaeologists, Bible scholars,
religious leaders from the far right to the far left, educators,''
said producer Penney Finkelman Cox of Patchwork Productions,
DreamWorks' animation division. ``People were very generous.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the advice was not what they wanted to hear, as with
the scene in which Moses and Tzipporah (voice of Michelle Pfeiffer)
marry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Moses do the traditional breaking of the pot,'' Cox
said. ``It was a beautiful moment. One of the educators said, `Yes,
but that signifies the destruction of the first temple, which
didn't happen for another thousand years.' So that's an anachronism
in the movie. It was really painful for us (to remove). We had
already created it in storyboard form.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's creators had Egyptologists go over their hieroglyphs
``with a microscope'' to make sure they were accurate. One scholar
found that one of the Egyptian gods depicted in the film's
background paintings was from the wrong period and had to be
removed.
</P>
<P>
   For inspiration, Katzenberg took his creative team on a visit to
Egypt to better understand their subject.
</P>
<P>
   The mighty pyramids and other structures of classical Egypt are
constantly on display in the movie, and they have never looked
grander.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our production designer, Darek Gogol, was doing these huge
drawings of the monuments and pyramids and temples,'' said Chapman.
``I said, `Darek, I think we should pull back a little bit.' But
once we went there and stood at the foot of the columns, they felt
that big. I said, `Go for it. Make it as big as you want.'''
</P>
<P>
   Detail and accuracy and faithfulness to the Bible may or may not
satisfy religious audiences. For the vast majority of the large
crowds DreamWorks hopes to attract, none of that will matter unless
they find the story exciting and involving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is the key to a good film, whether it is live-action
or animated,'' said Chapman. ``The visuals are there to support the
story. If you don't care anything for those characters or what's
happening to them, the best animation in the world can't save a bad
story, but the worst animation in the world won't hurt a good
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to make this a human story, because we need to
relate to Moses. He can't just be this icon who walks through this
preachy Bible movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapman, the first woman to direct a major animated film and
head of story work for Disney on ``The Lion King'' and other films,
admitted that she was skeptical when Katzenberg approached her to
direct the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking, an animated musical Bible story about Moses? Who
wants to go see that? I've seen some really bad Sunday-school stuff
that makes people want to go screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to meet with Jeffrey and Steven Spielberg (and
others) I saw the possibilities. Jeffrey is not going to allow
something to be of a lesser quality.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks would not give out production costs. But large-scale
animated films can cost $50 million to $75 million or more to
produce. Add to that tens of millions more for promotion and
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Antz'' (like ``A Bug's Life'') was done in computer
animation, ``The Prince of Egypt'' is DreamWorks' maiden showcase
in traditional animation. Aside from some of the massive crowd
scenes, where digital techniques were employed, most of the movie
is hand-drawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense of acting, a sense of fluidity that you get
with hand-drawn animation,'' Chapman said. ``You get
inconsistencies and imperfections. That's part of the charm of
classically done animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The digital is still working out bugs, no pun intended. They
can feel a little weightless or puppet like.''
</P>
<P>
   Can DreamWorks compete in this tricky field, and make a success
of a film that goes so contrary to accepted animation style and
subject? Will religious audiences accept a Hollywood film? Will
nonreligious audiences accept a Bible story?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the answers, Katzenberg said the studio is committed to
a more adult approach to animation, not trying to beat Disney, but
to creating its own animation niche.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the animation side, we are committed for the next four
years,'' Katzenberg said. ``What we have to do is maintain an even
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a little divine intervention would help.

A BIT OF `MONKEY' BUSINESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks like Disney.
</P>
<P>
   It feels like Disney.
</P>
<P>
   It even has Disney's beloved chimps.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Summer of the Monkeys,'' a family film new on video (rated
G, closed-captioned, $19.99), wasn't made by Disney, although it's
being issued under Disney's name.
</P>
<P>
   The film was independently produced last year in Canada, with
Michael Ontkean (``Twin Peaks'') starring and Michael Anderson
(``Around the World in 80 Days'') directing.
</P>
<P>
   Based on an award-winning novel by Wilson Rawls, ``Summer of the
Monkeys'' depicts 1800s farm boy Jay (Corey Sevier), who tries to
capture some escaped circus chimps in order to collect a reward so
he can buy his own pony.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Jay learns a lot about chimps, faith, family and
what's truly important in life.
</P>
<P>
   Ontkean and Leslie Hope play the boy's parents, Katie Stuart is
his handicapped sister, and Wilford Brimley plays the boy's
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   The star of the tube's twisted ``Twin Peaks'' might seem like a
long shot for such a film, but Ontkean, 48, was ready for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up one day and realized my youngest daughter was 9, and
in her lifetime I had not made a movie that she could see,''
Ontkean said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I drew a line in the sand and said, `That's it. I'm not
making another movie until it's something she can see and there's
nothing ugly or twisted about it.' Then I had to wait a year until
this came along.``
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer of the Monkeys'' was shot in Ontkean's native Canada
``on quite a stunning landscape in remote Saskatchewan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as you could see, the prairie land is so flat. We built
our own sets, and there was nothing else for 50 miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Things might have gotten dull, but there were always the film's
four chimps, supervised by animal trainers. The chimps are the true
stars.
</P>
<P>
   For all the warm family sentiments straight out of ``Little
House on the Prairie,'' Summer of the Monkeys has ample monkey
business (as did Disney's ``Toby Tyler'' of 1960 and ``Rocket Man''
of last year).
</P>
<P>
   Those chimps could be fun off-camera, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the middle of nowhere, with no diversions, so we
spent a lot of time hanging out with the monkeys on the set,''
Ontkean said.
</P>
<P>
   He found the animals ``very much like humans. You quickly
develop a real respect for their intelligence _ and not just what
they can do, but their feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney didn't see the product until it was finished, at which
point the studio picked the film up for distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a real tribute to the filmmakers, because Disney likes
to generate its own material,'' Ontkean said. ``But this does look
like a Disney movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Ontkean's other recent work has included ``A Chance of Snow,''
another family film, which premiered last week on cable's Lifetime.
His earlier work included the films ``Slap Shot,'' ``Postcards From
the Edge'' and ``Making Love.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's perhaps best known for playing Sheriff Harry S. Truman
in the ``Twin Peaks'' TV series of 1990-91, probing the bizarre
death of prom queen Laura Palmer while sharing doughnuts with FBI
Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan).
</P>
<P>
   ```Twin Peaks' still follows me around,'' Ontkean said with a
wry laugh. ``There are some pretty intense and rabid `Peakies' out
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fans don't bother me. It's all very friendly. Nothing
strange has ever happened out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ontkean said he's ``proud'' of ``Twin Peaks,'' just as he's
``proud'' of ``Summer of the Monkeys.'' But his favorite film to
make was 1977's ``Slap Shot,'' a raw comedy in which he played a
hockey player opposite Paul Newman.
</P>
<P>
   ``By working with Newman, in six months you learn 25 years'
worth of acting lessons,'' said Ontkean, who grew up playing hockey
in Montreal, hockey's birthplace. (He now lives in Southern
California.)
</P>
<P>
   Ontkean said it was also ``a real honor'' to star in one of the
early mainstream movies about homosexuality, 1982's ``Making
Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bold movie in its day, and now it's very tame,'' he
said. ``But it was a real learning experience for me. I grew up in
Canada, and I'm a little backward in a lot of ways. This was a
whole culture for me to explore.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he hopes to continue his family-film string, even if it
means breaking a major rule of acting: Never work opposite kids or
animals (since they'll constantly upstage you).
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really mind,'' Ontkean said of his experience on
``Summer of the Monkeys.'' ``The chimps were so much fun, and the
kids were lively and energetic. You just can't find fault with that
kind of life force.''

QUICK CLICKS DELIVER TWO DECENT SYSTEMS &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>

<P>
   All indications are that this is going to be another banner
Christmas season for shopping online. Some analysts estimate that
40 percent of all Internet users will buy something over the World
Wide Web, and probably a lot more than that will use the Net for
research before buying.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that computer equipment is one of the most
popular online purchases. If you already have a computer, you're
comfortable with buying over the Web and you need to upgrade, it's
a natural progression to click your way to a spanking-new system.
</P>
<P>
   Savvy computer makers have set up user-friendly sites that let
you configure your own system online. Two masters of direct
consumer-PC sales, Gateway and Micron Electronics, have made the
process of selecting and purchasing a system via their Web pages
not just painless, but fun.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at two systems you can buy online. If you click
quickly, you might even be able to get them delivered in time for
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gateway G6-450, $1,998, Gateway: Looking for the most solidly
built, best-value, high-end consumer PC available this year? This
is it. Gateway has hit a home run with a system that packs a
powerful punch at an impressively low price.
</P>
<P>
   The starting configuration comes with Intel's top-of-the-line
450-megahertz Pentium II processor, 64 megabytes of memory, a
10-gigabyte hard drive, a DVD-ROM drive, a 3Dfx Banshee video card
with 16 MB of video memory, a PCI-based SoundBlaster card with
Boston Acoustic speakers and a US Robotics 56K Winmodem.
</P>
<P>
   And for that price, you also get a 17-inch monitor.
</P>
<P>
   I added a network interface card for connecting to a home
network, and a Voodoo2-based 3-D add-on graphics card for playing
games. I also switched out the Winmodem for a traditional modem _
more on that in a minute _ which brought the total to just under
$2,200, still a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The G6-450 is very, very fast _ easily the fastest 450-Mhz
system I've used. Give it more RAM, and it would probably do even
better. It easily handled every game I threw at it, from Half-Life
and Quake II to Sierra Pro Pilot 99, a flight simulator with some
challenging graphics.
</P>
<P>
   It is also is well-designed. There are three available PCI
slots, and the case is solid and roomy. There's room to work
inside.
</P>
<P>
   I have only three complaints about the G6-450, and they are
minor.
</P>
<P>
   First, the software bundle is relatively stingy, but that's
probably one way that Gateway keeps the price low. You can add
software as part of an upgraded configuration. However, don't
expect this system to come with all the programs you'll need _ it's
more for folks who already have their own software.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it comes with a winmodem, which stores its software
instructions on a file on the hard drive rather than in a chip on
the modem's circuit board. I'm on the verge of going on a crusade
against these things. I've never found one that works as well as a
traditional modem. If you buy a G6-450, take the option for a
regular modem.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the hard drive is noisy, making a loud clattering time
every time it's used.
</P>
<P>
   But, as I said, these are minor points. Overall, this is the
best consumer machine I've seen this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Millennia Max, $1,999, Micron Electronics: Like Dell Computer
Corp., Micron focuses on business sales, though like Dell, it's
always had a solid base of savvy consumer buyers. Micron makes
decent machines inexpensively, though the one I tried was not quite
as solid or fast as the Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried had a 450-Mhz Pentium II, 128 MB of memory, a
10-GB hard drive, a Diamond Viper V550 card with 16 MB of memory, a
DVD-ROM drive, US Robotics 56K Winmodem and a 128-voice wavetable
sound card with Monsoon M-100 speakers. Like the Gateway, this
price includes a 17-inch monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Micron came with twice as much memory as the
Gateway, it wasn't quite as fast. It also wasn't as stable, thanks
to buggy drivers that came with the Diamond Viper V550 card.
Although Diamond is working on new drivers, this card suffers from
serious problems. For example, America Online 4.0 users will find
the screen may freeze when they have the card's color depth set to
more than 256.
</P>
<P>
   I also did not specify that I did not want a winmodem in this
system. It had trouble connecting both to America Online and a
local Internet provider. Fortunately, a traditional modem is
available.
</P>
<P>
   I also did not care for the speakers, which look intriguing with
a set of flat-panel satellites complemented by a jet-black
subwoofer. But volume control was flakey _ it was either too loud
or too soft _ and the subwoofer delivered punchless bass.
</P>
<P>
   This system would be an excellent buy if you avoided the
winmodem, went shopping elsewhere for your speakers or chose one of
the two alternate video cards available at Micron's Web site.

WINDOWS 95/98, DESPITE RUMORS, ABLE TO HANDLE PLENTY OF MEMORY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I was about to go to the computer store and buy some more
memory to put in my system when a friend who I think is pretty
knowledgeable about PCs told me not to bother.
</P>
<P>
   He said Windows 95 and 98 can only handle up to 64 megabytes of
memory, and I would be wasting my money. I was thinking of going up
to 128 MB. What's the truth?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I've heard this from several readers, and fortunately, it's
not true. Windows 95/98 can handle a lot more memory than 64 MB _
up to four gigabytes!
</P>
<P>
   You see plenty of systems sold with 128 and 256 megabytes of
RAM, so that should be a clue right there that 64 megabytes is a
false limit. The amount of memory your particular machine can use
may be limited by your hardware, such as your motherboard and
system BIOS.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure where this rumor came from, except that there was a
similar one about Windows 3.1, that it could only handle 32
megabytes. MS-DOS did have a 64-megabyte limit, so that may be the
source.
</P>
<P>
   Some users have reported that if they have the old EMM386 device
from DOS still included in their config.sys files, their systems
will say they have 64 megabytes, even though the machine obviously
has _ and is making use of _ more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been told that it is better to close a window using
File, then Close/Exit, rather than using the X in the upper right
hand corner to avoid possibly corrupting files. Is that true or
does it only apply to certain windows like Word?
</P>
<P>
   A: Using the X box is basically the same thing as doing a
File/Exit menu command. You won't hurt your files doing it this
way. It is a good idea, though, to use the Save command before
shutting down a program if you have a document active in the
application.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I currently have a Pentium 100 and I'm going to be upgrading
very soon. On the P100 I have about 3 gigabytes of storage spanning
three drives. Is there a convenient way to transfer the files from
the P100 to the new computer? I thought that the easiest way would
be removing the drives one at a time from the old machine,
installing them in the new machine and copying the files to the new
drive, but I'm open to suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   A: That's one way to do it. Another suggestion _ buy a couple of
network cards and some Ethernet cable. Make a two-machine network
and copy the files that way. When you're done, you'll have all the
files on your new machine _ and you'll have a home network to boot!
</P>
<P>
   You can read my instructions for setting up a home network, from
a column I wrote last April, at
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/98/04/24/compute.html.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you can also use a program such as LapLink for Windows
(www.travsoft.com), which lets you transfer files between two
computers using a serial or parallel cable. This is the slowest
method, but doesn't require that you open your computer's case.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in adding a new 3-D card. My system came with
a 4-MB NVidia AGP graphics card. I want the STB Velocity 4400 16-MB
3-D card. Should I get the PCI version of this card and run both
cards together or get the AGP version and replace the original
graphics card?
</P>
<P>
   A: Replace the original AGP card if you want to use that
specific video card. AGP graphics cards are faster, so you would
not want to use the PCI card if your system has an AGP slot.
</P>
<P>
   The only kind of card that augments an existing graphics adapter
is the kind that uses 3Dfx's Voodoo or Voodoo2 chips. They connect
to your current card and take over only when 3-D is required.

CLINTON'S UNSAFE SEX, LIES AND MISSILE TAPES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Count me out. I never got the memo. I'm not
impeaching anyone and I'm not launching cruise missiles at anyone.
But I've thought about the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Just as I was making my list of people who deserve to be hit by
cruise missiles, unlike Iraqi civilians, one landed on House
Speaker-designate Robert Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   He said he ``on occasion strayed from his marriage,'' but added
that ``these past indiscretions were not with anyone on my staff,
and I was never called to testify on them.''
</P>
<P>
   And they were cuter than Monica, he could have added.
</P>
<P>
   As the House starts impeachment hearings, the Republic teeters
on such distinctions. After all, you can't get rid of a politician
for just having an affair, or Washington would be empty.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's not a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason Livingston was never called to testify on his
affairs. He didn't have a special prosecutor chasing him for six
years, cornering him in courtrooms and gathering dresses and secret
tape-recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Let's target that cruise missile on his glass house anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Bomb them all and let God sort them out. The most fanatical
Republican Guard is in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Bill Clinton is so wonderful. But there are rational
reasons for disliking Clinton, and irrational reasons for hating
him and wanting to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Just as an example of a rational reason to dislike Clinton, he
tends to use cruise missiles as weapons of mass distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles make for a good show on CNN and invariably raise
Clinton's poll ratings when he's in trouble. However, they also
raise Saddam Hussein's ratings in Iraq because of the civilians
they kill and wound.
</P>
<P>
   A cruise missile is a coward's weapon that doesn't risk American
casualties, but can't do the job that only can be done by
commitment to ground war.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the irrational hatreds of Clinton. The Republican
Party should be on the couch having their hatreds examined. One of
those obsessions is the need to wage retroactive culture war with
Woodstock Nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans don't know whom they're dealing with. Many of us
took acid back then. We can deal with the country's bad trip. We
already went down the rabbit hole.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Saddam Hussein has already attacked us with a chemical
weapon. Maybe he put thousands of gallons of LSD in our water
supply.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain everyone's weirdness? Retired Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf joined the Democrats, saying ``By golly, troops are
committed, and we can't have people second-guessing them the way
they did in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh no, we can't have that, not in a democracy led by a former
opponent of the Vietnam War. We must keep heading for the light at
the end of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri shouted:
``Our sons and daughters are in harm's way while we're beginning a
debate on impeaching a president. That is wrong. That is wrong.
That is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know. I seem to remember a debate on impeaching a
president during another undeclared war. But he deserved it, and
the war had already gone on for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   So they're going through with it, even if Clinton can make the
cruise-missile supply last until Jan. 6, when the new Congress is
sworn in. We're almost assured of seeing Linda Tripp and Monica
Lewinsky testify before the Senate. Talk about a bad trip.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein will be laughing his head off, as his government
becomes more entrenched while ours shatters.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate won't just be impeaching Clinton. They'll
be establishing law and setting precedent. Impeachment could become
a standard political tool for reversing elections.
</P>
<P>
   Just wait until a Republican becomes president again. After
this, though, you may have to wait a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans didn't have to do this. They could have used the
bombing as an impeachment halt, and let their hatred of Clinton
cool down for a while.
</P>
<P>
   But no, they've been feeding their irrational hatred of Clinton
for six years, and they're not about to quit now, Operation Desert
Fox, or no Operation Desert Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can't seem to do anything right at this point. His
glorious little green night-vision war has the same nickname as
Nazi Germany's greatest general, Erwin Rommel.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government protested the name, as well as the
cruise-missile attacks. One member of the Russian parliament even
introduced a motion appealing to Monica Lewinsky ``to restrain the
emotions of Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, he's on the phone, and it doesn't help.
</P>
<P>
   How bad are these times? So bad that it's a relief to get back
to the basic issues of government _ like which politicians
committed adultery.
</P>
<P>
   They all did, I suspect. But you know how it is with sex. One
thing leads to another.
</P>
<P>
   One moment you're having meaningless sex, and six years later
your life, the government and parts of Baghdad are destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   That, my friend, is not safe sex.

to perceive value that others overlooked. In his column, he urges
us to recognize the value of spirituality in life.)

<P>
   Imagine a majestic mountain, its granite peaks towering
thousands of feet into the sky. Nothing would seem to be more
invincible than this giant fortress of rock. Yet, in time, it is
possible that certain forces can reduce this mountain to tiny
pebbles.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the forces that wield such power are among the
softest, most yielding elements of nature -- water and air. The
blowing of winds and the gentle flowing streams can ultimately
conquer the mightiest of mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The power of the gentle approach can be illustrated by a
statement from the Tao Te Ching, the sacred writings of the Chinese
religion of Taoism: ``What is of all things most yielding can
overcome that which is the most hard.''
</P>
<P>
   And is not the spiritual power of forgiveness a loving, gentle
apprach than can soften the hardest of situations?
</P>
<P>
   When someone is unkind, critical, or spiteful -- yes, you can
suffer. But is the suffering not greater if we allow our thoughts
and emotions to become hardened and resistant? If our mind is
filled with resentment, anger, or a desire for revenge, these
feelings within ourself can do far more harm than any outside
influence can possibly do. Revenge is not a solution to anything.
It merely starts a new cycle of negation.
</P>
<P>
   Someone made the statement, ``If your life is not all you want
it to be, it may be that you have some forgiving to do.'' The
action of forgiveness may not necessarily come easily. Someone has
also said, ``A person's ability to forgive is in proportion to the
greatness of his soul.'' When forgiveness is genuine and complete,
it goes to the depths of the situation. Hatreds, resentments, even
mild dislikes can be dissolved by the power of forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Do you currently blame someone for a wrong you may believe has
been done to you? Do you hold any resentments toward someone for
your present situation? Is there a part of you that says, ``If only
so-and-so had not done such-and-such to me, I would be happier and
more successful''?
</P>
<P>
   In one way or another, we often try to find a scapegoat for a
lack we feel in our lives. Can you realize that what you hold on
to, holds on to you? Have you heard yourself say, ``I will never
forget the way she or he treated me.'' And you didn't forget.
</P>
<P>
   Humanly, it may be difficult to keep such thoughts and feelings
from recurring. But it can be done. Assistance is at hand when you
truly begin to understand and know that God's law of love and
justice adjusts all matters for those who trust it.
</P>
<P>
   A story has been told down through the years about Leonardo da
Vinci when he was painting the Last Supper on the walls of Santa
Maria delle Grazie, a church in Milan. It seems a significant event
occurred while da Vinci was working on the face of Jesus. The
artist became so angry and upset at someone that, the story goes, a
violent argument took place during which da Vinci threatened bodily
harm to the man and chased him away.
</P>
<P>
   When da Vinci returned to work on the fresco, he was so filled
with hatred and resentment that the flow of inspiration dried up.
Try as he might, da Vinci couldn't paint the face of Jesus.
Repeatedly he attempted to apply subtle brush strokes to the wet
plaster, only to be unhappy with the results and become more
frustrated and upset.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on realizing that his anger and upset was depriving him
of the peace of mind necessary for him to be creative, the great
artist laid aside his brushes and went in search of the man with
whom he had quarreled to apologize and ask for forgiveness. It took
a while to find the man, but on doing so, and after much
persuasion, da Vinci convinced the man of his pure intent, and the
situation was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   With a peace-filled and loving heart, da Vinci was able to
return to his work, and the magnificent face of the Christ that
flowed from his brushes became a mystical moment captured by the
great artist. It is said that even now, in spite of the pathetic
condition of the walls of the ruined church, the Last Supper
remains as one of the great art treasures of the world.
</P>
<P>
   We need to be aware of the price we may have to pay for holding
grudges and resentments. We need to understand that we are the ones
who suffer from this unforgiveness. It takes a lot of energy, which
could be much better spent, to hold onto a grudge. We may feel
temporarily justified in our attitude, but in the long run what
does it really matter? Why would we punish ourselves even further
by dwelling on negative thoughts and emotions? A tremendous cost in
sickness of mind and body affects those who cling to feelings of
unforgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   It has been rightly said, ``To err is human, to forgive is
divine.'' The highest and best qualities we possess urge us to get
on with our lives and stop making excuses for our failures. We do
ourselves a disservice when we blame our failures on someone else
rather than choosing to learn and grow from our experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Complete and total forgiveness can be a sure way to health and
happiness and to new energy and enthusiasm. It is a sign that we
are taking responsibility for our lives. Once we realize that we're
in the driver's seat, we can move swiftly and surely to greater
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victory comes through surrender,'' is another beautiful truth
from the Tao Te Ching. Yielding. Surrendering. Forgiving. Are these
not attitudes of mind wherein we recognize that our ``battles'' may
be won not by personal strength but by allowing a higher power to
work through us?

<P>
   Santa Claus may be able to travel around the world in a single
night, but when it comes to his health, he's no Superman, according
to the latest medical research. That bowl full of jelly, a diet
rich in fatty cookies and a lack of regular exercise all put Santa
at risk for a number of health problems.
</P>
<P>
   But adopting a healthier lifestyle won't be as difficult for
Santa as it may sound, according to Dr. Joseph A. Lieberman, the
chairman of the department of family and community medicine at the
Christiana Care Health System in Wilmington, Del., and a clinical
professor of family medicine at Jefferson Medical College in
Philadelphia. And Santa's jolly nature already gives him a head
start on improving his health, he said. While Lieberman has never
examined Santa himself, he has taken a peek at the Jolly One's
medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Medical Tribune News Service's annual review of the
state of Santa's health.
</P>
<P>
   --Santa needs to trim a few pounds. This may seem obvious, but
the importance of weight loss continues to be a subject of debate
in the medical community.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, the editors of a prestigious medical journal,
The New England Journal of Medicine, published an editorial stating
that Americans are too obsessed with trying to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   But in the spring, the American Heart Association placed obesity
in the same risk-factor class as smoking, high cholesterol, high
blood pressure and a sedentary lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda,
Md., announced new obesity guidelines, which declared that 55
percent of American adults need to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with these mixed messages, Santa should stay calm,
according to Lieberman. The Delaware expert recommended that St.
Nick ``use an exercise program and dietary discretion to keep his
weight under control,'' but that he should ``not be so obsessed
that it affects his jolly disposition.''
</P>
<P>
   --Year-round exercise can boost Santa's health. Besides helping
him trim down his bowl full of jelly, research published this year
has highlighted a number of exercise's health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A Finnish study of about 8,000 sets of twins found that those
who walked or jogged for just 30 minutes six or more times a month
had a 43 percent lower risk of death than sedentary people.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise may also help ward off Alzheimer's disease, according
to a study conducted at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland. In a group of 370 people, those who did not have
Alzheimer's had engaged in significantly more exercise during their
lifetimes than people with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Santa may not have much room for error, since ``he's already
making his list and checking it twice,'' Lieberman commented. ``We
want to insure that he forestalls the development of Alzheimer's,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman recommended that Santa exercise for 20 minutes at
least three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   --Lay off the cookies. ``An occasional indulgence in cookies is
OK, but kiddies may also want to put out other things,'' Lieberman
advised.
</P>
<P>
   Veggies may be good substitutes, since they are rich in
nutrients and fiber. And a study from Italy found that some
vegetables, carrots in particular, may help prevent certain types
of cancer. Vegetables and fruits rich in potassium, such as
bananas, may also lower the risk of stroke, according to a Harvard
study of more than 44,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   --Have an occasional glass of wine. While earlier research has
shown that a daily drink or two -- especially red wine -- may help
protect the heart, the habit may also help preserve Santa's sight,
according to a study of more than 3,000 adults that found that
moderate wine drinkers were less likely to develop age-related
macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness among the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman agreed, but he warned against drinking while behind
the reins. ``It would be wonderful to have wine, but not while he's
driving the sled,'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   --That jolly disposition counts for something. University of
Kentucky researchers have discovered that optimism may improve more
than a person's mood: it may also boost the immune system. ``We
should learn a lesson from Santa that a pleasant disposition may
prolong life,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Santa's outlook may be getting rosier. In a nationwide poll of
2,727 people ages 25 to 74, older men and women were more likely
than younger folks to say that they had felt happy, cheerful or
satisfied in the last month.
</P>

   SIDEBAR: A HEAD-TO-TOE ASSESSMENT OF SANTA'S HEALTH
</P>
<P>
   EDITORS: This sidebar is designed to accompany a full-length
graphic of Santa. Each blurb should point to the particular area of
Santa's body.
</P>
<P>
   --Eyes. Elderly people are at risk for a number of eye diseases,
including cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. The San
Francisco-based American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends a
complete eye exam every one to two years for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   --Nose. That red honker may mean that Santa likes to unwind with
a drink every now and then. While a drink or two a day can be a
boost for the heart, Santa should not overdo it, since excessive
drinking may lead to liver problems.
</P>
<P>
   --Smile. Santa's cheery attitude may help keep his immune system
strong.
</P>
<P>
   --Pipe. Besides increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke,
smoking a pipe increases Santa's odds of developing mouth and
throat cancers.
</P>
<P>
   --Heart. Fatty cookies and lack of regular exercise makes life
tougher for Santa's ticker.
</P>
<P>
   --Belly. It may jiggle when he laughs, but that spare tire
increases Santa's chance of heart attack, stroke, diabetes and a
number of other health problems.
</P>
<P>
   --Knee. Unless he sheds a few pounds, Santa's extra weight may
lead to a painful joint disease known as osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   --Hat/Hands/Feet. To protect himself against frostbite and
hypothermia, St. Nick must not forget to wear gloves, hat and
snow-proof boots.
</P>
<P>
   --Bones. To help keep Santa's bones strong, kids should leave
out glasses of milk -- skim, of course.

DREAMWORKS TEMPTS FAITH IN ITS MOSES PORTRAIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' is a hard sell. Critics know it. The
studio knows it. Probably even Moses knows it, or he would if he
were around to dwell on such things. A biblically inspired,
resolutely unsilly animated musical aimed at grown-ups is not the
sort of movie generally paired with the term ``blockbuster.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the sort of movie generally made.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here it is, DreamWorks' startling new look at the Book of
Exodus, and the powers that be in production are crossing their
fingers and their toes, and their hearts, and their split ends,
probably _ in skittish anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely concerned that it's a hard sell,'' said
Penney Finkelman Cox, who produced the film with Sandra Rabins.
``Yes, we feel that it's going to be a real challenge to get people
to choose this movie. . .. The whole fear from day one was that if
people saw it as a Sunday school lesson, as something that was,
quote, `good for you,' it'd be the last thing in the world they'd
want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, she said, the studio aimed from the start for
a more human _ and dramatically compelling _ portrait of Moses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about having this very well-known story is, you
know, there are two things you have to include: There's no doubt
that the Red Sea has to part, and the bush has to talk. ... But the
only way to make (`Prince of Egypt') a film experience as opposed
to a Sunday school lesson is to find the drama in it as well,''
said Cox, speaking in a recent telephone interview from Los
Angeles. ``The man Moses _ that's what we set out to discover, the
man and his vision and his goals. And we tried to discover what
made him such a unique figure.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the film's biggest leaps is its depiction of the
relationship between Moses and the Pharaoh Rameses, who are
portrayed as adoptive brothers. This gives the movie much of its
dramatic tension, requiring Moses to renounce his Egyptian family
before he can obey God's call. ``(Moses) was the first reluctant
hero he was the first very fallible, very human hero who said,
`What difference can I make? I'm just one man. I'm not sure I want
to take this job.' He's a man who committed murder, he had all the
faults and all of the weaknesses of all of us. He asked all the
questions all of us ask in our lives: `I'm just an individual; do I
have a responsibility to society as a whole, or can I just hide in
my life?'''
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who produced DreamWorks' computer-animated ``Antz'' as well
as such live-action films as ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and (as
co-producer) ``Terms of Endearment,'' described the four-year
creative discussions behind ``Prince'' as ``an incredibly yeasty
stew of conversation'' that covered mythology, identity and the
nature of religion. She quickly brushed off questions about her own
or anyone else's religious beliefs, and swore the film ``was not
made from a point of view of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the movie's creators were careful to treat the
story of Moses with respect, delicately balancing elements from
Exodus with their own new twists. ``The whole nature of religion is
about commentary the basic rule is that every Saturday and Sunday
across the world, priests and ministers and rabbis are basically
making commentaries,'' she said. ``And one of the first
understandings we came to was that when the Bible is silent on
something, that allows for commentary, that allows for the midrash
that evolved, for the speculation on what might've happened. But
when the Bible is specific, then the specificity has to be
understood and respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``As lay people, it really was a challenge,'' she said. The
bottom line was a matter of moviemaking: how to make the film
respectful ``while making it entertaining, while making it dramatic
and effective and not a Bible lesson. We just didn't want to string
icons together.''
</P>
<P>
   A more mundane worry was how to avoid imitating ``The Ten
Commandments,'' Cecil B. DeMille's 1956 benchmark. Cox said the
film's executive producer, DreamWorks honcho Jeffrey Katzenberg,
asked everyone early on not to watch the older film. ``He really
made a plea for us not to see it,'' Cox said. ``Because if we saw
it again, we might be tempted, inadvertently, to copy it in ways
that we couldn't even predict. Or we might be tempted to strongly
go in an opposite direction, which would also color our choices.
But it's really hard to say what subliminal influences it might
have had.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said she sees a marked difference between the complexity of
``The Prince of Egypt'' and the simplicity of the average animated
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we came to understand the story, the more we grew
inspired by it by the depth of it, by the amazing richness of the
cinematic material,'' Cox said. ```The Prince of Egypt' has so many
dimensions, it's such a multidimensional story, that for us that
was the challenge and the fun of it. We had such a good time
allowing ourselves to layer it on.''
</P>
<P>
   What about audiences? Will they respond? Cox hopes so. Recalling
an early screening of the film, she said, ``My favorite comment was
the comment of a 7-year-old boy, who said, `Gosh, the Red Sea
rocks.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I want: I want a 7-year-old to say, `The Red Sea
rocks.' I want it all.''

STAVE OFF END, FORM NEW LEAGUE FOR THE PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - For many, the withdrawals are already starting.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL season is dwindling down to a precious few games, and
you know what that means _ the end of fantasy football.
</P>
<P>
   Horror of horrors.
</P>
<P>
   Without fantasy leagues, the NFL is much like the inside of
Kevin Greene's skull: a bleak void, bereft of all meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Or not. Anyway, you get the picture. When your fantasy team hits
the wall, it's really hard to get up for this week's Carolina-St.
Louis tilt. This is the No Fun League, after all.
</P>
<P>
   But I feel your pain. If the shakes get too bad, you can always
take desperate measures. Like watching the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Just a little joke there.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm talking about playoff fantasy football. This is an
even more depraved version, where you hold a draft between
Christmas and New Year's Day (very popular with the spousal unit,
by the way) and pick players from playoff-bound teams such as
Denver, Minnesota and maybe even, yipes, Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   There are a million ways to do it, but I've developed a
blueprint which can be borrowed at no personal cost to you.
</P>
<P>
   Each owner drafts a quarterback, two running backs, two wide
receivers, a tight end, a kicker and a defense/special teams unit
from a team that has made the playoffs. There are no backups, since
the season is so short and the pool of players is going to shrink
as teams lose.
</P>
<P>
   There are no head-to-head games. A winner is determined by the
cumulative total points amassed by each team. Points are counted
right through the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, strategy plays a huge part in a playoff league. You
want players from teams favored to reach the Super Bowl, such as
Denver and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Do you take a chance on a player who may get great numbers for
one or two games, like Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre, or
someone who will have lesser numbers but play in more games, like
Denver quarterback John Elway?
</P>
<P>
   We at Fantasy Central are here to help. Some handicapping for
the sure-bet playoff teams:
</P>
<P>
   Denver: If running back Terrell Davis isn't your first pick,
immediately submit yourself to the commissioner for drug testing.
I'm not as fired up about the Broncos passing attack, though Elway
should ring up numbers just because he'll play a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota: Randall Cunningham. Randy Moss. Cris Carter. Robert
Smith (injured, but he'll be back). The Vikings are an
embarrassment of riches, and I don't see anybody keeping them out
of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta: Jamal Anderson should go in the first round. Tony
Martin and Terance Mathis are nice players, as is Chris Chandler if
his glass body doesn't shatter on impact.
</P>
<P>
   New York Jets: Coach Bill Parcells should keep the Jets around
for a couple of rounds, so quarterback Vinny Testaverde, running
back Curtis Martin and receivers Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet
are worth drafting.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco: Steve Young and Garrison Hearst might last only
two games, but they'll put up monster numbers that could sustain
you through the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas: The Cowboys are in if they beat either Philadelphia or
Washington at home. Trouble is, they'll only win one game.
Quarterback Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith are the picks. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Waiver wire &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'd take a look at Washington wide receiver Albert Connell, as
well as running back Skip Hicks, who is subbing for a dinged-up
Terry Allen. Rams running back June Henley had a nice game against
the Patriots. Cowboys receiver Patrick Jeffers would be a nice
pickup. &QL; 
One-hit wonder &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week, it's New York Giants quarterback Kent Graham, who
threw for 265 yards and two touchdowns against Denver. I've seen
the future, and it's not Kent Graham. &QL;

FEAR TAKES A HOLIDAY, BUT RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - For a minute I felt frightened, a soul-chill that drew
me back to boyhood, to the age of 10, 11, 12. To nights when I
regularly snapped out of sleep to a vision of shadows, ashen
blemishes cast on charred concrete. Nuclear silhouettes.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't felt such a fear in 20 years, maybe longer. Then I sat
at my desk staring at the television set Wednesday afternoon,
taking in the face of our president and the greenish glow of
Baghdad at night. These images made me feel young again but not
youthful; young, but at the same time, too old.
</P>
<P>
   It lasted a minute only, this fear, then quickly turned to
surprise. Not surprise because I had experienced a minute's chill,
but surprise because I had gone two decades without it.
</P>
<P>
   Without a hint of The Bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Detonated not (begin ital) there, (end ital) somewhere far off
and evil, but here, on American soil. Killing not them, but us.
</P>
<P>
   It is an idea long gone from our culture, almost quaint. It
disappeared with the end of the Cold War and the mounting years _
some 53 now _ between today and the flight of the Enola Gay.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we talk of war without thought to reprisal, about bombs
dropped as political strategy to stave off impeachment or to wag
some Hollywood-conjured dog. War is a prime-time show, a reason to
pre-empt the sitcoms. Bombs are ``smart,'' damage to the innocent
is ``collateral.'' Every mission has a testosterone-drenched name
and a TV logo.
</P>
<P>
   Today, war is media fodder, something to chew over at the water
cooler, to speculate about with the call-in hosts. War is like
cancer, or a fatal car crash, or a drive-by shooting. Such a
cataclysm will never happen to us, not in America.
</P>
<P>
   We have come far in this culture, and fast, but not so far as we
think. Wednesday afternoon, the face of Saddam Hussein reminds me
of this. Of the fear.
</P>
<P>
   We can kill him, make Baghdad disintegrate, but we can't kill
them all _ every madman with access to a lump of something
radioactive. There are too many of them, and they believe in their
own truths too deeply. So one day they will extract a price.
</P>
<P>
   Not with missiles, most likely, or by full-frontal assault. By
something planted somewhere, something with deadly force enough to
make the World Trade Center or Oklahoma City and the coring of a
Federal Building look positively mild.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's long minute, I see the aftermath, as I did as a
boy.
</P>
<P>
   I was 11 the first time I read John Hersey's ``Hiroshima,'' old
enough to unpuzzle the words, but too young to really understand. I
pulled the book off the shelf of the library at Public School 209,
a blond brick building with a yellow and black sign that denoted a
fallout shelter.
</P>
<P>
   My mother had told me stories of her grade-school days, sirens
and A-bomb drills, but I was too late for that. Instead I had
Hersey and his six survivors, the clerk and the doctor, the
tailor's widow and the priest, the surgeon and the pastor.
</P>
<P>
   I read that book in my head many nights for months.
</P>
<P>
   Saw the flash of light, the mushroom cloud. Saw hanging flesh
and bare trees, day turned into night.
</P>
<P>
   I have read the book many times since. Every page makes me feel
11 years old _ small in the face what we have the capacity to
inflict. Frightened.
</P>
<P>
   Like I felt for a minute Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   I watched and listened to bombing coverage as the night wore on,
waiting for another minute like that one. It never came. Baghad's
nighttime green gave way to daylight. The streets looked largely
undamaged. The talk in Washington balanced the mission with the
president's self-made distress.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when I opened my eyes in the dead of one more night, it
wasn't to shadows burned into the sidewalk, but to the sound of my
wife's breathing.
</P>
<P>
   I listened to her a long time. I felt so young and so very old.
The bombs felt far away and all too close. Twenty years never felt
shorter. &QL;

WE'LL SURVIVE IMPEACHMENT  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE DEC. 18 ARIZONA REPUBLIC)  
 (FOR USE BY N.Y. TIMES NEWS SERVICE CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   By XXXXXX  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - At long last, the full House of Representatives has
begun deciding whether to impeach President Clinton. For all the
fits and starts, unseemly revelations and even bombing attacks, we
have arrived at this historic vote with the president having had
any number of opportunities to explain himself honestly, to present
his case candidly.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Clinton has done neither.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year, the president has twisted and dodged and
sought to evade accusations that he violated the law. In plain
language, he has yet to fess up to much of anything. Now Clinton's
lack of credibility clouds even the motives behind his decision to
bomb Baghdad on Wednesday. If anything, the timing of that foray
into Iraq has stiffened the resolve of House Republicans to deal
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It may be, as even some of his apologists argue, that Clinton is
incapable of telling the truth or of expressing real remorse over
his efforts to conceal his relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky. That is a failing, and, however papered
over by supporters, it is hardly a reason to hand the president a
free pass or allow him to duck the legal consequences of his
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming vote is a rendezvous with truth and conscience. The
House will vote on four articles of impeachment that accuse Clinton
of perjury in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, perjury
before a federal grand jury, obstructing justice and misusing or
abusing the power of his office. All four stem from Clinton's
efforts to cover up his affair with Lewinsky. If the House votes to
impeach, as seems likely, the matter will go to the Senate for a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who has alternately been fascinated with and
anguished about his place in history, is about to land next to
Andrew Johnson, who was impeached by the House, and somewhere near
Richard Nixon, who underwent his own presidential impeachment
crisis and resigned. Is it any wonder Clinton signaled last week
that he was ``ready to accept'' the rebuke and censure of Congress?
</P>
<P>
   (Even that _ ``ready to accept'' _ connotes an arrogant
assumption that Clinton has a choice in the matter.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's many defenders contend that while he has not been
truthful, his lies have been about a rather trifling matter in the
scheme of things _ sex. They contend that perjury and obstruction
of justice do not rise to the level of high crimes and
misdemeanors. In fact, theirs is a world where the president enjoys
executive privilege and is above the law. Committing perjury, on
videotape, is just one of those things that happens, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the very foundation of our justice system _ the
value of truth.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen one argument after another against impeachment
topple over, Democratic leaders and liberal intellectuals now warn
of dire consequences for the nation if Clinton is impeached and the
Senate begins a trial on whether to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintonian mantra is that impeachment puts America on the
brink of a crisis. The nation will be plunged into months of pain
and despair. Why, even the stock market, the only barometer of
importance to some Americans, is allegedly quaking because of
political uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   This nation has survived wars, assassinations, riots and any
number of corrupt politicians. It certainly is big enough to handle
an impeachment trial. In a decade of highly publicized trials,
maybe it is appropriate that the Clinton presidency should wind up
in the town stockade.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fears of Clinton supporters and perhaps others, it
is hard to see the Senate dwelling for months on a trial. This body
will want to dispose of the issue as quickly as possible, opening
the door to some sort of tough censure. That would allow Clinton to
hang onto his tarnished office and contemplate what might have
been.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton supporters, who have been quick to cite polls showing
public opposition to impeachment, can't be encouraged by the latest
polls. A ``Wall Street Journal''/NBC News survey shows that 44
percent would prefer that, if impeached, Clinton resign.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he should or not, Clinton seems likely to survive the
impeachment process _ just as the nation will. &QL;

   So much for the very foundation of our justice system _ the
value of truth.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen one argument after another against impeachment
topple over, Democratic leaders and liberal intellectuals now warn
of dire consequences for the nation if Clinton is impeached and the
Senate begins a trial on whether to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintonian mantra is that impeachment puts America on the
brink of a crisis. The nation will be plunged into months of pain
and despair. Why, even the stock market, the only barometer of
importance to some Americans, is allegedly quaking because of
political uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   This nation has survived wars, assassinations, riots and any
number of corrupt politicians. It certainly is big enough to handle
an impeachment trial. In a decade of highly publicized trials,
maybe it is appropriate that the Clinton presidency should wind up
in the town stockade.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fears of Clinton supporters and perhaps others, it
is hard to see the Senate dwelling for months on a trial. This body
will want to dispose of the issue as quickly as possible, opening
the door to some sort of tough censure. That would allow Clinton to
hang onto his tarnished office and contemplate what might have
been.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton supporters, who have been quick to cite polls showing
public opposition to impeachment, can't be encouraged by the latest
polls. A ``Wall Street Journal''/NBC News survey shows that 44
percent would prefer that, if impeached, Clinton resign.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he should or not, Clinton seems likely to survive the
impeachment process _ just as the nation will. &QL;

GOALS OF THE AIR ATTACKS SIGNAL A US POLICY SHIFT

   WASHINGTON _ What happens after the bombing stops?
</P>
<P>
   Under fire for launching missile against Iraq without a
long-term strategy, President Clinton's national security team
Thursday responded by disclosing a broad plan: aiming to crush
Iraq's defenses, destroy biological and chemical weapons
production, increase unrest in the Iraqi army and ultimately topple
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   In public statements and briefings to Congress, officials
described the plan as a dramatic change in what had for years been
an effort to ``contain'' Hussein and control his weapons
development.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration has been reluctant to reveal details,
plans under consideration include drastic measures such as
declaring all of Iraq a ``no-fly, no troop-movement zone'' so that
Hussein cannot use his warplanes or dispatch his soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a seminal shift in the attitude of the
administration, as I read it,'' said Joseph R. Biden Jr. of
Delaware, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, who has been in regular touch with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. ``Put it this way, I'd be surprised if at the
end of a three- four- or five-day air campaign the adminstration
said, `Well, we've done our job.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the strike say that President Clinton launched
strikes merely to punish Iraq or deflect attention from impeachment
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf
accused the US and British governments of exaggerating reports of
Iraq's weapons development and telling ``cheap lies in order to
deceive the world, in order to have the pretext to commit
aggression against Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is not alone. Some of the most virulent criticism came
Thursday from Russia. The State Department Thursday announced that
Russia had recalled its ambassador to Washington to protest the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, a group
representing Muslim countries, issued a statement saying, ``Iraq
finds itself subject to military strikes which come under
mysterious circumstances with no clear objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has given mixed messages about its
objectives in this campaign. Just a month ago, Clinton called off
an attack on Iraq, saying it would lead other countries to end
inspections by the UN Special Commision, or UNSCOM. But Thursday,
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said the ``medium-term
goal'' of the attack is to have ``a strong, professional,
functioning UNSCOM with unfettered access to be able to continue to
do its work.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate objective of the bombing is to ``degrade''
Hussein's ability to make biological, chemical and nuclear weapons
and attack his command and control centers, Albright said. The
ultimate objective, she indicated, is to overthrow Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key word is `degrade' because it allows them to declare
any victory at any point,'' said Howard Diamond, an expert with the
Arms Control Association in Washington. ``If you bomb two targets
and hit one, you can still say that you have degraded Iraq's
capacity to build weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Even supporters say the administration is taking a risky turn
that could, at the very least, lead to an expensive commitment of
US troops near Iraq for years to come. Also, the effort could cause
a backlash that isolates the United States at the United Nations
and leads to the end of weapons inspections and an easing of
economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, a senior UN official predicted that
Russia, China, France and other countries critical of the attack
would lead an effort to derail or end the UN Special Commission, or
UNSCOM. ``There is good reason to believe we could get totally
thrown out period _ buzz off,'' he said. ``No oil-for-food (deals).
No UNSCOM, and the erosion of economic sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its limits, the inspection team has served as an
important group of eyes and ears in Baghdad for the past seven
years. Even when the Iraqi government turned away inspectors from
sites, that was a tip to Washington that Saddam Hussein wanted to
hide something, said Richard Shultz, a professor of international
politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts
University and former consultant to the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the inspections could deprive the US government of
one of the few reliable sources of information it has inside Iraq,
he said. ``If you change your strategy and now you're going to try
control Saddam's weapons of mass destruction production through
military strikes, then will you ever have the intelligence you
need?''
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, Russia started lobbying to remake a less
aggressive UNSCOM with fewer British and American inspectors.
Russia called for a more ``professional'' and ``objective'' group
of inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Albright and Clinton have called top officials from
more than 20 countries to rally support. The effort has taken the
edge off of some of the sharp words. Although China and Russia
condemned the strike, France muted its criticism Thursday. ``I
don't know the solution to this problem,'' Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's new government voiced strong backing for the attack,
as Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said, ``There is no question
whatsoever about our solidarity with the international community,
and with our alliance partners the United States and Great
Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   Arab countries have reacted cautiously to the strikes, which
might continue through the first days of Ramadan, the holy month,
this weekend. But American diplomats said the Arab leaders have
been supportive in private countries because they are so wary of
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The attack has provided encouragement to fractious Iraqi
opposition, which is seeking undercover assistance as well as $97
million in military aid that money the US Congress set aside to
help seize power in Baghdad. But the administration, concerned that
the opposition groups have scant support inside the country, has
not been able to settle on any .
</P>
<P>
   Senator Biden said Republicans have criticized President Clinton
for failing to choose an opposition group, yet Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott and other critics also have been unable to settle
on a group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `Fine, give me a name... Come on Trent, say it out
loud, ' '' Biden told reporters Thursday. ``Come on fella, speak
up. You say, `I have a plan to overthrow (Hussein)'? Okay, tell
me.''

FOR SOME BLACKS, NEW FEARS OF AN ALLY'S FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most Americans see the vote on whether to impeach
President Clinton as a unique event, something they might see once
in a lifetime, or even once in a century. But for some black
Americans, it all has a familiar ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many African-Americans fear now that anybody that stands up
for us like Bill Clinton has, that someone always tries to come and
get them,'' said the Rev. Earl Nance Jr., who raised the point in
his sermon last Sunday at the Greater Mount Carmel Baptist Church
in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, Kennedy was shot. Carter did only one term,''
said Hank Thompson, a Missouri political consultant and black-radio
talk show host. ``This is almost the same soup warmed over. Any
elected official that shows any kind of interest in equity or fair
play and diversity _ something inevitably happens to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the House moves toward an impeachment vote,
African-American leaders are divided over whether the effort to
eject Clinton from office would energize black voters with anger,
or only increase feelings of alienation.
</P>
<P>
   The debate comes in a year that African-American leaders battled
a frustrating and false rumor that blacks would lose the right to
vote in eight years, when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 comes up
for renewal. Many were also forced to repeatedly knock down a false
rumor that federal regulators planned to ban gospel programs from
radio.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the rumors illustrated the insecurity that some blacks
feel about their place in American society. They fear those
feelings might grow if Congress removes a president who is
overwhelmingly supported by black voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People believing this hoax about their voting rights having to
be renewed _ that comes from black people knowing their own history
of being left outside the mainstream,'' said Representative James
Clyburn, the South Carolina Democrat who is incoming chairman of
the Congressional Black Caucus. Impeaching and removing the
president, he said, ``would reinforce that and give those feelings
legs.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment battle has also spawned rumors. Waiting for the
bus at the Dudley Square station Tuesday, John Pight offered one of
his own: That White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky was, in fact, a
Republican plant whose job was to prey on the president's
weaknesses and discredit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they had to do was get some intern in, knowing how he
is,'' said Pight, 30, a cook at Northeastern University. ``The
Republicans are for the rich and the Democrats are for the poor.
That's why they tried to get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won loyalty from the black community years ago, and he
has cemented it by initiating a dialogue on race and highlighting
the pain of the US slave trade during a trip to Africa. His Cabinet
has included black members like Alexis Herman at the Labor
Department, Hazel O'Leary at Energy, Michael Espy at Agriculture,
and the late Ronald Brown at Commerce. A black man, Vernon E.
Jordan Jr., is among his closest friends. A black woman, Betty
Currie, is among his top personal staff.
</P>
<P>
   Only a month ago, black voters produced their largest turnout at
the polls in 10 years as they helped Clinton's party make
unexpected gains in Congress. About 89 percent of the black vote
went to Democrats this year, up from 82 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Today on black radio, a pro-Clinton novelty song has become one
of the most-requested tunes. ``Leave Bill Clinton Alone,'' croons
Larry Shannon Hargrove. ``Everybody's done something wrong. You
just don't like him 'cause he wears dark glasses and plays the
saxophone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People love that record,'' said Travis Gardner, program
director at KCOH radio in Houston. ``They constantly ask for it.
Even on our talk shows, they're playing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, in Missouri, said, ``Some people hated what he did in
signing welfare reform, but Clinton has a real affinity'' for the
African-American community. ``He just seems very, very comfortable.
You contrast that with 12 years of Reagan and Bush, and he's almost
like a black angel.''
</P>
<P>
   As lawmakers took up the impeachment debate, it was hard to
ignore the black support for Clinton. The Rainbow/Push Coalition,
led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, held a prayer vigil outside the
Capitol Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If the effort to block impeachment fails, some fear that black
voting could decline. ``It doesn't do any good for the morale of
the African-American community, when they see a president forced
out who is sensitive to their issues, who has a Cabinet that
reflects them,'' said Nance.
</P>
<P>
   But state Representative Byron Rushing, a Boston Democrat, said
any disappointment would be overshadowed by the victory blacks feel
in having produced a large voter turnout last month. ``The reaction
in the black community in this last election was that they had done
something good,'' Rushing said.
</P>
<P>
   Tavis Smiley, host of a weeknight talk show on Black
Entertainment Television, said Republicans could ultimately be hurt
the most by voting for impeachment. The GOP could find it difficult
to maintain a majority in a nation that is increasingly brown and
black, Smiley said.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, impeachment could undo any benefits that House
Republicans won by naming a black congressmen, Representative J.C.
Watts of Oklahoma, to the coveted position of GOP conference
chairman. ``This effort to crush the president takes away anything
they might have picked up with the elevation of J.C. Watts to a
leadership position,'' Smiley said. ``It's going to hurt the
Republicans tremendously.''

TO CLINTON FRIENDS, LOYALTY AN OPEN QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the day the Gennifer Flowers story nearly
destroyed Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992, Clinton
survived with the help of ``Friends of Bill'' such as
Representative W. J. ``Billy'' Tauzin of Louisiana. Tauzin endorsed
Clinton and helped keep the campaign alive among skeptical Southern
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stood by him at his moment of crisis,'' Tauzin said about
the Flowers episode. But, as president, Clinton lied to get
Tauzin's vote for a budget bill, the lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin, a Democrat-turned-Republican, announced Wednesday he was
leaning toward voting for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, perhaps more than at any time in his life, Clinton needs
help from his FOB's, the Friends of Bill who have guided him
through so many crises. But it may be too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take friends who helped you and tried to work with
you and then you burn them, where do you turn to in this crisis?''
Tauzin said in an interview. ``I'm convinced that there isn't a
friend he wouldn't sell out for his own purposes. I'm convinced
that he doesn't even recognize the consequences of those acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Hillary Rodham Clinton, who famously stood by her husband
in a ``60 Minutes'' interview in the 1992 campaign and who earlier
this year blamed a ``right-wing conspiracy'' for Clinton's
problems, has been silent. An NBC News report this week caused a
buzz in Washington by saying that Mrs. Clinton ``was seen brushing
away her husband's arm'' when the couple visited the grave site of
Yitzhak Rabin, the former Israeli prime minister. But White House
officials insisted the movement was subtle and misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, according to her spokeswoman Marsha Berry, is
``very engaged'' in the strategy to stop impeachment, including
discussions with some members of Congress. Asked why Mrs. Clinton
hasn't talked publicly about whether she has forgiven her husband,
Berry responded: ``Mainly because she considers it a private
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton's supporters in the House appear strained in
their defense. Most Democrats who oppose impeachment quickly add
that they condemn the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the start of his presidency, Clinton has had a
reputation for dumping friends when it suited his political
purposes. He walked away from his first two nominees for attorney
general, Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood. Then he dropped the nomination
of Lani Guinier to be the Justice Department's civil rights chief
when critics labeled her _ unfairly, she said _ ``quota queen.''
Clinton also failed to fight for a number of his judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Clinton's friends came with him from Arkansas, only to
be beset by troubles in Washington. Former White House deputy
counsel Vincent Foster committed suicide, and former associate
attorney general Webster Hubbell was jailed for embezzling funds
from law firm clients.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin's relationship with Clinton provides a case study in how
a friendship failed. The Louisiana congressman vividly recalls the
day reports surfaced that Flowers had an affair with Clinton,
because Tauzin stood on a platform with the Arkansas governor and
endorsed him during the primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got many conservatives and Republicans to support him in his
first bid for the presidency,'' Tauzin said. ``It is hard not to
like the guy. He is one of the most charming people you will ever
meet in politics. That is probably one of the reasons he remains as
popular as he is. People want to be his friend from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after Clinton was elected, the president promised
Tauzin and others he would eliminate a proposed energy tax if they
would support his budget. Tauzin and the others agreed, only to
learn later that Clinton was retaining the energy tax, which later
was dropped for other reasons. Tauzin turns angry as he recalls the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lied to me and they stole my vote, took it under false
pretenses,'' Tauzin said. ``That to me is a worse offense than what
he is charged with now . . . I ought to be public about this
prejudice.'' As Tauzin was deciding how to vote on impeachment, he
said he would not talk with Clinton because ``I wouldn't believe a
word he says.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Clinton is not ousted from office, it might be because
he has been able to count on a small circle of friends who remain
loyal. Unlike during the Watergate years, when former White House
counsel John Dean and others provided incriminating evidence
against President Nixon, no one has come forward in a similar way
to hurt Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, friends such as lawyer Vernon E. Jordan Jr.,
who helped Monica S. Lewinsky get a job, and White House deputy
counsel Bruce Lindsey, who has refused to testify about what he
considers to be privileged conversations with Clinton, have done
their best to back up the president's version of events.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, such help has not been enough to avert the pending
House vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In Little Rock, Ark., meanwhile, some of Clinton's closest
friends say they will be by his side no matter what happens in the
House or during a possible Senate trial. Some of the original
``Arkansas Travelers,'' who traveled throughout the nation in 1992
to boost Clinton's candidacy, met this week at the local Democratic
Party headquarters to demonstrate their support.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the president's friends recalled being upset when
Clinton admitted in August that he had an inappropriate
relationship with Lewinsky. One of his closest friends, Arkansas
lawyer Joe Purvis, said, ``There is no question that Clinton let
his friends down. There was a period of time right after the
announcement that you were really mad, then you come back and you
put it in perspective.'' Purvis said he remains friends with
Clinton and called the impeachment effort ``absolute insanity.''
Skip Rutherford, a Clinton friend who chose to remain in Arkansas
rather than take a job in the Clinton administration, said the
current scandal has only reinforced friendships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The friends of the Clintons are stronger now than ever
before,'' Rutherford said. ``Friendship runs very deep, and it is
not based on whether there are good times or bad times.''

GOP LEADERSHIP STUBS ITS TOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton-haters running Congress made it two-in-a-row in
committing colossal blunders this week, and it's still only Friday.
So blinded are they by hate that they risk alienating all but the
most rabid voters. The Sun Belt Commandoes running this lynch mob
displayed a shaky grasp as they launched their anti-Clinton
impeachment coup.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi led off with an
incredible gaffe. Even before the first US cruise missile zeroed in
on Iraqi military targets, Lott denounced the strike. ``I cannot
support this military action in the Persian Gulf at this time,''
Lott declared defiantly.
</P>
<P>
   That lasted a day; Thursday he summoned a CNN crew to hem and
haw: yeah, sure, of course I support the troops, ``We want to make
sure we have a united front in this effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott can be smarmy on even his best days, but Thursday he was at
his smarmiest. ``We should have acted &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (against Iraq) in February, and November,'' he rambled. Then he
coughed up a half-baked apology of sorts. ``I believe that there is
no relationship,'' he said, between the impeachment threat and
Clinton's decision to order military action.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he had been convinced &UR;  &LR; by Defense Secretary William
Cohen, a former GOP senator, and the joint chiefs of staff, that
politics did not play a key role. ``I am satisfied this was a
military decision,'' oozed Lott, backing away from his stance of
the day before.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's Judy Woodruff would not let him off the hook so easily. In
1990, she reminded Lott, you said senators who refused to support
the Gulf War ``could be giving aid and comfort to Saddam Hussein.''
Lott winced, then fell back, mumbling about how the Democrats
opposed President Bush's Gulf War launch. He was only one of a
couple of hundred Republicans who had to scramble to regain their
political equilibrium after the Iraq strike upset the GOP's
impeachment applecart.
</P>
<P>
   Initial polls showed 3-1 support for the strike against Iraqi
chemical and biological weapons sites. Clinton's job approval
rating of 68 percent is the year's highest. Impeachment is still
opposed by a solid majority of all polled. Yet the GOP then made
Blunder No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bob Livingston of Louisiana, the man elected to
replace Newt Gingrich as speaker, emerged from the House Republican
Caucus to declare that Clinton would win only a 24-hour delay in
his impeachment. Thursday, Livingston, who has ducked most public
appearances since toppling Gingrich, took the House floor to
announce that on Day 3 of war with Iraq, Clinton would face
impeachment in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston and Lott: two of a kind. This pair raise backstabbing
to a whole new level. They and their lieutenants, busily
undermining Clinton as he presides over a shooting war, have
shattered the century-old American political practice of shelving
partisan differences when troops are in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   The public's verdict all year has been that the ambushing of
Clinton was a partisan deal from the get-go. Livingston tried to
duck his role, but cannot hide any longer after being drawn into
the impeachment morass.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of Americans don't know Livingston from Adam,
polls show. And the Bayou Bookkeeper is clearly not ready for prime
time. He was nervous and barely articulate in a news conference
announcing he'd push for a quick impeachment vote. Livingston, who
once donned a red clown nose and a blue clown hat on the floor of
the House in a debate about campaign finance reform, is not nearly
as nimble-witted as Gingrich, driven from office by the same
right-wingers he personally recruited for his majority.
</P>
<P>
   Head bobbing like Big Bird, babbling about how the Democrats
were against the Vietnam War and opposed aid for ``the Freedom
Fighters'' of Central America under Reagan, Livingston did not make
a reassuring impression. He had been similarly obdurate in hosting
a meeting of feminists, who left his office furious over his
dismissal of their objections to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   With hard-line Texans like Majority Leader Dick Armey and whip
Tom ``The Hammer'' DeLay knuckling moderate Republicans into the
impeachment press gang, the Republican Party is risking its future
on this hotheaded, intemperate, unfair, and unpatriotic bid to dump
Clinton with a war going on.
</P>
<P>
   The backstabbing is disgraceful. It cannot fail to galvanize
public support behind Clinton. The lesson of the week is what
Clinton said of Saddam: ``If you act recklessly, you will pay a
heavy price.'' Saddam stiffed the UN weapons inspectors and is
eating cruise missiles as his price. Clinton was reckless with
Monica Lewinsky and is still paying his staggering price.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sun Belt firm of Lott &AMP; Livingston is also acting
recklessly, and the price they pay will not be exacted for 23
months, the election in which the control of House, Senate, and
White House is at stake. They will reap what they sow.

SCENES OUT OF ORWELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; On Wednesday, George Orwell's hand was on Page One of the
Globe, printing All the Doublespeak That's Fit to Print.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut General Assembly, which oversees horrific gaps
between rich and poor, threw $375 million of corporate welfare at
the Patriots in the form of a new stadium. Despite all the analysis
that stadiums lose big money for taxpayers, Governor John Rowland
said the stadium will ``change the landscape of this community for
the rest of our lifetimes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Republicans, unshamed by their losses in the
midterm elections, sped toward the impeachment of President Bill
Clinton. Speaker-elect Robert Livingston went so far as to claim
that Clinton's lies to cover up an affair were worse than the lies
of President Nixon to steal democracy itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Nixon's crime was covering up a crime he did not
commit,'' Livingston said. ``Clinton is covering up a crime he did
commit, and that is a large difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, running away from impeachment and from the fact that
his barely postpubescent acts with a subordinate, while hardly
Nixonian, would have been a fireable offense in his own military,
was marching us toward Wednesday night's bombing of Iraq. So far,
America applauds Clinton, who has made us believe Saddam Hussein, a
chump in 1991 when we overran his troops in mere hours, is suddenly
again Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, we have been made to believe that this is war by
video game. Send in a few missiles, show no pictures of US soldiers
at risk, and you have the instantly acceptable war.
</P>
<P>
   With Orwell's hand at work, it was fitting that Page One also
featured the demise of board games. Today's children, because of
rushed or disintegrating families, now seek solitary confinement in
the hyper hypnosis of action-packed and often murderous video
games. How better to prepare America for surgical strikes?
</P>
<P>
   Since I do not believe in smart bombs or surgical strikes,
especially since we have yet to hit Hussein himself, Clinton should
be shish kebabbed in history for killing yet more innocent Iraqi
women, children, and civilians, and especially so if we come to
find that the timing had anything to do ultimately with the fact
that he could not keep his pants zipped up.
</P>
<P>
   If Orwell really were the editor, the accompanying editorial for
these events could be lifted right out of his 1949 novel ``1984,''
from the part where Winston Smith is reading ``WAR IS PEACE'':
</P>
<P>
   ``War, however is no longer the desperate, annihilating struggle
that it was in the early decades of the 20th century. It is a
warfare of limited aims between combatants who are unable to
destroy one another, have no material cause for fighting, and are
not divided by any genuine ideological difference . . . in a
physical sense war involves very small numbers of people, mostly
highly trained specialists, and causes comparatively few
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fighting, when there is any, takes place on the vague
frontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at . . .
In the centers of civilization war means no more than a continuous
shortage of consumption goods, and the occasional crash of a rocket
bomb which may cause a few scores of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no longer, in a material sense, anything to fight
about. With the establishment of self-contained economies, in which
production and consumption are geared to one another, the scramble
for markets which was a main cause of previous wars has come to an
end, while the competition for raw materials is no longer a matter
of life and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the
principles of doublethink, this aim is simultaneous recognized and
not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to
use up the products of the machine without raising the general
standard of living . . . In the early 20th century, the vision of a
future society unbelievably rich, leisured, orderly, and efficient
_ a glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white
concrete _ was part of the consciousness of nearly every literate
person. Science and technology were developing at a prodigious
speed, and it seemed natural to assume that they would go on
developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was also clear that . . . if it once became general,
wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt to
imagine a society in which wealth, in the sense of personal
possessions and luxuries, should be even distributed, while power
remained in the hands of a small privileged caste.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in practice such a society could not long remain stable.
For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great
mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would
become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when
once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that
the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it
away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on
the basis of poverty and ignorance.''

HOMICIDES HAUNT BALTIMORE 
</HEADLINE>

 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ This city is in a race against time to save lives _
12 of them, to be precise. The problem is, no one knows whose lives
are at risk, where they live or why they are in peril.
</P>
<P>
   All anyone knows is that if all 12 die in the two weeks before
the new year, the loss would extend far beyond the sorrow of
families and friends. Their deaths would be a blow to this city's
latest attempt to save itself.
</P>
<P>
   While other cities large and small have been basking in the
glory of plummeting homicide rates, Baltimore's widespread poverty,
entrenched drug trade, and a shoot-first culture in certain
neighborhoods have conspired to buck the national trend.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with pressure and criticism mounting, police officials have
declared they will do everything in their power _ primarily
flooding the streets with formerly desk-bound officers _ to keep
the number of homicides below the 310 recorded last year.
</P>
<P>
   But with two weeks to go, the death count is 298 _ 12 away from
the fateful total. The latest was a man found Tuesday night, dead
in a truck with gunshot wounds, the 15th homicide since the
lifesaving initiative began Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I know we have wrung every possible officer out of
administrative jobs and put them out there, then I know we have
done everthing we can do to bring down that (1997) number,'' said
police Commissioner Thomas C. Frazier. Almost as an afterthought,
he added: ``The goal here is public safety.''
</P>
<P>
   As Frazier's comments demonstrated, the motivation is a
combination of concern for life and the knowledge that in the world
of big-city policing, there is little that counts more these days
than falling crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   Crime statistics _ particularly homicide rates _ have become
national news and a benchmark for municipal quality-of-life
comparisons. To civic boosters, low crime rates mean tourist
dollars, economic development, local pride, and job security for
politicians and police chiefs. High rates jeopardize all that.
</P>
<P>
   Cities including New York, Chicago, and Boston have seen sharp
drops in homicide numbers. Baltimore is among the also-rans,
trailing only Gary, Ind., New Orleans, and Detroit for the highest
rates. Last year, Boston's 44 homicides equaled about eight per
100,000 people; this year, there have been 35 homicides to date in
the city of 558,000 people. By contrast, in Baltimore, with its
population of 675,000, 310 homicides last year translated into
about 46 per 100,000 people, more than five times Boston's rate.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it is ghoulishly fitting that Baltimore is the
scene of the NBC series, ``Homicide: Life on the Street.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no single reason for Baltimore's homicide problem,
though observers often cite an unusually high concentration of poor
people, IV drug users, and cocaine dealers _ the crack epidemic
arrived in the early 1990s, several years after it hit other
cities. Police blame three-quarters of the killings on drug dealers
and users.
</P>
<P>
   However, others downplay the role of crack by noting that in the
past 25 years there have been more than 200 homicides in every year
but two, and more than 300 in each of the past eight years. They
cite an entrenched culture in which violence is seen as the
problem-solver of first resort, particularly among some residents
in the row houses of West Baltimore, East Baltimore, and Park
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baltimore represents some of the best in urban America, but
also faces some of the worst problems of urban America,'' said
three-term Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke. Though he supports the police
effort, he acknowledged it would be foolhardy to declare victory
simply for keeping the homicide total below 310.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply a psychological barrier. In order to come to grips
with the problem, we need a series of years in which the homicide
numbers are going down significantly,'' Schmoke said.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, Baltimore has enjoyed a drop in other violent and
nonviolent crime rates, and the number of homicides is down from
the peak years in the early 1990s. But the city knows that isn't
enough for public safety or public relations, particularly since
Baltimore also has been in the news recently for having the
nation's highest rates of syphillis and gonorrhea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an obsession with crime statistics, and police
departments are under tremendous pressure right now,'' said Jack
Levin, director of the Brudnick Center for the Study of Violence at
Northeastern University. ``Police are being pressured to do the
right thing _ partnerships with residents, community policing,
supervising youngsters _ so I don't think it's all bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But some cities, including Philadelphia, have responded to the
pressure by allegedly fabricating their crime data to make the
numbers look rosier. Homicide rates, however, are rarely open to
manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   In quiet conversation, Baltimore police acknowledge they are
playing with fire by setting the goal of keeping the homicide total
below 310. While eager to reap the benefits of a decline _ even one
as statistically meaningless as one or two fewer killings _ there
is a down side to the high-profile effort. If the 1998 total
exceeds 310, Levin said, the department risks a further erosion of
public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   At roll call Tuesday night at the Tactical Section Room in the
department's downtown headquarters, Lieutenant Donald E. Healy
rallied his troops to keep that from happening: ``Make the drug
dealers' lives miserable,'' he urged them. ``Let's keep those
shootings down. Another 15 days and we'll be all right.'' Behind
him was a bulletin board with 224 Polaroid photos of guns seized
this year during arrests; one more would be added before the night
was out.
</P>
<P>
   Before the antihomicide initiative, a night shift would consist
of about 240 uniformed officers citywide, not including drug units,
plainclothes officers, and detectives, out of a total of 3,200
sworn officers. With the homicide initiative, up to 100 extra
police officers per shift have been pulled from administrative jobs
and put on the street; paperwork is piling up on empty desks.
</P>
<P>
   A tour on the night shift with Officers Chris Timms and Guy
Thacker offered a window on the problems linked to the homicide
rate. The pair drove relentlessly and aggressively through the
roughest parts of West Baltimore, brooming young men off street
corners only to see them reassemble soon after nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood varied from neat, attached-brick homes with
marble stoops, to burned out, boarded up, falling down row houses
that serve as temporary homes for crack users. Young men stopped by
Timms and Thacker were familiar with the routine, quickly pulling
up their shirts to show no weapons in their waistbands.
</P>
<P>
   During the shift, the pair recorded one arrest, charging a
23-year-old man with possession of narcotics with intent to
distribute. Citywide that night, police recorded 11 arrests, one
seized gun, 112 field interviews, 65 car stops and 14 moving
violations. The worst event seemed to be a head-on crash between a
police cruiser and a Toyota Tercel that left no one seriously
injured. But then, after midnight, police received the report of a
man with the gunshot wounds to the back. That brought the total to
297. Later in the day, it rose to 298.
</P>
<P>
   Community activists have supported the police department's
December drive, though some said it was not enough. ``I think it's
great, but it should be all year. We shouldn't get to the point
where the last minute you're trying to keep your numbers down,''
said funeral home owner Samuel Redd, director of Operation Pulse, a
crime-prevention group in East Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, who became police commissioner here five years ago
after a 28-year career in San Jose, Calif., acknowledged that
point, noting that even his wife had asked him what would happen on
New Year's Day and beyond. He said the department will assess the
program's success and decide what to do then.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the street-level efforts, a multiagency task force has
been seeking strategies with help from David Kennedy, senior
researcher at the John F. Kennedy School of Government and director
of the Boston Gun Project, which has been credited with helping to
stem violence in Boston. Kennedy declined to outline results of the
Baltimore study, which will be unveiled next year, but offered hope
that this city does not have to fix all its problems at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the pieces of good news out of the Boston experience is
you can at least hope to intervene against violence without
believing you first have to get rid of all the drugs and the drug
trade,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the rate of killings approaching one a day here,
officers such as Timms and Thacker have grown skeptical. As Thacker
put it, ``If somebody wants to kill somebody, they're always going
to find a way to do it.''

TELEVISION IS HIS HOLE CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - As the media's attention bounced from the bombing
of Iraq to the prospects for Bill Clinton's impeachment, NBC news
anchor Tom Brokaw asked Clinton biographer David Maraniss if the
president had any more cards to play to ward off impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Maraniss replied, ``but Bill Clinton has
more than 52 cards in his deck.''
</P>
<P>
   The 53d card in Bill Clinton's deck has always been television.
No one can say what the ultimate effect of the raids will be, but
at Clinton's greatest times of trouble his mastery of the medium
has had a dramatic effect on his popularity. From his ``60
Minutes'' and ``Arsenio'' appearances that helped rescue his
initial candidacy through the presidential debates to his televised
testimony before a federal grand jury, Clinton has controlled
attention when he has controlled the television image, perhaps even
more so than John Kennedy or Ronald Reagan. Giving Clinton access
to Americans in their living rooms seems to give him access to
their approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's recent appearances have not been his most impressive,
although perhaps even his weariness has worked to his favor _
underscoring the burdens of leadership in a time of crisis. He has
appeared emotional when necessary (as during his recent trip to
Israel), but also in control of his emotions (his cool rebuke to
Republican skepticism about the timing of this attack).
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his Wednesday night address and his quasi-impromptu
give-and-take with reporters Thursday, Clinton rode the rising
polling waves on the basis of what the country was seeing on their
televisions. The media backdrop of Baghdad featured a large yellow
poster of Saddam Hussein, as if to underline Peter Jennings's
assertion that ``it has been clear, going back to George Bush, that
if a president wanted to pick on a foreign leader, Saddam Hussein
would be the easiest target.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening images of the attack were even more antiseptic than
those during the Gulf War, giving the illusion of a war largely
without casualties. When an Iraqi family was standing on a street
corner as the air raid was sounding, Brokaw even joked, ``If you
think it's hard getting a cab in New York City . . .'' before
realizing he had been too flip and correcting himself: ``It's not
comical, it's tragic.'' If all this supposed calm gave the illusion
of a war without casualties, it also made it apparent this was a
military action without any negative consequences for Clinton.
Quite the opposite, at least so far.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, of course, there were scenes of destruction in Iraq,
although nothing as heart-rending as the grief over the death of
civilians in a shelter during the Gulf War. The newscasts were
basically respectful of Republican skepticism over the timing of
the bombing, although ABC's John Cochran ended his report on the
subject with, ``Go outside of Washington and it's hard to find
people who think President Clinton could order air strikes just to
delay (the impeachment process).''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Republicans were having a generally terrible time
on television. It began with Tom DeLay and other House Republicans
announcing they weren't supporting the mission only to have cold
water thrown on suggestions that Clinton was lauching the strike as
part of a ``Wag the Dog'' scenario. Anchors announced that
Republican Senator Jesse Helms had voiced his support for the
president. Gulf War hero Norman Schwarzkopf said, ``From a military
point of view, the timing was right for this mission.'' Brent
Scowcroft and others who had served in Republican administrations
echoed Schwarzkopf, although former Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger remained irate and skeptical. While American networks
and cable services tried to play their coverage down the middle
between the president and the Republicans, the BBC didn't hold
back. ``Isn't it inconceivable,'' asked the bemused anchor, ``that
(the Republicans) would look so partisan by withholding support?''
``It isn't inconceivable,'' replied the reporter, ``because it's
already happened.''
</P>
<P>
   As for House speaker-designate Bob Livingston _ buffeted by
revelations of his own infidelities _ he has done his party few
favors with his recent media appearances. Displaying a rather lean
and hungry look, Livingston fairly shouted out the news that the
GOP majority would only briefly delay impeachment proceedings _ as
if the microphone hadn't been invented.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton needs no such coaching. His ease in front of the camera
is a constant. His enemies wonder why people can't see through that
ease, but so did Ronald Reagan's. His ability to look into the
camera and convince people that he's one of them (talking about the
difficulties of modern marriage on ``60 Minutes'') and is on their
side (his debates with Bush) is clearly one key to his success,
although he obviously overplayed that card with his finger-pointing
classic: ``I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   What he doesn't have, unlike Reagan, is the ability to make
people like him. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released before
Thursday's bombing reported that 56 percent had an unfavorable view
of Clinton as a person, even as his approval ratings climbed over
60 percent. Like all national leaders, Clinton looks particularly
presidential at the onset of a military action despite his lack of
military service. ``Whatever else you think,'' said Maraniss,
``he's calm and collected.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ability to use television to rally people to his side
isn't likely to stop his impeachment in the House, but it may be
enough to save his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   As Maraniss said, ``Every time he's on the precipice, there's
something that pulls him back.'' That ``something'' could be that
Clinton was born for television as much as for the presidency.
</P>

JUST NOT IN HARMONY WITH HYMNODY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   There is an especially tiresome kind of churchman _ my father
was one _ who cannot slide into a pew without bemoaning the
intrusion of novelty into church practice. Among Episcopalians,
this takes the form of nostalgia for the 1928 prayer book,
beautifully written but long out of use. In Catholicism, these are
the people who natter on about the lovely Latin Mass, etc.
</P>
<P>
   I have become one of these people.
</P>
<P>
   The battle of the Bible, of course, was lost many years ago. The
Protestant denominations slid away from the elegant 17th-century
prose of King James's England, through the pedestrian cadences of
the Revised Standard text into the Classics Illustrated jabber of
the more recent Good News! pabulum. One anticipates the Rappers'
Bible to take its place in this continuum.
</P>
<P>
   I have suffered through the loss of the gorgeous US Navy Hymn
(``O, hear us when we cry to Thee/For those in peril on the sea'')
from my hymnal. More recently, I've endured the bowdlerizing of
such great Thanksgiving hymns as ``We Gather Together,'' which in
the modern version contains these lines, more appropriate for a
Marin County hot tub:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You draw us away
</P>
<P>
   from self-centered complaining
</P>
<P>
   You lead us and guide us
</P>
<P>
   in ways that are true.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But all this was bearable. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   It is fair to say that my wife and I nearly choked on these
nouveau lyrics to the familiar Christmas carol:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joy to the world! The Lord has come
</P>
<P>
   Let earth its praises sing
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Huh? At least five generations of Americans have sung the second
line, ``Let earth receive her King.''
</P>
<P>
   Or what about ``Good Christian Friends, Rejoice'' instead of the
loathsome, patriarchal ``Good Christian Men, Rejoice''? I suppose I
can handle that. But when we arrived at ``O Come, All You
Faithful'' _ yes, ``You'' instead of ``Ye'' _ I gagged again.
</P>
<P>
   ``O come, let us adore Him'' was now ``O come in adoration.''
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here? Several things at once. Archaisms are out:
``Ye,'' ``thee,'' etc. are apparently too challenging for modern
Christians. The Lutherans turfed out the hymn ``Lo, How a Rose E'er
Blooming'' in favor of ``Lo, How a Rose Is Growing'' _ a line you
might find in a Burpee catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Gender bias is out. We've known this for some years, having
witnessed the gelding of numerous beautiful songs. For example, in
``Now Thank We All Our God,'' the line ``who from our mothers'
arms'' has become ``. . . our parents' arms,'' as if mothers no
longer gave birth to children. Worse still: The word ``sons'' has
been deleted from this memorable line of ``God Our Help in Ages
Past'':
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
</P>
<P>
   Bears all its sons away
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Now it's:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bears all our years away
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just as many liturgies no longer refer to the ``Holy Ghost''
(too pagan! too spooky!), some now seem to be suggesting that Jesus
Christ wasn't male. In liturgical newspeak, he's not Him and he's
not a king. It seems OK to call he/she/it ``Lord,'' even though
this is a male title.
</P>
<P>
   A man partially _ but only partially _ to blame for some of this
clunky ``inclusive'' language is Arthur Clyde, who helped collate a
new hymnal for the United Church of Christ. He says he's persona
non grata (quite rightly!) in his home parish for ditching the Navy
Hymn, and he gets quite an earful at Christmastime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we know this would be painful for some people? Yes,'' he
concedes. But he points out that the United Church of Christ and
other confessions have added excellent new songs to the hymnal, for
example, an amusing New Zealand carol about a meteorologically
``upside down'' Christmas. Furthermore, he notes that lyrics I
consider to be sacrosanct were themselves adaptations. The words to
``Silent Night'' were quite different 100 years ago (``Still the
night, Holy night'') and ``Hark! the Herald Angels Sing'' was
originally ``Hark, How All the Welkin Rings.''
</P>
<P>
   That has a nice sound . . . maybe we can change it back.

HEARST IS FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ By the end, Steve Mariucci was virtually
apologetic, almost sorry the 49ers had to win a game this way. ``I
guess,'' said the San Francisco coach, ``this is a new version of
the West Coast offense.''
</P>
<P>
   New?
</P>
<P>
   This way, this running the football play after play, this
pushing the line of scrimmage 3 yards downfield before quarterback
Steve Young even handed off the ball, this punishment of the Lions
by the 49ers' offensive line, is as old as football itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about that,'' Young said when told of his coach's
label. ``I take a lot of pride in our West Coast offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The old West Coast offense, that is. Bill Walsh's child, now
grown into an adult of many disguises, but an offense that still
passes and passes. Still, Mariucci spoke with almost wonderment in
his voice when he said, ``We really won the game at the line of
scrimmage.''
</P>
<P>
   New?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearst'' was the reason last Monday for San Francisco's fame
and easy game, but ``Hearst'' is a name that has been associated
with San Francisco longer than the Golden Gate Bridge. William
Randolph Hearst ran the city's newspapers since the turn of the
century, Patty Hearst held up banks in San Francisco's and
Berkeley's wild times some 25 years ago, and the Hearst Castle is a
must-see for any tourist who ventures south of Carmel and Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   And now? Garrison Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   The man who turned San Francisco football back 20 years, 30
years, maybe even 40 years, all the way back to Hugh McElhenny and
John David Crow and Joe Perry, when the 49ers could and would and
did run the football. But nobody knows what to make of this in 1998
_ the San Francisco 49ers running the football.
</P>
<P>
   Six or seven or eight times Young would step up to the line of
scrimmage Monday, scan the Lions' defense, and call an audible from
a pass play to a running play. The Richter Scale has no numbers
high enough to measure the magnitude of this San Francisco
earthquake. Bill Walsh is said to be resting comfortably after the
initial shock of seeing this . . . this . . . this San Francisco
sacrilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't plan on running the ball as much as we did,'' said
Mariucci, almost as if he were confessing to a football sin. ``But
because it was working, we stayed with it. For us to throw for less
than 100 yards . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Is a blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but Bobb McKittrick, the 49ers' offensive line coach, could
not contain himself. ``This is the way football should be,'' said
McKittrick, the last of Walsh's assistants, saying what every line
coach dreams of saying and seeing, ``and Garrison Hearst is a great
running back.''
</P>
<P>
   How great?
</P>
<P>
   ``With apologies to Roger Craig _ but not with any apologies to
Ricky Watters _ Garrison Hearst is probably the best running back
we've had since I've been here,'' said McKittrick. ``He can run, he
can catch, and he may be the best blocker on the team. I'll tell
you, if he never ran the ball once and you asked him to block on
every play, Garrison would do it and he wouldn't say a word.''
</P>
<P>
   No arguments there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garrison Hearst is a lunch-bucket type of guy,'' said
McKittrick. ``You ask him to do something and he does it. And he
does it well.''
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to Bobb McKittrick, Roger Craig was a very
valuable member of the great 49ers offenses of the 1980s, but Craig
was not a great runner. Dependable and very good, but not great.
And perhaps only San Franciscans can fathom McKittrick's need to
still dig at Watters, a flashy but undependable runner who seemed
so un-49er-like in his concern more for himself than his team.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst set the club record with 198 yards rushing last Monday, 4
more than Delvin Williams's previous standard, established in 1976.
Which, of course, was two years before Bill Walsh arrived with his
West Coast offense. Even more, the 49ers gained an astounding 328
yards rushing Monday and only 81 yards through the air, the third
straight game they have gained more than 200 yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Which hadn't happened since 1954, 24 years before Walsh arrived
with his passing offense, his West Coast offense in which the
running play seemed like an asterisk or apostrophe in the 49ers'
game plans, there but hardly noticed.
</P>
<P>
   As his father, Gary, held his duffel bag and waited for his son,
Hearst would say little about his running. ``It's great to win the
game,'' he said, offering nothing about how effortlessly he swooped
around the Lions' cornerbacks time and again, how deftly he slipped
inside tackle for huge chunks inside, how quick and smooth he was
on virtually every run.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Edwards, the sociologist and consultant to the 49ers, gave
a hint of the Hearst that, apparently, is seldom shown to the
media. With the Lions in town and Barry Sanders the center of much
attention, Edwards recalled that ``Garrison said something to me
before the game: `People are coming expecting to see No. 20
(Sanders) run wild. I'll try not to disappoint them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now football fans know there is another No. 20 who can run, even
if he doesn't like to expound to the media. ``I can't rate my
games,'' Hearst said when asked to do just that. ``If we win, I'm
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   What is so satisfying about playing for the 49ers is the
attitude of the team. ``I've been in places (Arizona) where they
don't win games,'' said Hearst, ``and all they want to do is win
one more game than last year. You come here and they say, `Let's
win the Super Bowl. Again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely this lack of ego that makes Hearst stand out in
San Francisco. With Jerry Rice pulling rank to get more passes
thrown his way, with J.J. Stokes and Terrell Owens also unhappy
that more balls are not thrown their way, Hearst is just happy to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing in my career was when I went (to Arizona),''
said Hearst, ``and the best thing was when I left there.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing his college career at Georgia, Hearst was the star
runner of the 1993 draft, the fourth player taken overall, but he
tore a knee ligament and Arizona coach Buddy Ryan nearly tore
Hearst's spirit from his soul. The Cardinals released him after the
1995 season, thinking they could pick him up again, but Cincinnati
claimed him.
</P>
<P>
   And going from one losing team to another was made even worse
when then Bengals coach Dave Shula told Hearst that he'd be only a
backup to Ki-Jana Carter, the first player in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's second to none.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tough,'' said McKittrick, ``and he can run any play in
America's favorite playbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Including, as shocking to San Francisco as it is, the running
play. Any running play.

SUSAN TEDESCHI PUTS MILES ON THE VAN, HITS ON THE RADIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Does she or doesn't she sound like Janis Joplin? That's a
question that Susan Tedeschi is often asked these days. The Norwell
native has had a dream year _ opening national tours for Buddy Guy
and B. B. King and watching her solo career soar _ but the Joplin
question keeps popping up.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been raised especially by Tedeschi's tune ``It
Hurts So Bad,'' which has become a triple-A (adult album
alternative format) radio hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people think it's a Janis Joplin track that they haven't
heard before,'' says Tedeschi. ``People have been calling radio
stations from their cars to find out if it's a Joplin song.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many people think I'm here as the
reincarnated Janis Joplin,'' adds Tedeschi, now 28. ``People come
up to me and say, `You are her!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, one of those people was Sam Andrews, who played guitar
in Joplin's band, Big Brother &AMP; the Holding Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's involved in a movie of Janis's life and asked me about
playing the role of Janis,'' says Tedeschi. ``I'd consider it, but
I'm not dying to do it . . . I don't want to be known as Janis
Joplin the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some interesting historical notes that some people
point to. Tedeschi was born Nov. 9, 1970 _ a month after Joplin
died. And some of her stage mannerisms are similar. ``The way I
kick my foot when I sing and play is similar to what Janis did,''
admits Tedeschi, though she says that's a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked Janis when I was growing up _ and my dad had footage
of her and a bunch of her records. But I liked Linda Ronstadt
better,'' she says. ``I don't have Janis as a singing influence
that much, but the way I emote with my voice is similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the key thing is that the two of us are both trying
to sing like Etta James!'' says Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
   Joplin comparisons aside, Tedeschi has gotten ahead this year by
sheer hard work. She and her band have put 35,000 miles on their
van since June. Her latest album, ``Just Won't Burn'' (on
Boston-based Tone-Cool Records), has sold more than 70,000 copies,
according to SoundScan. She's had another triple-A hit with the
erotic ``Rock Me Right.'' And she's forged a close family-style
bond with the blues deans with whom she's toured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with Buddy Guy on his 63d birthday and got to bring
him a cake. And I played with B. B. King on his 73d birthday and
got to bring him a cake, too,'' says Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
   So how is she holding up after such a long, road-filled year?
``I'm barely alive,'' she says with a laugh. ``No, really, I'm
doing surprisingly well.''
</P>
<P>
   She's doing particularly well in the Northwest, where her radio
play has been the strongest. In Seattle, she sold out a 1,400-seat
theater. In San Francisco, she packed John Lee Hooker's Boom Boom
Club and 600 people were turned away. In Portland, she did a radio
station gig for KINK-FM and was asked to headline over John Hiatt
and Keb' Mo'. ``I freaked out, because John Hiatt is an idol of
mine,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The only major negative this summer was her breakup with her
boyfriend, guitarist Sean Costello. Since he left the band after
doing her Harborlights show in August, she's assumed all guitar
duties herself.
</P>
<P>
   Tedeschi, who attended Berklee College of Music and played all
the blues jams around Boston and Cambridge when she started out,
has recently moved back to Boston from Atlanta, where she met her
backing band, known as the Jive Bombers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I moved my stuff into storage back in Boston,'' says
Tedeschi. ``I'm really living on the road right now. I won't have
time to get my own place until February.''
</P>
<P>

   Buffett aims high: First, there was the $650 package to see the
Rolling Stones at the FleetCenter on March 22 and 23, which
consists of a ticket, parking, tour merchandise, and a party before
and after the show. Now Jimmy Buffett is offering the same thing,
but for $400 for his Feb. 28 show at the Fleet. There are 500 of
those packages available, but guess what? They haven't sold out
yet, unlike the Stones's $650 counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it means that Buffett is less popular. I think
it says that a lot of money has already been taken out of the
market for concerts,'' says FleetCenter president Richard Krezwick.
Or maybe it means the Parrotheads have more sense after all.
They're opting for other tickets to the show, which are under $60.

THUMBS UP FOR THE REVAMPED INFINITI Q45 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, December 20, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Special interests present special problems to the car buyer. To
complicate things, automobiles have shrunk considerably from what
they once were, thanks to clean-air imperatives and the badgering
of environmental extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the problem that confronted Martha, the very tall woman
who plays a very tall instrument: the harp. A good harp costs more
than a good car and fits in none of them. A van, however, fills the
bill. Martha's devotion to the queen of stringed things dictated
van.
</P>
<P>
   The van is also the solution for the hobbyist devoted to big
things winged _ large- or giant-scale model airplanes, frequently
with wings spanning seven, eight, or nine feet. Sometimes the hobby
requires trailer rental or purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Antiques collectors, too, run into problems _ the drop-leaf
table or antique desk won't quite make it into the trunk of an
econobox _ one shudders to consider the potential of that
much-heralded electric thingamajig.
</P>
<P>
   Even the annual Christmas tree gets to be a transport headache
when the living space demands a seven-foot fir and the car
available is . . . well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   For the columnist, lately, the choice of test vehicle has
revolved around the particular capacity problem to be solved, the
annual forays into those joyful celebrations known as Tuba
Christmas. This being the 25th anniversary of the first TC, and the
columnist being addicted to disturbing the peace from time to time
with a euphonium and joining others so inclined, the desire was
vehicles that would adapt well to carrying these formidable
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   A euphonium is a modest-sized member of the tuba family (roughly
defined here as any instrument with conical bore playing mostly
below middle C), and so there is wide choice _ except when
traveling with friends. But consider some of the heavier members of
the clan, those full-size standing behemoths of the band that
require a case bigger than a small car! It is no mean feat to
assemble 130 tubists in downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Now there loomed Essex, Conn., and Wickford, R.I., and your
columnist was traveling in concert (if you will excuse a mild pun)
to both; there was need to place three large brass, bass-clef
instruments in the trunk of the available car, a 1999 Infiniti Q45.
The Q is a large car by today's standards, but the trunk obviously
was not designed with three euphoniums (or is it euphonia?) in
mind, one a double-belled instrument. At first glance, it was no
go.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Collins is an engineer, and he quickly figured a way to
place the bulky, odd-shaped cases into the somewhat narrow confines
and still have room for stands, music, and a couple or three
cornets, if anybody had a mind to bring them. At the Essex Steam
Train Museum, 78 tubists gathered in the engine shed to sound out a
merry Christmas _ a group also gathered on the platform to serenade
revelers on the excursion train. At Wickford, some 50 or so solved
the transport need with a variety of automobiles _ Taurus wagons
seem popular among musicians with large instruments, brass and
electronic.
</P>
<P>
   In between Tuba Christmasing, the Infiniti was called upon for
hard duty in middle and coastal Maine, a lot of New Hampshire, and
a generous bit of the Bay State. It is a pleasant car, but
Nissan/Infiniti seems to have mixed feelings about just what it is
that an Infiniti is supposed to be. It has been a model in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   The Q started as a magnificent ugly duckling, a luxury car
looking like a cross between an old Pontiac and a new BMW but with
a wart on its nose. But what a car to drive! It was splendid on the
road. Then, it got prettier and less fun _ softer, squishier. The
1999 reincarnation is just about right _ it's time to quit
tinkering and out the effort into solid marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The styling for '99 is restrained, refined _ hey, it's a classy
boat. The 4.13-liter V-8 this year puts out 266 horsepower (278
ft/lb torque) and is mated to a 4-speed, electronically controlled
gearbox. The tested car is the standard model, a $48,695-delivered
car with all the bells and whistles, Bose sound, CD player, 16-inch
wheels, ABS, and traction control. There is a touring model, the
Q45t, for $1,700 more, with a new electronically managed suspension
system.
</P>
<P>
   The headlights are new, halogen bonfires which cast a blue light
that apparently irritates other drivers, if one is to judge by the
number of bright lights flashed at me on the road. There have been
interior modifications, too. The signature gold-rimmed clock has
returned to center dash after a two-year hiatus, and the controls
have generally been modified larger for the benefit of gloved
fingers _ except for tuning and scan/seek functions on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Interior storage is still an issue; the glove box is barely
adequate for the fancy packet of owner's manual and other
literature. Bins grace the doors, and there is a two-piece storage
bin under the armrest that would better serve if it were one useful
storage space. A small lidded compartment forward of that is either
two cupholders or an eyeglass storage bin. Seat-back pockets pretty
much complete the storage picture _ don't ask where one might
connveniently place a purse.
</P>
<P>
   Wood accents and supple leather attest to luxury; interior room
makes somewhat less of a case _ a Rolls-Royce this is not _ but
unless the front-seat occupants are NBA pros with overly long legs,
the kneeroom in the rear is generous. Headroom is good.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the Q45 is sheer pleasure. It is quick, quiet,
responsive _ not quite crisp, perhaps, but nice in the corners and
nimble in traffic. The ride is firmer this year but hardly stiff;
the Q soaks up the ruts on a dirt road admirably, still offers
decent road feel and feedback to the driver.
</P>
<P>
   The Q45 is EPA-rated 17 miles per gallon city, 24 highway; in a
bit more than 600 miles tracked, the tested car delivered 21.02
m.p.g. overall in varied driving, mostly with a good load _ three
tubas, three tubists for more than half that distance.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs up for the Q45 _ and a very Merry Christmas to you all.

TENSION SHOWER ROD DROPS AFTER 6 HOURS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Q. When I put up a tension shower rod on new tiles in my
bathroom tub surround, it stayed up for about six hours, then fell.
After a few failures, I took it back to the store and got another
one. It too fell. What's wrong, and how can I keep that rod up?
</P>
<P>
   J.S., Malden, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Maybe both rods were defective. A tension rod has an inside
spring, which is turned to tighten and loosen. Try tightening the
spring so that the rod fits with great effort; you can telescope it
slightly to get it in place. The rod should be heavy duty, the
heaviest you can get, although a lighter one should hold as well as
a heavy one. If that doesn't work, take it back and buy a
heavy-duty rod at another store. The handyman has one that has
worked very well for years; he bought it at Caldor. Make sure the
new rod, if you buy it, has rubber tips.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 1899 house has some great pocket doors; they are huge,
each is six feet wide and mighty heavy. They close OK, but when I
go to open them, they jam six or seven inches out of the pocket. Is
there any easy way to get to the blockage so I can fix it?
</P>
<P>
   BOB PERRY, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. No easy way. Possibly no way except to take down the wall,
because they were installed before the wall finish went up. At
least the mechanism lasted 100 years, not bad for something built
in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   But before you take down a wall finish (plaster and all), open
the door as far as it will go, right to the opposite end of the
opening. Then you can check the top for rail or wheel damage, and
look into the pocket to see what has happened. You can also take
off the door casing that surrounds the pocket opening and peer in
with a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   The door might have jumped the rail; if so, you might be able to
lift it back on the track by putting a pry bar on the bottom.
Maybe. Or, the rail might have come loose at the far end
(naturally) of the pocket, causing the door to drop, dragging and
blocking any movement. If you take the door off its rail, you can
screw the railback on. Or, one wheel might have loosened, and, if
it is accessible, can be refastened.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, removing the plaster and lath may be necessary.
And, instead of taking off all the wall finish, you could cut a
smaller area for limited observation and repair, so there would be
much less wall finish to replace.
</P>
<P>
   If you need to replace hardware, check these places: Restoration
Resources Store, 200 A Webster St. (Route 123) Hanover, Mass.,
781-878-3794; Classic Restorations, Watertown, Mass., 617-926-0505;
Restoration Resources, retail store, 31 Thayer St., Boston,
617-542-3033. Also, Stanley makes hardware for pocket and other
kinds of sliding doors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In my condo building, the neighbor's shower stall is directly
above ours. He put in a new pan, and now water gushes through the
ceiling of our shower stall, which is tiled. But it happens only
four or so times a year. What is wrong and how can it be fixed?
Could this gushing water collapse the ceiling? And could it spread
to the rest of the bathroom? The installer of the new pan said it
is not leaking.
</P>
<P>
   DEBBIE ONIE, Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Short answers to the first two question are: Who knows what's
wrong, and most anything can be fixed, once one finds the cause. As
for the cause, it could be the pan, in spite of what the installer
says; it could be a leaking drain pipe. It could be the upstairs
shower is leaking through the tiled walls. It could even be a
pinhole leak in the water pipe. But what is mysterious is why the
gushing occurs so rarely. I think the reason is this: The pan is
set in a depression, and when water leaks through it or the drain,
it collects in that depression above the ceiling of your stall.
That tiled ceiling is probably a mud job (installed in mortar) and
is quite leakproof, until the water gets heavy enough to break
through.
</P>
<P>
   This gushing water could spread to the rest of the bathroom
ceiling, and either ceiling _ bathroom or stall _ can collapse,
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   To fix the cause, you have to find it, and that may mean taking
down the ceiling of your stall and inspecting the drain pipe, water
pipes, and the pan itself.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a peculiar garage with a 16-foot-wide door under a
jury-rigged 4 x 4 header under a 4 x 6 with a 2 x 10 beam. It
sagged about two inches in the middle. I don't want to put in a
middle post, so I am jacking up the middle until it's level and
will add a heavy steel beam. When I started jacking up the beam, I
noticed a crack in a rafter on top of it, so I stopped jacking. Is
there a formula for how fast to jack up that beam? I have 1 1/4
inches to go to level.
</P>
<P>
   JAMES CARTER, Dover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Some say to do a half turn once a day, others say faster is
OK. There is no hard and fast rule; it's a matter of slow enough
not to crack rafters and other members, and not to raise the whole
beam and roof. Jack up the middle a tad, then wait a day for the
beam to adjust. You might be done by the Fourth of July.

HOW SHERYL CROW FLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sheryl Crow is straddling two generations. She has toured with
the Rolling Stones and recorded a Bob Dylan song at the artist's
request, so she has earned classic-rock credibility. She's also
been accepted as a modern rocker whose last two albums sold a
combined 15 million copies _ way more than the Stones and Dylan in
recent years, meaning that she's definitely reached the young
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I do interviews, people always ask me how I feel about
being lumped into the older generation,'' Crow says, referring to
her allegiance with the Stones and Dylan. ``But I think of myself
as this up-and-comer who never really fit into that. I've been
really lucky to get my own audience.''
</P>
<P>
   A restless artist who switched from being a Missouri school
teacher to a West Coast rocker back in the '80s, Crow is now living
in New York City and is putting together a new band. ``It was just
time for a change,'' she says of both moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely love New York,'' adds Crow. ``I'm the kind of
person who has real problems making plans and I also don't like to
drive, so LA is always problematic. . . . And LA is also
distracting. I find that most people I'm around there are always
talking about business. It creates this strange sort of panic that
the phones should be ringing and you should be out doing
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The phones are still ringing for Crow, despite her change of
address. She released a new album, ``The Globe Sessions,'' with
some inspired songs drawn from romantic breakups that have occurred
during her tour-heavy schedule of the past five years. (The Globe
also refers to the studio where she made the album in a ``seedy
part of Manhattan, which I love,'' she says.)
</P>
<P>
   She's making further moves to expand her career. She'll soon
make her film debut as a junkie in Dwight Yoakam's ``Minus Man,''
which has just been accepted into the Sundance Film Festival. She
also hopes to write a film score in the future. She also is
producing a new album for Fleetwood Mac's queen bee, Stevie Nicks,
for whom she produced two songs on the recent ``Practical Magic''
soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Crow is preparing a tour to start in March in New
York, featuring new guitarist Peter Stroud from Pete Droge's band.
``Now that I've had a year off from touring, I'm starting to get
really antsy about it,'' she says. ``I love playing live.''
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, she's playing a White House Christmas concert,
``A Very Special Christmas From Washington, D.C.,'' with Eric
Clapton, Tracy Chapman, Vanessa Williams, and others, airing Sunday
at 8 p.m. on TNT. Crow and Mary J. Blige perform a duet on ``Blue
Christmas,'' which may have a double meaning at the Clinton White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's terrible what he did,'' Crow says of President
Clinton's frolic with Monica Lewinsky, ``but now it's turning into
a three-ring circus and we can't get away from it. Obviously, he's
not very scrupulous, but he's been a good president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the bare bones of it, it's really about an
affair and people's moral fibers were so challenged by that. That's
the bottom line,'' she adds. ``I've met Clinton and I know Mrs.
Clinton fairly well and I think she's really the one who is lost in
this whole thing. All the work she does, she doesn't just do for
her husband, but for the Democratic Party. The whole thing's been a
violation of her. But in the end, I think she's going to turn
around and be a very important political leader when this is said
and done.''
</P>
<P>
   Crow has become a leader in her own right in recent years, after
the success of her albums, ``Tuesday Night Music Club'' (in 1993)
and ``Sheryl Crow'' (in 1996). Though she is grateful to have been
embraced by the Stones, Dylan, et al., nothing has been more
satisfying than her recent alliance with Fleetwood Mac's Nicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She and I have had such a similar path,'' says Crow. ``She
became well-known at 29 and I got my first record deal when I was
29. . . . We're also similar in that we're both matriarchal. When
we go out on the road, we take care of everybody. We're not just
the captain of the ship, we are the mother _ and the person who is
challenging everyone musically. But when you come home, it's a
different thing. That was my experience when I came off the road
this last time. All of a sudden, the family that I built around me
wasn't my family. They all went home to their families. And that's
what motivates you to continue to go out on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Nicks, Crow is a rock 'n' roll lifer (``it's my calling''),
but ``the one difference is that I'd like to have children pretty
soon.'' (Nicks, who just turned 50, has voiced regret that she
never had children.)
</P>
<P>
   Crow will spend next month co-writing songs with Nicks for the
latter's album. ``Right now, we're doing five songs for the album
that she had already. And two of them are Buckingham/Nicks songs,''
Crows says, referring to Nicks's pre-Fleetwood Mac collaboration
with Lindsey Buckingham.
</P>
<P>
   Crow also has kept intact her friendship with the Rolling
Stones, who have been an endless inspiration to her, not just for
the guitar licks that she has so obviously memorized, but for their
enthusiasm to keep going decade after decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing with the Rolling Stones is that they're so
obviously into the music and they get such a kick out of each
other,'' Crow says. ``For me, that's the most telling experience.
Just watching the interaction between them when they were getting
their new live album together. Keith (Richards) was acting as
bartender and listening to the record at full volume, while they
were all pointing at each other and posing during their solos.
They're still just so into music. . . . I don't know what kind of
lesson that is, but it certainly gives somebody like me a great
deal of encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   Crow listens to other elders as well, among them legendary punk
priestess Patti Smith. ``I played after her on a radio gig once and
she smoked me. When she came offstage, I said, `I'm supposed to go
on after that?' And she said, `Just go out there and give 'em
love.' I thought that was such a cool comment. What a great
attitude.''

A COMMANDING BUT CONSTRAINED `PRINCE'

<TEXT>
<P>
   DreamWorks' new ``The Prince of Egypt'' at least solves the
problem of how to produce a biblical epic without the ponderousness
that has suffocated all but a few of the usual Hollywood
treatments. Its mix of traditional animation and com- &QC; 
MovieReview
</P>
<P>
   puter-generated effects unfolds in a succession of magnificently
rendered designs and captures a momentum that all but eluded the
campy and leaden film that seems to have served as its source,
Cecil B. DeMille's second (1956) version of ``The Ten
Commandments,'' starring Charlton Heston as Moses. That effort
sacrificed the immediacy of DeMille's earlier but much more
modern-seeming 1923 film. This new effort generates its own brand
of visual splendors and high-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   Every drawing, every design, every panoramic sequence of this
new retelling tells you that DreamWorks has a lot riding on ``The
Prince of Egypt.'' But it's more imposing than stirring, more
likely to be respected than loved. Still, the drawn Moses (voiced
by Val Kilmer) is a lot easier to take than previous incarnations.
He looks more convincing than Charlton Heston ever did. And while I
wish Rameses (voiced by Ralph Fiennes), as he's called here, looked
less like Yul Brynner, he and all the characters look more
indigenous than any Hollywood cast ever did. It has taken Hollywood
nearly a century, but at last its Hebrews and Egyptians have lost
the ludicrous Anglo look peculiar to the Hollywood Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, animation does things that the special effects of
De Mille's day couldn't do as well. The parting of the Red Sea
works better here than in what now seems the primitive matte
process of the film. Ditto for the burning bush. And the Angel of
Death sequence, when God visits plagues upon Egypt to punish
Rameses, is one of the most striking in ``The Prince of Egypt.'' So
is the dream sequence in which the adult Moses learns of his
origins and of the genocide that drove his mother to float him down
the Nile to safety. A revelation appears to Moses as hieroglyphs,
and temple reliefs come to life to act out history in bloodstained
hues.
</P>
<P>
   The film, buttressed by a list of advisers consisting of dozens
of scholars and religious leaders, changes the story of the
bullrushes. After Moses' floating basket eludes crocs and hippos,
it's plucked from the water by Pharaoh's wife, who adopts the baby
and raises him as Rameses' younger brother. They're close enough in
age to become playmates, then adolescent cutups, racing chariots,
dropping water balloons, pursuing the desert version of la dolce
vita, until Moses meets the adult his sister has grown into, and
her husband, and is brought face to face both with the suffering of
the Jewish slaves under Pharaoh and with his own Jewishness. When
Moses leaves, he meets a spirited shepherdess (voiced by Michelle
Pfeiffer, who sings her own songs, as Kilmer does). DreamWorks has
sprung for an A-list of voices, signing on Helen Mirren, Sandra
Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Steve Martin, and Martin Short.
</P>
<P>
   When the estrangement deepens between the two men who once were
brothers, it's Rameses' anguish we feel. But his pangs are eclipsed
by his arrogance and his callousness toward the slaves, whose
condition he regards as natural. Fiennes's Rameses is as close as
the film comes to generating real feelings. Pfeiffer's fiery
shepherdess, Tzipporah, registers, too. But when big feelings are
required, they do run up against the limitations of the animation.
They didn't have to. While ``The Prince of Egypt'' succeeds
brilliantly in rendering the funerary splendors of the Egyptian
empire and the undulating shapes and tints of the desert, it's
artistically less imaginative and more compromised than it had to
be.
</P>
<P>
   I wish ``The Prince of Egypt'' had lost the silly songs that
hang like cinder blocks around the necks of too many animations,
especially this one. For that matter, I wish DreamWorks had been
more truly daring instead of merely competitive and worked a little
longer at evolving a drawing style that departed more radically
from the Disney house style than this film does. It seems less an
artistic alternative to Disney than a proliferation of it. On the
other hand, the studio takes a few chances, conceiving a
full-length animation that clearly is not skewed to very young
viewers. This worked to better effect with ``Antz,'' which isn't
nearly the big deal that ``The Prince of Egypt'' is, yet shines
with more spontaneity and wit _ and with a look of its own. ``The
Prince of Egypt'' is frankly more involving and less boring than I
expected a Hollywood biblical outing to be. But, DreamWorks, let
your animators go!

bridles when she sees ``Hanukkah bushes'' or Jewish friends

send her Christmas cards with religious images. ``Sure, it's the

<P>
   At this time of year, the simple act of setting the table means
creating a backdrop festive enough for holiday meals. And what
could be more glorious than a table laden with fruit? Fruit is
nature's bounty and an eloquent symbol of its richness.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch and Flemish masters immortalized fruit, as well as
flowers, in their prettiest still lifes. But it was the French,
during the 17th and 18th centuries, who refined fruit centerpieces
into soaring pyramids of glistening cherries and grapes; elaborate
epergnes whose branches were filled with strawberries, figs and
miniature apples; or a single golden pineapple served up on a
pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   The best fruits for creating table decorations have sturdy skins
and can thrive without being refrigerated. Apples, oranges and
lemons, for example, may last several weeks; grapes stay pretty for
four or five days.
</P>
<P>
   Combining fruit is as rich an art as arranging flowers _ and
just as rewarding, if you learn to appreciate fruit for its color,
shape, texture and size, as you do your favorite blooms. Be simple
or be grand. A single pear crowning a slender candlestick can be as
eloquent as a lily in a bud vase. Or a tower of plums, pears and
grapes can have the intricacy of a lavish bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   You can make delectable arrangements with surprising ease.
Construct a tall cone of fruit simply by piercing each piece of
fruit with a toothpick, then piling the fruit in circles on a
Styrofoam form. Create sparkling table ornaments with a coat of
spray-on adhesive and a frosting of granulated sugar. A single
piece of fruit can shine, dressed with a ribbon, at each place
setting.
</P>
<P>
   For still richer arrangements, combine fruit with greenery.
Sprigs of princess pine or boxwood can enliven a fruit pyramid. Red
fruit will look even more vivid against bluish evergreens, such as
eucalyptus or white pine.
</P>
<P>
   Wired to a wreath or garland, apples and plums will resemble
luscious Christmas-tree balls. And don't forget artificial fruit: A
swag garnished with polystyrene fruit is both lightweight and
long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit is so vibrant it can provide a color theme for your table
or the decoration of an entire dining room. Fruit can also spin a
mood. A spiky pineapple and the bright, sunny hues of oranges,
lemons and limes may call to mind the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   But what fruit does best is help you welcome the holidays, and
your guests, with one of nature's sweetest, most prized gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ideas to try:
 &UR; SUGARED LEMONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A light coating of sugar turns lemons into sparkling
decorations. Although they're not edible, sugared lemons are
long-lasting and especially easy to make.
</P>
<P>
   For an informal centerpiece, fill a bowl with sugared lemons, or
set them in eggcups or small goblets and dot them across the table.
</P>
<P>
   To make them, you'll need lemons; bamboo skewers; Spray-Mount (a
quick-drying adhesive available at art-supply or crafts stores);
granulated sugar; a spoon; a bowl; and craft paper.
</P>
<P>
   Insert a skewer into one end of a lemon. Working over craft
paper, hold lemon by skewer and coat with Spray-Mount. Sprinkle
granulated sugar over lemon with spoon, holding the fruit over bowl
to catch granules that do not adhere. Set sugared lemon on clean
piece of craft paper to dry.
 &UR; SHEER FRUIT POUCHES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gold-mesh bags filled with pears and lady apples or other fruit
can be grouped on a sideboard or as a centerpiece, or used singly
to mark each guest's place at the table. At the end of the evening,
your guests can carry them away.
</P>
<P>
   To make a pouch: Cut one piece each of gold tulle and
gold-metallic organza 4 inches wide and 8 inches long; pin
together.
</P>
<P>
   With scissors, round the two corners of one of the 4-inch sides.
Machine-stitch around the U, leaving the top open.
</P>
<P>
   Turn bag right side out, fill with fruit and tie with ribbon,
adding a sprig of grapes or an artificial ivy leaf and vine if you
wish. You may also want to trim the tops of the bags.
 &UR; FRUIT PYRAMID &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make a 12-inch apple pyramid, you'll need 40 to 50 dwarf
apples; boxwood sprigs; a 12-inch polystyrene cone; toothpicks;
scissors; and a pretty urn, footed bowl or platter. The same basic
technique can be used for larger pyramids made of different fruits,
or combinations of fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the point of the cone so the top is flat. Poke
toothpicks into bottoms of apples; insert on cone in rings,
starting with largest apples at the base. Finish top with one
apple. Fill in spaces by tucking short sprigs of boxwood between
apples.
</P>
<P>
   Set pyramid atop your desired container, adding more boxwood
sprigs beneath the bottom row of apples, if you wish.
 &UR; DECORATING WITH REDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ripe red fruit can transform an otherwise quiet dining room for
the holidays. Here are several simple, inexpensive ways to
incorporate a variety of fruits into your table setting.
</P>
<P>
   _ As a centerpiece, fill a silver or crystal footed bowl with
pears, apples, pomegranates, crab apples, and litchi nuts in
countless shades of crimson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tie individual red apples with sheer silver ribbon and place
one at each place setting. The shiny red apples make tasty gifts
for dinner guests, who can eat them with dessert or save them for a
healthy midnight snack.
</P>
<P>
   _ Surround pillar candles, on heatproof plates or in wide glass
cylinders, with plump cranberries (the berries should reach no
higher than a quarter of the way up the sides of the candles).
</P>
<P>
   _ On a surface like a mantel or sideboard, perch red pears on
one pair of candlesticks, and make tiny wreaths of viburnum berries
to encircle another pair. Line the mantel or sideboard with
cuttings of greenery to provide contrast in texture and color, and
nestle a few more pieces of red fruit among the cuttings.
</P>

   Ripe red fruit and scarlet seat cushions on the Gustavian-style
dining chairs transform an otherwise quiet green-and-white dining
room for the holidays. On the antique brass-edged mahogany dining
table, a handblown Murano glass bowl holds pears, apples,
pomegranates, crab apples and litchi nuts in countless shades of
crimson; a single apple marks each place setting. A similar mix of
red fruits, the papery litchi contrasting with the smooth apples,
dresses up the mantel. In shimmering niches displaying a collection
of creamware, tiny wrapped gifts and still more red fruit add dots
of color.

YOU'VE GOT MAIL 
Directed by: Nora Ephron 
Screenplay by: Nora and Delia Ephron 
Starring: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Parker Posey, Jean Stapleton, Dave
Chappelle, Steve Zahn, Greg Kinnear, Heather Burns 
Running time: 116 minutes 
Rated: PG (some language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' answers the date-movie question for the
holidays _ and months beyond. Nora Ephron's remake of the classic
romantic comedy ``The Shop Around the Corner'' is warm, smart, and
funny. Perhaps more to the point, it has performances of enormous
appeal from Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks as lovers who have no idea how
mismatched they are, since they meet and intensify their
relationship in an Internet chat room. They have no idea that they
live within blocks of each other on Manhattan's richly textured
Upper West Side, and in fact pass each other several times on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   The trick here, of course, is to not let the love come too
easily. Ephron, Ryan, and Hanks have traveled this route before, in
``Sleepless in Seattle,'' and know just how to do it. This outing
could be subtitled ``Nervous in New York,'' given that Hanks is
playing the millionaire owner of a bookstore chain wiping out small
independents, such as the children's bookstore Ryan's Kathleen
Kelly inherited from her mother. This plot twist provides the only
real roadblock to credibility. We're asked to believe that Kathleen
could fall in love with the guy who's driving her out of business.
</P>
<P>
   But we do. That's because Hanks's and Ryan's performances give
the film such a core of undentable decency that they carry the film
past this and a couple of other roadblocks, one being that he
learns she's his mystery correspondent on the Internet before she
learns he's her correspondent. Hanks's character, Joe Fox, exploits
this advantage to play a few mind games with Ryan's devout romantic
before all is revealed. And if the film is also a hymn to the Upper
West Side by Nora Ephron and her co-screenwriting sister, Delia,
who have lived there for years and know the territory, it's also a
symphony of product placement, especially for America Online and
Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   In the acerbically sentimental Ernst Lubitsch 1939 original,
lovers-to-be Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan were co-workers
who didn't realize that each was also the other's pen pal. The new
film's Internet update works even better. It's a pleasure to
encounter a movie where the romantic connection is made solely
through sensitive, nimble, witty language, which we hear in
voice-overs as the electronic communiques take on ever-increasing
importance to Kathleen and Joe. As the film begins, each is living
with somebody else, he with Parker Posey's publishing careerist,
she with Greg Kinnear's politically correct reporter.
</P>
<P>
   They can't wait for their respective partners to leave for work
in the morning so they can sign on and click to the e-mail that
fosters growing intimacy along with the risk that a meeting might
prove devastating in proportion to the difference between the
imagined person and the actuality. Not that this is their only
problem. Faced with the imminent extinction of her cute-as-a-button
shop in this cute-as-a-button film, Kathleen maintains a superhuman
sweetness as she transcends the shop's almost certain demise, to
say nothing of the overdue demise of her comfortable but lukewarm
relationship with the crusader that Kinnear is allowed to make just
goofy enough to be likable.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks's wary Joe has even less difficulty in conveniently ending
his live-in relationship with Parker's pushy exec, who's rendered
in shrill, one-note terms to soften any pangs we might feel about
her loss. The film is nothing if not shrewdly constructed, making
one right move after another. It'll deepen the perception of Hanks
as the contemporary Jimmy Stewart, partly because Hanks is
permitted the same kind of prickly edge Stewart had in the
original. He's a take-charge guy, but takes the sting out of his
character's ways by convincing us that he's a fundamentally good
guy and not a vicious power-tripper. Similarly, Ryan has to
convince us that Kathleen is not too sweet for her own good and
doesn't cave in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' doesn't set itself any problems that the
charm and appeal of its leads _ and Ephron's savvy behind the
camera and in front of the word processor _ can't handle. ``You've
Got Mail'' is the kind of film that likes its characters and likes
New York, too. It looks a lot easier to bring off than it actually
is _ further testimony to the Ephron sisters' secure grip on the
world of the film and the emotions of its characters, especially
yearning. Nobody does yearning better than Ryan when she scrunches
her face into an interim expression between a smile and scowl of
concentration. If ``Sleepless in Seattle'' was your kind of
romantic comedy, ``You've Got Mail'' will be, too.

 (FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE)
 ADAPTED FROM ``DECORATING FOR THE HOLIDAYS: CHRISTMAS WITH MARTHA
STEWART LIVING, VOLUME 2''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITOR'S NOTE: Information about the ``Decorating for the
Holidays'' book is offered at the end of this article. THIS
INFORMATION MUST BE INCLUDED WITH THIS PIECE WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED
IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With only gray skies surrounding it, a house in early winter can
look stark. But hang a wreath or a swag on the front door, and your
house will spring to life.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttings of evergreen are sweet compensation for the leaves that
are missing from most of the trees, and the tart hues of winter
berries are reminders that nature has not forgotten about color,
even though the garden is no longer in bloom. Add wide ribbons and
twinkling lights, and holiday spirit brims over.
</P>
<P>
   The Victorians, who never willingly left a surface unadorned,
are sometimes credited with the custom of hanging Christmas wreaths
on front doors. In more recent years, front-door displays have
taken many forms, from flashy tinsel wreaths with silver-metallic
bows to electric-light garlands that spell out ``Season's
Greetings.''
</P>
<P>
   The most eloquent outdoor ornaments, however, are usually simple
and natural, made from the hearty fruit and greenery that flourish
while almost all of the landscape hibernates.
</P>
<P>
   Winter's harvest abounds with unexpected textures and shapes,
such as spiky pinecones and smooth little eucalyptus seeds. And the
palette is more than the red and green we expect. We do get those
colors, of course, in abundance: scarlet cranberries, blood-red
rose hips, crimson Pyracantha and a cavalcade of greenery _
silver-green eucalyptus, blue-green cedar, deep-green boxwood, and
the astonishing chartreuse and olive-green of the intriguingly
named golden hinoki false cypress.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the tangy purple of privet berries, the spongy
gold of kumquats and the yellow pods and wild-red centers of
bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   To make decorations for your front door, you may find all the
raw materials you need growing in your own yard or garden, but if
you don't, visit garden centers, florists, Christmas-tree lots,
even greengrocers.
</P>
<P>
   If the greenery you have chosen feels sappy or prickly, be sure
to wear work gloves. And remember that although there is nothing
wrong with a big spray of holly tied with a red bow, embellishing
the traditional recipes can yield lovely results. For example, try
finishing a large wreath with crisscrossed strings of cranberries
instead of a bow. (See instructions below.)
</P>
<P>
   Once you have learned how to cut and wire greenery, outdoor
ornaments are easy to construct and make enjoyable projects for
brisk winter days, especially when you are working with fragrant
greens. If you select cuttings that are as fresh as possible, and
the weather stays cold, your outdoor displays should last for
weeks, spreading holiday cheer throughout the season.
 &UR; CRANBERRY-LACED WREATH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This large, cranberry-wrapped wreath looks as handsome on a
window or wall as it does on a front door. You can also make two
small wreaths and strands of ribbon and cranberries to frame it _
or to decorate an interior window or mirror.
</P>
<P>
   To make the entire arrangement, you'll need a 20-inch tubular
straw wreath form; two 6-inch single-wire wreath forms; floral
pins; 24-gauge floral wire; cranberries; 4-inch-wide ribbon; and
golden hinoki false cypress. We chose this greenery because the
dark cranberries stand out against its varied hues of green;
light-colored fancy cedar can also be used.
</P>
<P>
   1. To make the large wreath, place the straw wreath form on a
table and, using floral pins, attach sprigs of greenery all the way
around. Vary the wreath's color by alternating light, medium and
dark greens.
</P>
<P>
   2. To make cranberry strands: First twist one end of a length of
floral wire into a knot. String cranberries, one by one, onto wire,
piercing each berry from end to end. Finish the strand with another
knot, to keep berries on wire.
</P>
<P>
   3. To decorate the wreath, lay strands of berries on the wreath
to plot a crisscross pattern; use floral pins to indicate where the
strands intersect. Be sure the ends of the strands fall on the back
of the wreath. When you are pleased with the pattern, anchor the
cranberry strands with floral pins.
</P>
<P>
   Draping the cranberry strands can be difficult so, if possible,
have someone help you: One person holds the wreath and the other
weaves the strands.
</P>
<P>
   4. To complete the doorway decorations, make two wreaths using
6-inch wire wreath forms, floral wire and sprigs of golden hinoki
false cypress. Secure the end of the floral wire to the wire form.
Place a few sprigs of greenery on the form, and wrap the wire
around the cut ends and the form several times, securing the
greenery to the form; do not cut the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Add more sprigs, overlapping the first ones by about half; wrap
with wire. Continue adding sprigs until the form is completely
covered. Cut and wrap the wire to secure.
</P>
<P>
   Hang the small wreathes from nails placed above opposite sides
of the door. Thread two cranberry strands and a long length of
satin ribbon through the two wreaths. The ribbon and cranberry
strands should swoop gracefully above the door.
</P>
<P>
   When the ribbon and cranberry strands are positioned correctly,
cut the ribbon ends on a diagonal.
</P>

SCRAPBOOKS: HOLIDAY GIFTS THAT WILL BE FAMILY TREASURES 
</HEADLINE>
 (For purchase information and to obtain photos, call New York Times
Syndicate sales representative Nirdi Relis at (800) 972-3550 or
(212) 499-3333.) &HT;    
 By KATHY SENA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    No doubt there's a shoebox or two up in your closet just
overflowing with snapshots dating back to your child's first
birthday, your wedding ... maybe your own childhood. How do I know
all this? Just take a look in my closets!
 &HT;    You can turn those treasured photos into albums that will become
great holiday gifts _ and family heirlooms.
 &HT;    Scrapbooking, the popular craft of creating ``memory books,''
has been sweeping the western and southern parts of the United
States for the past few years. It is quickly becoming the '90s
version of the quilting bee. Its popularity has even spread to
England, Australia and Japan.
 &HT;    Scrapbooking is simple. But the list of products _ and the
terminology _ can sound intimidating to the beginner. Acid-free?
Polyurethane? Archival quality?
 &HT;    Not to worry. Just follow these simple instructions and you'll
finish your first scrapbook page in no time. And trust me _ you'll
be hooked.
 &HT;    Experts estimate that photos preserved in this fashion should
still be in good shape at least 200 years from now. I can't say the
same for my high school photo album, a magnetic album that has
turned my photos gummy and brown around the edges _ and I'm not
that old! What better treasure to pass on to your children _ and
your great-great-grandchildren.
 WHAT IS SCRAPBOOKING?  
 &HT;    Scrapbooking is a way to preserve photographs and other
memorabilia in a safe, acid-free environment. Aid can weaken and
discolor paper. As long as you choose acid-free, archival-quality
(meaning material that can be safely used for preservation
purposes) paper, pens, adhesive and sheet-protectors, you really
can't go wrong. The only thing you add is photos, love and a little
imagination.
 &HT;    Here's how to get started:
 &HT;    1. Get organized. Group your photos by year or by subject. Most
experts recommend starting with your most recent photographs and
working back in time. Because magnetic-page photo albums are quite
harmful to photos, consider removing photos from old albums and
storing them by date in a heavy-duty, acid-free photo-storage box
(which can be purchased inexpensively at most camera stores and
photo shops) until you have time to add them to your scrapbook.
 &HT;    2. Buy supplies. There is an overwhelming array of scrapbooking
products available at craft stores, stationery stores and rubber
stamp stores and by mail order. There are even stores devoted just
to scrapbooking. But all you really need to get started is the
following:
 &HT;    + Photos. Order double prints.
 &HT;    + Acid-free mounting paper, polyurethane archival-quality page
protectors and a three-ring binder. Some people prefer to use 8 1/2
x 11-inch sheets stored in sheet protectors in binders. Others use
albums of different sizes that are pre-filled with acid-free paper.
 &HT;    + Regular household scissors.
 &HT;    + Acid-free adhesive _ glue stick, photo corners or
peel-and-stick squares.
 &HT;    + Acid-free pen for ``journaling'' _ adding names, dates and
comments to the page.
 &HT;    Starter kits containing most of the above can be purchased at
many craft stores for about $25. To further enhance your pages, you
may wish to buy such items as paper punches, stickers, circle
cutters, colored paper and pens, templates for cutting shapes,
fancy-edged scissors.
 &HT;    3. Pick a theme. Christmas? Your child's birthday party? The
school picnic? Whatever your theme, play with groupings of photos.
Be choosy. Use only your best photos, whether it's one special
photo alone on a page or a grouping of four or five.
 &HT;    4. Crop and mat. You may want to crop your photos to sharpen
their focus. Trim around the most important part of the photo,
removing excess background or unnecessary elements. If you are
using old family photos or other irreplaceable photos, make color
copies and work from those.
 &HT;    You can use plain or patterned paper to create a mat. Just glue
your photo to the paper and trim around the edges, leaving a border
showing. Double- or triple-matted photos look great, too.
 &HT;    5. Add the finishing touches. After you've chosen a layout, it's
time to glue down your photos and to add stickers, stamps and _
most important _ journaling.
 &HT;    Add dates and names, of course. But don't stop there. Add
details that will make the photos come alive for future
generations. Tell a funny story about how your dog ate the
Thanksgiving turkey. List your child's five favorite songs next to
a photo showing her singing. Describe where and how far your son
hiked on the Boy Scout camping trip. It's those details that make
your scrapbook a real family treasure.
 &HT;    6. Pass it around. One of the most rewarding parts of
scrapbooking is sharing the finished book with your family. Kids
can learn a lot from looking at scrapbooks. Older kids enjoy
looking back on family activities and sharing the book with
friends. Toddlers and preschoolers learn names of family members,
pick up lots of new words and enjoy looking at themselves when they
were ``just babies.''
 &HT;    And all kids feel like VIPs as they turn the pages. After all,
they're the stars of their very own book.

 By PETER F. STEVENS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Once a year, Christmas cards flood America's mailboxes. Once a
year, countless fingers go numb from signing and addressing stacks
of them.
 &HT;    How did this tradition come to be?
 &HT;    The first Christmas card can be traced to a long-forgotten
businessman named Richard H. Pease. History records little of Pease
except that he was a skilled lithographer and printer who set up
shop in Albany in 1850. In 1851, whether in a fit of Yuletide
whimsy or in a savvy burst of self-promotion, he put bold black ink
to stiff, pristine white paper and crafted an intricate design.
 &HT;    On 4 1/2-by-6-inch cards, the holiday entrepreneur fashioned
images that later generations might have deemed too ``busy'' in
such a limited space, but that Americans of the 1850s found
perfectly fitting, given the mid-19th century affinity for
Victorian vistas and Currier &AMP; Ives prints.
 &HT;    A gracefully curved line of holly adorned the bottom of the
card, and prominently above the inked leaves ran the creator's
advertisement _ ``Pease's Great Variety Store in the Temple of
Fancy.''
 &HT;    ``Temple of Fancy'' perfectly described the images crowding the
card, Pease having turned his imagination and his drawing hand
loose in a burst of Christmas creativity. Featured in his holiday
motifs was, of course, Santa Claus.
 &HT;    Pease's Santa, however, bore only a passing resemblance to the
rotund St. Nick that famed 19th-century caricaturist Thomas Nast
later stamped upon the nation's collective imagination. The
businessman's Santa appeared on the card as a small, rather elflike
Santa Claus with a fur-trimmed cap.
 &HT;    Pease's card also featured scenes of how middle- and upper-class
Americans of the day celebrated Christmas. Arrayed around the
card's four corners were Christmas presents, Christmas dishes and
Christmas drinks, all hinting of mouthwatering holiday repasts and
heartfelt toasts.
 &HT;    In the card's center, a young, handsome couple, faces redolent
of holiday cheer and financial comfort, enjoyed the Yuletide
exuberance of their three children. Behind the beaming family, a
servant was setting an elaborate holiday dinner, a familiar scene
in affluent and middle-class households throughout the United
States. Reflecting an equally familiar but more disturbing reality
of 1850s American life was the black servant bustling about the
table.
 &HT;    Whether they knew it or not, friends and customers peering at
Pease's landmark cards, with their vivid black and white tones and
their boldly inked message, ``A Merry Christmas and A Happy New
Year,'' literally held the future theme of the Christmas card in
their hands.
 &HT;    Pease's card also contained the stuff of printers' nightmares.
To his friends' and customers' probable amusement and to his
certain chagrin, the engraver's cards included a misspelled word:
``Pease's Great Varety Store.''
 &HT;    In 1874, 24 years after Pease's flight of holiday fancy
materialized, Massachusetts lithographer Louis Prang unveiled a
line of beautiful commercial Christmas cards that spawned a
lucrative industry and earned him the sobriquet ``Father of the
American Christmas Card.''
 &HT;    For generations to come, Prang, whose pleasant, white-whiskered
features resembled those of the Santas in his popular cards, was
hailed as the first American to craft Christmas cards. Pease's
milestone card slipped into historical obscurity, eclipsed by the
commercial and artistic feat of Prang, who would long receive
mistaken acclaim as the creator of the very first American
Christmas card.
 &HT;    In 1954, greeting card authority Gyorgy Buday completed his
detailed book ``The History of the Christmas Card,'' which credited
Prang as the creator of the Christmas card. His publisher was at
the page-proof stage, when the author had a surprise for his
editors.
 &HT;    Buday had just received a letter from E.D. Chase, who had
enclosed a copy of ``the first American Christmas card'' -- Richard
Pease's card.
 &HT;    Buday went on to anoint Pease's card as the first: ``No date
appears on the lithograph itself, but as a result of some
considerable research, Mr. Chase satisfactorily established that it
must be either 1850, 1 or 2, since it was only these three years
that Mr. Pease occupied the building which is pictured prominently
on the card.''
 &HT;    Other scholars of Americana followed Buday's attempt to assign
Pease's card its proper place in the greeting card firmament. That
Prang had created the first commercially successful cards remains
clear. But Pease's creation stands as the nation's first bonafide
Christmas card.
 &HT;    We will never know if Pease's marriage of Christmas and commerce
bloomed ahead of its time, or if he, unlike Prang in the 1870s,
simply failed to parlay his idea into a holiday fortune.

 Hanukkah Bushes? Bah, Humbug!

sales representative Nirdi Relis at (800) 972-3550 or (212) By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I come from humbug beginnings. Raised as a Jew, I sat on Santa's
lap once at a department store, but it wasn't encouraged. My mother
likely gave in because I was too young to undersand the cosmic
implications.
 &HT;    Today, I consider it treason when Jews create ``Hanukkah
bushes'' or exchange gifts on Christmas. I, who don't belong to a
synagogue or light sabbath candles, still feel my roots erupt when
assaulted by Christmas.
 &HT;    The unbidden feelings come from years of singing Yuletide carols
in elementary school and being asked too many times what I did for
``The Holiday.'' When I answer indifferently that I worked, went to
a movie or grabbed a bite in Chinatown, people are suddenly quiet.
 &HT;    There's nothing like Christmas to make a Jew feel like a
minority. I know someone in Harleysville, Pa., who looked high and
low for Hanukkah candles. After painfully trying to describe to
clueless salespeople what menorah candles looked like, a clerk
suggested he use birthday candles _ a ludicrous concept to anyone
who knows the difference. The same person complained to a local
Wal-Mart manager when he couldn't find a Jewish New Year's card in
stock at Rosh Hashanah.
 &HT;    Most of the holiday cards I receive are bald-faced Christmas
cards, usually from people who 1) know I am Jewish, and 2) do not
know that Hanukkah began two weeks before Christmas.
 &HT;    While some feature neutral winter landscapes, others are
foil-embossed nativity scenes or living rooms steeped in candy
canes and boughs of holly. Sure, it's the thought that counts, but
a little more thinking could have gone a long way.
 &HT;    One year I happened upon a great series of cards called ``Mixed
Blessings.'' These cards use playful interdenominational pictures,
such as Santa skating a Star of David on ice or a reindeer with
antlers shaped like a menorah. Perfect to send anyone in the spirit
of unity.
 &HT;    Still, if you want to get technical, Hanukkah does not draw top
billing in the rank of Jewish holidays. When you care enough to
send the very best, send a card for the Jewish New Year, usually in
September.
 &HT;    Really, I'm not a grinch. I think the holiday season is a great
nudge for keeping tabs on faraway friends. Bragging family form
letters aside, I enjoy receiving their cards with news of a new
baby or a career switch. Likewise, I too have been known to think
about the people in my life each December who deserve a note from
the heart, seasonal or otherwise.

 SIDEBAR: SHOPPING AND INSTALLATION HINTS  
 &HT;    + Avoid impulse buys. Don't be fooled by fancy packaging. Do
your homework first by reading reviews and talking to friends.
 &HT;    + Check system requirements. Make sure you are buying something
your computer can handle. Minimum system requirements are always
listed on the boxes.
 &HT;    + Try before you buy. Many companies will let you play limited
versions of their programs on their websites or will send you a
demo CD. Call the company's 800 number for details.
 &HT;    + Install the software prior to the gift-giving. If at all
possible, install the software on your computer beforehand, make
sure it runs then rewrap the gift. Potential Christmas morning
disaster averted!

 &HT;    
 By HAL MALEHORN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    As almost everyone knows, a century ago in Manhattan 8-year-old
Virginia O'Hanlon wrote a letter to the editor of the New York Sun
to ask if there really was a Santa Claus.
 &HT;    Had that youngster lived 50 years earlier in certain parts of
the United States, she might well have asked if there was even a
Christmas.
 &HT;    Until the middle of the 1800s, throughout much of America
Christmas was much like any other day of the just-begun winter.
Most families then were farm folk, and the darkening days before
the winter solstice were simply times to rest up, fix up and save
up for the hard work of the coming agricultural season. Perhaps the
butchering of a hog enlivened the cold-weather chores, or a
quilting bee quickened the social scene.
 &HT;    This widespread indifference to the holiday can be explained by
the fact that most of our ancestors had no knowledge of the
traditions that were beginning to arrive here from Europe, and many
harbored strong religious objections to an event that sprang from
ancient pagan festivities.
 &HT;    In truth, beginning with the Puritans in early New England, and
continuing two centuries through the Great Awakening, many
sobersided naysayers deeply disliked the celebrations that came
from the Old World. ``Blasphemy'' and ``mockery,'' such persons
grumped. One prominent Protestant preacher of that era stoutly
announced, ``To me Christmas is a foreign day, and I shall die
so.''
 &HT;    Most rural people thus spent Christmas ignoring the celebrating,
with doors and minds shut to the pockets of seasonal merrymaking.
Indeed, by 1850 America had so little regard for Christmas that
only a few of our 31 states had declared it a legal holiday.
 &HT;    In the latter half of the 19th century, however, religious
opposition declined. Christmas then became a more secular season,
as Old World customs evolved into an American Yuletide culture.
 &HT;    For instance, from England came the exchange of greeting cards,
a tradition traced back to one Henry Cole. In 1843 he impulsively
dashed off picture cards in place of his long-overdue seasonal
letters that were required by strict British etiquette.
 &HT;    In 1851 the card-exchange idea arrived in this country, when
Richard H. Pease decorated his business cards with holiday
messages. More than 20 years later Louis Prang commercialized the
idea with the release of a line of Christmas cards, spawning a
profitable business for Hallmark and a harrowing job for the postal
system.
 &HT;    The Germans contributed the Christmas tree, though people who
migrated to areas devoid of evergreens had to settle for other
native species.
 &HT;    In 1848 the tree-as-centerpiece notion was given a boost in
America when Godey's Lady's Book published an engraving of Queen
Victoria and Prince Albert admiring the tree they had decorated for
their royal young. However, the tree then was just a tabletop
ornament. Only later did it evolve into its floor-to-ceiling
splendor.
 &HT;    In 1850 Charles Dickens, already famous for his ``Christmas
Carol,'' described an upper-class evergreen: ``It was brilliantly
lighted by a multitude of little tapers, everywhere sparkling with
bright objects, rosy-cheeked dolls, domestic furniture wonderfully
made of tin, jolly broad-faced men, fiddles, drums, paint boxes,
guns, banners, humming tops, and imitation fruit made dazzling with
gold leaf.''
 &HT;    That was all well and good for the wealthy set, of course. But
since the mass manufacture and marketing of toys was only in its
infancy in America, ordinary children lucky enough to observe
Christmas at all likely got homemade ``playpretties'' _ products of
a mother's sewing basket or a father's workbench.
 &HT;    Our modern image of Santa similarly came from overseas _
Holland, Scandinavia, Germany and France. But the picture that
eventually became fixed in our minds _ a jolly bewhiskered,
red-garbed fellow with more than an ample waistline _ was largely
the gift of Clement C. Moore, whose 1822 poem ``A Visit From St.
Nicholas'' not only defined the man himself but also set forever
the belief that Santa flies through the air on a reindeer-drawn
sleigh.
 &HT;    Today, of course, Christmas is big business, with its sales
pitch beginning weeks earlier. Children snuggle fitfully in their
bed with fond hopes that Ninja and Nintendo will not-so-magically
appear in their stockings come morning.
 &HT;    When Francis Church, editorial writer for the New York Sun,
replied to Virginia O'Hanlon in 1897, he little realized quite how
commercialized Santa and Christmas were to become. But he did
assure his young correspondent that Santa was and is more a matter
of heart and hope than of things in hand.
 &HT;    ``He lives in terms of love and generosity and devotion,''
Church wrote. ``No one can imagine all the wonders that are quite
unseen.''

AT BROOKSTONE, IT'S AS CLEAR AS GLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY&AMP;  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The windows of the Brookstone store at Copley Place in Boston
are carefully arranged. One window features health aids as well as
a plug for the company's Web site. Another shows off some high-tech
massage wands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest piece of advertising for us is our windows,'' says
Michael Anthony, president and chief executive of Brookstone Inc.,
a chain of gift stores based in Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   About three times a year, Brookstone takes out a print ad in the
New York Times Sunday Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   One recent print ad was the cover of a Brookstone catalog, which
in turn is designed to resemble the front of a Brookstone store.
One ad plumps ``the Tempur-pedic pillow, just one of 700 unique
gifts you'll discover at our 200 stores nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   A second print ad shows a man giving his young son a bath. The
featured product is a digital shower radio.
</P>
<P>
   Most Brookstone products, from air-injection wine-bottle openers
to barbecue forks with built-in thermometers, are promoted as ideal
gifts for men. As a result, many customers are women, and ad
imagery shows happy couples and young families.
</P>
<P>
   Print ads aside, Brookstone's chief marketing vehicle is its
windows, which are remodeled about once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Most Brookstone stores are based in malls, and sometimes the
stores will put one of their $3,000 vibrating chairs out front,
where weary shoppers can plop down for the purported equivalent of
a shiatsu rubdown.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that pleasantly shaken-up shoppers will then be
lured inside to buy a $40 TheraSpa folding turbo massager or a $30
electric tongue cleaner, supposedly the last word for passionate
advocates of oral hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are an impulse buy,'' says Anthony, who notes that nearly
two-thirds of Brookstone products cost $40 or less.
</P>
<P>
   As Anthony sees it, Brookstone also partly ``brands itself'' by
coming up with new products and attempting to stay a step ahead of
copycats that offer off-brand knockoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, shortly after Anthony joined the company, only 12 to 15
percent of store inventory was made expressly for Brookstone; now
that number is near 50 percent, and of the roughly 750 products
available in stores, a third of them are new.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the new products are upgrades,'' Anthony says.
``Sound relaxation systems, for instance, we obsoleted our entire
line, going from analog to digital systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of these systems offer soothing sounds _ the gentle ebb and
flow of the surf, a summer shower in a rainforest.
</P>
<P>
   But when some city customers complained that the sounds of
nature weren't the most restful, Brookstone dutifully added a track
full of wailing want sirens and honking horns. Without the roaring
traffic's boom, it seems, these demanding sleepers couldn't snooze.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work with a sleep therapist on all these products,''
Anthony says.
</P>
<P>
   Many retailers these days are seeing an evening out of their
sales cycles with consumers shopping steadily all year round.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Brookstone is a throwback; it will see a major
chunk of its sales in the last 14 days before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Through Oct. 31, the company was $9.4 million in the red, but it
still expects to report a handsome profit for the year on projected
full-year sales of $270 million to $275 million.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to smooth out a cycle that has big spikes at Father's
Day and Christmas, Brookstone is testing airport kiosks and stores
and now looks to expand a site at Logan International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brookstone has high hopes for selling products on its
Web site. Holiday sales have tripled from last year, though they
still amount to less than 1 percent of overall sales.
</P>
<P>
   One bit of bad news: Rising rents are forcing Brookstone to
close a store near Downtown Crossing, Anthony says.
</P>
<P>
   As befits a store full of gadgets, Brookstone has one that
counts the number of visitors to each store.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic is down so far this year, perhaps because warm weather
is keeping people away from the malls. Fortunately, for Brookstone,
customers those who make purchases are spending more than last
year, Anthony says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, it gets later and later,'' he says of the holiday
rush.
</P>
<P>
   Many retailers resort to advertising to unload unwanted
merchandise. When goods pile up, they'll run ads saying, ``Take 25
percent off.''
</P>
<P>
   But because it offers ``unique'' items, Brookstone can sell at
full price. As a result, it can use a different ad strategy. ``Our
store windows are our biggest marketing effort,'' Anthony says.

WARNINGS READY GILLETTE HOLDERS FOR THE BLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never mind those holiday shopping crowds. The world's consumer
markets are not turning out to be a very merry place in the last
months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the biggest global consumer marketing companies, Procter
&AMP; Gamble Co. and the Coca-Cola Co., have already warned investors
that their performance for the fourth quarter will be a
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Our question: If Coke and Procter &AMP; Gamble are coming up short,
how can Gillette Co. do that much better?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: it probably can't. But Gillette's warnings in
September, covering results for the second half of the year, have
put most investors on notice and cost-cutting may help the bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gillette's fourth quarter has all the makings of being an
extremely ugly quarter,'' said analyst Andrew Shore of PaineWebber.
``But it should take no one by suprise, Wall Street is well
prepared for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Razor blades aren't soda or soap suds. But the same weak global
economies that are dragging down performance at other consumer
product companies has to have an impact on Gillette. About
one-third of Gillette's sales take place outside the United States
and Western Europe, in Asia, South America and Russia, among other
places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprisingly, everyone had discounted a lot of the
international problems we had over the summer,'' said Robert
Izmirlian, a Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. analyst who follows Gillette.
``But they aren't going away all that quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Some money managers like John Snyder of the John Hancock
Soverign Investors fund, which buys large-company stocks, are
shying away from global marketing companies now because of weaker
economies around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that there is no top line (revenue) growth, no
volume growth per se,'' said Snyder. ``Part of that is obviuosly
the slowing in the global economies and slowing in Euorpe.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's sales for the first three quarters of 1998 are
slightly below comparable figures for last year and less than 3
percent better than 1996 results. Gillette shares slumped over the
summer with the rest of the stock market, falling from more than 62
to 36 1/4, but have failed to bounce back like many other big
issues. Gillette stock finished Thursday at 43 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Coke said it would earn as much as 20 percent less
than expected in the fourth quarter due to weak international
sales. Procter &AMP; Gamble said its sales were running below
expectations, but cost savings may preserve anticipated earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette had announced disappointing third-quarter expectations
and an aggressive cost-cutting plan at the end of September. At the
time, Gillette said it expected fourth-quarter earnings growth in
the ``low double digits'' and analysts have taken that at its
minimum. Their consensus forecasts for fourth quarter profits of 39
cents per share would be up from 36 cents a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't be bad, under the circumstances, and Gillette does
not appear to be guiding analyst estimates lower so far. Only a few
forecasts have been modestly trimmed in the last few weeks, but
their aggregate recommendation on Gillette stock has slipped.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gillette is focused on the rollout of expensive new
products that it hopes will be big winners in 1999. Sometime next
year it will become clear whether the heavily promoted Mach3 razor
and the new $4.99 Oral B toothbrush, the most expensive mass
marketed toothbrush ever, are successful products.
</P>
<P>
   Not suprisingly, Gillette officials wouldn't tell us much about
their fourth-quarter business. But we did pry loose bits of
information, including:
</P>
<P>
   --Currency translation, a serious problem created by the strong
dollar this year, continues but is ``less negative'' than in the
third quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
   --The battery business is doing fine at home. Around the world,
business should be up in local currencies but ``most likely'' down
in dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
   Mach3, the shaver with the billion-dollar development and
marekting budget, has seemed to do well in its early months.
Gillette said Mach3 was the best-selling razor with a 13 percent
share of the US market in November.
</P>
<P>
   Citing data from A.C. Neilson Co., Gillette said all its razors
and blades last month acheived a 70 percent share of US dollar
markets for the first time since 1962. The market share figure a
year ago was 67.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the crucial question for Mach3 is whether men will buy the
expensive replacement blades once their original supply that came
with the razor runs out. A four-pack of replacement blades costs
about $6.68 in retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't know until the first quarter whether the repurchase
data is fine, which I suspect it will be,'' said Shore. ``That
should allay all fears about Mach3. If it's weak, Gillette will be
a very bad stock. But I think Mach3 is going to be fine.''
</P>

THUMBS UP FOR THE REVAMPED INFINITI Q45 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, December 20, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Special interests present special problems to the car buyer. To
complicate things, automobiles have shrunk considerably from what
they once were, thanks to clean-air imperatives and the badgering
of environmental extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the problem that confronted Martha, the very tall woman
who plays a very tall instrument: the harp. A good harp costs more
than a good car and fits in none of them. A van, however, fills the
bill. Martha's devotion to the queen of stringed things dictated
van.
</P>
<P>
   The van is also the solution for the hobbyist devoted to big
things winged _ large- or giant-scale model airplanes, frequently
with wings spanning seven, eight, or nine feet. Sometimes the hobby
requires trailer rental or purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Antiques collectors, too, run into problems _ the drop-leaf
table or antique desk won't quite make it into the trunk of an
econobox _ one shudders to consider the potential of that
much-heralded electric thingamajig.
</P>
<P>
   Even the annual Christmas tree gets to be a transport headache
when the living space demands a seven-foot fir and the car
available is . . . well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   For the columnist, lately, the choice of test vehicle has
revolved around the particular capacity problem to be solved, the
annual forays into those joyful celebrations known as Tuba
Christmas. This being the 25th anniversary of the first TC, and the
columnist being addicted to disturbing the peace from time to time
with a euphonium and joining others so inclined, the desire was
vehicles that would adapt well to carrying these formidable
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   A euphonium is a modest-sized member of the tuba family (roughly
defined here as any instrument with conical bore playing mostly
below middle C), and so there is wide choice _ except when
traveling with friends. But consider some of the heavier members of
the clan, those full-size standing behemoths of the band that
require a case bigger than a small car! It is no mean feat to
assemble 130 tubists in downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Now there loomed Essex, Conn., and Wickford, R.I., and your
columnist was traveling in concert (if you will excuse a mild pun)
to both; there was need to place three large brass, bass-clef
instruments in the trunk of the available car, a 1999 Infiniti Q45.
The Q is a large car by today's standards, but the trunk obviously
was not designed with three euphoniums (or is it euphonia?) in
mind, one a double-belled instrument. At first glance, it was no
go.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Collins is an engineer, and he quickly figured a way to
place the bulky, odd-shaped cases into the somewhat narrow confines
and still have room for stands, music, and a couple or three
cornets, if anybody had a mind to bring them. At the Essex Steam
Train Museum, 78 tubists gathered in the engine shed to sound out a
merry Christmas _ a group also gathered on the platform to serenade
revelers on the excursion train. At Wickford, some 50 or so solved
the transport need with a variety of automobiles _ Taurus wagons
seem popular among musicians with large instruments, brass and
electronic.
</P>
<P>
   In between Tuba Christmasing, the Infiniti was called upon for
hard duty in middle and coastal Maine, a lot of New Hampshire, and
a generous bit of the Bay State. It is a pleasant car, but
Nissan/Infiniti seems to have mixed feelings about just what it is
that an Infiniti is supposed to be. It has been a model in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   The Q started as a magnificent ugly duckling, a luxury car
looking like a cross between an old Pontiac and a new BMW but with
a wart on its nose. But what a car to drive! It was splendid on the
road. Then, it got prettier and less fun _ softer, squishier. The
1999 reincarnation is just about right _ it's time to quit
tinkering and out the effort into solid marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The styling for '99 is restrained, refined _ hey, it's a classy
boat. The 4.13-liter V-8 this year puts out 266 horsepower (278
ft/lb torque) and is mated to a 4-speed, electronically controlled
gearbox. The tested car is the standard model, a $48,695-delivered
car with all the bells and whistles, Bose sound, CD player, 16-inch
wheels, ABS, and traction control. There is a touring model, the
Q45t, for $1,700 more, with a new electronically managed suspension
system.
</P>
<P>
   The headlights are new, halogen bonfires which cast a blue light
that apparently irritates other drivers, if one is to judge by the
number of bright lights flashed at me on the road. There have been
interior modifications, too. The signature gold-rimmed clock has
returned to center dash after a two-year hiatus, and the controls
have generally been modified larger for the benefit of gloved
fingers _ except for tuning and scan/seek functions on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Interior storage is still an issue; the glove box is barely
adequate for the fancy packet of owner's manual and other
literature. Bins grace the doors, and there is a two-piece storage
bin under the armrest that would better serve if it were one useful
storage space. A small lidded compartment forward of that is either
two cupholders or an eyeglass storage bin. Seat-back pockets pretty
much complete the storage picture _ don't ask where one might
connveniently place a purse.
</P>
<P>
   Wood accents and supple leather attest to luxury; interior room
makes somewhat less of a case _ a Rolls-Royce this is not _ but
unless the front-seat occupants are NBA pros with overly long legs,
the kneeroom in the rear is generous. Headroom is good.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the Q45 is sheer pleasure. It is quick, quiet,
responsive _ not quite crisp, perhaps, but nice in the corners and
nimble in traffic. The ride is firmer this year but hardly stiff;
the Q soaks up the ruts on a dirt road admirably, still offers
decent road feel and feedback to the driver.
</P>
<P>
   The Q45 is EPA-rated 17 miles per gallon city, 24 highway; in a
bit more than 600 miles tracked, the tested car delivered 21.02
m.p.g. overall in varied driving, mostly with a good load _ three
tubas, three tubists for more than half that distance.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs up for the Q45 _ and a very Merry Christmas to you all.

GOALS OF THE AIR ATTACKS SIGNAL A US POLICY SHIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS AND COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What happens after the bombing stops?
</P>
<P>
   Under fire for launching missile against Iraq without a
long-term strategy, President Clinton's national security team
Thursday responded by disclosing a broad plan: aiming to crush
Iraq's defenses, destroy biological and chemical weapons
production, increase unrest in the Iraqi army and ultimately topple
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   In public statements and briefings to Congress, officials
described the plan as a dramatic change in what had for years been
an effort to ``contain'' Hussein and control his weapons
development.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration has been reluctant to reveal details,
plans under consideration include drastic measures such as
declaring all of Iraq a ``no-fly, no troop-movement zone'' so that
Hussein cannot use his warplanes or dispatch his soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a seminal shift in the attitude of the
administration, as I read it,'' said Joseph R. Biden Jr. of
Delaware, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, who has been in regular touch with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. ``Put it this way, I'd be surprised if at the
end of a three- four- or five-day air campaign the adminstration
said, `Well, we've done our job.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the strike say that President Clinton launched
strikes merely to punish Iraq or deflect attention from impeachment
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf
accused the US and British governments of exaggerating reports of
Iraq's weapons development and telling ``cheap lies in order to
deceive the world, in order to have the pretext to commit
aggression against Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is not alone. Some of the most virulent criticism came
Thursday from Russia. The State Department Thursday announced that
Russia had recalled its ambassador to Washington to protest the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, a group
representing Muslim countries, issued a statement saying, ``Iraq
finds itself subject to military strikes which come under
mysterious circumstances with no clear objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has given mixed messages about its
objectives in this campaign. Just a month ago, Clinton called off
an attack on Iraq, saying it would lead other countries to end
inspections by the UN Special Commision, or UNSCOM. But Thursday,
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said the ``medium-term
goal'' of the attack is to have ``a strong, professional,
functioning UNSCOM with unfettered access to be able to continue to
do its work.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate objective of the bombing is to ``degrade''
Hussein's ability to make biological, chemical and nuclear weapons
and attack his command and control centers, Albright said. The
ultimate objective, she indicated, is to overthrow Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key word is `degrade' because it allows them to declare
any victory at any point,'' said Howard Diamond, an expert with the
Arms Control Association in Washington. ``If you bomb two targets
and hit one, you can still say that you have degraded Iraq's
capacity to build weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Even supporters say the administration is taking a risky turn
that could, at the very least, lead to an expensive commitment of
US troops near Iraq for years to come. Also, the effort could cause
a backlash that isolates the United States at the United Nations
and leads to the end of weapons inspections and an easing of
economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, a senior UN official predicted that
Russia, China, France and other countries critical of the attack
would lead an effort to derail or end the UN Special Commission, or
UNSCOM. ``There is good reason to believe we could get totally
thrown out period _ buzz off,'' he said. ``No oil-for-food (deals).
No UNSCOM, and the erosion of economic sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its limits, the inspection team has served as an
important group of eyes and ears in Baghdad for the past seven
years. Even when the Iraqi government turned away inspectors from
sites, that was a tip to Washington that Saddam Hussein wanted to
hide something, said Richard Shultz, a professor of international
politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts
University and former consultant to the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the inspections could deprive the US government of
one of the few reliable sources of information it has inside Iraq,
he said. ``If you change your strategy and now you're going to try
control Saddam's weapons of mass destruction production through
military strikes, then will you ever have the intelligence you
need?''
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, Russia started lobbying to remake a less
aggressive UNSCOM with fewer British and American inspectors.
Russia called for a more ``professional'' and ``objective'' group
of inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Albright and Clinton have called top officials from
more than 20 countries to rally support. The effort has taken the
edge off of some of the sharp words. Although China and Russia
condemned the strike, France muted its criticism Thursday. ``I
don't know the solution to this problem,'' Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's new government voiced strong backing for the attack,
as Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said, ``There is no question
whatsoever about our solidarity with the international community,
and with our alliance partners the United States and Great
Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   Arab countries have reacted cautiously to the strikes, which
might continue through the first days of Ramadan, the holy month,
this weekend. But American diplomats said the Arab leaders have
been supportive in private countries because they are so wary of
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The attack has provided encouragement to fractious Iraqi
opposition, which is seeking undercover assistance as well as $97
million in military aid that money the US Congress set aside to
help seize power in Baghdad. But the administration, concerned that
the opposition groups have scant support inside the country, has
not been able to settle on any .
</P>
<P>
   Senator Biden said Republicans have criticized President Clinton
for failing to choose an opposition group, yet Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott and other critics also have been unable to settle
on a group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `Fine, give me a name... Come on Trent, say it out
loud, ' '' Biden told reporters Thursday. ``Come on fella, speak
up. You say, `I have a plan to overthrow (Hussein)'? Okay, tell
me.''

   Q. You mentioned that the average domestic stock fund had a
year-to-date gain of only 6.5 percent. This seems rather low. I
have one fund, Oppenheimer Growth, Class A, which has had a
year-to-date gain of only 7 percent and I consider that poor
performance. My other equity mutual funds range from 7.85 percent
to 26 percent year-to-date gains. Our total portfolio, which
includes several professionally managed investment accounts, has a
year-to-date gain of 15.3 percent, with an allocation of 62.6
percent in stocks, 30 percent in bonds and the rest in cash
equivalents. Since the stocks are mostly large cap companies and
the Standard and Poor's 500 has a year-to-date gain of 21.26
percent, this seems like a reasonable gain. So if the average
domestic stock fund has gained only 6.5 percent this year, I would
consider the average fund poorly managed. Is this correct?
</P>
<P>
   R.B., Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, things have improved a bit since I wrote that, with the
average domestic stock fund having a 7.20 percent year-to-date gain
as of Dec. 10. But when you look at such figures, you should
remember that many of the funds that go into the calculation are
required by their charters to operate in market segments that are
currently unpopular. Thus while growth funds showed the highest
year-to-date average, at 14.22 percent, the figure for all domestic
stock funds was dragged down by the 7.59 percent average loss for
small company growth funds, and the meager 2.65 percent gain for
mid-cap funds.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these statistical glitches, your point is well taken,
and it goes far to explain the mushroom popularity of index funds.
A lot of apologists for the mutual fund industry have spent a lot
of time explaining that the terrific performance of the big index
funds in the past few years will probably prove an anomaly over the
longer run -- that the past few years have seen the large-cap
stocks that dominate the indexes move ahead almost in lockstep,
thus driving the index funds to their strong results. I think this
is a reasonable argument to explain the dramatic outperformance of
the last three years, when the average domestic stock fund produced
average annual returns of 16.19 percent, compared to 25.98 percent
for the Standard and Poor's 500 Index. But note also that if you go
back a full decade, the average annual figure posted for the
average domestic stock fund was 14.34 percent, which compares to
17.87 percent for the S&AMP;P 500 (and 17.70 percent for the largest
S&AMP;P fund, Vanguard Index 500). Perhaps something in the
neighborhood of half of the difference between the S&AMP;P 500 results
and those of the average domestic stock fund can be ascribed to the
fees and expenses which mutual fund owners bear. An additional part
of the variance can, as above, be tied to results of some funds
which are required to be in a particular market segment, no matter
how unpopular it is. But in the end, I'm afraid, there's yet
another element, which is that some mutual fund managers seem to
try too hard; the competition for the investor's dollars lead some
mutual fund managers to turn their portfolios too often, and to
take some short-term risks, attempting to bump their star ratings
from Morningstar Mutual Funds. Morningstar, which supplied the
long-term figures I cited above, no longer uses categories such as
aggressive growth or capital appreciation. But Lipper Analytical
Services Inc. still uses the Capital Appreciation category to
denote funds which take the most aggressive investment stance. As
of Lipper's report of Dec. 3, for the last five years the Capital
Appreciation group average showed a 97.76 percent gain. In the more
sedate growth group, the average total return was 124.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But to complete the tortoise-and-hare portrait, in those same
five years the average growth and income fund posted 125.34 percent
returns, while the average S&AMP;P 500 fund posted a 171.57 percent
total return. During those five years, only the Science and
Technology and Financial Services segments topped those of the S&AMP;P
index funds, with figures of 178.16 percent and 177.95 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   So I think the answer to your question takes two parts. One,
obviously, is that you and your advisors have done a good job of
building your portfolio. But it also seems true that the portfolio
has been at the right place at the right time -- and if you don't
change your investment mix as the market focuses change, ultimately
the markets will focus in other segments than the large caps, and
you'll find the comparative results less attractive than you do
now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In September of 1997 my son invested an IRA account of
$90,000 in Vanguard funds, with 50 percent in Vanguard Index Value,
20 percent in Vanguard Specialized Health Care, and 15 percent each
in Vanguard International Growth and Vanguard International Value.
This IRA will have 23 years before he must make his initial minimum
withdrawal. While I am satisfied with the composition of the funds,
I wonder if he wouldn't be better off by using something more
aggressive -- such as Vanguard Index 500 or Vanguard Index Growth
-- instead of Index Value.
</P>
<P>
   H.N., Dedham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, if your son were required to maintain the same
portfolio for 23 years, I would be inclined to agree with you. But
while I've never been much of a believer in market timing, I do
like the idea of periodically switching among Vanguard's three
funds that track the Standard and Poor's 500 Index and its subsets.
If you are willing to look at broad market trends and are confident
in your judgment of the status of market trends, you might decide
that you will hold Index 500 in a neutral market, use Index Growth
in a market with low PEs and high dividends, and use Index Value
when stocks are expensive and dividends low. If you're going to use
this approach, I don't advocate frequent switches, but rather
setting a schedule that requires a reassessment of the portfolio
allocation no more than once a year -- and perhaps even once every
other year.
</P>
<P>
   If your son were to adopt such a strategy, I think the current
market fully justifies holding the position in Index Value, so I
would make no change there right now -- or for the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
   But I would suggest one fairly minor change. To achieve broader
market diversification, why not suggest your son reduce the
positions in International Growth and International Value by 5
percent each, putting the proceeds of those sales into Vanguard's
Small Cap Index fund?

WHY IS SPREWELL VILIFIED, GREENE IGNORED? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If he wants, Ron Shelton can easily make a sequel to ``White Men
Can't Jump.'' Like the film that starred Wesley Snipes, Woody
Harrelson, and Rosie Perez, this one would have a heavy sports
theme. All the director would have to do is study the cases of
Kevin Greene and Latrell Sprewell, and, voila, he'd have the
insightful ``White Men Can't Be Thugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the public wouldn't buy it because, simply, the
public wouldn't know much about it. They wouldn't see it in the
sports and editorial pages, hear about it on sports radio, or watch
it during TV highlights because, apparently, media outlets
experience computer, microphone, and camera viruses when ``thug''
or ``punk'' or ``hoodlum'' is placed in the same vicinity as a
white professional athlete. When you're a nonwhite athlete, you get
used to the probing of your character and intelligence, all under
the guise of explaining your bad day on the field/court/diamond.
</P>
<P>
   Some days I hate my profession, but at least it consistently
gets half of it right: I don't think white athletes should be
called thugs, either. Which is also to say that I don't think any
athlete should be assigned thug status unless it is a self-applied
label. But, yo, I'm certainly not the one to be investigating
anybody's language. I do, though, have questions. Such as these,
directed to all the people who were outraged by Golden State
Warrior Sprewell going after his coach, P.J. Carlesimo, and choking
him last year:
</P>
<P>
   Where ya at?
</P>
<P>
   What's up?
</P>
<P>
   Where ya been?
</P>
<P>
   Why are you so quiet?
</P>
<P>
   Where are the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and ``Sixty
Minutes''? Where are the newspaper letter writers, talk show
callers, academics, and psychologists all telling us about the
pathology of any man who attacks his coach? Where are all the
feature stories exploring the background of Greene, with interviews
from his friends and neighbors? Sprewell hired the same lawyer O.J.
Simpson used (Johnnie Cochran) in his murder trial. People took
that information and acted as if police found blood on some Bruno
Maglis owned by Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   The public had a jones for Sprewell in 1997 and the media had no
problem accommodating their robust Sprewell appetite.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street Journal: ``Jail Sprewell.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Herald: ``Slam dunk, punk!''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Globe: ``Sprewell decision scores one for the bad guys.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Post: ``Hoop Thug.''
</P>
<P>
   Time: ``Tall Men Behaving Badly'' and ``corn-rowed punk.''
</P>
<P>
   Greensboro News &AMP; Record: ``A License To Steal and Strangle.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Times: ``NBA Violence.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt Sprewell has issues. I recognized that a few
years ago when I watched him get into an embarrassing argument with
teammate Tim Hardaway during a game against the Celtics. The two
men had to be separated, and eventually, Hardaway was traded.
Sprewell also sued the NBA, with full support from his agent, and
then turned around and sued the agent who supported him while he
was suing the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But if an argument is going to be made that Sprewell is a thug,
based on him being a self-absorbed player who choked his coach,
wouldn't you have to say the same for Greene?
</P>
<P>
   For those who missed it _ and you most certainly did because it
dipped in and out of the news like the swiftest night crawler _
Greene, a Carolina Panthers linebacker, erupted on the sideline
during a game Sunday and went after position coach Kevin Steele.
The coach was yelling at him, and he didn't want to hear it at the
time. First he told Steele to get out of his face. Then he put his
hands on him.
</P>
<P>
   Greene weighs 247 pounds. He owns a Gold's Gym in Alabama. He
knows how to hurt people. If his teammates hadn't restrained him,
he would have mussed up Steele so badly that the coach would be
able to fit in the tiny logo that adorns the sides of the Panthers'
helmets. That was clear to anyone who watched the clip of the
confrontation on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Sprewell was penalized 68 games and $6 million for
his attack. Greene was suspended one game and nearly $118,000 for
his.
</P>
<P>
   Like Greene, Sprewell would have thrashed his coach if not
restrained. Carlesimo is a very pleasant man when he is not in a
gym. When he steps onto a court, he turns into Major Pain. You
can't shut the guy up. Sprewell, who can be as volatile as his
game, went after Carlesimo during a December 1997 practice after
hearing too much of something. He went after him twice. He even
threatened to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's incident with Carlesimo was not televised. But if you
talk to people, they'll recite intimate details as if they were
ringside watching Mills Lane referee a title bout. The story of
what really happened lies with each individual who was in the gym
that day. Everything else is lore, the result of imaginations and
biases producing a scene that was never seen.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to a question that many people cannot
answer or are afraid to answer: Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   I thought of putting the race of each individual in one of the
earlier paragraphs of this story. But it's clear that I don't have
to, isn't it? Apparently, some people don't believe what their eyes
tell them; they believe what their minds tell them. See one man
chase his coach on TV and he's emotional; hear about another man
chasing and choking his coach and he is a thug, a menace, a
monster. One guy attempted to hurt his coach and one guy connected,
so that makes it different?
</P>
<P>
   This is not about race cards because, quite honestly, race cards
don't exist. There is no casino where a disenfranchised brother or
sister throws down an ace and says, ``Ha! Race card, you suckers. I
win!'' If the so-called race card were such a trump, there would be
no need for this conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Both Greene and Sprewell attacked their coaches. Excuses were
made for one while the other was and is demonized. Their stories
are the same. Many can't see that. Same old story.
</P>

PARITY LINE IN THE EAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With all the excitement generated by the tight AFC East race,
Matt Millen has three words _ St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' the Fox commentator said. ``The Rams have
to be saying to themselves that they could be the champs if they
were in the AFC East.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams have beaten the Jets, Dolphins, and Patriots, and they
symbolize, at least in Millen's mind, the nature of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now anybody can beat anybody,'' he said. ``First of all,
there are no dominant defenses out there, certainly not like the
1985 Bears. In addition, no one has a totally dominating offense.
Everybody has holes. Even Denver. For example, you can say that
Denver has a better team than the Jets. But you can't say with 100
percent certainty that the Jets can't beat Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Millen will be the analyst for Fox's Patriots-49ers telecast at
Foxboro Stadium Sunday at 1 p.m. He doesn't rule out a Patriots
victory, arguing that backup quarterback Scott Zolak is bound to do
better than his one-play-one-fumble performance against the Rams
and that running back Robert Edwards has the ability to control a
game if given the chance.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots also are unpredictable, and Millen says the
cause is free agency. ``I know the NFL and the union don't like to
hear it, but teams nowadays have to protect a core group of guys,''
he said. ``Back in the old days, teams had a core but were able to
build on that core. Great teams are not made solely with great
players but with supporting people who know each other and play
well together. That is when a team can become really good. But now
a supporting player on one team can become a starter somewhere
else. It leaves teams in a state of flux and it's terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Millen called the Patriots-Falcons game earlier this year.
``They got blown out early, so it really wasn't a good example of
the Patriots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The former Raiders and 49ers linebacker said injured quarterback
Drew Bledsoe has made big strides this season, especially after
engineering last-minute drives to beat the Bills and Dolphins. ``He
has put on his big boy pants,'' Millen said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's Beasley Reece called the Patriots-Rams game last week and
said he is unsure whether New England can pull it together to win
its last two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked horrible against the Rams,'' Reece said. ``But now
it's not a question of performance or effort. It's a question of
injuries. The Patriots could be a team that shot all of its bullets
a few weeks ago. They can't stay in the race unless they are
shooting with a full arsenal of talent. And right now the Patriots
are a very good football team limping into the critical period.''

   Fox stands to gain about $93 million in advertising revenues
from the Super Bowl. The network has sold all but four of the 58
available 30-second spots for the annual ratings bonanza, to be
played Jan. 31 in Miami. Despite the 23 percent increase over last
year's price, advertisers have lined up to pay an average of $1.6
million a spot. Some have paid as much as $2 million to secure
prime exposure. For Fox, which pays the NFL about $550 million a
year to broadcast NFC games, the $93 million does not include
revenues from ads run during the pregame, halftime, and postgame
shows . . . Fox's local affiliate, Channel 25, will have a
``Patriots Fifth Quarter'' show after its telecast of Sunday's
game. Steve Grogan and Jeff Cawley will be in the studio, while Bob
Halloran will work from Foxboro Stadium. At 10:30, Channel 25's
``Sports Sunday'' will feature Patriots defensive tackle Chad Eaton
. . . HBO will present the bout between Floyd Mayweather Jr. (18-0,
14 knockouts) and Angel Manfredy (25-2-1, 20 KOs) Saturday night at
9:45. Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant, and Roy Jones Jr. will be at
ringside for the collision of 130-pounders. The undercard pits
heavyweights David Tua (32-1, 27 KOs) and Hasim Rahman.

DECEMBER: THE A-10'S CRUELEST MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's going on in the Atlantic 10? The conference that had four
teams in the preseason Top 20 now has none. No team in the league
is more than two games above .500, and Fordham, of all teams, has
the best record in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   More important, all of the supposed power teams _ Rhode Island,
Temple, Massachusetts, Xavier _ all struggling, none so more than
UMass, which is 2-5 and needs a major push to get back to .500,
much less in the Top 20.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not going to get any easier or better for the Atantic
10.
</P>
<P>
   December is when teams solidify their reputations and power
rankings for the season. Traditionally, teams from powerful
conferences fatten up on nonconference opponents in December,
allowing some leeway for losses when the league races begin in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The argument used is that our conference is so tough, the losses
are quality losses.
</P>
<P>
   And that works when you are talking about the Atlantic Coast
Conference, where losses to Duke, North Carolina, or Maryland will
not hurt; or the Southeastern Conference, where losing to teams
such as Kentucky and Arkansas and in recent years South Carolina
also will not be fatal to NCAA tournament hopes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Atlantic 10 may be in trouble this season. If everyone
goes into the conference season with a slightly better than .500
record, what value will a win or a loss against UMass or Temple
have when March arrives?
</P>
<P>
   This does not diminish the quality of either team, which should
improve if the preseason prognostications are correct, but it could
and probably will hurt when the 64-team NCAA field is being
discussed by the selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   For now, one of two reasons would seem to explain the Atlantic
10's drop in status. Either the teams were vastly overrated or they
are all having very slow starts.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line also seems clear: The uneven play in December
will cost the Atlantic 10 in March when only three or four teams
make the NCAA tournament instead of the five or six the conference
had hoped for at the start of the season. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A coup for Dartmouth &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina at Dartmouth Saturday? How did this happen? Word
has it that it developed as a Carolina recruiting ploy when the Tar
Heels were after Winchendon School's Randell Jackson a few years
ago. One of the favorite tricks of then Carolina coach Dean Smith
(among others) was to schedule a nonconference game in a recruit's
home area, allowing his family and friends an opportunity to see
him play at least once during his career. Only problem is that
Jackson went to Florida State. Carolina, which hosted Dartmouth
three years ago, now is simply fulfilling the second part of the
home-and-home deal. Needless to say, it gives New England fans a
rare opportunity to see The Tar Heels . . . Is the Big East back?
Consider. Syracuse and Pittsburgh are 0-2 in league play but ranked
in the Top 25. St. John's has its highest ranking (15) since
December 1991 . . . If you look at the Big East standings now,
you'll see Rutgers, St. John's, Seton Hall, and Connecticut at the
top. Those were the four bottom seeds in the 1997 Big East
tournament . . . Individual scoring has not been a big factor in
Big East play this season. Villanova is a surprising 8-2, but the
Wildcats have had a player score more than 20 points twice. In
UConn's tough victories over Pitt and UMass, no Huskie scored as
many as 15 points . . . Scheduling a game on the Saturday before
Christmas involving two bad teams is no way to attract fans, but
Boston College athletic director Gene DeFilippo has a visit from
Holy Cross on tap Saturday. The crowds at Conte Forum have been
sparse all year despite a season ticket base of more than 5,000,
and don't expect a great gathering for Saturday's match between two
of the worst teams in Division 1 (according to the Sagarain
rankings, at least). DeFilippo's take on the game: ``With a lot of
Christmaas and holiday parties on Saturday night, we figured this
might be a good opporunity for a dad to take his kids to a game in
the afternoon before going out on Saturday night with Mom, or just
a good family opportunity to get together at a college basketball
game.'' With the BC students on holiday break, the Eagles need
someone to show up.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing wealth &QL;

   Local basketball guru Ted Sarandis is pushing an expansion of
the Commonwealth Classic next year when it returns to the
FleetCenter. He wants to make it a doubleheader _ UMass vs. BC and
UConn vs. URI _ in the equivalent of a New England college
basketball Beanpot Tournament. Maybe you could call it the Red
Auerbach Classic, says Sarandis, who is the loudest supporter for
college basketball in the area. Makes sense to me. Having UConn
would guarantee fans, and UMass, BC, and Rhode Island could bring
enough people to create a near sellout. The only thing missing
would be sensible ticket costs. The tickets for last week's
BC-UMass game at the Worcester Centrum started at $22. That should
be the maximum for the FleetCenter next year. Even if some tickets
are scaled down to $10, it's better to have a full house at lower
prices than an empty one at outrageous prices . . . Rutgers is 7-1
going into Saturday's game against Temple. In 92 seasons of
basketball, no other Rutgers team has had seven victories this
early . . . College basketball is experiencing a revival in
Chicago. With Michael Jordan and the Bulls idle, DePaul, which is
off to a quick start under new coach Pat Kennedy, Illinois-Chicago,
and even Chicago State all show signs of life. Chicago State, which
has had only two winning seasons since upgrading to Division 1
status in 1984-85, is relying on new coach Bo Ellis, the former
Marquette star, to show it the way. It will be a tough journey,
since Chicago Sate won a total of eight games in the last three
years. It lost five of its first six this season, but the interest
level is up. In their opening home game against Loyola-Chicago, the
Cougars, who play in 2,500-seat Jacoby Dickens Athletic Center,
drew a crowd of 2,514, only 312 short of their total home
attendance last season . . . Next week's Jimmy V Classic featuring
South Carolina-Purdue and Duke-Kentucky has become the toughest
regular-season ticket in the history of the Meadowlands. The Big
Ten has two Top 10 teams and six teams that are ranked . . . Purdue
coach Gene Keady on one reason he loves his job: ``I love watching
Big Ten football.''

EAGLES LIKE TO ATTACK ON LAND

<P>
   Western Illinois held ``Amazin'' Adrian Peterson, who had rushed
for 200 or more yards six times this season, to 102 in its NCAA
Division 1-AA semifinal last weekend at Georgia Southern.
</P>
<P>
   Only one problem.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles quarterback Greg Hill went to work, firing four touchdown
passes, including a back-breaking 11-yarder to slotback Corey
Joyner that gave Georgia Southern a 21-8 lead with 17 seconds left
in the first half. The Eagles went on to a 42-14 rout of Western
Illinois, a team that came into the game with the No. 1 defense in
Division 1-AA.
</P>
<P>
   Citadel coach Don Powers and his staff also know all too well
about Georgia Southern's explosiveness. Powers's team held a 27-10
lead at home in the third quarter after scoring on a fake punt. The
Citadel had the momentum and a whipped-up crowd of nearly 15,000
hoping for the upset.
</P>
<P>
   Final score: Georgia Southern, 51, Citadel, 34.
</P>
<P>
   Held to 49 rushing yards in the first half, the Eagles rolled
for 303 in the second. Fullback Peterson scored a school-record
five touchdowns and rushed for 231 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a very special back in Adrian Peterson,'' said
Powers of the team that will take on the University of
Massachusetts Saturday in Chattanooga, Tenn., for the national
title. ``He has the ability to take control of a game, and that's
what he did against us. With their option game, they always seem to
find a way to reduce it to a one-on-one ratio (runner to tackler),
and with a back of his quality, you need more than that one man to
stop him defensively, especially if he has space to his right or
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``But their offensive line may be the most overlooked portion of
their program. They're experienced, they've got more than one
All-American there, and they're probably the best offensive line in
1-AA in the country. To beat that team, your offense has to control
the ball, because if Southern plays with the ball long enough, bad
things will happen to the best of defenses. And you've got to play
great assignment, gap-control defense.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Western Carolina, coached by Bill Bleil, did for
most of its game _ but lost in crunch time, 28-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to play great defense, and by that, I mean try to
hold them to 28 or 30 points and try to outscore them, because
teams can throw the ball and move on them,'' said Bleil.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Georgia Southern has won the last 28 games in
which it has outgained its opponents on the ground. One need only
glance at the statistics sheet from their perfect season (14-0) and
look at two lines _ 384.9 yards per game rushing, 113.4 passing _
for a quick education about the Eagles' offense.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst is Peterson, the redshirt freshman who has amassed
2,445 yards and 32 touchdowns on 337 carries (7.3 yards per carry),
shattering school records for yards and touchdowns in a season.
Peterson isn't the only concern for the UMass defense. Hill, a
junior, ran for 22 touchdowns and passed for 10. And, said Bleil,
``they do a lot of things out of their Wing-T. Defensively, you
have to take their fullback out of it, but Western Illinois put an
extra man up front to try that and they got burned by the pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for UMass's defense?
</P>
<P>
   Said Bleil, ``You're simply not going to stop all three
components of their offense, Peterson, Hill, and a couple of their
slot guys (Joyner, who caught three TD passes last week, and Bennie
Cunningham). Heck, on fourth and 2, you might as well give them the
first down.''
</P>
<P>
   When Furman took it on the chin, 45-17, Peterson picked up 183
yards, but he wasn't the top ground-gainer. Hill, who has rushed
for more than 1,300 yards this season, picked up 222.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity for UMass's offense?
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, people have been able to score on them this
year,'' said Bleil. ``They don't take many chances defensively.
They'll kind of try to slow the pace down on defense because they
know their offense will score.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles own the second-ranked total offense and rushing
offense in Division 1-AA. Let them into your red zone and you've
got serious problems. The Eagles have crossed their opponents'
20-yard line 64 times this season and have scored on 60 of those
possessions, a whopping 93.8 percent success rate. When they cross
midfield, they've scored on 83 of 114 trips, a 72.8 percent success
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hamilton, whose East Tennessee State team was racked for
334 rushing yards in the first half of a 47-26 loss to Georgia
Southern, coached against current Eagles coach Paul Johnson when
Hamilton was at Air Force and Johnson was at Hawaii and Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing to do against Georgia Southern is contain
their offense,'' he said. ``Their personnel really fit into it,
especially Peterson and Hill. If you beat them, you'll just have to
outscore them. We had success against them offensively by mixing
our attack, and if UMass can do that, they have a chance. But it
would probably wind up as a scoring contest. Paul and I have
coached against each other in some barn-burners. We're good
friends, and I have to say he's matched speed and athleticism to an
outstanding scheme that he has great knowledge of.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of players like freshman free safety Arkee
Thompson, a former basketball player who has eight interceptions
and a team-leading 140 tackles; senior defensive ends Benjy Harris
and Eric Davis, who has 14 quarterback sacks; and junior tackle
Voncellies Allen, the key to its defensive line, Georgia Southern's
defense can be vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can throw the football, which UMass can do, and mix up
your plays and get into the fourth quarter of a close game, you've
got a chance,'' said Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles rank 37th nationally in total defense, allowing an
average of 323.9 yards per game. And while Georgia Southern has
exploded for 47.7 points per game in the playoffs, averaging 519
yards in victories over Colgate, Connecticut, and Western Illinois,
it has surrendered an average of 404.3 yards per playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your defense has to try and match up speedwise with their
offense,'' said South Florida coach Jim Leavitt, whose team also
gave the Eagles a battle before losing, 28-23, ``and you'd probably
want them to be throwing the ball instead of running it. The other
half of having any chance against them is to keep the ball away
from their offense. You have to be able to either run the ball on
them or control the ball through a short passing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And playing at a neutral field could also help UMass.''

   Here's the only way I go to Atlantic City for that NBA fiasco
they're planning Saturday: Da Boss says, ``Get your butt down there
or start consulting the Help Wanteds.'' Las Vegas? AC? Hey, fellas,
let me spell it for you: c-l-u-e-l-e-s-s.
</P>
<P>
   International Olympic Committee poobah Juan Antonio Samaranch
says he'd consider expelling bribe-taking members. His copy of
``Casablanca'' is in the overnight mail (``Gambling? I'm

</P>
<P>
   And speaking of the Huskies _ male and female _ it is very
difficult to conceive of Storrs, Conn., as the basketball capital
of the known amateur basketball world. What hath Jim and Geno

   Plus Ca Change, Etc. Dept.: The Tuna gets a journalistic kiss in
Sports Illustrated and then whines because he's on the (supposedly

say the man can't coach.

   Kevin Greene's Sprewellian attack on assistant coach Kevin

<P>
   Alfonseca, Counsell, Floyd, and Hernandez? No, it's not a

</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe-Rick Mirer was one thing, but early returns suggest
that the Peyton Manning-Ryan Leaf gap may be the most important 1

</P>
<P>
   As a child of the '50s, I am, as Don King would say, shocked and
chagrined to learn that neither Joe ``The Jet'' Perry nor
``Hurryin' '' Hugh McElhenny ever gained as many yards in a 49ers
game as Garrison Hearst did against the Lions last Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Next I suppose you're gonna tell me somebody's going to hit 62
home runs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dunleavy can tell us that kid of his heading to Duke is a
more talented player than he ever was, but no way he's going to
convince me he's a smarter player unless he shows me the basketball
equivalent of a MENSA certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, suppose they had gone ahead and restored instant replay
for the playoffs. Who was going to make it right for the Bills, who
ought to be 10-4, a game ahead of the Jets?
</P>
<P>
   You simply cannot say this too many times: If even one-fourth of
all American professional team sport athletes had half the standup
class and dignity of Dennis Eckersley, the sports world would be a
thoroughly pleasurable place to inhabit, rather than the
suspicious, hostile, and adversarial war zone it has become. And
Tim Naehring makes two.
</P>
<P>
   Using two hockey refs has always made sense to me, but just
remember that one great anything is far preferable to any number of
mediocre officials.
</P>
<P>
   Let me guess. Kevin Brown will average $15 million for the next
seven years, but I bet there's some sort of bonus if he manages to
make an All-Star team or two. How's about he kicks back half a mil
if he (itals)doesn't(unitals) make the team?
</P>
<P>
   Attention, Fenway area neighborhood activists: The ballpark was
there long before you were. Deal with it. (See Samaranch reference

   Go ahead. (itals)You(unitals) pick against Jackie Parker in the

`BIRD ISLAND' LEAVES TOO MANY STONES UNTURNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``The Island on Bird Street,'' a movie about a
boy who survives on his own for week after week in the ruined shell
of the Warsaw Ghetto, is maddeningly true to its hero.
</P>
<P>
   Everything in the film _ every single thing _ is seen through
the eyes of 11-year-old Alex, played by newcomer Jordan Kiziuk.
When Alex's everyday life is tedious _ and it is very tedious at
times _ the movie is also tedious. When Alex is confused, the movie
is confused. When Alex is awkward, the movie is awkward.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with the acting. Kiziuk, who received a
special mention at last year's Berlin Film Festival, is
outstanding. So are Patrick Bergin as his father, Jack Warden as
his uncle, Simon Gregor as a wounded resistance fighter, and every
other actor on the screen. The direction by Soren Kragh-Jacobsen is
solid. The music, by Zbigniew Preisner, won a Silver Bear at the
Berlin Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Island on Bird Street,'' a Danish-German-British project,
suffers from a decision to film in color and have everyone speak
English. Black and white would have served the movie better, and
the clash of accents, from Warden's flat American to Kuziuk's
Oxford English to a mishmash of European voices, is distracting. To
make up for extended dead periods, the movie also loads up with
false suspense, those patented scenes where soldiers stare and
stare at a hiding place before turning away.
</P>
<P>
   But the real problem with ``The Island on Bird Street'' lies
with the screenplay, adapted from Uri Orlev's semi-autobiographical
novel of a boy trying to survive in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto
during World War II. Screenwriters John Goldsmith and Tony Grisoni
give you a constant barrage of Alex while brushing past other
characters in the film, leaving one unanswered question after
another.
</P>
<P>
   During a Nazi sweep of the ghetto, Alex's father is taken away,
but not before telling his son to ``stay put. I shall come back for
you.'' Alex takes that order to heart, burrowing into an
underground bunker, grabbing food and water where he can, talking
at length with his pet white mouse, reading and rereading his copy
of ``Robinson Crusoe'' and finally setting up a loft in one of the
ruined houses _ a loft where he watches while Jews are rounded up
for the camps, only yards away from the bustle of Warsaw on the
other side of the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Alex monitors Warsaw beyond the ghetto, looking on from his loft
to see a doctor at a chess table, alone, or a girl staring out her
window, or children playing among the rubble. He takes care of a
wounded man for more than a week, finding enough money and enough
courage to cross the street and ask the doctor for help. But the
movie isn't really interested in these other people _ it's only
interested in Alex.
</P>
<P>
   Would you like to know if the doctor crosses into the ghetto
because of that roll of money or his own sense of decency? The
movie won't tell you. Would you like to know why Alex stops
appearing at a regular rendezvous with a girl who is taking a risk
to be with him? The movie is silent on that score. Would you like
Alex to say, in his own words, why he'll stay behind in the ruins
of the ghetto rather than accept an offer to escape to the country?
He won't.
</P>
<P>
   In a final double-cross, the ending demands a massive leap of
faith from the audience without offering a reason why people should
make that leap. It wants to transcend the Nazi terror without
talking about how it could happen. Like everything else in ``The
Island on Bird Street,'' the ending leaves the audience to fend for
itself _ to come up with its own answers to what goes on beyond the
walls, trying to grasp the world outside the singular mind of an
11-year-old boy.

UMAS STRIVES TO AVOID FLASHBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ Judging from its success this season, you
would never know that the University of Massachusetts football team
is still being harassed by demons of last year's dreadful 2-9
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen's dramatic turnaround, culminating with Saturday's
NCAA Division 1-AA championship game against unbeaten Georgia
Southern, shows they're is not paralyzed by memories of troubles
past.
</P>
<P>
   Haunted is more like it. For all their unprecedented success,
all the records set, all the obstacles scaled, and all the memories
achieved with arguably the most successful season in school
history, UMass (11-3) still often struggles to put 1997 behind it.
When things have gone well this season, players have become
complacent. When mistakes occur, frustrations have set in.
</P>
<P>
   Both situations sometimes prompt players unaccustomed to such
success as a team to revive last season's bad habits _ not enough
to hurt their cause, but enough to make things often more difficult
than they should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes things go wrong on a play, and then when we go back
into the huddle, people start blaming other people, and that's the
same thing that happened last year,'' said senior tight end Kerry
Taylor, a cocaptain. ``But then (fullback) Matt Jordan or
(quarterback) Todd Bankhead will step up and then someone will say,
`Listen, we're still winning.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I don't know if the offense even scored 200 points
all year and I know the defense gave up tons of points. So when the
offense goes out and explodes for big plays and the defense makes a
stop, sometimes we're overwhelmed with what just happened. Then we
relax and then we see the other team make a comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the reasons first-year coach Mark Whipple continues
to put pressure on the Minutemen, convinced that not doing so often
leads to such problems. Whipple's relentlessness is a primary
reason a team which lost 10-point leads five times this season and
suffered at least three turnovers in 11 outings has weathered
adversities and still believes it can reach the pinnacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as coaches have to coach them hard,'' said Whipple. ``I'm
worried about everything, every day of the week. We sit in meetings
that can't let these guys get away with anything. And we have to be
on them all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with 58 seconds left in last Saturday's 41-31 semifinal win
over Northwestern (La.) State. Whipple was doused with Gatorade at
that time, and he let everyone know he wasn't pleased, that the
game was far from over. ``Knowing (Northwestern State), I know
anything can happen,'' he said. ``They could have gotten 21 points
on them with their skill. Not until nine seconds left did I feel
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to change anything we've done. We will stay
hard on them all the time, in meetings and practice. I think even
more so now, because that's a natural tendency for humans, when
they're doing well and everyone is patting you on your back, to
slip back into bad habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was hired, I told the kids our ultimate goal was to win
the championship. They were kind of like kids at Christmas, very
eager, wanting to come in and meet, and really worked very hard.
But I don't know if they knew how hard they had to work or the
demands we were going to put on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a couple of weeks, that excitement wore off, and some
guys left the program. But the guys like Khari (Samuel, another
cocaptain) and Kerry knew what it was about, stayed, and I just saw
them get better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is it so difficult for a team which set a school record
for victories to put last year behind it? Because it was the worst
season for a Minuteman team this century. It included lopsided
defeats, bickering, and infighting. And players say that what made
it frustrating was that they knew they had the talent to do what
they've done this season all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we were always looking for answers,'' said senior
linebacker Samuel. ``This year we come out. We're explosive. We'll
put up two or three touchdowns first, and then it's as if maybe we
relax a bit and play comfortable. That is why I like it in those
situations'' when UMass enters as the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple said UMass will have to play its best game of the season
to beat Georgia Southern, whose option offense and speedy defense
have earned it three playoff victories by an average of 24 points.
That includes a 52-20 second-round victory over Connecticut, which
edged the Minutemen twice this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're mistake-free, then we'll win the game,'' said
Whipple. ``But on the other hand, with football, with that many
plays, you're going to make mistakes, and how do you handle them?
What this team has done so well all year is handle the adversity
and use that as a motivation, not a negative.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was voted to the 1-AA Coaches All-America Team and Samuel
was voted to the Associated Press All-America team. ``It's pretty
special; I didn't expect it to happen,'' said Taylor. ``I thank my
players because they've made me a better player, and it will feel a
lot better if we win (Saturday).'' . . . With the success teams
like Georgia Southern have had in recent years with the option,
it's a wonder why the offense _ once one of the most popular in
college football _ hasn't made more of a comeback. ``I think that,
in all honesty, I'm not sure a lot of people understand it,'' said
Georgia Southern coach Paul Johnson. ``I think football goes in
trends. It went from where everyone runs some option to the West
Coast offense, wherever that is. Now I think it's going back to
where everyone's running some option.'' But don't expect UMass to
follow the trend. ``I know why I don't run it. I ran it in college
and I got my butt kicked all the time,'' said Whipple, a former
quarterback at Brown. ``I got two bad knees and two bad shoulders
because of it.'' Georgia Southern will be the first option team
UMass has faced this season . . . Expect Saturday's game to have a
Georgia Southern flavor. Johnson said Thursday the school has
already sold 8,000 tickets and added, ``We should have at least
10,000 people here.''

has ruled out injecting any public money. By Mark Landler.

MINORITY OWNERSHIP LAGS IN FAST-FOOD INDUSTRY

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The fast-food industry is sizzling with talk of
emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   These hotbeds of opportunity are not in Brazil, Thailand or
Poland. They are minority neighborhoods in urban America, according
to the International Franchise Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest jewel we have left untouched in the U.S. is the
inner cities,'' said Michael Seid, managing director of Michael
Seid &AMP; Associates, a West Hartford, Conn., consulting firm that
specializes in franchising and works with the franchise
association.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean that minority ownership of fast-food
franchises is growing in kind.
</P>
<P>
   While fast-food companies have programs designed to back up
ethnic marketing campaigns with more diverse ownership of
franchises, significant gains in minority ownership of franchises
are hard to document.
</P>
<P>
   The largest fast-food restaurant chains have been adding
minority owners, but the percentage of minority ownership is about
half what it is in the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, minorities were stuck with older restaurants in
less-profitable locations. Failing equipment, heightened security
problems and lack of good help cut into their profits.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring how big a share of the fast-food franchise business is
held by blacks, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans is difficult
to document.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Women in Franchising, a Chicago consultant that helps
women and minorities slide into franchising, estimates that 10
percent of all franchise units _ a figure that includes more than
just fast food _ are minority-owned, and that proportion remains
flat.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Census Bureau figures indicate blacks, Asians, Native
Americans and Hispanics are 29 percent of the U.S. population and
growing.
</P>
<P>
   The International Franchise Association doesn't keep statistics
on minority ownership of franchises _ referring callers to the
individual companies _ and neither does the U.S. Small Business
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Kezios, president of Women in Franchising, said that this
omission is telling. Kezios thinks the fast-food industry's
commitment to diversity trails far behind other concerns. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The reason, Seid said, is that the fast-food companies pay more
attention to the color of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason franchise companies are going into inner cities is
pure economics. There's a need for it,'' Seid said. ``I'm not so
naive to think that franchisers are running around thinking, `I've
got to increase minority ownership by 10 percent this year.' They
don't care. They're colorblind, and that's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Franchising is like a professional sports team:
They're picking the best people they can get.''
</P>
<P>
   From the fast-food company's point of view, its future depends
on the management skill and financial strength of its operators.
Franchise owners are the ones who innovate and make their
restaurant a part of the community. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; A lawsuit filed recently in Houston by an angry Wendy's
franchisee shows how race can still become an issue in this
business.
</P>
<P>
   Theldon Branch, an African-American businessman who owns three
Wendy's restaurants, sued the No. 3 hamburger chain in U.S.
District Court in Houston on Oct. 22, alleging racial
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   His lawsuit says Wendy's refused to sell him existing locations
because he is black. The company wanted him to build new stores _
which is a much more expensive proposition _ then sold the stores
he wanted to a white owner. Branch is trying to have his suit
certified as a class action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wendy's denies this allegation,'' said Houston lawyer Gene
Locke, who has been retained by Wendy's. ``This is really a dispute
between Wendy's and one franchisee who wanted to buy additional
stores in the Houston area. Wendy's made a business decision to
sell those stores to other people who met the business criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy's response to the lawsuit says that Branch bounced checks
to the company and did not demonstrate the financial strength
needed to get more restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Of Wendy's 3,717 franchised U.S. restaurants, 262 are
minority-owned. Sixty-seven _ 13.4 percent _ of its 499 franchise
owners are minorities, and 26 are African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy's said it has stepped up its diversification efforts this
year. Five new minority franchisees joined the company in 1998, and
the company awarded more stores to minorities already in the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Such programs run up against corporate pressures peculiar to
franchising that stack the odds against new store owners, said Tim
Bates, a professor of labor and urban affairs at Wayne State
University in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real opportunities go to insiders,'' Bates said. Behind
every fast-food restaurant are some powerful operators owning a
large number of locations.
</P>
<P>
   Because they understand the business and have a proven track
record, these players often get the first crack at new locations.
``If they pass, what does that say about the opportunity?''
</P>
<P>
   But there are several minority franchisees in Houston showing a
well-heeled minority investor can get into this business in a big
way.
</P>
<P>
   With 32 Taco Bell restaurants throughout the Houston area, Shawn
Taylor, a former Arthur Andersen &AMP; Co. consultant and an African
American, has become co-owner of the largest Taco Bell franchise in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and his business partner, Duni Hebron, a former Taco Bell
market manager, started Family Eats two years ago with 19 stores.
It's a lucrative business that gives them the chance to create
opportunity for others in all sorts of neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us an opportunity as African Americans to create 30
jobs (per store) that today don't exist in those communities, of
which several of those jobs will be salaried positions with
bonuses, health insurance, retirement plans, you name it. And a
fringe benefit is that we are minorities going in and building a
successful business in those communities. You become role models.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fast-food franchises say having more minority-owned restaurants
at a time when patrons are increasingly diverse makes good business
sense.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a limited number of people who are likely owners in
a business where opening a big-name fast-food restaurant such as
Burger King can cost between $300,000 and $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Companies emphasize how they work to support new &UR;  &LR; operators
within the system _ which can help minority entrepreneurs _ but the
money is still a barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies will reduce the upfront cost by starting owners
off with a lower-cost kiosk location, leasing a restaurant, or
allowing them to use a low down payment to buy an existing
restaurant. But some analysts caution that financing programs can
carry expensive terms and carrying a heavy debt can make business
precarious.
</P>
<P>
   This savagely competitive franchise industry has moved into new
territory.
</P>
<P>
   The industry recently began to see the opportunity in inner
cities after many suburban strips became so overpopulated with fast
food that restaurants began to cannibalize each other's business.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the fast-food industry has underestimated the
potential of lower-income areas. But as urban areas have begun to
revive, the industry realized that these neighborhoods are more
densely populated than the suburbs and are served by fewer nearby
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   While residents in these areas have lower incomes on average,
they spend a higher proportion of their earnings eating out. These
families often see a meal out at a fast-food restaurant as a treat.
</P>
<P>
   As the restaurant chains change their view of the cities, groups
that once were known for championing civil rights issues are now
pushing to be sure minorities share in the profits.
</P>
<P>
   They see franchises as important business opportunities because
the franchises have a higher rate of success than independent
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH coalition, which works with Burger
King on diversity issues, reasons that since African Americans are
20 percent of a chain's customer base, they should own 20 percent
of that chain's restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The National Urban League sees opportunity for economic
advancement in franchising, and devoted its national economic
development summit last spring to franchise opportunities for
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   All of the major fast-food companies have diversity programs,
and strive to support owners in different ways. Burger King
committed in 1994 to increasing minority ownership of its
restaurants by one percentage point a year.
</P>
<P>
   Taco Bell seeks out a small number of strong owners who are
capable of managing a large number of restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy's participates in the IFA's Franchise Trade Delegation
Program _ a venture that seeks to drum up new franchise owners in
emerging market areas of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the company with the most aggressive program is
Atlanta-based AFC Enterprises, whose ownership of the Popeye's
Chicken and Churchs Chicken chains makes it the No. 2 fast-food
chicken chain.
</P>
<P>
   Theldon Branch's wife, Ester Branch, is opening 10 Churchs
Chicken stores because they're profitable and hospitable to African
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary difference over at Churchs is that diversity is
more than just a buzzword,'' Theldon Branch said.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 37 percent of AFC's franchised restaurants are owned
by minorities because of the company's active recruitment efforts
at historically black colleges and in black newspapers and business
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   To make opening a store as affordable as possible, AFC seeks out
prospective franchisees who can use government programs that
encourage investments in low-income neighborhoods to reduce the
start-up costs.
</P>
<P>
   They are encouraged to open restaurants in existing buildings,
which may halve the cost of starting up. AFC refers candidates to
its strategic partner, Banco Popular, for financing. Based in
Puerto Rico, Banco Popular operates in six states with large
Hispanic populations and is a top SBA lender to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The company also assigns a business consultant to work with each
prospective franchisee on starting the store, and that consultant
remains the franchisee's permanent resource within the company.
</P>
<P>
   Seid, the business consultant, said AFC's strategy of diversity
is paying off. ``AFC dominates in some markets because KFC didn't
get into it early,'' he said. ``It has benefited them tremendously.
They have a diverse franchise base; they tailor their products.''
</P>
<P>
   AFC tries to reach blacks, Hispanics and whites in equal
proportion and targets its advertisements accordingly. One campaign
featured gospel singer Kirk Franklin, who became so enthusiastic
about Churchs, he opened 12 of them after doing the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Hartman, AFC vice president for corporate communications,
said diverse ownership also reinforces the marketing campaign.
``They see people who look and are like them in the restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   That point raises a thorny question for those pushing for more
minorities in the business. Strategies to tap emerging markets
can't be so zealous as to limit the franchisees' choice of store
location based on their race or ethnicity, according to Robert
Zarco, a Miami franchisee attorney. ``That's redlining if you have
a black operator and you put them in a black neighborhood instead
of in a white suburban neighborhood.''

   IMPEACH-SCENE _ WASHINGTON _ History humbug! That was the
prevailing attitude of ordinary Americans touring the Capitol as
the House debated impeachment Friday. The scene of members reciting
their now-familiar arguments to a mostly empty chamber did not live
up to most visitor's expectations of the solemn occasion. But
elsewhere on Capitol Hill, in the hallways and offices of

   CAMPAIGN-MONEY _ WASHINGTON _ Any candidate who wants to win
either major-party presidential nomination in 2000 will have to
raise $22 million to $25 million in 1999, leading campaign finance
experts tell us. That's more than $60,000 a day, 7 days a week. And
that's just the so-called ``hard'' money. Enforcement of federal
limits has become so haphazard that another expert says he can't
even guess at how much unregulated ``soft'' money will be raised
and spent. An explainer of why candidates must raise so much so
early, what the money is spent for, and which candidates are
favored in what pundits call ``the invisible primary.'' (Mollison,

<P>
   US-IRAQ _ BAGHDAD or WASHINGTON _ American and British bombers
began a third day of bombings amid indications that the U.S.
strategy is to remove Saddam Hussein by turning his military and
security forces against him. U.S. aircraft dropped leaflets in
southern Iraq warning Iraqi forces there that they will be targeted
if they try to attack neighboring Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, but will
be spared if they stay in their bases. Meanwhile, the Pentagon said
it is widening its list of targets. Developing. (Deans/Kaplow, Cox

   IRAQ-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin was
joined by leaders from across the country Friday in denouncing the
U.S. and British attacks on Iraq and demanded an immediate halt to
the campaign. Top military leaders warned that Russia's relations
with the United States and the West may be seriously damaged by the
U.S. attack on Iraq, wiping out years of progress since the end of
the Cold War. And the Foreign Ministry said it had recalled
Russia's ambassador to Britain for urgent consultations -- a day

Washington. Developing. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   MILITARY-WOMEN _ WASHINGTON _ Seven years after the U.S. Senate
lifted a 43-year-old ban on female pilots in combat, several women

THIS ROMANTIC COMEDY LASTS TOO LONG FOR COMFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' has two absolutely beguiling stars in Tom
Hanks and Meg Ryan, a clever, straight-from-the-news premise, and
New York's Upper West Side at Christmas time. That's a lot for any
movie to have going for it.
</P>
<P>
   But what it also has is too many minutes _ 115 of them. In my
book, no romantic comedy should ever be more than 90 minutes. At
two hours, the froth on the comedy starts to dissolve like foam on
a latte left standing all day. At that length, the filmmakers are
either begging a question, sustaining a conflict beyond the
audience's attention span, or too in love with their own movie.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo! When Nora Ephron is in charge _ she is both director and
co-writer with her sister Delia _ these things tend to happen. They
did in ``Sleepless in Seattle,'' another film starring Hanks and
Ryan (potentially one of the screen's most enduring duos) that
failed to realize its merits for the same reason. It took forever
for the couple to meet, and when they finally did, it felt
anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
   But Ephron is nothing if not a woman in tune with popular
culture. Where ``Sleepless in Seattle'' was about Ryan being
attracted to Hanks after hearing him on a radio talk show, now we
have Hanks and Ryan as two e-mail pen pals who don't know that they
know each other in real life. It's a clever premise, since nearly
everyone these days has ``met'' someone this way.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's character, Kathleen Kelly, owns a bookstore that has been
in the family for years, The Shop Around the Corner. This is an
affectionate nod to the classic 1940 comedy by that name starring
Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, and upon which this screenplay
is based. Those characters, however, communicated by snail mail.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks' character, Joe Fox, is scion of a family who runs
enormous bookstore chains (think Borders or Barnes &AMP; Noble). Where
Joe's store offers cappuccinos and huge discounts, Kathleen's
offers children's story time and personal service.
</P>
<P>
   They inadvertently meet, and despite the fact that sparks fly,
eventually she discovers that he is the guy bringing a store into
her neighborhood that could force her out of business. This throws
the proverbial bucket of ice water on their romance.
</P>
<P>
   What she does not discover, however, is that Joe is the dream
man she ``met'' anonymously in an on-line chat room, and she's been
communicating with him daily. As their spite toward each other
grows in real life, so does their affection in their fantasy life _
which includes rules like no names, no specifics, just pure
thoughts and feelings.
</P>
<P>
   For the first third of the film, the premise works splendidly.
You like both of them, you realize they are mismatched with their
significant others, you root for a satisfying solution. But when
Joe finds out that Kathleen is his e-mail dream woman, the movie
starts to go wrong, and too many questions are raised with no good
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing now who Kathleen is, why would Joe continue to put her
out of business? Is he actually a jerk? And if he's a jerk, why
should she kick the hunky Greg Kinnear (whose character is fairly
simpatico) out of bed for him? Why doesn't Joe reveal himself to
her once he finds out the truth?
</P>
<P>
   Because Ephron wants to sustain the tension as long as possible.
Unfortunately, that leads to overlong scenes in which Joe attempts
to woo Kathleen without coming forth with the truth, and eventually
the audience's patience is tried.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, Hanks and Ryan are good as ever _ he of
the potato face and smile you want to fall into, she of the witty
cuteness. Although Ryan is in danger of wearing out her welcome as
America's Sweetheart if she makes one more film in which she (A)
gets the sniffles cutely, or (B) pads around in flannel jammies
cutely, or (C) wrinkles up her nose more than 150 times.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting cast members are also excellent, although the plot
bogs down occasionally with their subplots. Dabney Coleman as Joe's
womanizing father is as dry and soulless as we imagine all moguls
to be, Parker Posey is a breath of fresh air as Joe's Type Triple-A
girlfriend, and Kinnear is a scene-stealer as a vain newspaper
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   If Ephron had been directing someone else's script, she might
have had the objectivity required to lose about 20 minutes worth of
unneeded scenes, or trim some that meander endlessly. As it is, by
the time Joe and Kathleen finally meet in the rose garden for the
long-awaited denouement, we are relieved. But we should have been
thrilled.

FATHOMING THAT COMPLEX CREATURE, WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ My moment of enlightenment happened as I stood at a
railing on the third floor of the Marshall Field department store
here in the Loop recently. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was looking down through the Christmas decorations onto the
first-floor cosmetic counters. There I saw two women sitting on
tall chairs. Other women who worked in the store were applying
makeup to these women as countless Christmas shoppers wandered by. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amazing, I thought. I do not know one male who would subject
himself to such a public spectacle in pursuit of looking better
through chemistry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That, clearly, is one of the primary differences between the
sexes. Try to imagine a man you know _ or even you yourself, if,
like me, you are male _ sitting in a busy department store and
having some clerk brushing here and painting there to improve the
looks of that man. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have seen too much in life to insist it would never happen.
But I have never seen it happen. I did not see it happen in
Marshall Field's store. And I don't expect to see it happen before
I get carted off to the home and equipped with my own drool apron. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've been thinking about the differences between males and
females as the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal has unfolded, including why
it was so easy to believe that the Tripp-Lewinsky conversations,
caught on tape, were real. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I grew up as the only boy in a house full of four children,
which, by my count, means three were sisters. (And to the best of
my recollection, they were.) And I helped rear two daughters and no
sons. So I know some things about women that men without my vast
experience may not appreciate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing I know _ and love _ about women is that they often are
really good at talking with each other about private things.
Somehow women find it helpful and maybe even therapeutic to discuss
with other women their feelings about deeply intimate emotions. I
envy that, though I recognize that I may not be capable of it
because of some genetic structure related to my being male. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Men may be better about engaging in this kind of talk than they
used to be, but as a rule, the level of sharing about such things
among men rarely rises above the level of this question: ``So,
Harvey, tell me: You keeping as busy in the bedroom as you always
want us to believe?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, in turn, is likely to respond: ``You guys only wish you
were a stud like me.'' The next question, with barely time for a
breath, is likely to be: ``Yeah? Well, how about them Denver
Broncos?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's why, when women send daughters out into the world, they
prefer a long weekend together in which they may share private
hopes, dreams and advice. Men, generally, are content to walk a son
to the door as he leaves the nest, pat the kid on the butt and say,
``Go get 'em, Ace.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My own father was even briefer. As I left home permanently in
1967, he walked me out to the 1964 Rambler he had traded me for my
1958 Chevy, looked to see that the tires were full of air, shook my
hand and said, ``Write.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the paper hiring me is paying me to do,'' I said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that, knuckle-head. Write HOME once in a while.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My mother, meanwhile, stood behind him crying. I didn't
understand then why she was crying. But I know now she was upset I
wasn't a daughter who would engage in deep emotional sharing with
her. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This was the same mother who, when I reached the age when I had
quit growing in length and would grow only in breadth, took me to
this same Marshall Field's store in Chicago to buy me a decent
sports coat I could take to college and not embarrass myself if I
had to get semi-dressed up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a deep forest-green, herring-bone coat. All wool. I was
aghast at its cost _ $60 or so, an unimaginable fortune to me in
1963. I loved that jacket so much as an 18-year-old kid that I
wanted to wear it home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So I put it on and went down to Field's first floor cosmetic
counter to see if it would attract women. But they were too busy
getting made up to notice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I should have stood up on the third floor and whistled
down at them. Or told them some day we'd have a president named
Bill and it might be me. (Would that have risen to the level of
impeachable perjury?) &QL;
</P>

READING FACES IS ANOTHER LANGUAGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If you want to look into someone's soul, just take a
close look at his face. According to a self-styled face reader, the
wrinkles, dimples and droops reveal a life of happiness, tragedy
and everything in between.
</P>
<P>
   Eyelids are the barometer of life, said Mac Fulfer, a lawyer
from Fort Worth who taught himself to read faces. Fulfer was in
Houston recently to teach a roomful of human resource managers how
to interpret the lines and bumps on the faces of employees, bosses
and job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The technique is about as scientific as astrology, with phrases
that can be used to describe just about anyone. Nurturing.
Competitive. Focused. Anyone can think of an instance when we can
use those words to define a part of our personality.
</P>
<P>
   Human resource managers were rather skeptical that the lines
between the nose and mouth indicate a strong libido or see deep
personal tragedy in a line that runs from the corner of the mouth
to the chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm apparently a provider because of my wide nostrils,'' said
a professor of communications attending the seminar. ``I find it a
bit difficult to see, but there you are.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman let out a scream when she found her libido line. It's
true, she said.
</P>
<P>
   There are 45 muscles in the face, which can create more than
5,000 facial expressions, Fulfer said. People tend to use the same
patterns over and over again, which tends to shape your face, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Droopy eyelids indicate someone is pushing himself too hard,
said Fulfer. If the lids sag on the left eye, there's too much
intensity in his personal life. A sag on the right eye signals too
much pressure at work.
</P>
<P>
   Both eyes? Watch out, he needs a break, said Fulfer.
</P>
<P>
   Fulfer said he learned to study faces when he was working as a
lawyer because it helped him pick sympathetic juries. He said he
``validated'' his research by setting up a tent at festivals such
as the Rattlesnake Round-up and Octoberfest and offering to read
faces for $5 and later, when he got popular, $10.
</P>
<P>
   He said he read thousands of faces and the feedback that he
received helped him pick up on general traits which he has
chronicled in a book, ``Amazing Face Reading: An Illustrated
Encyclopedia for Reading Faces.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
JOWLS OF POWER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jowls, for example, are a symbol of power, Fulfer said.
President Nixon had them and when he was threatened with
impeachment, they flattened.
</P>
<P>
   Fulfer said that jowls are such a well-recognized symbol of
power that if you ask a bell boy to give a package to ``the
president'' at a convention event, he'll look for the man with the
biggest jowls.
</P>
<P>
   Fulfer offered a tip for women who want power: Don't complain
about the glass ceiling. All you need are jowls _ just look at
Madeleine Albright or Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Face reading works even if someone has had a facelift or plucks
her eyebrows (which, apparently, indicate how a person thinks).
</P>
<P>
   People change appearances based on the environment they're in,
said Fulfer, who recounted a story about a lowly clerk at a bus
company who didn't have much of a chin. After gaining a chin in
plastic surgery _ and therefore, gaining an aura of power and
authority _ people started treating her differently, Fulfer said.
No more meek and mild; she suddenly began moving up and now she is
an executive.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SKEPTICS WEIGH IN
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Webb, personnel officer at the Harris County Appraisal
District, was interested in what face lines can say but isn't
willing to throw out the personal interview, reference checks and
drug screenings when she evaluates job candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The lines apparently change based on stress, said Webb, so lines
that appear on a candidate's face may just be the result of
worrying about the interview or worrying that his parking meter
just expired.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Webb said she went to church the night of Fulfer's
presentation and noticed that everyone has a mouth that turns down.
Maybe everyone in the congregation is skeptical, Webb said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Miller, legendary Houston trial lawyer, said he closely
watches potential jurors but focuses on their head tilts, facial
expressions and mannerisms _ for example, someone who crosses his
arms gives the signal that he's made up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Even with other people watching reactions, it's impossible to
read a jury correctly all the time, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   But looking at wrinkles, nostril size and dimples? You've got to
be kidding, Miller said with a laugh. Facial features are based on
genetics, he said. ``It's so phony.''

Philippine Airlines, Asia's oldest airline, is in desperate shape.
But Philippine Airlines is also the crown jewel in the empire of
Lucio Tan, a tycoon who is a leading supporter of the new president
of the Philippines, Joseph E. Estrada. In the murky world of Asian
business, where friendships often count more than solvency,
Philippine Airlines would seem to be the classic candidate for a

investors to view the Philippines as having a level playing field,
has ruled out injecting any public money. By Mark Landler.

WITH `YOU'VE GOT MAIL,' MEG RYAN CONTINUES HER REIGN AS
GIRL-NEXT-DOOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To be honest, ``You've Got Mail'' isn't a very good movie. It's
predictable and manipulative; it comes across as one big ad for
America Online. Also, it's way too long.
</P>
<P>
   But it does have Meg Ryan. So you'll go.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there's also her co-star, that Tom Hanks guy. (Those
Oscars, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' blah, blah, blah.) And
writer/director Nora Ephron, who wrote the book on romantic
comedies with her triptych of ``When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in
Seattle'' and ``Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   But at its core, ``You've Got Mail'' is all about Meg Ryan, the
reigning practitioner of Movie Star Cute.
</P>
<P>
   If you know anything about this movie _ and you can just hear
the pitch meeting: ``Meg and Tom are secret E-mail pen pals, but
they hate each other in real life!'' _ you know what happens. No,
if you've ever been to a Meg Ryan movie, you know what happens. She
wrinkles her nose; she hovers on the edge of tears, those big blue
eyes almost brimming over; she is sweet to children and just sassy
enough to men. She is terminally, though not insufferably, cute.
</P>
<P>
   We've heard that Meg doesn't like to be called cute. Too bad.
She is what she is. And we're glad she got those ``serious roles''
out of her system. Meg Ryan as a helicopter pilot? Get out. As a
children's bookstore owner? That's more like it.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing at all deep about her appeal, mind you. Cute
isn't deep. That's one of the things we like about her.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing too glamorous about her either. We like that,
too. Here is a movie star who acts like we might if anyone ever
made a movie starring a prettier, thinner us.
</P>
<P>
   She sits around in baggy jammies. (Hey, WE like to sit around in
baggy jammies!) She gets excited about getting E-mail. (Hey, WE get
excited about getting E-mail!) She has a soft spot for Tom Hanks.
(Hey, WE _ well, you're on to us now.)
</P>
<P>
   Men, of course, love her, too _ they are crazy about cute. But
she's one of the few actresses that men love that women like just
as much.
</P>
<P>
   Ephron _ who wrote ``Harry'' (1989), directed ``Sleepless''
(1993) and co-wrote and directed the new ``Mail'' _ understands
this. She told one interviewer, Meg ``has no vanity. The women that
women love are those who don't walk around full of their own
self-love. You know when you see Meg on screen that if you found
yourself next to her, you might become friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is the way our parents felt about Doris Day; really,
that's who she is, with a messier haircut and a slightly sharper
edge. (I don't think Doris Day ever slept with anyone in her
movies, even after marriage. But you have to make some concession
to the '90s.)
</P>
<P>
   And as far as romantic comedies go, particularly the subset
starring Meg Ryan, ``You've Got Mail'' is better than ``Sleepless
in Seattle,'' not as good as ``When Harry Met Sally.'' As if it
really matters.
</P>
<P>
   It's sweet. It's out just in time for Christmas. It's got Meg
Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Save us a seat.
</P>

THEME RESTAURANTS SCARCE IN CITY OF FINE DINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Filed in financial sted lifestyle category.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco, a perennial contender for world's
greatest restaurant city, is short on one kind of restaurant that
has swept over much of the rest of the world: the big-bang,
big-theme, show-biz restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The city _ with 3,400 licensed restaurants, only two of which
are themed _ may not need the theme restaurants that flourish
elsewhere. But the theme concept, starved for visibility and
dedicated to brand-building and related merchandising, needs
prestigious, tourist-rich San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco is central. It's intuitively where we would like
to be,'' said Chris Stephenson, senior vice president of sales and
marketing for House of Blues, a minichain of music clubs with
full-service restaurants and bars, which has yet to expand here.
</P>
<P>
   Theme-restaurants typically cater to tourists hungry for
predictable decor, familiar menus and reasonable prices _ the
average per person bill at the Hard Rock Cafe is $13.50, according
to company executives.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by the San Francisco Convention &AMP; Visitors
Bureau, tourists dropped an average of $34.18 per person per day in
San Francisco's restaurants in the first half of 1998. The bureau
doesn't break out figures for theme restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Only Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood now operate in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1970 in London as the first major theme-restaurant
chain, the Hard Rock, which is based in Orlando, Fla., has 98
restaurants in 34 countries; all feature burgers and barbecue on
the menu, and rock music memorabilia on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Hard Rock Cafe International spent an undisclosed sum renovating
its San Francisco outlet last year. According to Linda Frigerio,
general manager of the San Francisco Hard Rock, the restaurant
lowered seating capacity from 200 to 160 to upgrade its
entertainment system and expand its on-site retail operations.
Frigerio estimates that 300,000 people chowed down in the eatery in
the past year, with another 100,000 stopping by just to buy
T-shirts and other items.
</P>
<P>
   The chief operating officer of the Hard Rock chain, Pete
Beaudrault, said San Francisco was in the Hard Rock's global top 10
in revenue, though he wouldn't cite dollar amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Block, a restaurant consultant in Sausalito, Calif., said
that Hard Rock ``still has a cachet of hipness.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of branded merchandise, Block said, are what drive
successful theme restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been about food,'' he said. ``It's always been
about retailing. At theme restaurants, people don't come back for
the food.''
</P>
<P>
   Block said that in San Francisco's fiercely competitive
restaurant market, chain restaurants in general do not survive.
``In New York, which has 7 million people, there are 7,500
full-service restaurants. San Francisco, with 750,000 people, has
3,400 restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's only other chain theme restaurant is Planet
Hollywood, which opened three years ago with a riot of flashbulbs,
a red carpet and personal appearances by Planet Hollywood investors
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   However, parent company Planet Hollywood International is
spinning on a wobbly axis, having put its Orlando, Fla., corporate
headquarters and restaurant on New York's Times Square up for sale
this week to pay creditors. The company lost $10.1 million in the
third quarter of 1998, and chain-wide revenue was down 26 percent
in the quarter, according to recent filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Planet Hollywood spokesmen declined to discuss the corporation's
travails. Planet Hollywood operates 80 eateries, including the
sports-themed Official All Star Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Block attributes Planet Hollywood's eclipse to its too-rapid
worldwide expansion. In contrast, he praised ``the cautious growth
of the Hard Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Other theme operations include the Rainforest Cafe, House of
Blues and the Minnesota Co.

   Every war is unhappy in its own way. Vietnam was especially so,
and one of the principal ways it became unhappy was through
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   With some exceptions -- the War of 1812, the Mexican War --
American journalists gladly enlisted in the country's wars,
fighting with their typewriters, rallying the home front, battling
to keep the fighting spirit alive and high. Then came Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam changed much in American culture: public respect for
professional soldiers, the broad assumption that the nation's
leaders spoke the truth to the people, the orthodoxy that our wars
are just, the notion that when the United States fights a war, it
wins it crisply, unambiguously, and honorably.
</P>
<P>
   But no institution in American life, not even the military, was
changed by the Vietnam War as profoundly as journalism. The ancient
craft entered the war with a wink and emerged with a scowl. Its
practitioners entered the war with skepticism and left with
cynicism. Its best-known names entered the war as mere observers of
great power and left the war wielders of great power.
</P>
<P>
   And so the appearance of an anthology of Vietnam journalism, in
two elegant volumes of the Library of America, is a landmark. But
it is also a recognition of how journalism changed that war and,
just as important, how that war changed journalism. In 1,715 pages
of writing that remains remarkably resilient -- still gripping
after all these years -- the full tragedy of Vietnam is visible,
audible, palpable, along with the whirr of the helicopter rotors
and the spit of the M-16 rifles and the tears of the families of
the 58,000 American dead.
</P>
<P>
   These are volumes that can be dipped into, skimmed -- or read
slowly, page after page, one volume following another. Any way will
do, and any way will leave the reader with a richer view of
Vietnam. But the very best way to read these volumes is to
accompany them with the two volumes the Library of America
published three years ago, ``Reporting World War II'' (also $35 a
volume). The World War II volumes add 1,900 pages of reading, to be
sure, but they also add an immensely valuable perspective.
</P>
<P>
   One example is especially searing. In Tunisia in World War II,
Ernie Pyle looked back upon the men who perished in the ferocious
fighting of 1943 and wrote: ``They died and thereby the rest of us
can go on and on. When we leave here for the next shore, there is
nothing we can do for the ones beneath the wooden crosses, except
perhaps to pause and murmur, `Thanks, pal.' `` No reader would ever
mistake that passage for one written about Vietnam, which was
simultaneously an overseas military conflict and a domestic
political one.
</P>
<P>
   Then consider how these two wars began, and how journalism
responded. The run-up to World War II was freighted with tension,
and the reporting that endured -- from William L. Shirer, Dorothy
Thompson, A. J. Liebling, Edward R.
</P>
<P>
   Murrow, among many -- was ominous in its tone, unmistakable in
its underlying assumption: The National Socialism of Hitler's
Germany was evil, it was destined to cause conflict, and America
was destined to become involved, and should.
</P>
<P>
   The beginnings in Vietnam, too, were full of warning, but the
blasts were of a far different nature. As early as January 1961,
for example, Stanley Karnow was writing of the South Vietnam
government that was America's ally: ``Beneath the appearance of
calm and stability, and despite all the government's assurances of
security, President (Ngo Dinh) Diem's regime may well be
approaching collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 13 months later, Homer Bigart, whose coverage of World War
II was far less political, sounded a tocsin in The New York Times
that wasn't heeded: ``The United States seems inextricably
committed to a long, inconclusive war.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists can prolong it for years. Even without
large-scale intervention from the north . . . what may be achieved
at best is only restoration of a tolerable security similar to that
achieved in Malaya after years of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   But it is too late to disengage; our prestige has been
committed. Washington says we will stay until the finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Karnow and Bigart weren't alone, far from it. The alarm bells
were sounding all over the landscape, even in the pages of the
Saturday Evening Post, never suspected of pink ideology. In a July
1962 interview with Bernard B. Fall, the North Vietnamese leader Ho
Chi Minh said: ``I think the Americans greatly underestimate the
determination of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people
always have shown great determination when they were faced with a
foreign invader.''
</P>
<P>
   As US involvement escalated, as domestic support eroded, and as
the biggest indigenous antiwar movement in US history grew, all
these elements became clearer. But it was a mistake then, and is
now, to believe that the elements of American failure in Vietnam
became clear only in 1966 and 1967 and 1968, when opposition to the
war broadened and deepened. Those elements were known, and
publicized, from the very start.
</P>
<P>
   But if the war was sustained by myths, then its course in the
popular mind is shrouded also in myth.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism has severe limits as a craft, and even more severe
ones as a chronicle of history; in almost every case, the
historian's view of events is more interesting, more thoughtful,
and more enduring than the reporter's.
</P>
<P>
   (Compare, for example, how historians view two of the signal
events of this century -- the causes of the Great Depression and
the causes of World War II -- with the way reporters viewed them,
and the chasm is clear.) But journalism is a reminder that the
myths of history also sometimes have to be swept away. In the
Vietnam era, that is especially so. Two examples, drawn from
coverage of two completely different aspects of the war years: -By
plowing through a portrait of the first teach-in, at the University
of Michigan, we are reminded of the passion of the antiwar
movement. We are reminded, too, that some of the passion was
stirred by the energies of young people living in a world we hardly
remember. For example, protests were sexually integrated in ways
that many other campus activities weren't. Here is the account from
the Michigan Daily: ``Women were allowed all-night permission to
attend the teach-in and as Jared Stammel, '68, remarked, `This
undoubtedly gave a big stimulus to the event.' `` -By rereading the
remarkable reporting by Seymour M. Hersh of the massacre at My Lai,
we are reminded of the sense of innocence Americans had about
themselves and about their war as late as November 1969. In the two
volumes' 1,700-odd pages, perhaps the most memorable single
sentence comes from the mother of one of the GIs at the village:
``I sent them a good boy and they made him a murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many memorable moments in these volumes, including the
account by John McCain, now a Republican US senator from Arizona,
of being shot down ``right in the center of Hanoi'' in 1967, being
charged with being a war criminal, being beaten and forced to live
in brutal solitary confinement; the writing of Norman Mailer at one
of the domestic battles of the war, Chicago in 1968, and of Tom
Wolfe, who caught the great tension between the war at home and the
one in Vietnam; the account of Doris Kearns (now Goodwin) of how
President Johnson chose the bombing targets and felt the great
frustration of the war; and the graceful writing of H. D. S.
Greenway, now the editor of the editorial page of this newspaper,
whose unforgettable account of a night with the Viet Cong began:
``At night in the Mekong River Delta, pale lights bob and flicker
like fireflies through the banana trees and over the rice paddies,
dry in the harvest now and white in the moonlight.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a war as brutal as World War II, and in an era when
many Americans' views about World War II come from Steven
Spielberg, it is worthwhile to remember the brutality of the war
that came two decades later.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Jack P. Smith, who was wounded at Landing Zone Albany
in the Ia Drang Valley in 1965, and who now is an ABC
correspondent: ``This was a massacre, and I was one of a handful
not yet wounded. All around me, those who were not already dead
were dying or severely wounded, most of them hit several times. I
must have been talking a lot, but I have no idea what I was saying.
</P>
<P>
   It think it was, `Oh, God, Oh, God, Oh God,' over and over. Then
I would cry.''
</P>
<P>
   If it was as brutal as World War II, the standards were
different in Vietnam. The New York Times's Sydney chanberg quotes
an Air Force general saying, ``We wiped out whole cities, whole
cities, in World War II, and there wasn't a single protest. Now one
bomb falls outside the target area and they scream in righteous
moral indignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam was, like most wars, the extension of politics by other
means. And at the heart of the struggle over the war was a complex
generational conflict between the wise old men, many with
worldviews rooted in World War II, and the young wise guys, whose
worldview was rooted in the gritty war in Vietnam. The old men were
Omar Bradley, Douglas Dillon, Matthew Ridgway, and Dean Acheson.
</P>
<P>
   The young guys were David Halberstam, Malcolm Browne, Neil
Sheehan, and Charles Mohr.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the wise young guys won the argument and won over
the Wise Old Men. It was, for better or for worse, the triumph of
journalism.

<P>
   Oil is a magnet for conflict. The problem is simple _ everyone
needs energy, but the sources of the world's transportation fuel
are concentrated in relatively few countries.
</P>
<P>
   Well over two-thirds of the world's remaining oil reserves lie
in the Middle East (including the Caspian basin), leaving the rest
of the world dependent on the region's collection of predators and
vulnerable autocrats.
</P>
<P>
   This unwelcome dependence keeps U.S. military forces tied to the
Persian Gulf, forces foreign-policy compromises and sinks many
developing nations into staggering debt as they struggle to pay for
expensive dollar-denominated oil with lower-priced commodities and
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, oil causes environmental conflict. The possibility
that greenhouse gases will lead to catastrophic climate change is
substantially increased by the 40 million barrels of oil burned
every day by vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol has always provided an alternative to gasoline. In terms
of environmental impact and fuel efficiency, its advantages over
gasoline substantially outweigh its few disadvantages. But until
now it has only been practical to produce ethanol from a tiny
portion of plant life _ the edible parts of corn or other feed
grains.
</P>
<P>
   Corn prices have fluctuated around $100 a ton in the last few
years, ranging from half to double that amount. Ethanol has thus
been too expensive to represent anything but a small, subsidized
niche of the transportation fuel market. In spite of recent
reductions in the expense of ethanol processing, the final product
still costs roughly a dollar a gallon, or about double today's
wholesale price of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Recent and prospective breakthroughs in genetic engineering and
processing, however, are radically changing the viability of
ethanol as a transportation fuel.
</P>
<P>
   And if the hundreds of billions of dollars that now flow into a
few coffers in a few nations were to flow instead to the millions
of people who till the world's fields, most countries would see
substantial national security, economic and environmental benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, energy is vital to a country's security and material
well-being. A state unable to provide its people with adequate
energy supplies or desiring added leverage over other people often
resorts to force.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, driven by his
desire to control more of the world's oil reserves, and the
international response to this threat. The underlying goal of the
U.N. force, which included 500,000 American troops, was to ensure
continued and unfettered access to petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Oil permeates every aspect of our lives, so even minor price
increases have devastating impacts. The most difficult challenge
for planners, policymakers and alternative-energy advocates is the
transportation sector, which accounts for more than 60 percent of
U.S. oil demand.
</P>
<P>
   The massive infrastructure developed to support gasoline-powered
cars is particularly resistant to modifications. It precludes rapid
change to alternative transportation systems and makes America
highly vulnerable to a break in oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
   During a war or embargo, moving quickly to mass transit or to
fuel-cell or battery-powered automobiles would be impossible. For
most countries, excluding only those few that will be the next
century's oil suppliers, the future portends growing indebtedness,
driven by increasingly expensive oil imports.
</P>
<P>
   New demand for oil will be filled largely by the Middle East,
meaning a transfer of more than $1 trillion over the next 15 years
to the unstable states of the Persian Gulf alone _ on top of the
$90 billion they received in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Dependence on the Middle East entails the risk of a repeat of
the international crises of 1973, 1979 and 1990 _ or worse. This
growing reliance on Middle Eastern oil not only adds to that
region's disproportionate leverage but provides the resources with
which rogue nations support international terrorism and develop
weapons of mass destruction and the ballistic missiles to carry
them.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi VX nerve gas and Iranian medium-range missiles show how
such regimes can convert oil revenues into extensive and
sophisticated armament programs.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists about world oil reserves, such as the Department of
Energy, are getting increasingly lonely. The International Energy
Agency now says that world production outside the Middle Eastern
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will peak in
1999 and world production overall will peak between 2010 and 2020.
</P>
<P>
   This projection is supported by influential recent articles in
Science and Scientific American. Some knowledgeable academic and
industry voices put the date that world production will peak even
sooner _ within the next five or six years.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists who project large reserve quantities of over one
trillion barrels tend to base their numbers on one of three things:
inclusion of heavy oil and tar sands, the exploitation of which
will entail huge economic and environmental costs; puffery by OPEC
nations lobbying for higher production quotas within the cartel; or
assumptions about new drilling technologies that may accelerate
production but are unlikely to expand reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Once production peaks, even though exhaustion of world reserves
will still be many years away, prices will begin to rise sharply.
This trend will be exacerbated by increased demand in the
developing world. Even assuming a substantial recession, increased
Asian needs alone will add enough demand by 2010 (9 million barrels
per day) to more than equal Saudi Arabia's current daily
production.
</P>
<P>
   The nations of the Middle East will be ready to exploit the
trend of rising demand and shrinking supply. The Gulf states
control nearly two-thirds of the world's reserves; the states
bordering the Caspian Sea have another several percent. Barring
some unforeseen discoveries, the Middle East will control something
approaching three-quarters of the world's oil in the coming
century.
</P>
<P>
   But if genetically engineered biocatalysts and advanced
processing technologies can make a transition from fossil fuels to
biofuels affordable, the world's security picture could be
different in many ways. It would be impossible to form a cartel
that would control the production, manufacturing, and marketing of
ethanol fuel.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomacy and policies in the Middle East could be guided
more by a respect for democracy than by a need to protect oil
supplies and accommodate oil-producing regimes. Our intrusive
military presence in the region could be reduced, both ameliorating
anti-American tensions and making U.S. involvement in a Middle
Eastern war less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Other states would also reap benefits. Ukraine, rich in fertile
land, would be less likely to be dominated over time by oil-rich
Russia. China would feel less pressure to befriend Iran and Iraq or
build a big navy to secure the oil of the South China Sea. The
ability of oil-exporting countries to shape events would be
increasingly limited.
</P>
<P>
   The recent report by the President's Committee of Advisers on
Science and Technology (PCAST) predicted that U.S. oil imports will
approximately double between 1996 and 2030, from 8.5 million
barrels per day, at a cost of $64 billion, to nearly 16 million
barrels per day, at a cost of $120 billion.
</P>
<P>
   They estimated, however, that with concentrated efforts in
fundamental energy research and investment in renewable fuel
technologies, this could be reduced to 6 million barrels per day in
2030.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded, ``A plausible argument can be made that
the security of the United States is at least as likely to be
imperiled in the first half of the next century by the consequences
of inadequacies in the energy options available to the world as by
inadequacies in the capabilities of U.S. weapons systems.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is striking that the federal government spends about
20 times more money for research and development of new weapons
than energy options.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the United States is not funding a vigorous program
in renewable technologies. The Department of Energy spends under
two percent of its budget on renewable fuels; its overall work on
renewable technologies is at its lowest level in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Because private investment often follows federal commitment,
industrial research and development has also reached new lows.
These disturbing trends occur at a time of national economic
prosperity when America has both time and resources for investing
in biofuels.
</P>
<P>
   The United States cannot afford to wait for the next energy
crisis to marshal its intellectual and industrial resources. Our
growing dependence on increasingly scarce Middle Eastern oil is a
fool's game _ there is no way for the rest of the world to win. Our
losses may come suddenly through war, steadily through price
increases, agonizingly through developing-nation poverty,
relentlessly through climate change _ or through all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   It would be extremely short-sighted not to take advantage of the
scientific breakthroughs that have occurred and that are in the
offing, accelerate them and move smartly toward ameliorating the
risks.
</P>
<P>
   If we do, we will make life far less dangerous and far more
prosperous for future generations. If we do not, those generations
will look back in angry wonder at the remarkable opportunity that
we missed.

meaning a transfer of more than $1 trillion over the next 15 years
to the unstable states of the Persian Gulf alone _ on top of the
$90 billion they received in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Dependence on the Middle East entails the risk of a repeat of
the international crises of 1973, 1979 and 1990 _ or worse. This
growing reliance on Middle Eastern oil not only adds to that
region's disproportionate leverage but provides the resources with
which rogue nations support international terrorism and develop
weapons of mass destruction and the ballistic missiles to carry
them.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi VX nerve gas and Iranian medium-range missiles show how
such regimes can convert oil revenues into extensive and
sophisticated armament programs.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists about world oil reserves, such as the Department of
Energy, are getting increasingly lonely. The International Energy
Agency now says that world production outside the Middle Eastern
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will peak in
1999 and world production overall will peak between 2010 and 2020.
</P>
<P>
   This projection is supported by influential recent articles in
Science and Scientific American. Some knowledgeable academic and
industry voices put the date that world production will peak even
sooner _ within the next five or six years.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists who project large reserve quantities of over one
trillion barrels tend to base their numbers on one of three things:
inclusion of heavy oil and tar sands, the exploitation of which
will entail huge economic and environmental costs; puffery by OPEC
nations lobbying for higher production quotas within the cartel; or
assumptions about new drilling technologies that may accelerate
production but are unlikely to expand reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Once production peaks, even though exhaustion of world reserves
will still be many years away, prices will begin to rise sharply.
This trend will be exacerbated by increased demand in the
developing world. Even assuming a substantial recession, increased
Asian needs alone will add enough demand by 2010 (9 million barrels
per day) to more than equal Saudi Arabia's current daily
production.
</P>
<P>
   The nations of the Middle East will be ready to exploit the
trend of rising demand and shrinking supply. The Gulf states
control nearly two-thirds of the world's reserves; the states
bordering the Caspian Sea have another several percent. Barring
some unforeseen discoveries, the Middle East will control something
approaching three-quarters of the world's oil in the coming
century.
</P>
<P>
   But if genetically engineered biocatalysts and advanced
processing technologies can make a transition from fossil fuels to
biofuels affordable, the world's security picture could be
different in many ways. It would be impossible to form a cartel
that would control the production, manufacturing, and marketing of
ethanol fuel.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomacy and policies in the Middle East could be guided
more by a respect for democracy than by a need to protect oil
supplies and accommodate oil-producing regimes. Our intrusive
military presence in the region could be reduced, both ameliorating
anti-American tensions and making U.S. involvement in a Middle
Eastern war less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Other states would also reap benefits. Ukraine, rich in fertile
land, would be less likely to be dominated over time by oil-rich
Russia. China would feel less pressure to befriend Iran and Iraq or
build a big navy to secure the oil of the South China Sea. The
ability of oil-exporting countries to shape events would be
increasingly limited.
</P>
<P>
   The recent report by the President's Committee of Advisers on
Science and Technology (PCAST) predicted that U.S. oil imports will
approximately double between 1996 and 2030, from 8.5 million
barrels per day, at a cost of $64 billion, to nearly 16 million
barrels per day, at a cost of $120 billion.
</P>
<P>
   They estimated, however, that with concentrated efforts in
fundamental energy research and investment in renewable fuel
technologies, this could be reduced to 6 million barrels per day in
2030.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded, ``A plausible argument can be made that
the security of the United States is at least as likely to be
imperiled in the first half of the next century by the consequences
of inadequacies in the energy options available to the world as by
inadequacies in the capabilities of U.S. weapons systems.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is striking that the federal government spends about
20 times more money for research and development of new weapons
than energy options.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the United States is not funding a vigorous program
in renewable technologies. The Department of Energy spends under
two percent of its budget on renewable fuels; its overall work on
renewable technologies is at its lowest level in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Because private investment often follows federal commitment,
industrial research and development has also reached new lows.
These disturbing trends occur at a time of national economic
prosperity when America has both time and resources for investing
in biofuels.
</P>
<P>
   The United States cannot afford to wait for the next energy
crisis to marshal its intellectual and industrial resources. Our
growing dependence on increasingly scarce Middle Eastern oil is a
fool's game _ there is no way for the rest of the world to win. Our
losses may come suddenly through war, steadily through price
increases, agonizingly through developing-nation poverty,
relentlessly through climate change _ or through all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   It would be extremely short-sighted not to take advantage of the
scientific breakthroughs that have occurred and that are in the
offing, accelerate them and move smartly toward ameliorating the
risks.
</P>
<P>
   If we do, we will make life far less dangerous and far more
prosperous for future generations. If we do not, those generations
will look back in angry wonder at the remarkable opportunity that
we missed.

BRITAIN LAUNCH AN IRAQI BAY OF PIGS? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In October, Congress rushed to embrace an Iraq Liberation Act,
authorizing a whopping $97 million in military aid to democratic
Iraqi resistance groups. President Clinton's staff was
unenthusiastic, but Clinton signed rather than pick a fight. The
basic idea behind it? That the United States should refuse to
accept the continued rule of Saddam Hussein and help install the
Iraqi opposition in his place. (slugged:

   &UR; Part II: THE `ROLLBACK' FANTASY _ WHY NOT HAVE THE IRAQI

</P>
<P>
   Some critics of current U.S. policy argue that the United States
should help the opposition umbrella group known as the Iraqi
National Congress (INC) seize and hold large enclaves inside Iraq,
from which it would proceed to undermine Saddam's rule. But this
plan is militarily ludicrous and would almost certainly end in a
massive bloodbath. (slugged: BC-IRAQ-REBELS-INCOMPETENT -TWO-NYTSF)

   One more option for toppling Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq is
known as ``the Afghan approach.'' It stipulates that the United
States could help the Iraqi opposition mount an insurgency on the
model of the Afghan mujahideen, the Nicaraguan Contras or the Viet
Cong. Iraq's neighbors, however, aren't terribly relieved at this

MAKING GAMER'S SEASON BRIGHT

   LOS ANGELES _ OK, time's getting tight. You have to pick up the
last few things for the family, and a game or two sounds great. For
you last-minute types, here's the absolute best of what I've seen
this season, plus a few suggestions for game-related purchases.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to make all of a computer gamer's experiences
better, consider buying them hardware instead of games. That means
additional RAM; a joystick or driving wheel; or a 3-D video card.
</P>
<P>
   All these purchases will cost more, say from $80 to $300,
depending on what you purchase. Space limitations prevent me from
making many suggestions, but consider a few things:
</P>
<P>
   _ RAM, for a computer's memory, is cheap, and more always helps
a computer's performance in just about every area, not just games.
</P>
<P>
   _ Video accelerator cards are proliferating in dizzying fashion.
Stick with cards based on the Voodoo and Voodoo II chip sets for
now, because more games are written to take advantage of their
power, and they provide excellent performance for the price.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft's new Sidewinder Pro Freestyle game controller and
driving wheel make for handy PC gaming peripherals, and Advanced
Gravis offers terrific game pads as well as joysticks and related
flying-game peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new PC games of note: Trespasser; Tomb Raider III;
Railroad Tycoon II; the Age of Empires expansion Rise of Rome;
Heavy Gear II; Heretic II; James Cameron's Titanic Explorer and
SimCity 3000. Total Annihilation Commander Pack is a repackaging of
a great real-time strategy war game with additional scenarios and a
strategy guide for a terrific price.
</P>
<P>
   Disney Interactive's three computer titles related to the
just-released ``A Bug's Life'' are all well done and would make a
well-timed gift for younger children in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro Interactive also has come out with two really cool hybrid
computer toys for younger children. They attach either a Tonka toy
workbench or the cockpit of Han Solo's Millennium Falcon from Star
Wars to a computer keyboard. That toy/keyboard combination in turn
controls a CD-ROM's worth of computer activities.
</P>
<P>
   This is a wonderful idea because it connects the sometimes
opaque computer experience into a real-world toy that a child can
use more easily and enjoyably than a conventional keyboard. The
Star Wars Millennium Falcon is for ages 5 and up, the Tonka
Workshop for ages 3 and up.
</P>
<P>
   And if you've just gotten a new computer that has a DVD-ROM
drive, check out the latest iteration of the never-ending Zork
adventure saga, Zork Grand Inquisitor. Zork has evolved from a
simple text-based game to this lushly illustrated interactive tale,
and remains an enjoyable experience.
</P>
<P>
   And as a bonus, the DVD disk includes Zork Nemesis (which came
out on CD-ROM) and a full set of hints and solutions.
</P>
<P>
   For $30, you can beef up your Nintendo 64 with an Expansion Pak,
which doubles the machine's memory to 8 megabytes. For great new
games designed for it _ such as Star Wars Rogue Squadron, NFL
Quarterback Club 99 and Turok 2: Seeds of Evil _ the extra memory
means better graphics, more and better enemies and more
sophisticated game play.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best N64 titles for more mature gamers this year are
Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (dubbed game of the century by one
publication); Star Wars Rogue Squadron (which I also just love);
and Turok 2. Among the best of the many N64 games appropriate for
younger gamers are Buck Bumble and Bomberman Hero.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo also just released a well-done color version of its
huge-selling Game Boy pocket gaming machine. Only a few titles are
out just yet to take advantage of the beefier new mchine's
capabilities, but it adds color to even the oldest black-and-white
Game Boy titles.
</P>
<P>
   And if your child is Game Boy freak, definitely pick up one of
the two versions of Pokemon (to force kids to trade and interact,
the company put out slightly different Red and Blue versions of the
game; either works fine).
</P>
<P>
   For a totally silly little stocking stuffer, Nintendo has come
up with a cross between a virtual pet and a pedometer based on its
star Pokemon creature, Pikachu. Shower it with gifts of ``watts,''
or Pikachu will turn its back on you.
</P>
<P>
   Over on the PlayStation side, Doc's Quake &AMP; Shake Rumbler is a
great analog dual-stick controller that's better than what Sony
includes with all new machines.
</P>
<P>
   It features a better directional, or ``D,'' pad than the Sony
controller, and adds ``turbo'' and ``slow'' buttons that are great
in driving games. If you want to spruce up an older PlayStation, or
play head-to-head, here's a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many PlayStation games of note:
</P>
<P>
   _ For younger children: Spyro the Dragon; A Bug's Life; Crash
Bandicoot: Warped Tiny Toon Adventures The Great Beanstalk.
</P>
<P>
   _ For adventure and role-playing gamers: Parasite Eve;
Xenogears; Brave Fencer Musashi; Apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   _ For shoot-'em-ups: Nitrous Oxide; Asteroids.
</P>
<P>
   _ For racing games: SCARS (also on N64); Gran Turismo; Need for
Speed III.
</P>
<P>
   For cheap stocking-stuffer games, both Nintendo and Sony have
cut prices to about $20 on a group of big-selling older titles.
These are a great way to inexpensively beef up your collection with
excellent titles such as N64's GoldenEye 007 and the PlayStation's
first two Crash Bandicoot games.
</P>
<P>
   ON A SITE, OUT OF MIND: And if it's really last-minute shopping

sites will deliver the next day, even if it is Christmas. Plus, you
don't have to brave the mall crowds. Ah, techno-bliss.

INTO THE MALL, ONE MORE TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Crazed, frazzled, feel like you've got the
shopper's equivalent of snow blindness from looking at too much
stuff in the stores?
</P>
<P>
   First, try to avoid being testy. Miz Hot Tips has seen too much
mall madness already, like a checkout line fight at the J.C. Penney
Outlet in West Hills, and she wants you to know it wasn't a pretty
sight. A woman accused another of pushing her child while waiting
in line (she didn't), and suddenly both were hurling insults, which
shocked the other ladylike customers.
</P>
<P>
   Relax. We'll all get our turn. Peace on Earth. Good will to all
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Second, take a list so you can check it off as you go. It really
works. And if you're desperate for offbeat gift ideas, read on.
</P>
<P>
   DESK SET: It may not make them whistle while they work, but
career types love status-heavy accessories, like Montblanc's Le
Grand fountain pen for $12,600.
</P>
<P>
   Miz Hot Tips spotted water globes at Saks Fifth Avenue, which
make great desk toys with Eiffel towers and other city landmarks,
for $35. And at all Old Navy stores, you can buy a snow globe for
$5 that can be personalized with your own picture.
</P>
<P>
   Another deskmate idea is the metal classic Rolodex in hot colors
like pink or orange for $95 at Orange, 245 S. Robertson Blvd.,
Beverly Hills. While you're there, check out some of the other
retro office supplies in rainbow colors, including file cabinets
and in-and-out trays. And keep an eye out for celebs. Word is that
Brad Pitt shops there.
</P>
<P>
   PUPPY PANACHE: The friends who throw birthday parties for their
dog will probably want to take it on vacation ... or to your house
... so give them a stylin' dog carrier. Miz Hot Tips learned that
all the major purse companies _ from Kate Spade to Louis Vuitton _
now have carriers, but Asprey &AMP; Garrard carries the most clout with
a real alligator-covered carrier for $19,000, according to Vogue
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Less pricey pup stuff includes red rain slickers and holiday
place mats and water bowls at the new Animal House at The Oaks
mall, 222 W. Hillcrest Ave., Thousand Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   And the Santa suit Rover's been begging for is available for
$10.99 at PetsMart stores.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Petco stores, you can buy Angel Dog (and Angel Cat)
ornaments designed by L.A. artist Joe Monroe with the help of his
greyhound Jaxson. They cost $20 and benefit Pets Are Wonderful
Support (PAWS), which provides veterinary care, pet food and pet
sitting for HIV patients. For more information, call (323)
876-7297, Ext. 116.
</P>
<P>
   A FROSTY MAKEOVER: OK, it's relatively toasty in Los Angeles,
but somewhere it's snowing. For this winter experience, you'll need
an official snowman kit, and the Horchow Collection catalog has
one. Honest.
</P>
<P>
   The kit includes a corncob pipe, eyes, a bow tie (or red feather
boa for a snow woman), wire-rimmed glasses, a hat, eyes and buttons
for $90. To order, call (800) 456-7000.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!A few good books:!off! You may think they're boring and
merely something to cover the scratches in your coffee table, but
surely you've got a literary friend or two.
</P>
<P>
   For them, Miz Hot Tips has rounded up a bunch of
oh-so-fashionable books. They include ``The Power of Glamour'' by
Annette Tapert (Crown Publishing; $40), which focuses on some of
Hollywood's most famous stars, from Greta Garbo to the lesser-known
Kay Francis. There's also Janet Wallach's new book, ``Chanel: Her
Style and Her Life'' (Doubleday; $35), which takes the reader from
Coco Chanel's poverty-ridden childhood to the top of a fashion
empire.
</P>
<P>
   For him, take a gander at John Bridges' very enlightening (and
short) book, ``How to Be a Gentleman'' (Rutledge Hill Press;
$12.95). It's packed with tips on cellular phone etiquette (turn it
off at the opera) and less-known subjects like ice. On the latter,
Bridges says a gentleman never crunches on ice except in the
privacy of his home.
</P>
<P>
   Other good reads are the gigantic _ and gorgeous _ ``Botanica's
Roses'' (Random House; $50), which is quite literally an
encyclopedia of 4,000 types of roses and how to grow them; and a
charming little book all about a local child actress now seen in
reruns of ``Father Knows Best'' and ``The Andy Griffith Show.''
It's ``In the Kitchen with Elinor Donahue'' (Cumberland House;
$16.95) and it's packed with nostalgia and celebrity recipes. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Casey Kerr of Winnetka works 360 days a year. The
other five he spends decorating his home for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a while to set up 3,000 lights, a snowman, Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs, Santa Claus and his reindeer, and Raggedy Ann
and Andy.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, he's been putting on his show of lights, and
every year it's the same thing. ``It's packed. I can easily walk
outside and there are five to six cars out front,'' said Kerr, who
owns a hot-rod shop. ``I average two accidents a year from people
rubbernecking and they run into something.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Stuart family of Agoura Hills, every Nov. 1 marks the
beginning of a 75-hour project. The whole family participates in
putting up the massive display that adds $700 to the electric bill
and draws sightseers to their cul-de-sac. The highlight of this
display? The merry molar family, which adorns the garage door.
``There are five molars in holiday garb, wishing everyone a Happy
Holiday season but admonishing them to keep on brushing,'' said
Charles Stuart, a dentist.
</P>
<P>
   The Nortons of Burbank have been celebrating the holidays with
an elaborate display since the early '70s and call it their ``gift
of love to the public in the form of an elaborate display.''
Working nights and weekends starting in mid-November, their
``gift'' takes a month to finish. ``When you see it, you understand
why,'' said Dick Norton.
</P>
<P>
   Large-scale, animated features in the display include a Ferris
wheel, a merry-go-round and a chugging train complete with a
steam-blowing whistle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young boys are fascinated by it and will sit and stare for
quite a while,'' says Norton. ``Kids think it's like Magic Mountain
_ they want to ride.''
</P>
<P>
   For liability reasons, viewers have to keep off the equipment,
but they are welcome to leave their mark in Santa's log book on the
podium next to the train station. Visitors have been known to leave
not only their name but questions, too, and the Nortons have
provided answers to the most common ones on a sign posted in front
of the display.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction never fails to pack the streets. ``On Christmas
evening, the street is like Universal CityWalk,'' Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Once, even a crew of Department of Water and Power workers
stopped to check out the display that adds $300 to the Nortons'
monthly power bill. ``I pay your bonuses every year,'' Norton
teased.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's expensive. Yes, it's time-consuming. But Norton said
he enjoys every moment of it. ``What I love the most is the large
number of people who come by and say how much they love it. For
some of them, that's it, the only Christmas they get, and it means
so much to them. So many people look forward to seeing it that it
makes it all worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the spectacular light displays in the San
Fernando Valley. &QL;

 &HT;    WACO'S EDWARDS DENOUNCES IMPEACHMENT EFFORT
 &HT;    575 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Waco Democratic Rep. Chet Edwards denounced the
GOP-led effort to impeach President Clinton as an unfair trampling
of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``History will surely judge this process as a combination of
Kafka, ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' and Keystone Kops,'' he said
Friday, on the floor of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the name of the rule of law, this process ignored the
fundamental principles of due process and fairness that form the
foundation of that rule of law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was among the first speakers Friday morning as the House
debated four articles of impeachment against the president. His
comments reflected those of many Democrats who spoke of a fiercely
partisan process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who among us, Democrat or Republican, in this House would want
to be a defendant in the case where the rules of law and fairness
were ignored, where secret grand jury testimony against us was
released to the world, where there was not one direct witness,
where your defense attorney was limited to one hour of
cross-examining your chief accuser, where your attorney was forced
to give your final defense even before one charge had been formally
presented against you...,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely no member of this House would want to be judged by that
process. We should not judge this president by that process,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards also blasted GOP House members for their efforts to
block a vote on censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some to speak of their vote of conscience today even as
they deny others a deep vote of conscience is, in itself,
unconscionable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Texas Democrats objected to the timing of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, said having the debate
concurrent with a U.S. military attack on Iraq ``may wind up
costing American lives'' because it could encourage Saddam Hussein
to resist longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority may well have blood on its hands by starting this
proceeding today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Republicans said the nation will survive no matter what
the Congress decides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens _ whether the president is impeached or not _
our nation will endure. We are a strong people, and we have a
Constitution that works,'' said San Antonio Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who has called for Clinton to resign, said the
impeachment is not about a private relationship but ``it involves
the most public of relationships _ that between a citizen and the
justice system and that between the president and the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's about respect for the law, respect for the
office of the presidency, respect for the American people, respect
for the officers of the court, respect for women and our own
self-respect.''
</P>
<P>
   A simple House majority of 218 votes is enough to impeach
Clinton. If the House approves articles of impeachment, the Senate
would be forced to hold a trial. It takes a two-thirds Senate
majority to convict a president and remove him from office, and few
people believe the Senate, which will have 55 Republicans and 45
Democrats next year, will find the 67 votes needed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In expressing his opposition to impeachment, Edwards said no
citizen should be treated below the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the name of justice, this process ignored the pillar of
justice: that in our nation every citizen is innocent until proven
guilty, not guilty until proven innocent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Final votes on the articles of impeachment are expected by
midday Saturday.

STAR OF WONDER STILL KEEPS A SCIENTIFIC SECRET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of my favorite Christmas songs has a verse that begins, ``Do
you see what I see _ a star, a star, shining in the night with a
tail as big as a kite, with a tail as big as a kite.''
</P>
<P>
   The song about the Star of Bethlehem leading the Magi to the
place of Christ's birth is one example of the fascination with the
bright light the Gospel of Matthew says pinpointed the location of
a humble manger almost 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Was the heavenly display a comet with a long tail, perhaps even
Halley's comet? Or was it an exploding star or an unusual
conjunction of planets?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Olenick, chairman of the University of Dallas' physics
department, thinks his computer _ with the help of an EZ Cosmos
program that allowed him to look back on ancient sky patterns _
sheds light on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The star of Bethlehem likely was a clustering of planets,''
says Olenick. ``Jupiter and Saturn appeared close to each other
three times within a few months in 7 B.C. Mars joined them on Feb.
20 in the year 6 B.C.''
</P>
<P>
   The brightest conjunction of the three planets appeared in March
of 6 B.C., likely the time of Jesus's birth, he says. Also, that
goes along with theories that Jesus was born in the spring, not in
December.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Enrique Nardoni, professor of theology at the
University of Dallas, said the accounts of shepherds watching their
flocks by night give credence to the idea that Jesus was born in
springtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very cold around Bethlehem in the wintertime, especially
at night, and shepherds would not be out tending to their flocks
then,'' Nardoni said.
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars believe that an error in the Christian calendar
caused a wrong dating of Jesus' birth. They conclude that he was
born between 4 B.C. and 6 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   That opinion is based on Roman records that indicate Herod the
Great died about 4 B.C. The Gospel says Herod was alive when Jesus
was born and, indeed, tried to have the child killed. Under that
time frame, Jesus had to have been born before Herod's demise _
perhaps in 5 B.C. or 6 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   No final answers exist about the date of Christ's birth or the
origin of the light that the New Testament says led wise men to the
child.
</P>
<P>
   But Olenick speculates that the wise men began their journey in
7 B.C. and completed it during the brightest conjunction of Mars,
Jupiter and Saturn in 6 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Don Garland, director of the Noble Planetarium of the Fort Worth
Museum of Science and History, examines several theories about the
Star of Bethlehem in a 25-minute Christmas show depicting
first-century skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider all the major possibilities of what the Christmas
star might have been,'' Garland said. ``We know that a comet
appeared in 5 B.C., so we show a comet _ actually a picture I took
of Halley's Comet when it last appeared.''
</P>
<P>
   The planetarium show uses special effects to simulate an
exploding star or supernova _ another possibility mentioned in
explaining the Star of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there were visible supernovas,'' he said. ``One was
documented by the Chinese in 1054.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the planetarium program depicts a conjunction of planets
and stars that could explain the Star of Bethlehem. Garland's
research indicates Jupiter was close to Regulus, the bright star in
the constellation Leo, in 2 B.C. and 3 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Garland said Jupiter and Saturn also are close together this
Christmas season. In Texas, one can look directly overhead about 9
p.m. and see the two bright planets.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth possibility _ that there is no scientific explanation
for the Star of Bethlehem _ also is mentioned in the planetarium
show.
</P>
<P>
   The star shining in the night may have been just another
Christmas miracle, like the birth of a child in the little town of
Bethlehem who profoundly changed the world with his teachings about
forgiveness, unconditional love and good will.

SCHOLARS DEBATE HIS EXISTENCE, BUT MOSES HAS BEEN INSPIRATION
THROUGH AGES (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The name of Moses resounds through Western civilization, echoing
ancient themes of freedom, faith and the founding of a nation. His
image _ bearded and sometimes horned (because of a tradition grown
out of a mistranslation) _ has inspired great geniuses to paint and
chisel. Words attributed to him have been known and recited by
nearly every person who has lived in Western civilization since
Christianity became the dominant religion.
</P>
<P>
   Even in 1998, Moses is deemed worthy of a mass-market animated
motion-picture feature, ``The Prince of Egypt,'' which opened
yesterday after much media fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   But did he really exist?
</P>
<P>
   Not too many years ago, when skepticism reigned among scholars
of the Bible, the answer by many experts would have been a
confident ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, that answer has changed to ``yes,'' though the vote is by
no means confident or unanimous. Moses does not meet modern
standards of historical evidence: There are no contemporaneous
written documents to back up the stories that, as far as can be
determined, were written down 200 to 500 years after the time in
which the historical Moses would have existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All but the true believers among contemporary Bible critics
are willing to concede that the `historicity' of Moses remains open
to question,'' writes Jonathan Kirsch in his recently published
``Moses: A Life,'' the latest in a long line of popular and
scholarly studies of the ancient leader.
</P>
<P>
   But many believe that Moses _ or someone upon whom the Moses
stories were based, or maybe several people upon whom the stories
were based _ must have existed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ``true believers'' willing to make a scholarly case
for Moses are members of the faculty of Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the type of corroboration historians use to
write history,'' says Rick Johnson, an associate professor of Old
Testament at the seminary and an admitted conservative. But Johnson
can point to several aspects of the Moses story that support the
idea that Moses really lived, even though there is no written
record.
</P>
<P>
   His colleague at the seminary, historian and archaeologist Tommy
Briscoe, points out the evidence of new settlement and sociological
change in Palestine in the late 13th century B.C. _ just the right
time to match the move of the Israelites from Egypt into Canaan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were changes at that time, evidence of small settlements
... '' he says. ``Some of them must be connected with the influence
of the Israelites.''
</P>
<P>
   From another religious perspective, historian Michael Meyer of
Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati defends the historical Moses,
without insisting on his existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no historical evidence outside the Bible,'' says
Meyer, whose wife, Margaret Meyer, commutes to Texas to serve as
rabbi at Congregation Kol Ami in Flower Mound. ``But the Jewish
tradition holds that there was a historical character named
Moses.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer points to several compelling aspects of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that his name is Egyptian attests to the historical
background,'' Meyer says. Scribes in Israel 200 years after the
fact would not have used an Egyptian name for a national hero in a
work of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, some interesting conjectures of the nature of
the real Moses have emerged. Tradition calls Moses the author of
the Pentateuch, but any reader must obviously wonder why, if Moses
wrote those first five books of the Bible, he is always referred to
in the third person _ and included a narration of his own death.
Seventeenth-century Jewish-Dutch philosopher Benedict Spinoza drew
the wrath of both Jews and Christians for asking that obvious
question, though just a century later, the outspoken Voltaire also
questioned the existence of Moses.
</P>
<P>
   By the 20th century, German scholar Martin Noth speculated that
Moses was a local leader in Palestine to whom the other stories
were attached; Sigmund Freud speculated that Moses was an Egyptian
who learned his religion from the pharaoh Akhenaton, who built a
cult that could be regarded as monotheistic around the sun god
Aton.
</P>
<P>
   According to Freud, the original Moses was killed in the
wilderness by the Israelites and replaced by a Hebrew leader who
took on his name.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a real Moses, what was he like?
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the chronology one chooses, he lived either in the
13th century B.C., at the time of Rameses II _ the choice taken by
the makers of ``The Prince of Egypt'' _ or about 200 years earlier.
But the impish individualism that might have produced a chariot
drag race between two teen-age princes depicted in ``Prince of
Egypt'' was unknown in the ancient Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Was Moses monotheistic in the modern sense?
</P>
<P>
   The world in which he lived was steeped in polytheism, but Moses
clearly moved beyond the belief in many gods, even if those around
him never did.
</P>
<P>
   For that concept alone, whether he was a prince of Egypt, a
leader of a wandering tribe or several people who came together in
one character, he occupies a unique place in human history and must
be regarded as a genius who saw far beyond the accepted beliefs of
his own time.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, tales once regarded as pure myth _ King
Arthur, the Trojan War _ have come to be regarded as having a basis
in fact. So is there a chance that historical evidence of Moses
will be found?
</P>
<P>
   Briscoe sees the faint possibility that something may be
discovered in the family tomb of Rameses II, currently under
excavation. A single word, a hieroglyph chipped on a stone in
Egypt, could place Moses squarely within the framework of history.

SCHOLARS SAY CONGRESS DOESN'T NEED TO FOLLOW PUBLIC OPINION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While opinion polls show that many Americans are
ambivalent about impeaching Bill Clinton, presidential and
constitutional law scholars say the Congress has every right to
buck public opinion and vote to remove the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that many people want Clinton punished but not
removed from office for his conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
And the surveys show that Clinton's job approval rating remains
high.
</P>
<P>
   But constitutional law experts say that if the founding fathers
had wanted the public to decide impeachment, they would have
required the president to be recalled by popular vote. Instead,
they gave the power to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of no indication that the framers thought impeachment
amounted to a popular referendum,'' said Evan Gerstmann, professor
of political science and specialist in constitutional law at Loyola
Marymount University in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saw it as the members of Congress exercising their
constitutional responsibility to do what, in their best judgment,
is best for the country,'' Gerstmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some analysts suggest that the faith in government could be
damaged by politicians acting in apparent defiance of public will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are thinking, `Even if we do vote, they're not
listening to us,''' said Ann Crigler, director of the Jesse Unruh
School of Politics at the University of Southern California.
``People are quite suspicious of Congress anyway ... This can only
hurt that.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote goes to the heart of whether representatives to
Congress should be delegates or trustees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delegate's main job is to do what the people tell him to
do,'' Gerstmann said. Under the trustee model, ``the people
delegate authority and they entrust the representative to use that
authority in the interests of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerstmann noted, ``There is no consensus within political
science circles about which theory is correct.''
</P>
<P>
   There are political theorists who believe representatives must
balance the two concerns when making decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans favoring impeachment have argued that the rule of
law should outweigh the shifting sentiments of public-opinion
polls. Democrats say ignoring the public's views is undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard some of the more, if you will, right-wing members
use the phrase, `We don't live in a democracy, we live in a
republic.' That has sent shivers up and down my spine,'' said Sen.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. ``How can you do something that's against
the will of the people? I will tell you something. This is a
democracy. The form is a democratic republic, but I have never
heard people say this is not a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Robinson, chairman of the department of government at
Smith College in Northampton, Mass., teaches a course on the effort
to impeach Richard Nixon. He said one of the little-known facts
students have been puzzling over is that opinion polls, especially
in early 1974, showed that the public did not support impeaching
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been very much impressed with public-opinion polls
saying Clinton should not be removed from office,'' Robinson said.
He said Nixon's own tapes showed he was convinced the public would
never allow impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have great respect, or even reverence, for the office
of president and are desperate not to believe that he has committed
grave enough offenses to overthrow two popular elections,''
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that House Democrats ignored the polls and kept
pushing the charges against Nixon. It was only after the discovery
of the ``smoking gun'' tapes _ revealing Nixon's role in the
cover-up of the Watergate break-in _ that bipartisan support for
impeachment began to grow.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A reading of the Federalist Papers shows that Alexander
Hamilton, like other founding fathers, expected the impeachment
process would be political and partisan. Robinson said the House
was given the responsibility of voting articles of impeachment,
knowing that members would have to explain their decision and face
voters again within two years.
</P>
<P>
   The framers also made sure a two-thirds vote in the Senate would
be needed to convict.
</P>
<P>
   But those who believe that the charges against Clinton don't add
up to impeachable offenses see a danger: Impeachment could be used
more frequently by the majority party against leaders of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment now becomes part of the arsenal of Congress to
hold a president of the opposite party to account,'' said Robert
Post, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley
School of Law and a specialist in constitutional law. ``It ought
not be that. I predict that it will be used that way in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel Lowenstein, a law professor at the University of
California at Los Angeles, said there are enough safeguards in the
impeachment process to keep it from being used irresponsibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not Clinton is impeached, whichever side is right
... it does seem to me that our system works pretty well because it
really does entitle (representatives) to think about a whole lot of
things,'' Lowenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it's just concern about the next election, they need
to think about what people are going to be thinking about this in
the future,'' he said. ``That's a good thing. Maybe all of us will
have a better perspective on this 20 years from now.''

<P>
   IMPEACH (Washington) _ For the first time since Feb. 24, 1868,
three years after the United States emerged from an awful Civil
War, the House of Representatives debated the impeachment of a
President Friday. It scheduled for Saturday a vote on four articles
of impeachment ``for high crimes and misdemeanors'' against William
Jefferson Clinton. Ledeall. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   IMPEACH-ASSESS (Washington) _ A news analysis: As the acrid,
rueful and righteous debate went through the hours Friday, the
House stood poised to do what even some of its own Republican
leaders once considered unimaginable _ to impeach a Democratic
president on a near party line vote against the will of the people.
This was not the way something as momentous as impeachment was
supposed to take place. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SCENE (Washington) _ The strangest sound of all in the
debate to impeach President Clinton was the sudden roar of
shockingly bipartisan approval and applause erupting across the
House of Representatives when the plaintive cry came forth: ``The
politics of smear and slash-and-burn must end!'' For the briefest
moment in a day of bear-pit partisanship, Republicans and Democrats
cheered as one.The scene. By Francis X. Clines.

   IMPEACH-MOOD (Washington) _ The President, some of his aides and
friends say, is devastated. He has withdrawn, they say, even
cutting off some of his usual circle of friends. One, who talked to
him daily, hasn't heard from him since Thanksgiving. Another tells

CELEBRATING NINE DECADES IN LAVENDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Dec. 20) 
(JT) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In spite of a 30-year run as an actor, writer, dandy
and celebrated wit, Quentin Crisp still lives in a kitchenless
rooming house in the East Village that features communal bathrooms
and no front-door buzzer. ``If you'll phone me from that terrible
Punjab cafe on the corner, I will whiz right down,'' he said on the
telephone a few hours before his birthday party last Tuesday.
``When I get to the sidewalk, I will jump up and down. That is how
you will recognize me.''
</P>
<P>
   Crisp, who first achieved notoriety in 1958 with the publication
of ``The Naked Civil Servant,'' a memoir of his travails as a gay
misfit, could hardly be mistaken for anyone else. When he emerged,
topped by his trademark fedora and wearing a sky-blue ascot and
rhinestone-studded bolo tie, Crisp looked as regal as Gloria
Swanson bound for a premiere.
</P>
<P>
   He did not jump up and down.
</P>
<P>
   In fact Crisp, who turns 90 on Christmas Day, was somewhat
winded as he gingerly slid into a taxi. Cindy Adams' voice briefly
intruded, cajoling passengers to buckle up. Crisp was unmoved. ``At
my age,'' he said, pausing for effect, ``death would be most
welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Mortality may have been on his mind, but the evening _ a party
at the home of Cheryl Hardwick, a composer _ was a celebration of
Crisp's life as a performer, humorist and unapologetically
flamboyant homosexual. The tablecloths were lavender. So were the
napkins, the plates and the frosting on the cake. In Ms. Hardwick's
rococo parlor, the birthday boy settled into a love seat, his
designated throne for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have gotten some palm fronds,'' Ms. Hardwick said,
as Crisp focused on his Pimm's Cup. The culinary theme was a nod to
Crisp's origins: Welsh rabbit, Yorkshire pudding and
bangers-and-mash fritters speared with toothpicks bearing tiny
Union Jacks.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who literally knelt down to pay their respects to
Crisp were John Waters; Kate Pierson of the B-52's; Hamish Bowles,
an editor at Vogue, and Lady Bunny, the drag performer. Waters, who
described Crisp as ``a joyous influence on my life,'' met the
writer in London in the late-1970s. Then an unknown filmmaker, he
found Crisp's number in the phone book and soon after calling was
invited over for tea. ``We had a lovely afternoon,'' Waters said.
``Unfortunately, he doesn't remember it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hardwick hushed the crowd when Fran Lebowitz called from
Paris to wish Crisp happy birthday via speaker phone. ``I have no
idea who's listening,'' boomed Ms. Lebowitz. ``It's unnerving. I
feel like Monica Lewinsky talking to Linda Tripp.'' Afterward,
everyone sang ``God Save the Queen,'' with new lyrics directed at
the guest of honor. Through it all, Crisp was composed but seemed
exhausted by the attention. He still has the stamina for a one-man
show, ``An Evening With Quentin Crisp,'' which opens Christmas Day
at the Intar Theater, but he doesn't shy from discussion of the
inevitable last curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a significant death,'' he said. ``I don't want to die
and have people say, `I thought he was dead already.'''
</P>
<P>
   What else does he hope to achieve in his lifetime? ``Now, I just
want my voice to be in a taxicab,'' he said. He even has a message
in mind, though it may not pass muster with the Taxi and Limousine
Commission: ``Life, to be sure, is not worth living, but if you
think it is, then buckle up.''

<P>
   At 6-feet-4, 241 pounds, with the tightly packed musculature of
a freshly caught bluefin tuna, Bill Romanowski, a linebacker for
the Denver Broncos, does not appear to be naturally built for yoga.
Yet, in his hotel room at the Newark Airport Hilton Saturday before
last, he gamely assumed the position known as the Pigeon. Kneeling,
with his back to the wall, one leg bent beneath him, he strained to
breathe rhythmically while keeping his face from contorting into
what Danny Poole, his instructor, disdainfully called ``a weight
lifter's grimace.''
</P>
<P>
   Poole, who has been training Romanowski in yoga for seven
months, seemed pleased. ``His flexibility has really improved,'' he
said. ``He used to have to put six inches of block under his elbows
just to do the Can Opener'' _ a deep hip-flexor stretch _ ``but now
he's right down on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski, 32, bent his bulk into the Swan, followed by the
Cobra. ``Keep your butt soft,'' Poole reminded his pupil, who ended
his routine with the ultimate hamstring stretcher, the
Downward-Facing Dog. The football player then directed his
attention to his stack of three room-service dinners.
</P>
<P>
   Poole, a rock-jawed former Montgomery Ward catalog model, was in
town to watch the Broncos take on the New York Giants last Sunday.
He trains half a dozen Broncos players, usually during the week.
But the Saturday evening before the Giants ended the Broncos'
13-game winning streak with a 20-16 victory, Poole was summoned to
the rooms of Romanowski and Shannon Sharpe, the Broncos' tight end,
for last-minute tuneups.
</P>
<P>
   Yoga and ashrams have become almost as mainstream as treadmills
and day spas. Still, it seems surprising to see the National
Football League's gladiator corps folding their heavily muscled
bodies into delicate pretzel shapes and hunkering down to seek
their inner light as they prepare for combat on the field.
</P>
<P>
   But Poole, who looks a decade younger than his 49 years, is no
saffron-robed yogi. He is an amiable ex-college basketball player
whose colorful career has included stints as a soul food
restaurateur, a sports columnist and, lately, a real estate
salesman. His association with the Broncos started as a friendship
with Detron Smith, a 5-feet-9-inch, 231-pound fullback he met at
Jimmy's Bar and Grill in Denver, on a ladies' night. Smith, known
among his teammates as ``the human bowling ball,'' invited Poole to
teach a few classes at training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most jocks I see don't know anything about yoga,'' Poole said.
``They think it's some guy chanting with his leg behind his neck,''
a maneuver he insists is beyond him. ``I can't even do a full
lotus,'' he said. ``I've had surgery on both knees. But that's what
I'm up against: the leg-behind-the-head thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Poole has won over some of his skeptics. When the regular season
began, Romanowski and Sharpe put Poole on retainer. He works five
days a week with Romanowski and three with Sharpe, at his regular
rate of $50 an hour. Other players float in and out of sessions
with less regularity.
</P>
<P>
   After working with Romanowski before last week's game, Poole
walked down the hall to do a quick routine with Sharpe. More
naturally limber than his teammate, Sharpe was able to put the
palms of his hands flat on the floor without bending his knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the guys tease me,'' Sharpe said. ``They say, `That's
gymnast stuff _ only girls are supposed to be that flexible.''' He
snorted. ``They're just jealous because they can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' quarterback, John Elway, has missed several games
this season with hamstring problems, and Poole thinks yoga could
help him avoid injuries. ``John has got the trainers doing him,''
Poole said. Don't get me wrong, I don't think anything these
trainers is doing is bad. There's just some better stuff out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Poole believes in yoga's benefits, but he doesn't push its
touchy-feely aspects on his NFL students. Although he begins his
classes with candle gazing, a traditional exercise that entails
quietly focusing on a burning flame, he has scaled that back from
10 minutes to a less demanding 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I try to steer clear of the spiritual aspects,'' he
said. Instead, he focuses on intense stretching, along with
rigorous breathing and visualization exercises. Where most NFL
stretching regimens work a muscle between 10 and 15 seconds, Poole
said, his program requires that poses be held for anywhere between
45 seconds and 2 minutes. ``Mainly, the idea is to prevent
injuries,'' he said. ``We focus on hamstrings, hip flexors, groins
and backs _ the things that usually knock athletes out of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Without throwing around too much chakra and dharma talk, Poole
does have a yogic philosophy with its own catchword: dwelling. Or,
rather, not dwelling. ``It's stress management,'' he explained.
``You let whatever comes up, come up. You thank it for coming up,
and then you say, `I'll see you later _ bye.' After a while, things
will come up and go away without you dwelling on them. You've got
to learn to catch yourself, just as physically, you have to catch
yourself grimacing, hunching your shoulders, holding your breath.
That's my homework assignment to my students: catch yourself
dwelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all Poole's students, Romanowski would seem to be one of the
ones most in need of ``dwelling'' awareness. Known as one of the
league's most hot-tempered players, he provided a memorable
television moment last year when, in a Monday night game against
the San Francisco 49ers, he spit in the face of an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the personality type expected to meditate on the
words ``Om Shanthi,'' the Hindu peace mantra. In fact, Romanowski,
an 11-year NFL veteran, is adamant that his interest in yoga has
nothing to do with searching for inner calm. ``It's not a
relaxation strategy,'' he said. ``It's not about self-control. You
can't relax out on the field.'' What IS it about, then? ``I just
feel looser,'' he said. ``Can you measure it? No. But if you feel
good, you play good. And if you play good, you'll have a job the
next year.''
</P>
<P>
   With four minutes left in the final quarter of the
Broncos-Giants upset, Poole became so elated when the Broncos
scored what looked like the winning touchdown that he stood up in
the stadium and assumed a Tree pose, impervious to the catcalls
from fans behind him. ``Hey, stork man,'' one yelled. ``Down in
front!''
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants fumbled on the Broncos' 20-yard line, Romanowski
dived fearlessly into the pile and recovered the football _ a feat
Poole attributed to yoga-induced confidence. Romanowski paraded
around the field brandishing the ball as if it was an infidel's
severed head. Bad karma, perhaps. Three plays later, the Giants got
the ball and scored the winning touchdown.

MISTLETOE'S MAGIC GOES WAY BEYOND THE KISSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 20)  
(lb) 
 By MARTY ROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The holiday season always started with a bang around my
grandmother's house _ usually coming from my great-grandmother's
big back yard next door, where my father and his cousin Tommy were
out with their squirrel rifles, shooting great clumps of mistletoe
out of an old oak. This was the boys' way of bringing home
Christmas, and they generally bagged enough for the whole family.
</P>
<P>
   That was before I was born. By the time I was old enough to
appreciate the mysteries of mistletoe, my father had packed away
his guns and Tommy had moved to Texas, but traditions were
rigorously maintained.
</P>
<P>
   There was always an enormous bunch of mistletoe dangling from
the flagpole over my grandmother's front door during the holiday
season, tied up with an impressively wide red ribbon. It swung
violently about in the cold winter wind but never came down. I was
fascinated by it, a magical bush overhead, green in the dead of
winter, full of luminous white berries, inspiring kiss after kiss
in the enchanted week between Christmas and New Year.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother lived in northwest Arkansas, where mistletoe is a
common parasite on trees, usually oaks. There are several species
of mistletoe, but the best known and most common is Phoradendron
leucarpum, North American mistletoe, found from New Jersey south to
Florida and all the way to the Great Plains wherever winter
temperatures rarely fall below zero.
</P>
<P>
   It is an evergreen plant with beautiful leathery leaves not much
larger than a thumb print. It grows into 3- or 4-foot clumps high
in the branches of oak, hackberry, elm, pecan, black gum, maple,
tupelo and sycamore trees. After the trees lose their leaves in the
fall, the mistletoe is easy to spot. It grows on the lower
branches, too, and sometimes appears on the trunks of young trees,
but it rarely persists where it can be reached easily from the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   European mistletoe, Viscum album, is another genus altogether,
similar in appearance and habit but unknown here. It is said to
prefer the shady side of old lichen-encrusted apple trees, but it
also establishes itself in lindens and hawthorns, and occasionally
in oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Mistletoe was sacred to the druids of antiquity, who ascribed
potent supernatural powers to the thick clusters of mistletoe in
oaks. According to Pliny the Elder, white-robed druids cut the
mistletoe down with golden sickles, and two white bulls were
sacrificed on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   In the Prose Edda, the Icelandic epic written down in the 13th
century, mistletoe figures in the account of the death of Balder,
the Norse god of light, Odin's son. Balder dreamed of his own
death, and his mother extracted a promise from everything in nature
never to hurt her son. She overlooked the lowly mistletoe, and the
inspired troublemaker Loki made a dart from its wood. This weapon,
thrown in jest by Balder's brother, killed the gentle Balder.
</P>
<P>
   (The Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus, however, writing in the
12th century, had it that Balder was slain in a rivalry between the
brothers for the lovely Nanna.)
</P>
<P>
   Herbalists regarded mistletoe as an ``all-healer,'' Mary Durant
wrote in ``Who Named the Daisy? Who Named the Rose?'' (Dodd, Mead &AMP;
Co., 1976), a rich little compendium of wildflower lore. ``It
protected against witchcraft and nightmares; it evoked ghosts and
caused them to answer your questions,'' she wrote. Mistletoe was
said to have the power to open locks, and it guarded dairies from
trolls and could point the way to buried treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Culpeper's ``Herbal,'' published in 1653, reported that
the dried berry of the mistletoe ``doth mollify hard knots, tumors
and imposthumes,'' or abscesses; mixed with equal parts rosin and
wax, it could heal ulcers and sores. A necklace of mistletoe sprigs
cured apoplexy and palsy ``very speedily.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, mistletoe is listed as a poisonous plant; eating a
couple of berries or leaves may make a person a little sick, but
acute poisoning is rare, according to the American Association of
Poison Control Centers.
</P>
<P>
   Culpeper attributed to the botanist Carolus Clusius (1526-1609)
the instruction that mistletoe ``should not touch the ground after
it is gathered,'' but this injunction was forgotten by American
pioneers. Early settlers laid green branches of it on fresh graves
in winter in Oklahoma, where mistletoe, the state flower, once grew
as thick as Spanish moss.
</P>
<P>
   There is a wintry darkness about mistletoe. In Shakespeare's
``Titus Andronicus,'' Tamora, queen of the Goths, describes the
trees in a forest near Rome as ``o'ercome with moss and baleful
mistletoe.''
</P>
<P>
   The etymology is not straightforward: The ``mist'' in the
Anglo-Saxon ``misteltan'' also means ``dung.'' ``Mistel'' is a
diminutive, and ``tan'' meant twig. The word translates roughly to
``the little dung twig,'' Mary Durant wrote. Early observers
thought that mistletoe seeds could not germinate until they had
passed through the digestive system of birds.
</P>
<P>
   Botanists now think they know better: The seeds are planted when
birds rub their beaks on branches to rid themselves of the berries'
residue. The seeds germinate on the branch, and after a couple of
years, the root penetrates into the wood of the tree and the
mistletoe leafs out.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Post does not provide guidance for 20th-century observers
of the ancient tradition of kissing under the mistletoe, but the
correct procedure, according to Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and
Fable, is to remove a berry after every kiss. When the last berry
is gone, there should be no more kissing.
</P>
<P>
   Mistletoe is still harvested by crack shots in the backwoods for
big-city markets, but I found a good bunch growing within my reach
not long ago along a new road near my parents' home in Arkansas. It
snapped off in my hand.
</P>
<P>
   Mistletoe even wards off lightning, I understand, and in that
stormy period between the winter solstice and Twelfth Night, my
mistletoe will be hanging from the beam by the stairs, right below
our lucky old horseshoe: You can't be too careful these days.

   NEW YORK _ Alan Richman is pretty plugged in when it comes to
restaurants. After all, he's the food and wine critic of GQ
magazine. But hearing that the Rainbow Room will soon be closed to
the public for all but Friday night, Sunday brunch and the
occasional holiday was news to him.
</P>
<P>
   He knew there was going to be a change in management at the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   He knew the Cipriani family would be taking over the restaurant
complex on the 65th floor of Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   It was the word ``closing'' that was giving him trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sure?'' Richman asked. ``This is one of those things like
a House appropriation to close the Washington Monument and nobody
notices because it's in a subclause buried on the 300th page of
some proposal. If true, IF, it's outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Richman paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, the Rainbow Room is one of the last grand
democratic restaurants,'' he continued. ``Let me get my thoughts
together here. It's a majestic piece of Americana that had the
added virtue of being accessible to the public. You would see
people dressed up wonderfully, having the night of their life. More
and more of the best things in life have become inaccessible, saved
only for the people with the luxury tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow Room, the famous Art Moderne supper club with its
revolving dance floor, site of thousands of celebrations of the
heart, is, indeed, closing _ to at least most of the people, most
of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The B.E. Group, which had managed the restaurant since 1987, did
not renew its lease when Tishman Speyer Properties, the manager and
an owner of Rockefeller Center, raised the rent from $3 million to
$4 million this year. Last night was the last time the Rainbow Room
complex, including the Promenade Bar and the Rainbow and Stars
cabaret, was open to the public under the old management. Don't
kick yourself for not popping over for one last dance. The
regulars, apprised of the situation by members of the deeply peeved
B.E. Group, had the place booked for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cipriani International, which operates the legendary Harry's Bar
in Venice (Hemingway liked it and who better to do press?), as well
as a number of elegant, pricey restaurants around town, holds the
new lease and is scheduled to reopen the Rainbow Room, name intact,
in February.
</P>
<P>
   All their plans are not known _ in part because, as the populace
begins to howl, the Ciprianis seem to be changing plans, and in
part because, as Nancy Friedman, a spokeswoman, put it, the
Ciprianis feel they are being ``crucified'' by the press and are
reluctant to speak.
</P>
<P>
   It is certain, however, that the Rainbow Room itself, perhaps
the last grand nightclub in New York with the space for ballroom
dancing, will be used primarily for private parties. The Promenade
Bar, where for the price of a drink you could look out at the city
for hours, will become a restaurant. Rainbow and Stars, the cabaret
that drew performers like Rosemary Clooney and Tony Bennett but
which rarely operated at a profit, had been scheduled to close at
the end of the year even before the Ciprianis signed on.
</P>
<P>
   The people who love the Rainbow Room; the couples who celebrated
an anniversary with an extravagant night on the town (dinner
averaged $250 to $300 a couple); the New Yorkers who sent visitors
to the Promenade Bar, which the critic Gael Greene of New York
magazine considers the city's most romantic (``those cozy alcoves
enclosed in blue suede where you feel like you're the only two
people in the world''), and the 350 employees whose contract
expires on New Year's Eve, are distressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk into the Rainbow Room, it's like walking into a movie
set, like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rodgers,'' said James Lendino, a
retired construction company owner from Sheepshead Bay, who has
taken his wife to the Rainbow Room every Saturday night for the
last eight years because he promised her, when they married more
than 30 years ago, that their dates would continue for the rest
their lives. ``You have no idea how devastated we are there's going
to be a changing of the guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Zagat, an owner of the Zagat Survey, said, ``It's like
taking the Empire State Building and saying you can't go.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Gurley Brown, editor in chief of Cosmopolitan magazine's
international editions, said: ``It took me weeks to pin down a date
for just a small dance party. Now that there's going to be just the
one night of the week; the mind boggles.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, under the latest plans, Ms. Brown might be able to
go dancing more than once a week. Just not in the space she's used
to. The plans are changing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Giuseppe Cipriani, 34, who heads the Cipriani Holding Group (it
was his grandfather who created the first Harry's Bar), told
reporters as recently as last month that the Promenade Bar, a long
narrow room that was being used as a private club at breakfast and
lunch, was to be turned into a branch of Harry's Bar. The reason
for focusing on private parties, a member of Cipriani's management
team later said, was money: an operator makes much more with
catering than what is called, in the restaurant industry, a la
carte. (The industry figures usually cited are a 30 percent profit
for catering, 10 percent for a la carte.)
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, the carving knifes were out. A column in USA
Today said that the panoramic bar, which it called a perfect 1930's
replica, ``will become another Harry's Bar theme restaurant under
the arrogant conceit that the apex of Rockefeller Center should
deign to pretend that it's in Venice.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, Harry.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Ms. Friedman, the Cipriani spokeswoman, the bar will
be called the Rainbow Grill. It will also include a dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decor will remain the same,'' Ms. Friedman said. ``It will
be consistent with the time period, the 1930s New York. It will not
be a Venetian makeover, as has been erroneously reported. It will
be a restaurant, which will be open for breakfast, lunch and
dinner, seven days a week, and have dancing nightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that the Rainbow Room sat 240 people and the Promenade Bar
seats fewer than 100, it might seem more accurate to say there will
be very close dancing nightly. Ms. Friedman acknowledges only that
the dance floor will be smaller than the one in the Rainbow Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers feel they own the Rainbow Room, they have a very
proprietary adoration for this landmark, yet they rarely go,'' Ms.
Friedman said, giving the story a spin reminiscent of the Rainbow's
famous floor, but faster. ``The idea of bringing the Ciprianis into
the plan is to make it more of a place that New Yorkers will
utilize. In its current situation, it's still closed much of the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Speyer, the president and chief executive of Tishman
Speyer, who has also been taking a lot of heat from the press,
echoed Ms. Friedman's remarks. Speyer was appreciative of the
romance of the Rainbow Room _ his daughter was married there.
(``You didn't expect that, huh?'' Speyer said, with some
satisfaction.) But he also said it was necessary ``to bring some
efficiency to the business.'' Speyer said that there had been bids
higher than those the Ciprianis submitted but that he felt the
Cipriani group would be the best way ``to insure a spectacular
future for the Rainbow Room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the evidence is pretty strong that people only use the
facility on certain days of the week and certain occasions,''
Speyer added. ``So in practical matters, it's not going to be so
different from the way it's run now.''
</P>
<P>
   The outgoing management disputes that. It says that with the
exception of Monday, when the Rainbow Room was closed, the big room
was rarely rented for private parties. This month, it was rented
only three times. Waldy Malouf, the executive chef and a director,
insisted the Rainbow Room was ``consistently used, almost to
capacity, frequently to capacity'' during the week.
</P>
<P>
   A final, brutal rejoinder from a member of the Cipriani team
regarding those capacity evenings: ``Package groups. Discounted
travel tours. The new management will be doing none of that.''

</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow Room opened in 1934, a long ago era in which
Rockefeller Center was owned by the Rockefeller family.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s, the club had faded, and the Rockefellers
brought in the B.E. Group, led by Joseph Baum and his partners,
Arthur Emil, Michael Whiteman and Dennis Sweeney, who oversaw the
club's glamorous makeover some 12 years ago. A theatrically
inclined restaurateur, who privately referred to the Rainbow Room
as ``the Empire State Building with its strap down,'' Baum took the
annual income from $8 million to $32 million. Seeing the Rainbow
Room as the people's palace may not be accurate. New Year's Eve in
the big ballroom was $450 a person, exclusive of beverage, tax and
tip.
</P>
<P>
   But Baum, his admirers say, knew how to put on a good show. New
Year's Eve included a conga line through the entire 64th floor, led
by a ``Fellini parade,'' including several costumed dwarfs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cipriani group acquired the lease for the Rainbow Room in
June. ( Baum, who had6been ill with cancer, died this fall.) Its
decision to focus on private parties was not remarkable to Ellen
Koteff, the executive editor of Nation's Restaurant News, a trade
magazine. ``It's a trend we're seeing across the board in fine
dining,'' Ms. Koteff said.
</P>
<P>
   But regulars, speaking from the heart, are not so philosophical.
``Where else can you get a view like this?'' said Don Mell, 36, one
recent night in the Promenade Bar, his hangout when he was a photo
editor with The Associated Press, which has its headquarters around
the corner. ``They're going to tear this bar up. I can't believe
the Rockefeller family would let them. Where's David Rockefeller in
this?''
</P>
<P>
   David Rockefeller is on the 56th floor on the old homestead _
but he is not, as he tells it, as powerful as some might think.
Rockefeller Center is now owned by Rockefeller Center Properties
Trust Inc., a consortium that includes Goldman, Sachs; Tishman
Speyer; Troutlet Investments, and the Exor Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``My interest is very different in some respects than when the
family owned it,'' Rockefeller said, ``Legally I have a 5 percent
interest, and I'm the non-executive chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be Rockefeller, however, who is responsible for the
public having any access to the Rainbow Room. ``When this came up,
I did inquire what was proposed and, um, expressed my strong
feeling that the public should have an opportunity to go there _ it
did have a lot of history,'' Rockefeller said. ``They assured me
that it will be open to the public regularly every Friday, and in
addition on holidays. My feeling is that it is not an unreasonable
compromise. I don't think I can tell the 95 percent owners they
haven't a right to have a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   What holidays will the room be open?
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got me there,'' Rockefeller said.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that Rockefeller and his future wife once won a polka
contest in the Rainbow Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a long time ago,'' Rockefeller, who is 83, said.
``I'm no longer dancing the polka. I do have particular favorite
memories of that room. It's a wonderful place, and I look forward
to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are not so sanguine. On a recent Saturday night, many
came for one last dance.
</P>
<P>
   Mell and his wife, Jeanne, and their friends Carl and Sharen
Butrum, invited 32 friends, some from as far away as California,
Nevada and Michigan. Mell, who wears black tie with the
unmistakable air of a fellow who usually does not, revealed that he
had proposed to his wife at the Rainbow Room. Other stories
followed: the New Year's Eves the gang celebrated in the bar, where
for years there was not even a music charge; the luck of having
spent time in a club in the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 in the morning, after the music stopped, Mell found his way
to the Promenade Bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you the truth,'' he said. ``I guess I'm still here
because when we leave we'll never come back again. It won't be the
same Rainbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a thought occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know,'' he said, ``it's New York. Things are always
changing. In a couple of years, who knows?''

 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In spite of a 30-year run as an actor, writer, dandy
and celebrated wit, Quentin Crisp still lives in a kitchenless
rooming house in the East Village that features communal bathrooms
and no front-door buzzer. ``If you'll phone me from that terrible
Punjab cafe on the corner, I will whiz right down,'' he said on the
telephone a few hours before his birthday party last Tuesday.
``When I get to the sidewalk, I will jump up and down. That is how
you will recognize me.''
</P>
<P>
   Crisp, who first achieved notoriety in 1958 with the publication
of ``The Naked Civil Servant,'' a memoir of his travails as a gay
misfit, could hardly be mistaken for anyone else. When he emerged,
topped by his trademark fedora and wearing a sky-blue ascot and
rhinestone-studded bolo tie, Crisp looked as regal as Gloria
Swanson bound for a premiere.
</P>
<P>
   He did not jump up and down.
</P>
<P>
   In fact Crisp, who turns 90 on Christmas Day, was somewhat
winded as he gingerly slid into a taxi. Cindy Adams' voice briefly
intruded, cajoling passengers to buckle up. Crisp was unmoved. ``At
my age,'' he said, pausing for effect, ``death would be most
welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Mortality may have been on his mind, but the evening _ a party
at the home of Cheryl Hardwick, a composer _ was a celebration of
Crisp's life as a performer, humorist and unapologetically
flamboyant homosexual. The tablecloths were lavender. So were the
napkins, the plates and the frosting on the cake. In Ms. Hardwick's
rococo parlor, the birthday boy settled into a love seat, his
designated throne for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have gotten some palm fronds,'' Ms. Hardwick said,
as Crisp focused on his Pimm's Cup. The culinary theme was a nod to
Crisp's origins: Welsh rabbit, Yorkshire pudding and
bangers-and-mash fritters speared with toothpicks bearing tiny
Union Jacks.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who literally knelt down to pay their respects to
Crisp were John Waters; Kate Pierson of the B-52's; Hamish Bowles,
an editor at Vogue, and Lady Bunny, the drag performer. Waters, who
described Crisp as ``a joyous influence on my life,'' met the
writer in London in the late-1970s. Then an unknown filmmaker, he
found Crisp's number in the phone book and soon after calling was
invited over for tea. ``We had a lovely afternoon,'' Waters said.
``Unfortunately, he doesn't remember it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hardwick hushed the crowd when Fran Lebowitz called from
Paris to wish Crisp happy birthday via speaker phone. ``I have no
idea who's listening,'' boomed Ms. Lebowitz. ``It's unnerving. I
feel like Monica Lewinsky talking to Linda Tripp.'' Afterward,
everyone sang ``God Save the Queen,'' with new lyrics directed at
the guest of honor. Through it all, Crisp was composed but seemed
exhausted by the attention. He still has the stamina for a one-man
show, ``An Evening With Quentin Crisp,'' which opens Christmas Day
at the Intar Theater, but he doesn't shy from discussion of the
inevitable last curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a significant death,'' he said. ``I don't want to die
and have people say, `I thought he was dead already.'''
</P>
<P>
   What else does he hope to achieve in his lifetime? ``Now, I just
want my voice to be in a taxicab,'' he said. He even has a message
in mind, though it may not pass muster with the Taxi and Limousine
Commission: ``Life, to be sure, is not worth living, but if you
think it is, then buckle up.''

GIVE PRACTICAL GIFTS THIS YEAR _ LIKE VEGETABLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is, by now, way too late to do your holiday gift-buying early
_ unless you are so repugnantly well organized that you are already
shopping for 1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In which case, I invite you to spend your spare time bringing
order to the chaos of my garage, my desk, my bookshelves at home,
my. . .the list is as nearly endless as it is sad. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But I know that most of you, even at this late hour, still have
Christmas gifts to buy. And, undiscerning as you are, you are even
willing to take advice about these last-minute gifts from someone
like me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying I'm a worthless source of gift ideas, but should
you trust someone who, as a child, used to sneak under the tree and
add his name to labels already on presents so it looked as if he
was at least partly responsible for some of them? Notice my
Clintonesque stance here: I'm not admitting, exactly, that I did
that. I'm just raising the question. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I may be no better organized today than I was as a stripling,
but I've at least had some practice in acquiring St. Nick-of-time
gifts that the recipients accepted without laughing in my face. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My main advice: think simple and be practical. This would lead
you to: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Toothpicks. They're surprisingly affordable _ and they may be
the only real wood in houses that feature ever-pink
almost-biodegradable Christmas trees made from spun vegetable
protein. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Toothpaste. People are always running out of it when it's
least convenient. And imagine how grateful the recipients will be
on their next trip when they look in their cosmetic travel cases
and find that teeny little tube of travel toothpaste you were
thoughtful enough to wrap for them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Wax lips. Sticking with the mouth area for cheap and quick
gift ideas, I find that hardly anyone ever thinks to give wax lips
for Christmas. Oh, you get them now and then at Halloween, but it's
Christmas now and it's often so darn cold outside that your real
lips could use some protection from the weather. A gift of wax lips
will make you a memorable giver. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Post cards. Did you have a post card handy when you last
wanted one? Almost certainly not. So why not meet the unanticipated
needs of people on your Christmas list by picking up a few post
cards? If you're a really thoughtful giver you'll even preaddress
one to yourself with this note: ``Say, thanks a lot for the great
post card(s).'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Thumbtacks. I can't tell you how often I've needed one and not
been able to find one. If someone had given me a little box of,
say, 100 of them for Christmas, my chances of finding one in the
house would have shot up by a lot. And just for fun, you can put a
few of them on chairs near the Christmas tree so people will
remember the point of the gift. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Asparagus. Perhaps you've noticed that so far most of the
gifts I've suggested have started with letters from the second half
of the alphabet. Not this one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Bratwurst. This idea is included for the same reason. Plus,
it's not that bad with asparagus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Drums. A set of these can be found in the basement of the
house in which I am permitted to dwell. They are played with
regularity _ and considerable skill _ by another resident of the
same house. It seems to me others might want to share this
experience, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Hacksaw. This thoughtful gift can help the recipient make
quick work of other gifts that didn't suit his or her fancy. Each
home should have one. &QL;
</P>
<P>

B-2 STEALTH BOMBER ON THE SIDELINES IN IRAQ CONFLICT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The B-2 stealth bomber was designed to be the most
feared plane in the Air Force, able to slip undetected through
enemy radar and deliver a lethal payload.
</P>
<P>
   But when the United States launched the biggest air assault
since the Persian Gulf War, the $2 billion boomerang-shaped plane
was at home in a hangar.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. warplanes and cruise missiles pounded Baghdad over the
past two days, the nine B-2s the Air Force considers operational
were at Whiteman Air Force Base, near Sedalia, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's decision to leave the B-2 out of its Iraq battle
plan has raised eyebrows among defense industry experts and members
of Congress, who recall how the Air Force touted the bomber on
Capitol Hill. Congress poured billions into developing an airplane
that was supposed to be so formidable that it would make much of
the U.S. arsenal obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon chose to carry out its aerial attack on Iraq
with tried- and-proven aircraft, such as the F-15 Eagle and the
B-52 Stratofortress, which first flew in 1952 and was a mainstay of
the Cold War bomber fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is the B-2?'' asked Tim Lomparis, a weapons technology
expert at St. Louis University in St. Louis. ``If the B-52 is a
better aircraft for this purpose, then what is the purpose of the
B-2? If they can't bring it out and strut it around, it's a nice
piece for an air museum somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force spokesman, Maj. Tyrone Woodyard, would not rule out
use of the B-2 in Iraq, but he added: ``At this point in time, they
have not received an alert order or deployment order.''
</P>
<P>
   That has left some lawmakers and others wondering when the Air
Force might unleash the plane or how serious the mission must be to
require its services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have those 50-year-old B-52s over there flying all those
missions,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., chairman of a House
subcommittee on military aviation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fear of taking the B-2 over there. If we lost a B-2
in Iraq it would be a multibillion-dollar loss and create an
international scandal the president would not be able to recover
from. But this is the kind of activity the plane was designed
for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has become accustomed to hearing criticism of the
B-2. It has become a symbol of Pentagon excess, and last year the
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
reported that the B-2's stealth capability would deteriorate in
rain, heat and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force says it has solved the problems, and in October,
it sent three B-2s to Guam for more than a month of exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials said the B-2 wasn't used in Iraq because
mission planners relied largely on aircraft already in the region.
It would take about 18 hours for the B-2, which was produced in
part at Northrop Grumman's plant near Grand Prairie, to fly from
Whiteman to the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts said the planners apparently didn't believe it
was worth waiting for the B-2 because it would not give the United
States any particular advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The B-2 does not have that much to offer in this type of
environment,'' said Richard Aboulafia, defense and aerospace
analyst for the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va. ``You use the B-2 to
penetrate a very well protected network. The air defense network
the Iraqis have is pretty darn crude.''

CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION TO TOP 50 MILLION BY 2028 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The low birth rate in San Francisco will
make it the only jurisdiction in rapidly growing California where
the population will actually decline in the years ahead, a state
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The average age in San Francisco is 35 _ four years older than
the state average _ but people aren't breeding as rapidly as in
other counties. As the state's population expands _ reaching 50
million by 2028, up from about 32 million today _ the city is
expected to lose 46,000 residents. And the city's average age will
be 49.
</P>
<P>
   State demographers believe there will be more professional
people with no children living in San Francisco and fewer working
couples with families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cleavers have been supplanted by the `Real World,''' said
H.D. Palmer, a spokesman for the state Department of Finance, which
released its report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, according to the report, the number of Hispanics and
Asians will surge, while the black population will decline slightly
and whites will no longer be in the majority.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic shift in California is certain to be the biggest
challenge for state government into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Hedy Chang, associate director of the nonprofit group California
Tomorrow, said the classroom is a good place to start. While 75
percent of California's teachers are white, the ethnic makeup of
kindergarten through 12th grade is much more diverse, reflecting
the future of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about not missing an opportunity in the schools to
really draw strength from this diversity,'' Chang said. ``You have
this incredible way to learn about the world. What an incredible
way to learn how not to be prejudiced. There has to be a conscious
effort to make sure that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Used by state officials in planning for services such as
transportation and welfare benefits, the Department of Finance
report is a mathematical and demographic crystal ball into the
state's future. Among its predictions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Between 1990 and 2040, the white proportion of the state's
population will drop from 57.2 percent to 30.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Hispanic segment will increase from 26 percent to 47.8
percent in the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Asians and Pacific Islanders will jump from 9.2 percent
statewide to 15.5 percent. But the group will see a huge increase
in San Francisco, leaping from 29 percent to 40 percent of the
population to become the dominant ethnic group.

   _ The black population will fall from 7 percent to 5.5 percent
statewide.

<P>
   The predicted decline in San Francisco's population was one
quirk in the state report. Using a 1990 population figure of
727,873 people, the Department of Finance factored in more recent
demographic statistics, including fertility and migration rates, to
predict that the 2040 population in the city would decrease to
681,924.
</P>
<P>
   ``The birth rates are relatively low,'' said Mary Heim, a
demographer with the Department of Finance. She said many of the
people in San Francisco who are of childbearing age are ``single
and are not having children.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's foreign minister warned U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright on Friday that further air strikes against
Iraq could seriously damage U.S.-Russian ties.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday, the State Department announced that Albright will
travel to Moscow next month in an effort at damage control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this action is not stopped, Russian-American relations can
seriously suffer,'' Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told Albright in a
telephone conversation, according to a statement released by his
office in Moscow. ``Everything must be done to rule out a setback
in our relations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This would not be our choice,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The direct reproach followed two days of harsh criticism from
across Russia's political spectrum, a unified front critical of
America and reminiscent of Cold War rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sent a letter to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin explaining the U.S. rationale for the attacks. Force was
necessary after diplomacy failed, Clinton said. He urged Yeltsin to
place their disagreement over Iraq in a broader context of the
critical U.S.-Russian relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Russia's defense establishment warned that the U.S.-British
strikes in Iraq threatened relations with NATO and could force
Moscow to shift its defense posture to a Cold War standing.
</P>
<P>
   Russia ``will be forced to change its military-political course
and may become the leader of a part of the world community that
disagrees with the (U.S.) dictate,'' Gen. Leonid Ivashov was quoted
as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we talk about cooperation and partnership with the
alliance now, when Russia's opinion is openly ignored?'' Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, economically and politically weak, has little pressure
to bring to bear on the Clinton administration. Yet the angry
response by Moscow marks a low point in relations since Russia
became an independent state after the fall of the Soviet Union in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin said it would not sever diplomatic relations with
America and Britain, perhaps mindful that Russia is reliant on
Western aid to see it through its deep economic crisis. The U.S.
and Russia are currently negotiating the details of a $600 million
American pledge of food aid to help Russia through its coldest
winter in the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks on Iraq are ``impermissible, they must be stopped,''
Dmitry Yakushkin, Yeltsin's spokesman, told a news conference. But
he added: ``There can be no talk of a break in relations with
Britain and the United States . . . We must not let things slide
into confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and a
key broker in previous confrontations between the United Nations
and Iraq, was distressed that it was not consulted prior to the
United States and Britain launching their attacks on Iraq.
Frustrated as a former superpower, Russia has been unable to
influence policy and safeguard its longtime ally, Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian commentators suggested that Russia's sharp
criticism of America and Britain was disingenuous and that the
country could benefit economically from the strikes on Iraq by an
expected increase in the world price of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Cash-strapped Russia depends on its oil and gas exports for much
of its badly needed revenue. Iraq also owes Russia about $7 billion
for arms purchases dating back to Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Objectively, as cynical as it sounds, bombings can bring
profit to Russia. No OPEC can raise world oil prices as Bill
Clinton did, the result of his order to bomb Iraq,'' wrote the
Kommersant business daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia could not wish for a better present for the New Year,''
wrote the daily newspaper Sevodnya, calling the tough talk from the
Russia's defense establishment ``an event of rather theatrical
character than real.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia on Friday recalled its ambassador to Britain for urgent
consultations -- a day after it summoned home its ambassador to
Washington. The action is a diplomatic form of protest, but rarely
has been used by Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house of parliament, the Communist-controlled Duma,
called Friday for Russia to unilaterally break the U.N. trade
embargo and provide aid to Iraq.

LONGTIME REPUBLICAN MAVERICK REMAINS MUM ON IMPEACHMENT DECISION 
</HEADLINE>

 By MARK HELM and ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After meeting with President Clinton for an hour
Friday, Republican Rep. Christopher Shays did what he often does:
He annoyed his party's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Shays, a moderate from Connecticut, refused to bow to pressure
from House Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who wanted him to announce he
will vote for Clinton's impeachment. Instead, Shays said he would
wait until Saturday's historic vote on the matter before announcing
his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will not be saying anything until after he has voted,''
Shays spokesman Seth Amgott said.
</P>
<P>
   Until last weekend, Shays had said he was against impeachment,
but he wavered after Clinton said again that he had not lied. ``I
think his remarks show that he just doesn't get it,'' Shays said
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday at a town meeting in Norwalk, Conn., Shays appeared
to be leaning against a yes vote when he told the crowd that
``impeachable offenses ... have not been proven and I believe the
proven offenses are not impeachable. But it is darn close.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Shays maintained then that he had not made a decision
on the vote.
</P>
<P>
   His decision Friday to keep House leaders guessing came as no
surprise to those who know him. For many of his 11 years in
Congress, he has been an iconoclastic champion of reform and
moderate causes, challenging his party's conservatives on issues
from abortion to gun control to the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial last spring, the Hartford Courant called Shays a
``rebel with a cause,'' with one of the most independent voting
records among congressional Republicans. In fact, Shays' tendency
to cross party lines has earned him only a 43 percent favorable
rating from the American Conservative Union on his voting record in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Shays enraged Republican leaders when he
teamed up with Massachusetts Democrat Martin Meehan on a bill to
toughen campaign finance laws. The unsuccessful bill would have
banned ``soft money,'' which is used for party expenses like voter
registration drives and can be collected in unlimited sums. The
measure also would have restricted campaign-related advertising by
groups like the Christian Coalition, the National Rifle Association
and unions.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, a leader in the effort to impeach the president, said at
the time that Shays was ``endangering the Republican Congress'' by
attempting to strip away the GOP's fund-raising advantages.
</P>
<P>
   But Shays argued that his legislation would restore public
confidence in the electoral system and would ``help to save the
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his troubles with many Republican leaders, the
53-year-old Shays has maintained support among most members of his
party through an unfailing drive for fiscal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the core Republicans who fought for balanced
budgets in the 1980s, before it became a safe issue,'' Amgott said.
</P>
<P>
   Shays entered Congress in 1987 after winning a special midterm
election to replace Republican Stewart McKinney, who died in May of
that year.
</P>
<P>
   Amgott said that ``when Shays arrived, there was a sense that
Congress had become an island unto itself, and he wanted to change
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he helped write and pass the Congressional
Accountability Act, which requires members of Congress to live by
the laws set for all citizens. The act was the first item of the
House Republicans' ``Contract with America'' to be signed by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Shays threatened to vote against Newt Gingrich in
his re-election bid for House speaker because of questions raised
by an ethics investigation of the Georgian.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich settled the issue by admitting he violated House rules
in using tax-exempt money for political purposes and providing
false information to a congressional committee about the case. For
the offenses, the House reprimanded Gingrich and fined him
$300,000.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, Shays has found that his independence served
him well. In November, he won his race with nearly 70 percent of
the vote _ an impressive achievement for a Republican from an urban
district where about 50 percent of registered voters are
Democratic.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the first Winter Wonderland Ball, a fund-raiser at
the New York Botanical Garden last week, a see-through tent was set
up next to the all-glass Enid A. Haupt Conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   When the music started, 200 young Establishment swingers in
their 20s and 30s jumped up and writhed like eels.
</P>
<P>
   It was not your usual benefit dance, decked out with showy
floral arrangements on tables and around the tent.
</P>
<P>
   Overhead and on the walls, there wasn't a flower in sight, only
white paper that had been cut up and curled, then hung in loopy
garlands. On the dance floor stood whimsical sculptures of a
giraffe and a ballerina made by Marc Gagnon, a papier-mache artist.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual decor was conceived and assembled by David Hoey and
Stewart Lucas, who are better known for their witty window displays
for Bergdorf Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked them because we knew the whimsical approach they
would take,'' said Brooke de Ocampo, 32, a chairwoman of the ball,
along with Nathalie Gerschel, Whitney Fairchild and Aerin Lauder
Zinterhofer. ``All we said was, `Think of the scene in ``The
Nutcracker'' where they are walking through the forest and the snow
is falling.' And then we said, `We can't afford Robert Isabell and
this is your budget.' They laughed. But they made us a winter
wonderland out of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Messers Hoey and Lucas, both 35, are among a new wave of floral
and party designers in New York who are challenging the
long-reigning kings of the fabulous fete: George Trescher, 72, who
has organized fund-raising galas for New York institutions for 30
years, and Isabell, 41, who first introduced his style of power
flowers in the 1980s and is still at it.
</P>
<P>
   For the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Ball two
weeks ago, Isabell packed dark red roses and amaryllis so tightly
into the arrangements that a blowgun couldn't have wedged in
another bud.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new generation is asserting itself in the war of the
rosebuds. And one of its main innovations has been to eliminate the
rosebud altogether _ that is, to replace flowers as party decor
with all kinds of unlikely materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hilarious what you can do with reams of paper once
you attack it with X-Acto knives,'' said Hoey, whose budget was
under $10,000, very modest compared with more traditional galas,
whose decor can cost 10 times that much.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the inspiration for using paper came from the vogue for
paper sculpture in window displays in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no famous paper sculptors,'' Hoey said. ``But you
used to see paper mannequins in windows all the time, and we even
found directions in old crafts magazines. You don't see this stuff
around, so it seems fresh now.''
</P>
<P>
   Avi Adler, 42, of Avi Adler Flowers said, ``I like to give
things a little edge, make them a little more contemporary.'' He
designed the New York magazine New York Awards party on Monday with
his partner, David Stark, 30.
</P>
<P>
   Their major design statement was a 16-foot-high wall of
custom-made gold cubes, cones and spheres hanging from metal
trusses, which greeted guests entering the old Dime Savings Bank,
across from Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the cathedral-size room, which is the newest catering
hall to be opened by the Cipriani family, thousands of votive
candles (and no flowers) flickered in the old tellers' windows and
at tables.
</P>
<P>
   Adler said of the gaudy ornaments: ``I was inspired by those red
and green, metal-and-glass markers you use for the edges of
driveways _ you know, they shine at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Offbeat sculptural walls are something of a signature for him as
a party designer. He did a solid facade of 8,000 lemons for an
Esquire magazine party this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the trends in floral arrangements and party design
in the late 90s seem bipolar, swinging between two moods: an
exuberant maximalism and a defensive, protective minimalism.
Coincidentally _ or maybe not so coincidentally _ the swings
reflect the gyrations of the stock market this year, which has
plunged from the high of summer to the low of autumn, and is now
rebounding to another high, although one riddled with anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no middle ground,'' Susan Miller Smith said, speaking
of trends in flower design _ although she could just as easily have
been speaking of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith works in both maximal and minimal styles. For Robert
Wilson's fund-raiser in August for his Watermill Center in
Southampton, N.Y., Ms. Smith, 38, decapitated hundreds of white
roses and laid the heads in rows on the center's bare floor in
front of a blank wall.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The minimalism of the late 90s is not the stark, seemingly
impoverished minimalism of the early part of the decade. It is not
the Banana Republic pocket T-shirt; it is the Banana Republic
cashmere T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   In floral terms, the minimalism of this moment can involve
thousands of blooms, arranged in simple, pared-down, calmingly
repetitive patterns. It is flower arranging as Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   It says you can afford indulgence, but you don't want to flaunt
it, because the bottom could drop out at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Working in her maximalist mode, Ms. Smith recently created an
over-the-top floral fantasy for the Upper East Side town house of
William and Katharine Rayner. The Rayners' Christmas scene is
rather loosely called ``Christmas in Jerusalem'' because of Ms.
Rayner's collection of Tiffany vermeil palm-tree candlesticks and
Arab-looking figurines holding still more candles.
</P>
<P>
   But the whole deal is really a great excuse to get away from red
and green, and to use a fabulous collection of gilt animal figures:
Egyptian sphinxes and Empire-style bullocks. Mixed in with jasmine,
a black-tinged rose called Barcarole and furry, caramel-colored
branching things called kangaroo paws are grapes, figs and privet
berry.
</P>
<P>
   Like landscape architects, most party planners and floral
designers come to their professions from somewhere else. Both Adler
and Stark are painters. Ms. Smith was a psychology student
supporting herself as a personal trainer, before she divined her
true calling six years ago. ``I got so energized by flowers and by
dirt,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith used cheese and bagels (and no flowers) as part of the
Upper West Side theme for the opening party for the new Nora Ephron
film ``You've Got Mail'' at the Museum of Natural History last
Thursday. ``It was a portrait of the West Side in food, and it
worked very well, very well,'' recalled Leslie Feeley, a private
art dealer and a friend of Ms. Ephron's. ``I was starving.''
</P>
<P>
   Another exemplar of the post-floral party designer is Benjamin
Liu, who plans celebrations for Visionaire magazine and other hip
downtown events. ``Flowers are irrelevant,'' Liu said, when asked
what blooms partygoers in their late 20s prefer. ``They want them
to go with the environment, so it doesn't look planned _ nothing
too arranged,'' he said. ``I'd rather call it vegetation, actually.
People might use just grass.''
</P>
<P>
   But real flowers are not utterly over for the new party
designers. When Remco Van Vliet and Cas Trap, Dutch-born brothers,
were hired to do the decor for the opening of the new Jimmy Choo
high-fashion shoe store recently, they set up Lucite columns topped
with severe stainless-steel containers.
</P>
<P>
   And in the containers they stuck real flowers. ``Reds,
burgundies and a deep maroon are what we used,'' Van Vliet, 23,
said, ``especially a French amaryllis _ Royal Velvet. It grows four
feet tall because it's raised hydroponically and gets 24 hours of
light a day.''
</P>
<P>
   The publicity agent who hired the brothers, Elizabeth Harrison,
whose company has a number of fashion clients, also likes to use
the designer Meredith Waga Perez to send flowers as thank-you
gifts. For a fixed price of $40, Ms. Perez's business, Belle Fleur,
sends out tiny, finely detailed arrangements in odd containers with
hand-lettered calligraphy cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good value, and when you order them they get there
fast,'' Ms. Harrison said. She keeps ordering them, she added,
``because I get more phone calls about them than for flowers from
other places.''
</P>
<P>
   Belle Fleur's other fashion-related clientele includes corporate
customers like Paul Smith, Donna Karan and Gucci, and others like
Alexandra Von Furstenberg; Bonnie Fuller, the editor in chief of
Glamour, and the actresses Gretchen Mol and Yasmine Bleeth, Ms.
Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Among certain old-line New Yorkers, those whose tastes run to
understatement rather than grand statements, one of the most
popular new floral designers is Carolyn Gregg. Ms. Gregg, 55, who
has been in flowers for only four years, also has clients in
publishing like Lynn Nesbit, the literary agent, and Arthur Carter,
the publisher of The New York Observer.
</P>
<P>
   At Ms. Nesbit's home on the Upper West Side last week, Ms. Gregg
did the flowers for a private party. A single arrangement
summarized her style: it took her no more than five minutes to put
together and consisted of fewer than a dozen big, fat cream roses
and four or five branches of glossy magnolia leaves stuck in a
white Victorian porcelain mantel ornament.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the elevator hall, the arrangement stopped traffic. It
managed to be both maximal and minimal at once.

HUSSEIN'S IRON GRIP ON POWER THWARTS BEST U.S. EFFORTS TO TOPPLE

<P>
   Saddam Hussein's game of hide-and-seek _ his palaces by the
dozen, not sleeping in the same bed two nights in a row _ would end
quickly enough with the help of a single snitch.
</P>
<P>
   But consider what happens to those who cross the Iraqi
strongman.
</P>
<P>
   He has killed his own sons-in-laws _ the fathers of his
grandchildren _ for flirting with rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   As an ambitious young man working in for a secret police outfit,
he was said to enjoy interrogation and have an affinity for a
torture device made to cut off fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Or there's the story of a time near the end of the Iran-Iraq war
when his health minister suggested that Hussein step aside, only
temporarily, to gain concessions from the Iranians. The advantage
won, the man suggested, Hussein could grasp the reins of power once
more.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein calmly ushered the adviser to the side, fired a bullet
in his face and resumed the meeting. When the man's widow, best
friend to Hussein's wife, asked for her husband's body, a plastic
bag containing his dismembered remains was dumped in her living
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a message to the family, and beyond that, to all Iraqis
that if you waver in the slightest way, you will pay a horrendous
cost,'' said James Phillips, a Middle East expert at the
conservative Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Through terror and cunning, in ways that resemble a combination
of Josef Stalin and a mafioso, Hussein for decades has survived
rivals at home and a world enraged to keep an iron grip on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Coups too numerous to count have boomeranged every time. Even in
1991, when 88,000 tons of munitions left his infrastructure in
tatters, when an international army war machine shooed his troops
from Kuwait, when the airspace over his country was sliced apart
with no-fly zones, Hussein endured.
</P>
<P>
   He is the proverbial cockroach scrambling through the rubble
after a nuclear explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to crack this wall of protection Saddam has built
around himself for years now and failed,'' Scott Ritter, a former
U.N. arms inspector in Iraq said on NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the United States were to mark him for assassination _
an executive order in place since 1975 bars such deliberate
killings of heads of state _ experts believe Hussein would pose a
nearly invincible target.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy would allow his death as part of a military action,
would find no fault with dropping a bomb on his hideout during a
war. But killing him that way is no easier.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's resilience is part logistical and part political,
experts said, and the two overlap.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, he's a moving target. In quiet times, Hussein
tends to spend only a few days in the same place in a country that
is bigger than California. During the last war, his minions cleared
three houses each day for him to hide.
</P>
<P>
   His personal safety is a constant obsession, Phillips said. On
his rare travels abroad, he brings his own chair with him because
he holds a mortal fear of sitting upon a needle planted by an
opponent. He surrounds himself in look-alikes to confuse potential
assassins with multiple targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``At most,'' said Middle East scholar Guilain Denoeux, ``maybe a
dozen people have direct access to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Denoeux describes Hussein as an Arab Stalin. Raised poor in the
countryside, both men rose through party structures _ the Communist
Party for Stalin and the Arab socialist//pan-Arab Baath Party for
Hussein _ and then went on murderous purges of intimidation once
they gained power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each man made sure that no one else in the country had any
other source of power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The political and ethnic factions that pose a threat within Iraq
are mostly divided. The Kurds in the north _ the ethnic minority
that Hussein smothered with mustard gas during the Iran-Iraq war _
fight too fiercely among themselves to pose a serious challenge to
Hussein and his Sunni Muslim faction.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1996, the Democratic Party of Kurdistan invited
Iraqi troops to help fight their rival, the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, which was backed by Iran.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, prompted President Clinton to launch cruise
missiles on Baghdad, far from the attacking forces in the Kurdish
areas. Within weeks, then-Central Intelligence Agency Director John
Deutsch told a Senate panel that Hussein's position at home had
only been strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, CIA agents were forced to flee the Kurdish territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, the people we relied on...in Baghdad were
executed,'' said Denoeux, who served in the French Embassy in the
Iraqi capital during the Iran-Iraq war. ``We lost our best sources
of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise in southern Iraq, the Shiite Muslims who might pose a
challenge lack the cohesion to take on Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Ousting Hussein _ whether by rivals from within or by Tomahawk
missiles from without _ is not necessarily a prescription for
Middle East stability. In fact, it could disrupt a balance of
tension between Iran and Iraq that the West has exploited for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take out the center, and the whole country flies apart,''
Denoeux said. ``You could have the Kurds controlling the north, the
Shiites in the south and the Sunnis in the middle. One big county
then becomes splintered into three parts and there's the fear among
some people that Iran could move in and dominate the region.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason that President George Bush gave for ending the
Gulf War of 1991 before toppling Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't,'' Bush said at one point, ``shove one soldier or
airman into an Iraqi civil war that's gone on for ages.''

MORE WATER DISTRICTS FOUND TO BE CONTAMINATED WITH VINYL CHLORIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas regulators have found 11 rural water districts where
samples of tap water were contaminated with a cancer-causing
chemical.
</P>
<P>
   In total, high levels of vinyl chloride, a chemical known to
cause cancer in humans, have been found in 17 rural water districts
in Missouri and Kansas. Older plastic water distribution pipes have
been blamed for the contamination.
</P>
<P>
   But it's too early to say how many homes might be affected by
vinyl chloride. Contamination found in samples from individual
homes does not mean the entire system is contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll know more when we do some more sampling,'' said Don
Brown, a spokesman for the Kansas Department of Health and
Environment. ``We need to know whether the one house is it, or if
there are other problems in the system,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has notified each homeowner where high levels of the
vinyl chloride were found, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 rural water districts: Franklin County No. 4; Anderson
County No. 4; Mitchell County No. 3; Dickinson County No. 1 and No.
2; Republic County No. 1; Ottawa County No. 1; Russell County No.
3; Comanche County No. 2; Harper County No. 2 and Sumner County No.
4.
</P>
<P>
   The rural water districts serve a few thousand rural Kansas
residents. Anderson County No. 4, for example, has 310 customers.
Dickinson County No. 2 serves 1,509, and Russell County No. 3
serves 480.
</P>
<P>
   The district closest to Kansas City is Anderson County,
southwest of Johnson County. Most of the other districts are in
sparsely populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators tested 125 of Kansas' 250 rural water districts
between June and October, taking two to four tests at each. The
highest reading was in Comanche County, 13.6 parts per billion. The
federal limit is 2 ppb.
</P>
<P>
   Officials chose the 125 districts that appeared to be most
likely to show vinyl chloride contamination, said Dave Waldo, who
heads the public drinking water section of the Kansas Department of
Health and Environment.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear yet whether the 125 other rural water systems in
Kansas will be tested. Those would be considered less likely to
have problems, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, regulators reported in September that they had
found high levels of vinyl chloride in five rural water districts,
but they hoped to investigate further. The Missouri official in
charge of that effort could not be reached late Thursday for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Three rural water districts in Iowa were found this summer with
high levels of vinyl chloride, but follow-up testing has found that
those were the result of ``unusual circumstances,'' such as low
water usage, said Roy Ney, an engineer in Iowa's Water Quality
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In each case in Iowa, the situation has been corrected, Ney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about the levels of vinyl chloride and other
contaminants within public water systems' distribution lines,
because testing isn't required beyond the point where it leaves the
water plant.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, high levels of vinyl chloride found in these
systems have so far not been considered to be a violation of
federal drinking water limits.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic pipe made from polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, before 1977
can release the chemical into drinking water if water sits long in
the pipe, especially during warm weather. The dead-end sections of
sprawling rural water systems are most prone to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Rural water districts across the Midwest began this summer to
test for vinyl chloride in drinking water after federal regulators
suggested the testing.
</P>
<P>
   In February, The Kansas City Star reported that state and
federal agencies that regulate public drinking water had known for
at least six years that parts of a rural water system in Doniphan
County, Kan., were contaminated by vinyl chloride. The agencies
didn't act to reduce customers' exposure until the newspaper
inquired about the contamination.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, EPA officials made a $50,000 grant available to
help pay for the testing. Kansas and Missouri split that money.
</P>
<P>
   The Vinyl Institute, an industry association, and a PVC pipe
industry group have taken steps this year related to the vinyl
chloride problem.
</P>
<P>
   They have offered to help states pay for follow-up testing.
</P>
<P>
   In Doniphan County's Rural Water District No. 5, they have
provided bottled water for most of the year to about 30 residents
whose water tested high for vinyl chloride.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has also offered District No. 5 free replacement
pipe or two other alternatives that might reduce vinyl chloride
levels below the federal limit of 2 parts per billion.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Patterson, who until recently represented the Vinyl
Institute on this issue, has said he was not surprised to find that
a small percentage of the systems with pipe made before 1977 had
high levels of vinyl chloride.
</P>
<P>
   That is because industry tests had shown that the plastic resin
used to make the pipe back then contained enough vinyl chloride to
contaminate water at levels above the federal limit under certain
conditions, Patterson said. The industry switched to a new
manufacturing method after 1977.
</P>
<P>
   But other industry representatives on Thursday pointed to recent
data as evidence that the vinyl chloride problem may not extend far
beyond Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri and Iowa found few problems, most of them caused by
such unusual circumstances as someone not being home for an
extended time, causing the water to sit in the pipes for unusually
long periods, said Dave Eckstein of the Dallas-based Uni-Bell PVC
Pipe Association, which represents PVC pipe producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to say this is a limited situation,'' Eckstein
said.

TAKING A STAND AT THE SHUBERT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sounds of freedom rang through the Shubert Theatre at the
debut presentation of the concert version of ``Masada, the
Musical,'' a benefit for DARE America and the Masada Preservation
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The musical, which the producers plan to take to Broadway in the
future, tells the story of a band of first-century Jewish zealots
who take a stand against the Romans in a mountaintop fortress and
choose death by their own hands rather than the slavery that
awaited them.
</P>
<P>
   The pairing of ``Masada'' and DARE, the now-worldwide drug
education and resistance program for schoolchildren, was a natural,
said Glenn Levant, president and founding director of DARE America.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Masada's' theme is `Let no man be another man's slave,' and
DARE is keeping children from being slaves to drugs and the fear of
violence,'' Levant said. He also noted that when ``Masada'' is
staged on Broadway and worldwide, a portion of its profits will
always go to benefit DARE.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that Levant is married to the musical's executive
producer, Jayne Levant. ``I had the inside track'' for the benefit,
Levant quipped. And his wife added, ``I hope you brought plenty of
Kleenex _ it will be a moving experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The reception, held in a narrow foyer of the Shubert,
appropriately was themed with Middle Eastern fare, a pianist
playing melodies from the upcoming performance, and even a display
of antique jars from Masada that were on loan from the collections
of the Institute of Archeology of Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Hors d'oeuvres tables were laden with stuffed grape leaves, filo
pastry topped with carmelized onions and goat cheese, tabbouleh,
fresh vegetables, pita and assorted dips. Tiny servings of caviar,
smoked salmon, potato pancakes, spanakopita, and other treats were
passed on orchid-trimmed trays throughout the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Among the eclectic crowd was ``Masada'' composer Shuki Levy, Lee
Iacocca, Marla Maples, Larry King, Fred Dryer, Donna Mills, Donny
and Marie Osmond, Monty Hall, Corbin Bernsen, Sugar Ray Leonard,
Jerry Buss, Paul Mazursky, District Attorney Gil Garcetti, Sheriff
Lee Baca, Los Angeles police Chief Bernard Parks and even the
Israeli consul general, Yoram Ben Ze'ev. Making the highest profile
arrival, however, was Jon Voight, the program narrator, wearing a
black scarf around his head and a white scarf draped around his
shoulder ... and a full beard.
</P>
<P>
   The performance itself _ set on a stark stage with full
orchestra _ featured Davis Gaines, known for his long-running
performances in ``Phantom of the Opera,'' in the role as leader of
the zealots. The concert ended with members of the Children of the
World Choir, wearing culturally diverse costumes and each holding a
flickering candle, in a performance that got the audience to jump
to its feet for a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ELSEWHERE IN THE CITY were numerous holiday-themed parties,
including Geary's 12 Days of Christmas party to benefit the
Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. The charity's national
spokeswoman Mary Steenburgen was among the guests who helped raise
$1 million for the charity by bidding on jewels and gifts donated
by Cindy Crawford, Tiger Woods, Helen Hunt, Mel Gibson and Tom
Hanks. The event was held at Geary's in Beverly Hills, and
co-hosted by In Style magazine.
</P>
<P>
   AND AT THE REGENT Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, the
United Hostesses' Charities presented Dr. Alfred Trento with the
1998 Humanitarian Award. Trento is chairman of Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center's Cardiothoracic Surgery division.
</P>
<P>
   The 56th annual dinner dance was planned by Donna Weintraub and
Roya Geiderman as a benefit for Cedars-Sinai and the Didi Hirsch
Community Mental Health Center in Culver City.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar De La Hoya Foundation held its second annual Evening
of Champions gala at the Beverly Hilton Hotel and honored Sylvester
Stallone. According to De La Hoya, ``He was an inspiration to me
while I was growing up. Watching him in the first `Rocky' movie
taught me to never give up and always go for my goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Also honored were Richard Naula, president of Starwood Hotels
and Resorts; Jim Lampley of HBO Sports; and Robert Alcazar,
co-founder of the Oscar De La Hoya Youth Center. &QL;

THERE'S A BIG UPSIDE TO DOWNSIZING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When economist Timothy Martin offered his perspectives at the
Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce economic outlook breakfast
last week, he provided an interesting insight that helped explain
how a low jobless rate coexists with relentless corporate
downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, senior economist with NationsBank Corp., mentioned in
passing a phenomenon he characterized as ``trophy layoffs.'' The
implication was that when companies trumpet plans for massive
layoffs, they're playing to Wall Street in hopes of a favorable
reaction by stock analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The eventual reality, however, is that subsequent downsizings
don't prove as devastating to the employees at risk as the
announcement portends. The downsizing is often achieved largely by
attrition, and actual layoffs aren't nearly as extensive as
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   If Martin's insight is valid, it makes some sense of one of the
most puzzling economic developments of the '90s. While downsizing
has continued apace, the unemployment rate has declined to levels
not seen in a generation. Meanwhile, the economic expansion is
nearing a record duration for peacetime, and job creation has been
extremely strong.
</P>
<P>
   While these events are obvious, most average Americans tend not
to question the apparent anomaly of plentiful jobs and
announcements of massive layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Martin know that the rest of us don't?
</P>
<P>
   He probably knows to look beyond media coverage for his economic
insights. MediaNomics, the Media Research Center's periodic
critique of business and economics reporting, recently noted how
journalists usually fail to make the connection between
restructuring and U.S. economic strength.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the biggest companies are boasting of getting leaner and
meaner, the small and mid-sized companies continue hiring at a
``stupendous clip.'' The article quotes a recent Investor's
Business Daily story explaining how ``new jobs are being created
faster than the government can count in sectors of the economy that
barely existed two decades ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin reminds us that there may be a lot less to the announced
Big Business layoffs in recent years than meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Why do reporters fail to get beyond what big corporations are
saying and what's really happening? It probably gets back to the
media's traditional mind-set. First of all, bad news gets a lot
more attention than good news. Beyond this, journalists generally
don't cut Big Business much slack. When megamergers occur, this
leads to the obvious themes of how the robber barons are banding
together to take over the world and crush the proletariat under
their oppressive heels.
</P>
<P>
   What nobody seems to notice, though, is that America's
proletariat has become the beneficiary of the most prosperous
economy in the world. The expanding economy is the result of
businesses doing what's necessary to become more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The reason most of the rest of the world is struggling is
because business leadership elsewhere couldn't summon the resolve
to meet the challenges of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're looking for something to be thankful for this
holiday season, try a decade of downsizing. Without it, America
might be in the same boat as Asia.

<P>
   The world is entering into a bold new phase of space exploration
_ somewhat quietly. In recent years, public interest has waned. Not
that space probes and space flight have become commonplace, but the
keen excitement of our love affair with space has diminished. Back
in the 1960s and '70s citizens across the nation took time out of
their busy lives to watch America's rocket launches on television.
</P>
<P>
   When 77-year-old John Glenn returned to space as one of the crew
in the shuttle Discovery last month, interest peaked momentarily.
</P>
<P>
   But few people watched the shuttle Endeavor lift off from the
Kennedy Space Center on Dec. 4 to rendezvous with the orbiting
Russian-made control module. Endeavor carried a docking port to
connect with the control module, the first two major components of
an international Earth orbiting space station.
</P>
<P>
   American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts and 14 other nations
have been working together to build the orbiting station. It will
be used for long-term space experiments and as a space outpost for
exploration into the far reaches of space.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 more important components will be added in the next
five years before the space station is completed. At that point, it
will weigh approximately one million pounds and span two football
fields.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, NASA's unmanned spacecraft, the Mars Climate Orbiter,
rocketed into space headed for Mars and will reach it next
September. In early January, the Mars Polar Lander will be sent to
burrow into the Red Planet and analyze its soil. The polar lander
will track the movement of water vapor and dust across Mars. The
orbiter will relay that information back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   NASA now plans to send a pair of unmanned spacecraft to Mars
every two years for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be long before the first explorers will travel from the
space station to the Red Planet and back. And a new age of
exploration will have begun _ one that will far exceed dreams and
accomplishments of the seafaring explorers of the 1400s.

CHRISTMAS CARD CUSTOM UNDER STRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has the Christmas card become a ball and chain?
</P>
<P>
   As busy as Americans have become, hardly anyone wants to face
the annual chore of penning individual greetings and signing dozens
of cards, addressing envelopes, and licking them shut. Not to
mention tracking down zip codes. Can't e-mail suffice?
</P>
<P>
   It's a modern quandary over a time-consuming tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Some people try to get off the hook by sending a picture of
their children, attached to a pre-printed greeting card. Others
have their names engraved in fancy lettering inside stationery.
There's no personal message, but they figure it's the thought that
counts. Still others send form letters on decorated computer paper,
recounting their family's accomplishments for the year.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who use the Web site, www.beyond.com, that sends
electronic cards via the Internet. Then there are the folks who
unabashedly send their cards after Christmas. And others are simply
cutting back.
</P>
<P>
   June Tarter doesn't want to give up on cards completely but has
trimmed her list, eliminating some of her husband's business
contacts and people she hasn't heard from in years past. ``I don't
want to be petty and say, `You didn't send me one,' '' she says.
But Tarter has already devoted several nights this month to the
task. Besides she says, ``You have such easy access to people now,
through the fax, the telephone, and e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Tarter's friends are cutting back too. Last year, she
received a note from someone saying they would send a newsletter
only every three years and, in the off years, they would send the
money normally spent on the cards to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas card sales are steady, says Michelle Buckley, a
spokeswoman for Hallmark Cards. Since about 70 percent of Americans
typically send cards, she says, the market is basically saturated.
According to Hallmark research, on average, 38 to 40 cards are sent
per celebrating household and, industrywide, 2.6 billion cards were
exchanged nationwide in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   So just what are the rules these days? What's considered tacky
in the world of Christmas card etiquette? And what exactly _ with
just six days left until the big day _ can you get away with doing
this year?
</P>
<P>
   Well, forget engraved cards. While they're a great time-saver,
they're just too impersonal, say etiquette experts. ``I can't stand
it when cards just have people's names printed on them. I would
rather not get one,'' complains Nancy Tuckerman, co-author of ``The
Amy Vanderbilt Complete Book of Etiquette.'' ``If they can't write
a few things _ `Hoping to see you. Have a great New Year's' _
forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, preprinted address labels are problematic. Says Peggy
Post, author of ``Etiquette,'' ``Sure, they cut back on time if
someone has the time to type in all those addresses. I only caution
that sometimes the envelopes don't look like personal mail. They
can look like junk mail and get tossed out.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the family form letter? Keep it short, maybe just one
page, etiquette authorities advise. ``Are people that interested in
whether your dog had puppies? Do they want to know the grades of
your children? If you just stop and think . . . the answer is no,''
says Tuckerman.
</P>
<P>
   Most people agree that pictures of children are charming.
However, if the greeting arrives after the holidays, the meaning is
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have completely given up on the tradition of card
giving. Nancy Michaels, for example, hasn't mailed Christmas cards
since 1990. Last year, she gave out Valentine's Day cards instead.
``Initially, it was a fluke. I couldn't make the deadline,'' says
the marketing consultant. Now, in business seminars, she advises
clients not to send out Christmas cards for business because she
believes they are a waste of time and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've discovered that to send a holiday card out is not the
most memorable thing you can do. You're stuck in the deluge of mail
that everyone else is sending,'' she says. ``When you send a card
out at an unexpected time, it stands out. It creates a bigger
memory. Can you remember who sent you cards last year?''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are many people who still take the
Christmas-card custom seriously _ even as prices for cards have
risen to $17 a box, and even higher. Mary Lou Andre, president of
the Organization by Design, a wardrobe management company, reports
that at least 10 of her customers requested her help in selecting
outfits for their Christmas card family portraits this year. ``The
pictures are a big deal,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Boskin, a Boston University history professor, says that
one of his close friends _ who will remain unnamed _ plans to mail
out 1,750 cards this year to business associates and family, down
from 2,500 in the past. ``These people start in August at the
beach,'' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   How many cards will Boskin send out this year? ``Zero. I send
out no cards. I celebrate Christmas. I just can't do cards. I don't
have the time and I must say I've gotten lazier. I don't want to,''
he says. Rather than cards, he says, ``I just say what I want to on
the telephone. It's much more personal.''

   CALIFORNIA -- CRIME. Behind a federal commission's new
recommendation that the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals be
restructured lies a concern over crime. Or rather, how the
explosion of crime-related cases has caused the nation's largest
circuit court, which encompasses 14 million square miles in nine

Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals be restructured into three

   LOUISIANA -- POET. When Billy Tauzin was a 21-year-old senior at
Nicholls St. University, he wrote a short story that, given the
recent events on Capitol Hill, might be grist for the tabloids, or
worse. But, besides including sex, it describes topics expressed by
such literary forms such as poetry and short stories express but
not by other forms of modern entertainment. Tauzin says this isn't

CURE FOR A BAD AIR DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENIFER HANRAHAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Get a whiff of this.
</P>
<P>
   It took long enough, but someone finally did it.
</P>
<P>
   Air, one of the last of life's necessities still freely
available to everyone, has been commodified _ packaged, marketed
and sold by a celebrity pitchman.
</P>
<P>
   At O2, Los Angeles' first oxygen bar, customers can order 20
minutes of purified, pleasant-smelling air for $13.
</P>
<P>
   Co-owners Woody Harrelson, wife Laura Louie and Richard ``Dr.
D'' DeAndrea are banking that you'll be willing to pay through the
nose for it.
</P>
<P>
   Breathing air with a high oxygen content, enthusiasts say, has
health benefits that range from boosting energy and the immune
system to relieving headaches and stress.
</P>
<P>
   No one needs this more than in Los Angeles, where bad air
actually makes the nightly news. The brownish gas we're breathing
is causing ``slow suffocation,'' O2's brochure warns. A few snorts
of oxygen can undo some of the damage, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very cleansing,'' DeAndrea said. ``It creates a
meditative balance ... People who come in here who are very
energetic get calm. People who come in here who are very calm get
more energetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, an oxygen bar has its appeal. Oxygen is low-cal and
low-fat. You can go &UR;  &LR; on a bender _ without risking a hangover!
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, many mainstream medical experts are turning up
their noses at those claims, saying no medical study supports such
assertions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no benefit to be gained, other than some vague
emotional idea you are doing something good for yourself,'' said
Dr. Bertrand Shapiro, professor of clinical medicine at UCLA's
School of Medicine. ``You're paying for a placebo effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eat. Drink. Breathe. Love.'' With a motto like that, O2 is
right at home on the trendiest portion of the Sunset Strip, between
the Sky Bar and the Viper Room in West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   DeAndrea, who has disavowed traditional medicine's reliance on
technology and pharmaceuticals, fits the part as well, looking more
like a grunge rocker in his brown ski cap and flannel shirt than a
physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life can be an endless party,'' he says, reclining on comfy,
colorful pillows with a two-pronged tube up his nose to deliver his
daily dose of canned oxygen. ``That would make everybody much
happier.''
</P>
<P>
   DeAndrea graduated from the State University of New York Health
Science Center at Brooklyn in 1991 with a degree in medicine. The
young doctor gave up meat when a woman he was interested in dating
said she would only kiss him if he promised to go vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a profound change in the way I felt,'' DeAndrea said.
``I felt stronger and more focused.''
</P>
<P>
   He soon took a job as medical director of Century Freeway
Medical Center in the Watts section of Los Angeles. What he found
there would reinforce his interest in vegetarianism. Many of his
patients, he said, were obese and suffered from chronic diseases,
including diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and arthritis. He
became convinced that their meat-based, high-fat diets were slowly
killing them, and he challenged his patients to give up meat and
dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Harrelson _ best known for his role as the lovable dolt
of a bartender on the retired sitcom ``Cheers'' _ and his wife were
listening as DeAndrea promoted his holistic medicine and vegetarian
beliefs on a now-defunct public radio show.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity couple, outspoken advocates of legalized
marijuana, invited him to their home in Beverly Hills, where the
threesome hatched the plan: Develop a concept for a place where
people could gather socially and improve their health at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the trio is peddling oxygen on tap. Customers
can listen to soothing music, gaze at the painting of the planets
on the rotunda ceiling and sample herbal elixirs or raw-food dishes
from the all-organic, nondairy, vegetarian menu.
</P>
<P>
   For $12, try Yoda's Wish pizza for one, made from sun-dried
tomatoes, spinach, pesto sauce, garlic, basil and olives on crust
made from dehydrated kamut seed _ all of it uncooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooking food destroys its enzymes, the life force in the food,
and alters its nutrients,'' said John Wood, O2's chef. ``Our food
is all alive ... You don't see any other animals cooking their food
except us, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   You can also sample a variety of herbal drinks for $6, such as
Jah Creme _ amaretto and java nut milk on the rocks, mixed with
kava kava, valerian, chamomile and hops for a ``meditative
meltdown'' in a martini glass.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like a mud slide, but tastes more like mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's supposed to taste herb-y,'' said the bartender helpfully.
</P>
<P>
   You can also order totally legal carrot cake made with hemp,
hemp burgers and blueberry hemp smoothies. Food made with this hemp
seed does not produce the same effects as, say, a hashish brownie,
since it contains no THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the primary
psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, DeAndrea said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to mention that just in case anyone wanted to
smoke our drapes,'' DeAndrea said.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes time for the main attraction _ the oxygen _
customers insert a cannula, a device with two prongs that shoots
gas into the nostrils.
</P>
<P>
   The gas _ which you can ``flavor'' with lemon, lime, orange,
joy, clarity, or energy for an extra $2 _ contains upward of 85
percent oxygen. Air normally contains about 21 percent oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Sound extra healthy? Not when you consider all the oxygen
healthy people need is right under their noses, said Shapiro, who
specializes in pulmonary disease.
</P>
<P>
   The hemoglobin in our blood is already 98 percent to 99 percent
saturated with oxygen. Upping that another percentage point isn't
going to make a significant or long-term difference in our health,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   People with pulmonary disease such as emphysema or chronic
bronchitis can benefit from breathing pure oxygen because their
blood oxygen levels are low to start with _ but they're typically
hooked up round-the-clock to a portable oxygen system.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side: there is probably nothing harmful about
breathing in purified oxygen for 20 minutes a day, Shapiro said.
While breathing 100 percent oxygen for too long can be toxic,
Shapiro said, there's little chance of that happening to anyone at
O2.
</P>
<P>
   To get the full impact of the tanked gases, you'd need a
tight-fitting mask. Using the two-pronged cannula allows most of
the oxygen to escape or to be diluted by air from the room.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, you're inhaling air that's at best about 24 percent
to 35 percent oxygen, Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of medical evidence to support any health benefits of
breathing concentrated oxygen doesn't keep bars like O2 from
sucking in new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real skeptical,'' said Los Angeles resident Daniel
Costello, 30, sampling oxygen for the first time at O2 recently.
``But it's kind of cool. I do feel relaxed and energized ...
They're going to make a profit selling good things rather than
alcohol or cigarettes.''

   Added Gina Pucci, 32, of Santa Monica: ``It's not like being
stoned or high or drunk, but it's relaxing.''

<P>
   Oxygen bars are hardly new on our polluted planet. Kevin
McFarland, chief executive officer of the O2 Zone, a Reno-based
company that manufactures oxygen bar equipment and trains new
proprietors in using it, claims that as far back as 1957, street
vendors in Tokyo offered ``shots'' of oxygen to passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   McFarland said oxygen bars opened in the late '80s in the United
States but were shut down by local, state or federal authorities
for making medical claims or using medical-grade oxygen improperly.
</P>
<P>
   Medical-grade oxygen, which has to meet stringent purity
requirements, is regulated by the FDA and can only be dispensed by
a doctor or with a prescription, said Brad Stone, spokesman for the
U.S. Food and Drug Adminstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't heard of any oxygen bar that would be in compliance
with our regulations,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, more are on their way. Las Vegas' first oxygen bar,
Breathe, opened last week. Denver and Portland are each scheduled
to get their own early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens more small-scale oxygen outlets are operating out of
tanning salons, hair salons and day spas in small cities, including
Rockford, Ill., Scottsdale, Ariz., &UR;  &LR; Jonesboro, Ga., and Cincinnati,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But how will the oxygen bar concept float in Los Angeles?
</P>
<P>
   Hyper health-conscious Los Angelenos, pioneers of questionable
self-help therapies, are already primed for it.
</P>
<P>
   We hand over a couple of bucks to men in little red jackets to
move our car 2 feet. We buy $80,000 Humvees to cruise Ventura
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   We buy bottled water that costs far more more than what comes
out of the tap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The analogy of bottled water is the best,'' McFarland said.
``In the early days, I said, `Who would pay for bottled water when
you can get it out of the tap for free?' And now look.''

   WASHINGTON _ The B-2 stealth bomber was designed to be the most
feared plane in the Air Force, able to slip undetected through
enemy radar and deliver a lethal payload. But when the United
States launched the biggest air assault since the Persian Gulf War,
the $2 billion boomerang-shaped plane was at home in a hangar. As
U.S. warplanes and cruise missiles pounded Baghdad over the past
three days, the nine B-2s the Air Force considers operational were
at Whiteman Air Force Base, near Sedalia, Mo. By MICHAEL D. TOWLE.

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL DECEMBER 20
 &HT;    Designer takes humorous, light approach
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What can one write about Carolina Herrera that hasn't been
written already?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very difficult question to answer,'' Herrera recently
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Before a ponderous silence could fully blanket the Ritz-Carlton
Buckhead suite she occupied while waiting for a runway presentation
of her spring summer '99 designs to start, Herrera's 29-year-old
daughter traveling companion fragrance collaborator, Carolina
Adriana, chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it is,'' she said, turning admiringly toward her
mother. ``You're hysterically funny. I can vouch for that. That's
never been written, but it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as Herrera, 58, matures, she seems to grow more
whimsical. She responded with laughter when asked about entering
the design business so late in life (age 40), about her love-hate
stance on public appearances, her plans for 2000 and the challenges
of staying relevant in the fickle fashion industry.
</P>
<P>
   There's an increasing lightheartedness to Herrera's designs as
well. Among the 500 women who showed up to see her Saks Fifth
Avenue-sponsored show at the Ritz, the average age was at least 45.
Yet the clothes had that sassy, clingy, sprightly look befitting
women half that age.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, black and white are the base shades of Herrera's
spring/summer '99 collection, but she livens it up with leather
pieces in lavender and fuchsia. Skirts are slit high in the front;
pants are slung low on the hips. Tops are either funneled at the
neck, or they plunge deeply in back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a younger collection because I'm inspired by the youth of
the world,'' Herrera said. ``Everything they do is fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And at this stage in the Venezuelan designer's career fun is the
main object of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have a good sense of humor,'' she said. ``I think
anything you do with a sense of humor is perfect. Someone can say
to you, `Do you remember such and such a man? He's so
good-looking.' To me, he may or may not be. But you never forget
someone who makes you laugh. Never, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Herrera on . . .
</P>
<P>
   Her Atlanta clients' tastes:
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose they're looking for what Carolina Herrera's given
them for years. . . . I give them styles that are very feminine and
sophisticated but at the same time modern. It's easy to wear. It's
not complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Her evolving design philosophy:
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion should have an extravagance to it, yet it should also
be simple. Simplicity is the basis of elegance, and that's the way
women want to look, no?''
</P>
<P>
   Her plans for 2000:
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is . . . what's new? We don't know what's going
to be new in the year 2000. Let's arrive there first, then see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Collaborating with daughter Carolina to formulate the new
fragrance 212:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an all new concept, from the packaging to the bottle to
the ad campaign to the fragrance itself. It's very light and fresh
and young, and we thought it was a great idea to bring Carolina in
to develop it.''

 &HT;    The gift of a book a reflection of who we are to the giver
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I own, or rather am owned by, roughly 2,000 books, of which
exactly seven were given to me at Christmas. It's curious how gifts
to family and friends reflect not the people they truly are but who
we think they are _ or who we are. Over the years, I've warehoused
large stocks of cologne and after-shave, grown rich in underwear,
found myself the owner of a clock that will hang on my wall only
when Time runs out and not a second sooner, lined by closets _ if
not my pockets _ in things woolen and warm.
</P>
<P>
   All of these were expressions of sincerest generosity, and were
appreciated for the thought that lay behind them. We all know
that's what counts, much more than the everyday utility of cotton
briefs.
</P>
<P>
   But the gift we appreciate like no other is the one that
reflects us. In such a case, the thought means all the more because
the giver has glimpsed something of the person we are. Among the
books that have taken over my den, study and bedroom is a copy of
E.F. Benson's ``Make Way for Lucia,'' given me 10 years ago and
inscribed by my friend and former colleague Bill Morrison.
Elsewhere is a copy of Hugh Thomas' ``The Spanish Civil War'' that
my father gave me one Christmas when he was younger than I am now.
At the time, I couldn't have told you anything of that war's
origins or its consequences, and even now couldn't write more than
a passable paragraph about it. But Thomas' book, brightly jacketed
in yellow, red-orange and black, had caught my eye and to this day
I can call up the smell of its pages when it was new. It cost all
of $10, about what I made each week delivering newspapers. My
father wasn't much of a reader, but he knew that I was, and in his
bold script (so different from my styleless scribble) he expressed
the kind of Christmas sentiments that need no ribbons or bows.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, giving books as gifts can be chancy; they are more
personal than even jewelry, to say nothing of toiletries. Unless
you know him well, you don't want to spring a novel of any
complexity on a man. He's not likely to be up to it. Men, by and
large, don't read literary fiction, just as women, by and large,
don't read serious nonfiction. Most men don't read that either,
come to think of it. When they read at all, their tastes run to
management manuals, sports biographies, stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   Disagree? Check out what the people you know read and decide for
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Yet books are popular Christmas gifts, from readers to
nonreaders, from nonreaders to readers baffled that someone would
think they'd want to read . . . . that?
</P>
<P>
   If it's better to give than to receive, it's also easier.
Receiving, in fact, can be excruciating. What writers would one be
horror-struck to find beneath the tree? Stephen King, obviously,
but that's his stock-in-trade; he wants you to be. All things
considered, I could manage a truer and brighter face for Stephen
King, maybe even Anne Rice, than I could for the pensees of certain
talk-show hosts, recycled for the congregants.
</P>
<P>
   There are books and then, of course, there is merchandise. They
might be one and the same to the clerk taking inventory. But once
in our hands, they present themselves as one or the other _ as one
more material possession, less valuable than a new sweater or new
software, or as something that speaks to what is most vital within
us.
</P>
<P>
   I don't quite believe this, but a few years ago the Gallup Poll
reported that three in five adults hoped to receive books for
Christmas. Imagine that: In a country of nonreaders, afflicted by
attention-deficit disorder, 60 percent of us are hoping there's a
book under the tree.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, the poll _ which was conducted for the
American Booksellers Association _ reported some interesting
findings. Geographically, people read more in the Northeast and the
West than we do down here in the South, but we read more than folks
in some uncharted territory identified as ``North Central'' (the
Dakotas plus Minnesota?). Places I would call the Southwest _ Texas
and wherever there's cactus _ got left out entirely. Maybe no one
reads out there.
</P>
<P>
   The rich read more than the poor, the educated more than the
uneducated and, of course, women more than men. And the young,
surprisingly, read more than the old (well, 55 and up). Exactly
what they read was not reported. For the merchandiser, it's beside
the point. All books are equal in the sight of God and the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   But for the receiver, that's precisely the point. The books we
keep are ones that read us as much as we read them. More than any
gift that comes to mind, they are a reflection of our taste and our
curiosity, our capacity for discrimination and enjoyment. On my
shelves are books read and unread, books by the hundreds that I
want to keep for as long as I live and at least as many that I
should winnow out before the start of a new year.
</P>
<P>
   But there are seven that at various points of my life meant, and
still mean, something special. They sit, unnoticed on most days,
like signposts to Christmases past _ and to ties everlasting.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Bombing Iraq is a tactical tantrum rather than part of a
well-thought out strategy. It is also as ineffective as it is
morally dubious.
</P>
<P>
   The air raids have alienated much of the rest of the world while
weakening the United Nations and the already creaky system of
international order. The bombs may rattle windows in Baghdad, but
they will not dislodge Saddam Hussein from his throne. And while
the United States and Britain can bomb on their own, they need the
rest of the world to hold the line on sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, it was bad manners to start the bombing in
the name of the United Nations without telling Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, who sounded understandably miffed that there was too
little warning to pull out the entire staff he had in the target
zone.
</P>
<P>
   It is also stretching international law to the breaking point to
invoke U.N. resolutions to justify the U.S.-British action, which
is precisely why the Russians and Chinese are so upset. If it had
been proposed anew to the Security Council, they would have vetoed
it.
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of the U.N. Security Council is collective
security: that there should be a consensus on action to avert
threats to international peace. Could Russia take action against
Indonesia and Morocco because of their defiance of Security Council
resolutions on East Timor or Western Sahara, or against Israel for
the U.N. resolutions it has defied?
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it is not just the GOP at home who suspect that the
timing of the raids tarnishes them with the suspicion of domestic
expediency in the face of impeachment. The rest of the world is
already weary with an American foreign policy that all too often
seems to be driven by domestic influences.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the legality, and the expediency, there is the
question of efficacy. There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein was
``asking for it'' by reneging on his latest promise to cooperate
with the U.N. inspectors. But since when have we decided to give
him what he asks for?
</P>
<P>
   The first casualty of the bombing is likely to be the U.N.
inspection regime, which will give Saddam even more leeway to
develop his chemical and biological warfare capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the bombings, there was a strange confluence of
interests developing between Washington and Baghdad. On the one
hand, Washington had decided that the inspections were ineffective
and left events hostage to Iraqi whims. On the other, Baghdad's
weapon-fetishists worried that the shell game they had been playing
would fail sometime and that the inspectors would produce damning
evidence of their dissimulation.
</P>
<P>
   So the current policy seems to have just evolved. The bombing
implies abandoning the inspection regime, trying to maintain
sanctions, perhaps plugging the considerable leaks which benefit
the regime directly, and hoping that someone, sometime, will topple
Saddam. However, that is almost as much of a non-policy as the
bombing itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has often implied that the aim of
sanctions is the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. But that is not what
other members of the United Nations think, no matter how much they
would like to see the back of him. Without the inspection regime
that sanctions are supposed to enforce, it will be difficult to
persuade cooperation from the rest of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, apart from its dubious morality, starving
populations into rebellion has not worked in Cuba, nor is it likely
to work in Iraq. Even if it did, in the Darwinian world of Iraqi
politics, anyone who replaces Saddam Hussein is likely to be even
nastier.
</P>
<P>
   If sanctions are to be maintained with continued international
support after the bombing, the relevant U.N. resolutions need
revision. This means refining the sanctions so that they target the
regime rather than its Iraqi victims, which would offer a trade-off
to Russia, China and other critics of the effect of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The administration will also have to promise ``light at the end
of the tunnel'' for Iraq, the eventual lifting of sanctions in
return for cooperation on disarmament. This might then allow the
inspectors and monitors to reenter Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is a crumbling of the sanctions regime and a
further erosion of the U.N.'s standing, with occasional salvos of
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of hardware against a defiant
Saddam Hussein.

question of efficacy. There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein was
``asking for it'' by reneging on his latest promise to cooperate
with the U.N. inspectors. But since when have we decided to give
him what he asks for?
</P>
<P>
   The first casualty of the bombing is likely to be the U.N.
inspection regime, which will give Saddam even more leeway to
develop his chemical and biological warfare capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the bombings, there was a strange confluence of
interests developing between Washington and Baghdad. On the one
hand, Washington had decided that the inspections were ineffective
and left events hostage to Iraqi whims. On the other, Baghdad's
weapon-fetishists worried that the shell game they had been playing
would fail sometime and that the inspectors would produce damning
evidence of their dissimulation.
</P>
<P>
   So the current policy seems to have just evolved. The bombing
implies abandoning the inspection regime, trying to maintain
sanctions, perhaps plugging the considerable leaks which benefit
the regime directly, and hoping that someone, sometime, will topple
Saddam. However, that is almost as much of a non-policy as the
bombing itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has often implied that the aim of
sanctions is the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. But that is not what
other members of the United Nations think, no matter how much they
would like to see the back of him. Without the inspection regime
that sanctions are supposed to enforce, it will be difficult to
persuade cooperation from the rest of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, apart from its dubious morality, starving
populations into rebellion has not worked in Cuba, nor is it likely
to work in Iraq. Even if it did, in the Darwinian world of Iraqi
politics, anyone who replaces Saddam Hussein is likely to be even
nastier.
</P>
<P>
   If sanctions are to be maintained with continued international
support after the bombing, the relevant U.N. resolutions need
revision. This means refining the sanctions so that they target the
regime rather than its Iraqi victims, which would offer a trade-off
to Russia, China and other critics of the effect of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The administration will also have to promise ``light at the end
of the tunnel'' for Iraq, the eventual lifting of sanctions in
return for cooperation on disarmament. This might then allow the
inspectors and monitors to reenter Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is a crumbling of the sanctions regime and a
further erosion of the U.N.'s standing, with occasional salvos of
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of hardware against a defiant
Saddam Hussein.

PEOPLE CAN'T AGREE ON WHAT'S NATURAL AND WHAT'S NOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
(lb) 
 By TIMOTHY EGAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When people look for nature without adornment, they often end up
in Alaska, the American Eden. But five years ago, the governor of
Alaska said something was horribly out of whack in the wilds of the
Last Frontier state. There were too many wolves, he felt. Wolves
eat moose, the preferred prey of human hunters. To keep more moose
alive so they can be shot by predators on two feet, wolves had to
be killed, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't just let nature run wild,'' said Gov. Walter Hickel,
a Republican, who retired in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about nature, which supposedly answers to its own
call, that is forever drawing people into debate over how to shape
it, worship it or use it? Nature is constantly being invoked in one
moral crusade or another, as evidence of the wonders of God, or as
a warning about the excesses of humans. It has been hopelessly
anthropomorphized. It has wrath, fury. It is art, poetry,
perfection and, in bad moods, cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A perennial question in the open space of the West is whether
wild horses should run free or be given up for adoption. Yet wild
horses are not wild at all. They are descendants of domesticated
Spanish animals brought to the upper Rio Grande Valley more than
400 years ago. So who has nature on their side?
</P>
<P>
   Glacier National Park in the northern Rockies may soon be
without any glaciers. Is it a victim of a globe warmed by
industrial society on hyperspeed, or just further natural
adaptation?
</P>
<P>
   Or what about a meticulously sculptured courtyard garden? Does
that have anything to do with the natural world, or is it just
flora on a short leash? Certainly, the best British gardeners do
not consider their hedgerows anything less than natural.
</P>
<P>
   Even philanderers of late have taken comfort in the new work on
the sexual proclivity of animals. The new thinking goes: Males need
promiscuity to keep the gene pool healthy; females crave alpha-male
security (rich guys) for the same reason. The tag line is the same:
Sorry, honey, it's nature's way.
</P>
<P>
   These attitudes are so human that they seem, well, natural. In
his new book, ``Nature: Western Attitudes Since Ancient Times''
(University of California Press), the British author Peter Coates
gives an exhaustively detailed account of the ever changing history
of nature, mostly tied to the political goals of the times. What is
surprising is how little has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every culture projects its values onto nature and holds them
up as nature's own authority,'' writes Coates, a senior lecturer in
the Department of Historical Studies at the University of Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   Modern interpretations of nature, Coates writes, came from late
18th- and early 19th-century romantic poets, for whom an orchid was
the essence of physical sublimity, but anything touched by man was
outside the bounds of aesthetic purity.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient Greece, nature was viewed by leading philosophers as
a system and not a physical thing. Human thought, no matter where
it strayed, was as natural as a river flowing downhill. But of
course the Greeks included that most elusive of human attachments _
a soul, or spirit _ in their discussion of what was ``natural.''
Aristotle believed every living thing had a soul, but a human soul
was different from that of, say, a bottom fish.
</P>
<P>
   The Romans continued the debate of Aristotle and others, to a
point. But in the process of expanding and feeding their empire,
they stripped much of the natural world bare, and their
rationalizations followed. The areas around Rome and Athens were
once heavily forested, and North Africa was such a fecund place
that half a million tons of wheat was exported annually, in the
first century A.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of all the trees consumed by the furnaces in the
ubiquitous Roman public bath,'' writes Coates. The Romans justified
this plundering because they were creating, in the words of Cicero,
``a second world within the world of nature.'' They felt duty-bound
to fashion such a construct.
</P>
<P>
   Rome fell, in the view of many modern environmental historians,
because it simply expanded to the point of being an unsustainable
beast. Others saw a moral failing, another persistent line of
thought about nature's role. In this view, Roman leaders became too
fat, lazy and promiscuous and lost their place atop the hill.
</P>
<P>
   What the Romans bequeathed to Europe was the idea that the
countryside, wild and natural, was a balm for the soul. Sprawl was
not a good thing. Cities had walls. The rural ``outside'' was
sacred because of its material and spiritual utility.
</P>
<P>
   For European Christians, the great green saint was Francis of
Assisi, who communed with birds, snakes and wolves in such a way
that he could very likely win a seat on the Sierra Club board of
directors today. St. Francis, who died in A.D. 1226, was of the
school that materialism corrupts, because it leads to detachment
from the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   But some historians have argued that when young Francis gave up
his silk garments to his father, it was not so much a first step on
the road to ecological divinity as it was a reaction to the
excesses of a corpulent church.
</P>
<P>
   St. Francis remains a powerful figure, as any visitor to the
Umbrian forest where he used to hike can attest. Pope John Paul II,
in a 1989 environmental address in which he cautioned against
deforestation and global warming, praised St. Francis for keeping
``ever alive a sense of fraternity with all those good and
beautiful things which almighty God has created.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Coates says St. Francis is one of the more striking examples
of how figures from the past are made over in a modern image to
suit political demands on the environment. Animal rights activists
recite the tale of St. Francis releasing a rabbit from a spring
trap, while green poets have made him out to be a medieval
Wordsworth, says Coates.
</P>
<P>
   A century after the death of St. Francis, bubonic plague, or the
Black Death, wiped out upward of a third of the population of
Europe. The catastrophe has been interpreted differently by
virtually every generation since. It was the revenge of nature for
a world gone bad. It was nature culling itself of the weakest
elements of society, a Darwinian view. It was an extreme example of
what can happen when people pollute their land and rivers without
care for consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Modern plagues have been similarly interpreted. A few years ago,
Pat Buchanan, a Republican presidential candidate in the primary
elections, said that AIDS was nature's way of punishing
homosexuals. More recently, the television evangelist Pat Robertson
said a hurricane might strike a community in Florida that had shown
a bit too much tolerance for gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   In America, nature was long thought to be pristine and inviolate
until the arrival of Europeans. The French, who coined the phrase
``noble savage'' to describe indigenous Americans, were
particularly fond of this view.
</P>
<P>
   Some of today's environmentalists see nature's revenge in the
gradual warming of the earth and its stormy hissy fits along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred years ago, after the Americans had wiped out most of
the bounteous bison of the West and removed the native people who
had lived on those animals, there came a great die-out of domestic
cattle. A long, bitter winter left cowboys without cows, and the
Indians saying, ``Told you so.'' It was, many people still believe,
nature's blow against the attempt to erase much of the native West.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the Great Plains tribes, who used to start big
grass fires to drive bison off a cliff? By some estimates, up to 90
percent of a herd was wasted. It may have been natural or simply
crafty and wasteful, no different from Roman excess.
</P>
<P>
   Americans embraced nature in a burst of nationalism around the
middle of the last century. The Grand Canyon was sniffed at by the
Spanish in the 16th century; it rated barely a mention. But after
John Wesley Powell breached the canyon in a wooden dory in the
1860s, the United States went wild over its big ditch, as Stephen
J. Pyne documents in his new book, ``How the Canyon Became Grand: A
Short History'' (Viking Press).
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Europe had magnificent cathedrals, and Asia had
wonders of ivory and porcelain as well as cities of layered beauty,
but what the United States could boast about was nature _ and lots
of it. President Jefferson had hailed the new country as ``Nature's
nation,'' but it took the creation of the world's first national
park, Yellowstone in 1872, to link much of the United States'
identity solidly to the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Today, nature has become a commercial force; witness the growth
of natural medicine and remedies. It is debated in the impeachment
hearings, in the question of what is wrong but natural. It is
evoked in the open land of the West, as wolves are reintroduced in
an effort to restore a lost predator to the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a consistent definition, nature may simply be one of
those ever ephemeral concepts, like news. Asked to define news,
Walter Cronkite said, ``It is what I say it is.'' The same has long
been said about nature.

PHILIPPINE AIRLINES MAY NOT SURVIVE WITHOUT BAILOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ Christmas is a sacred holiday in the
Philippines, and nowhere is that more evident than at the
headquarters of Philippine Airlines. Religious statues adorn
executive offices, and signs throughout the building announce a
holiday mass in the main lobby.
</P>
<P>
   In these dark days, when its frazzled executives are struggling
to keep the airline afloat, a mass seems entirely appropriate: One
cannot help thinking that what the airline needs is divine
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   With $2.2 billion in debt, plunging revenues, and losses of
close to $1 million a day, Asia's oldest airline, known as PAL, is
in desperate shape. When negotiations for Cathay Pacific Airways to
acquire a stake collapsed earlier this month, several analysts said
the airline's options were running out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rescue effort is not just huge, it is astronomical,'' said
Nicholas Ionides, a Singapore-based editor of Air Transport
Intelligence, a news agency that covers the industry. ``The
question is, Do you keep an airline like this alive for pride
reasons? My opinion is that they should just shut it down.''
</P>
<P>
   But Philippine Airlines is not just another shipwreck of a
company. It is the nation's flag carrier, a state company until
after the ouster of Ferdinand Marcos, when it was spun off to a
group of investors led by Lucio Tan, an ethnic Chinese who traded
on his ties to Marcos to amass one of the greatest fortunes in the
Philippines. The airline is now the crown jewel in Tan's empire.
</P>
<P>
   Tan is a leading supporter of the new president of the
Philippines, Joseph Estrada, not only contributing to his campaign
but giving him the use of his planes. When a labor dispute prompted
Tan to shut down the 57-year-old airline in September, provoking
tears from nostalgic Filipinos, it was Estrada who brokered an
agreement that got the planes flying again.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Estrada, it's a mark of political prestige to save the
airline, and Lucio Tan knows it,'' said Alexander Magno, president
of the Foundation for Economic Freedom, a research organization in
Manila.
</P>
<P>
   In the murky world of Asian business, where friendships often
count more than solvency, Philippine Airlines would seem to be the
classic candidate for a government bailout. The catch is that
Estrada, wanting foreign investors to view the Philippines as
having a level playing field, has ruled out injecting any public
money.
</P>
<P>
   As the losses pile up, though, Philippine Airlines will be an
acid test for this movie-star-turned-politician, who has been in
office for six months. Estrada, 61, may find it hard not to help a
friend in need, even if it reinforces the image of the Philippines
as a den of crony capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very tough for Estrada,'' said Christian
Monzad, former chairman of the Philippine Election Commission and a
consultant to the Lopez Group, a Filipino conglomerate. ``He is
very loyal to his friends, and he would like to repay his political
debts.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrada's decision will be watched carefully in other Asian
capitals, which are grappling with similar issues. In Indonesia,
the government has refused to aid companies with ties to its fallen
president, Suharto. But in Malaysia, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad has continued to pump public money into private companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the spartan offices of Philippine Airlines, senior executives
insist they can go it alone. On Dec. 7, they submitted a
rehabilitation plan to the Philippine Securities and Exchange
Commission that would turn PAL from a sprawling national airline
into a compact carrier focused on profitable routes.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said it would prune its fleet, which was
aggressively expanded in the years leading up to the Asian economic
crisis, to 22 planes from 57. It would cut its domestic routes to
17 from 36 and its international routes to 13 from 26; among the
routes lost would be those to Los Angeles and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of routes has eroded some fond traditions here.
Philippine Airlines used to ferry home for the holidays scores of
Filipinos who work abroad _ often at cut-rate fares it can no
longer afford. On a recent afternoon, hundreds of Filipinos from
North America streamed into Manila via Hong Kong on Cathay Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a very good chance of rehabilitating this
airline, although we need the support of the major stakeholders,''
said Jaime Bautista, chief financial officer of Philippine
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, the finances do not add up. The airline says it
needs $150 million in fresh capital to overhaul its operations and
begin paying off its debt. Tan and other shareholders will come up
with $90 million, and the rest would come from new investors.
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of the talks with Cathay Pacific, analysts
said they doubted that Philippine Airlines would find a white
knight. Bautista conceded that the carrier was not talking to any
other airlines, though he has retained Chase Manhattan Bank to
scour the world for potential partners.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Bautista said, he saw nothing wrong with the
government throwing the airline a few favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A national flag carrier is very important to a country,'' said
Bautista, an amiable man whose punishing work schedule has made him
look a good deal older than his 41 years. ``Governments have always
been there to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Tan declined to be interviewed. But Bautista said the airline
deserved help because his boss had been treated unfairly by the
government. In truth, Tan's experience is more a case of ending up
on the wrong side of history. Under the Marcos regime, he made a
fortune in the cigarette and beer businesses _ in no small part
through government tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   But after Marcos was ousted in 1986, Tan got a chillier
reception from his successors, Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos. The
now 64-year-old tycoon was hit with a $1 billion tax-evasion
lawsuit that was finally dismissed by the Supreme Court in 1996.
And he no longer enjoyed preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
   None of this stopped Tan from adding to his empire. He first
invested in Philippine Airlines in 1992 and won control in 1996.
But Ramos, who was intent on privatizing the economy, opened the
industry to competition, licensing rivals like Air Philippines,
Cebu Pacific and Grand Air.
</P>
<P>
   Bautista said the new airlines competed with Philippine Airlines
on profitable routes, like flights to the resort island of Cebu.
But the government required the airline to continue serving
money-losing ``missionary routes'' _ outposts in this vast
archipelago where the planes often fly empty.
</P>
<P>
   Bautista said the government also allowed foreign carriers to
increase flights to Manila, enabling them to undercut PAL's fares.
Last week the airline asked the Estrada administration to cut back
the flights open to foreign carriers to pre-Ramos levels.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Espiritu, the finance secretary, said the government
would probably grant the request to reverse the ``unhealthy
actions'' of the previous administration.
</P>
<P>
   Magno of the Foundation for Economic Freedom said these
protections ``would restore PAL to monopoly status.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is not stopping there. Espiritu has asked several
government-affiliated banks to make bridge loans to Philippine
Airlines. The president of the Philippine National Bank, which is
already owed $81 million by the airline, has resisted the idea. But
the government is the bank's largest shareholder, with a 45 percent
stake, so he may have little choice.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is not clear that cash alone will solve the problem.
Analysts said Philippine Airlines was being choked by a bloated
payroll. The airline has trimmed its ranks from 12,986 employees to
8,589 since May. But industry experts said it would have to cut
that to 2,000 to compete with more efficient carriers like Cathay
Pacific or Singapore Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got too many employees sitting around, they get
into other problems _ they go on strike, they organize unions,''
said Jim Eckes, an aviation consultant at Indoswiss Ltd. in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a strike by employees precipitated the airline's
near-death experience in September, when Tan shut down the carrier
after its unions refused to accept a drastic cost-cutting plan.
After two weeks of frantic mediation by Estrada, the unions voted
to give up a collective-bargaining agreement in return for a 20
percent stake in the airline and three board seats.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gave Tan some breathing room to cut the payroll.
But Eckes said it would be politically untenable to trim enough
workers to make it genuinely competitive. And hacking away at costs
does not erase the carrier's debt load, which, at $2.2 billion, is
larger than its estimated break-up value of $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's creditors _ which include local and foreign banks,
plus export-import banks in the United States and Europe _ must
approve the rescue plan. But short of a nasty battle over the
airline's planes, they do not have a better option.
</P>
<P>
   Two questions now hang over Philippine Airlines. The first is
whether it is really worth saving. Some analysts contend that other
carriers already serve the most critical domestic and international
routes, and that a new airline _ without PAL's baggage _ could soon
claim the mantle of flag carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are nonemotional about it, there is no loss,'' said
David Sherman, a consultant who specializes in transportation at
A.T. Kearney in Hong Kong. ``If you are emotional about it, this is
a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The second question is: Can Philippine Airlines be saved with
Tan? In the negotiations with Cathay Pacific, he refused to
relinquish control, which ultimately doomed the talks. Bautista
said Tan was willing to hand over day-to-day operations but
insisted on retaining control of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts said no investor would put up money to revive
the airline unless it gained control. Perhaps the one person who
could ease Tan out of the cockpit is Estrada. But in an interview
last month, Estrada seemed more intent on praising Tan than on
prodding him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to admire Lucio Tan,'' he said, ``because in spite of
losing big money, I was able to prevail upon him to continue losing
money.''
</P>
<P>
   And how was the president able to do that?
</P>
<P>
   ``He has attained his goal as a billionaire,'' Estrada replied
solemnly. ``Maybe before he leaves the world, he wants to do
something for his country.''

   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACHMENT COVERAGE
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH _ WASHINGTON _ The House debates impeachment of
President Clinton. (Carr/Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   w/IMPEACH-SCENE _ WASHINGTON _ History humbug! That was the
prevailing attitude of ordinary Americans touring the Capitol as
the House debated impeachment Friday. The scene of members reciting
their now-familiar arguments to a mostly empty chamber did not live
up to most visitor's expectations of the solemn occasion. But
elsewhere on Capitol Hill, in the hallways and offices of
congressional buildings, there was a sense of the historic
importance of what was happening in the House chamber. (Dart, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ The situation at the White House,
where Clinton remained in seclusion amid hints that he and his
staff already were mapping out a strategy for how to blunt expected
stepped-up calls for the president's resignation if the House votes
for impeachment. (Deans, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PRESSURE _ WASHINGTON _ A week packed with tough peace
talks in Jerusalem, political battling against impeachment and a
war on Iraq has subjected President Clinton to an excruciating set
of pressures that few chief executives could imagine. How he's
holding up. (Deans, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   EDs: Reskedded from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-LAREACT _ Reaction of suburban New Orleans district to
news of Livingston's marital infidelity and the impeachment
debate/vote. (Konigsmark, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-GADEL _ Highlights from the Georgia delegation; what
they said and what they did. (Foskett, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-TV _ ATLANTA _ Coverage of Friday's TV, expected to be a
constant split screen between impeachment and Iraq. (Jubera,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-BAXTER _ WASHINGTON _ Column from the scene. (Baxter,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   NON-IMPEACHMENT COVERAGE
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-MONEY _ WASHINGTON _ Any candidate who wants to win
either major-party presidential nomination in 2000 will have to
raise $22 million to $25 million in 1999, leading campaign finance
experts tell us. That's more than $60,000 a day, 7 days a week. And
that's just the so-called ``hard'' money. Enforcement of federal
limits has become so haphazard that another expert says he can't
even guess at how much unregulated ``soft'' money will be raised
and spent. An explainer of why candidates must raise so much so
early, what the money is spent for, and which candidates are
favored in what pundits call ``the invisible primary.'' (Mollison,
Cox News Service).

</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-DATA _ For graphic or box.
</P>
<P>
   EDs: Moved Wedneday and to be repeated Friday. Shelf-life for
this story: Dec. 20-Jan.1.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ COVERAGE
</P>
<P>
   US-IRAQ _ BAGHDAD or WASHINGTON _ American and British bombers
began a third day of bombings amid indications that the U.S.
strategy is to remove Saddam Hussein by turning his military and
security forces against him. U.S. aircraft dropped leaflets in
southern Iraq warning Iraqi forces there that they will be targeted
if they try to attack neighboring Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, but will
be spared if they stay in their bases. Meanwhile, the Pentagon said
it is widening its list of targets. Developing. (Deans/Kaplow, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   w/IRAQ-ATTACKS _ BAGHDAD _ The stories of some of the several
dozen Iraqi people who have been injured in the three days of
attacks by U.S. and British forces. The story will be topped with
an Iraqi marine engineer who has visited, and liked the United
States. That is, until one of the missiles literally landed in his
living room. He now wants Saddam to take revenge. Developing.
(Kaplow, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin was
joined by leaders from across the country Friday in denouncing the
U.S. and British attacks on Iraq and demanded an immediate halt to
the campaign. Top military leaders warned that Russia's relations
with the United States and the West may be seriously damaged by the
U.S. attack on Iraq, wiping out years of progress since the end of
the Cold War. And the Foreign Ministry said it had recalled
Russia's ambassador to Britain for urgent consultations -- a day
after it did the same thing with the Russian ambassador to
Washington. Developing. (Holmes, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-WOMEN _ WASHINGTON _ Seven years after the U.S. Senate
lifted a 43-year-old ban on female pilots in combat, several women
on the USS Enterprise are flying fighter aircraft in the Persian
Gulf. The conflict marks the third time in American history women
have flown fighter planes under fire. Developing. (Monroe, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-CHAPLAINS _ ATLANTA _ The holidays can be a stressful
period, even in times of peace. Add a military action, and the
stress level soars _ especially for people in the military. We talk
with military chaplains at bases around Atlanta, to see what they
are telling military personnel and their families as U.S. forces
continue bombing Iraq. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   EDs: Expected to begin moving by 5 p.m. EST in both the
International and Commentary categories.
</P>
<P>
   NATION
</P>
<P>
   WATERWARS _ MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ The Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa
River Basin Commission meets, 10 a.m., Montgomery Civic Center. At
11 a.m., Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin Commission
meets, Montgomery Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Governors from three states expected too extend the deadline for
reaching a setlement in the interstate water war. (Seabrook,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   TX-CLEMENCY-BUSH _ Amid what has become international clamor
about the state's clemency system. Gov. George W. Bush says it
would take a ``compelling argument'' to get him to support any
changes. The current system, says Bush, works fine. He fears that
opening the system would lead to another trial. (Herman, Austin
American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   TELEMARKET-FRAUD _ Federal and state investigators hold a news
conference concerning results of and undercover operation that
targeted fraud among telemarketers. Charges have been filed against
nearly 1,000 telemarketers. (Tanamachi, Austin American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   HOLOCAUST-DEBATE _ ATLANTA _ In the strongest move against them
to date, Georgia State University's University Senate has passed a
resolution condemning the anti-semetic actions of the Committee for
Open Debate on the Holocaust. For the past three years, GSU's
student newspaper, The Signal, has published advertisments tauting
CODOH's revisionist Holocaust theories. (Suggs, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE/MEDICINE
</P>
<P>
   AIDS _ ATLANTA _ The FDA today approved a new AIDS drug, Ziagen,
a twice-daily tablet manufactured by GlaxoWellcome. Ziagen belongs
to the same class of drugs as AZT, the granddaddy of HIV drugs _
but it's much more powerful, plus isn't expected to have the same
negative side effects as other recent AIDS drugs. (Kim, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

send this one to Waco because of the Hall of Fame there. (Wear,

ROLE OF A LIFETIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; With her Cover Girl complexion and prom-queen
smile, it might seem perverse that Ingrid Boydston's all-time
favorite character role was a repulsive swamp hag in the immortal
drama ``Terror by Gaslight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to murder this girl on stage,'' says Boydston, her dark
eyes gleaming happily at the memory. ``It required a lot of
burping, so I had to guzzle cream soda all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, nobody said this was Shakespeare, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Her directing debut? ``I Only Have Fangs for You,'' a Halloween
spoof that even Boydston admits had ``a terrible, terrible
script.''
</P>
<P>
   Saintly teachers. Pure-hearted saloon girl. Naughty housewives.
Merry murderesses. In the world of small-town community theater,
the 33-year-old schoolmarm with the personality that would make
Pollyanna sound like a cynic may be the closest thing going to
Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   Why, out here in Canyon Country folks still talk of Boydston's
tour-de-force as Anne Sullivan in last summer's Canyon Theatre
Guild production of ``The Miracle Worker.'' Never mind that the
theater's dirt-gravel remoteness, at the edge of the Angeles
National Forest, often makes passers-by mistake it for a biker bar.
</P>
<P>
   If Michael Ovitz had been in the audience one of those nights,
who knows? Maybe Boydston wouldn't still be working at Santa
Clarita Elementary School, where two months ago she was named one
of five California Teachers of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In live theater, it's very hard to make people cry, but they
were crying at `The Miracle Worker','' says Canyon Theatre Guild
artistic director Ben Boydston, who happens to be Ingrid's husband.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Boydston's true-life roles have been equally
gut-wrenching. Like the time two years ago when one of her
students, a bright, gentle boy named Paul Youhanian, was shot dead
off-campus for no earthly reason.
</P>
<P>
   Or back in 1990, when Boydston _ then a 20-something Hollywood
party hound and celebrity wannabe _ was cruising Sunset Boulevard
in a midnight blue convertible, wondering why her super-cool
lifestyle was leaving her so empty and miserable.
</P>
<P>
   That was around the time when Ben Boydston first walked into
Ingrid's life and helped her realize that her true calling wasn't
to be found in trendy nightclubs, but in a sun-streaked classroom
on Seco Canyon Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband calls it `wounded bird syndrome','' Boydston
explains. ``He has it, too. You want to save the world. Because he
saved me, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   But we're getting ahead of our story.
</P>
<P>
   In the dizzying weeks since she was named a Teacher of the Year
_ the only person from L.A. County so honored _ Boydston and her
school have been basking in the afterglow. Practically every TV
crew in town has beaten a path to Room 15 of Santa Clarita
Elementary, where Boydston has taught sixth grade for nearly 11
years.
</P>
<P>
   To call Boydston prime TV material would be an understatement.
She seems a figure straight out of central casting, this upbeat,
ferociously dedicated young woman with the long blond hair and the
goofy sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could bottle her enthusiasm in the classroom, you could
sell it,'' says Karen Blackwell, the school's head teacher. ``A
down day for Ingrid is a good day for other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Boydston's camera-ready persona even caught the attention of the
``The Donny and Marie Show,'' which invited her entire class in for
a taping session last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited, because that's my age group,'' Boydston gushes.
``We grew up with Donny and Marie lunch pails!''
</P>
<P>
   Then the date got postponed. Indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids were so deflated,'' Boydston sighs. ``I felt
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she has enjoyed the spotlight enormously, Boydston says
she's now eager to ``get back to normal,'' both in and outside her
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'd be really bad at being famous,'' she says
modestly.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, when the Canyon Theatre Guild wraps up its year-end
production, ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' Boydston will be glad to be
just another pretty face in the Potterville mob.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seven lines and six costume changes,'' she says
cheerfully. ``If you blink, you'll miss me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, that's show biz. One minute you're the star, the hometown
hero. The next, it's back to the daily grind, working unseen
miracles here and there, but mostly just trying to get 28
hormonally restive kids ready to inherit the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Oops, there's the 8:20 a.m. bell! We'll be late for class!
</P>
<P>
   Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap!
</P>
<P>
   Whenever someone visits Room 15, Mrs. Boydston and her students
stop whatever they're doing and break into applause. Even if it's
only Myron Groch, the school's vigilant yet easygoing principal.
Clap! Clap! Clap!
</P>
<P>
   It's one of many small touches that make Room 15 feel more like
a home than a learning factory.
</P>
<P>
   On the room's south wall, Boydston's students have painted
vibrant murals of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Great
Pyramids and other Wonders of the World they'll be studying this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the teacher's desk is the class motto: ``Take PRIDE in
yourself, have CONFIDENCE in your Abilities, the COURAGE to do your
Best and COMPASSION for Humankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Another chart lists the duties of class officers, including Hero
of the Week. This accolade goes for top all-around citizenship, an
achievement Boydston rates higher than a perfect test score.
</P>
<P>
   ``For being such a wonderful community and a great district, in
my 10 years here I've dealt with murder, suicide, incest, divorce,
abandonment and substance abuse,'' Boydston says. ``In our valley!
That's (why) I feel so strongly that half my job is teaching them
things they need to know _ and the wisdom to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason students like Mrs. Boydston so much is that she's a
terrific ham. Strolling the classroom, she reads aloud from books
like ``Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,'' nailing the
Oompa-Loompas' accents on the very first take.
</P>
<P>
   She's forever dreaming up new incentives and gently probing for
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can disagree, and it can still be right,'' she'll tell the
sea of quizzical faces. ``Think, think, think! You can't be wrong,
so take the risk!''
</P>
<P>
   When the classroom gets too noisy, a steady look from Mrs.
Boydston is all that's needed to restore calm. Spend a day in Room
15, and you begin to wonder: Does this woman ever stop smiling?
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to hate science and social studies, and she makes it
fun,'' says Jessica Oliver, 11. ``Mrs. Boydston just makes
everything so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though seldom as easy as it looks, of course.
</P>
<P>
   When her pupil Paul Youhanian was killed in October 1996, many
of his classmates were ``incapacitated with anger,'' Boydston says.
They drifted into her class seeking comfort. What could she do but
sit and listen?
</P>
<P>
   ``The private side of Ingrid is that she was devastated, but she
never missed a day of school,'' says principal Groch. ``Every day,
she put on that happy face. And then when it was time to cry, she
cried with them, and then went on.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul's death wasn't the first severe test of Boydston's chronic
optimism. A few years ago, another of her students showed up at the
annual holiday party armed and planning to harm a classmate.
Boydston somehow talked him out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Then last July, a Saugus mother was charged with four murder
counts after she allegedly dressed her four young daughters in
their pajamas, had them lie down in sleeping bags on the kitchen
floor, then doused her home with accelerant and set a fire. All
four youngsters died; three of the girls, ages 5 to 11, attended
Santa Clarita Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems like we don't have a year go by without a
tragedy,'' Boydston says. ``But it has pulled the staff together.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, among the dozen PCs and Macs in Room 15 is one donated by
Paul's parents as a gesture of remembrance and thanks to Boydston
and the school.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the wondrous high-tech classroom of the 21st century is
upon us. But some stuff never changes. Remember Elmer's Glue,
Boston Ranger pencil sharpeners, the Pledge of Allegiance,
``chocolate'' vs. ``regular'' milk for lunch, and the Dell
Paperbacks version of ``Johnny Tremaine''? They're still around,
mixed in with the in-line skates and the Bart Simpson sweatshirts.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's been the best and worst of years at Santa Clarita,
made tougher by the recent death of Boydston's beloved mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then my mind flies to some of my kids who don't have their
mom anymore or have a mom who's nothing like my mom was,'' Boydston
says. ``And then I can only be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, certain readers must surely be thinking: Enough
already! This woman's a saint! If we wanted fairy tales, we'd go
read Hans Christian Andersen!
</P>
<P>
   Boydston knows some people at first may be suspicious of what
they perceive as a cheerier-than-thou approach to life.
</P>
<P>
   So we'll let you in on a deep, dark secret: Boydston can't
resist Rice Krispies squares or chocolate doughnuts, both of which
she proceeds to wolf down during morning break in the teachers'
lounge.
</P>
<P>
   There!
</P>
<P>
   Following her luxurious 15-minute sabbatical, Boydston is back
on her feet again, leading her class in a discussion of Betsy
Byars' classic book ``The Pinballs.'' It's one of those
``realistic'' children's novels that came into vogue in the '70s,
and at first Boydston's students tittered at the characters' dated
slang and silly haircuts.
</P>
<P>
   But when Boydston gets them talking, it's clear the tale of a
girl's troubled family life has hit home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that when I get married I should really want kids,
so they'll really feel wanted,'' says Emily Bush, 11.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett Randall, whose parents named him for jazz pianist Keith
Jarrett, pipes up next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that you should never give up hope your whole
life,'' Jarrett says, ``because you've probably got about 80 years
to live, and when you think about it, one out of 80 isn't all that
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Boydston nods in agreement while managing to stifle a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she whispers: ``I live to hear what he's going to say
next!''
</P>
<P>
   Lunchtime!
</P>
<P>
   En route to the cafeteria, Boydston grabs her black Rubbermaid
lunch pail and dashes out the door. One side bears an inscription
that Ben gave Ingrid for their first Christmas. It reads: ``Ingrid
_ Making a Difference by Teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, this wasn't exactly what Boydston had in mind when
she came west from Grand Junction, Colo., a 21-year-old theater
major out to conquer the world rather than save it.
</P>
<P>
   Always, always, she had wanted to be an actress, ever since her
parents named her after Ingrid Bergman, whose performance in the
1945 schlockfest ``Saratoga Trunk'' enchanted Boydston as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had black hair and a bad foreign accent, and I still
thought it was the greatest thing in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   With five daughters to support (Ingrid was second oldest),
Boydston's family didn't have much disposable income.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we didn't know we didn't have any money. If we wanted to
play an instrument, we got music lessons. If we wanted to be in
Brownies, my mom would become the troop leader.''
</P>
<P>
   From childhood on, greasepaint coursed through her veins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd do `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' and call it `Wo
Snite and the Deven Swarves.' We thought we were hysterical.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, while majoring in theater at Mesa College, Boydston met
actress Margaret Avery (``The Color Purple''). Avery advised that
if Boydston was moving to California, she could earn money
teaching, because the state needed teachers so badly it was
allowing accelerated accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a month after landing in Southern California with a
suitcase and a $50 bus ticket, Boydston landed a job
substitute-teaching in Santa Maria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the classroom before they knew I wasn't an ax
murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   She also was holding down two other part-time jobs and taking
evening acting classes.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half later, she was hired by the Saugus Union
School District to teach at Santa Clarita. But her heart still was
serving two masters.
</P>
<P>
   Her fiance at the time was an aspiring director in the film
program at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia. The
couple had hooked up with an actor friend, and the trio began
writing and filming five-minute video shorts for Showtime's The
Movie Channel, mostly involving bogus activities performed by
celebrity look-alikes.
</P>
<P>
   Those shorts were to be their ticket into Hollywood. Almost
before she realized it, Boydston was swept up in the party-hopping,
status-digging frenzy that The Industry requires of those who covet
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to these really hideous things, like Sylvester
Stallone was throwing this fashion show for his girlfriend to be in
it, and it was like this crush of people all wanting to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   One evening, while driving to some or other club ``where some
ex-punk rocker just out of rehab was going to be appearing,''
Boydston had an epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling very disillusioned that all the events and
activities I was doing should've been making me feel wonderful and
happy and given me a sense of accomplishment, and they were empty
and fake and tragic, really.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas before if somebody had told me I was going to be in
the classroom, it would've felt like a letdown. In the classroom it
was vibrant and fun, and I felt not only did I have my own
identity, but I was helping other people find theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   That was all it took for Boydston to give herself over, body and
soul, to her sixth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   Well ... it also helped that by then she'd met Ben while
auditioning at the Canyon Theatre for Larry Shue's comedy ``The
Nerd.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben was playing The Nerd.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid thought: ``There's no way I could like this guy, because
he had a little ponytail back then. He had a personalized license
plate and a cell phone, and those things scared me. But I could
also see he was very talented and very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben thought: ``I want to be you, because you don't care what
anybody thinks, you're just so happy in your bubble world, and I
want to be in there with you.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, they were married.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, several other couples and their children make up
the Canyon Theatre Guild's core membership of about 40. It's a
cozy, family affair though, like most families, not without
squabbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things aren't going right here, I get very nervous _ if
people's marriages aren't working out or whatever,'' Boydston says.
</P>
<P>
   More wounded bird syndrome?
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably,'' she admits. ``But I can't help it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving school for a dress rehearsal, Boydston shows a
visitor the little memorial garden that the school built for Paul
Youhanian, the boy who was killed. It's a lovely oasis of native
California plants and shrubs, with a short brick path and a
solitary bench. Principal Myron Groch did all the brickwork
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that little teddy bear topiary that gets to me
sometimes,'' Boydston finally says.
</P>
<P>
   By 7 o'clock, the theater is humming with activity _ costumes
being fitted, sets hammered, lines loudly rehearsed. Boydston won't
be needed for a while, so she offers her visitor an impromptu
backstage tour.
</P>
<P>
   She pushes open a rickety door and steps outside. It's a perfect
California winter night, cool and serene. Not a breath of wind can
be heard in the surrounding canyons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'll sit out here and just hear the audience
laughing,'' she says softly, ``and it's so quiet, and you can see
the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimly, the voices of her fellow thespians drift through the air.
Soon, Boydston will rejoin them. But for now she's happy savoring
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a good idea. Because, as Jarrett reckoned, you've
probably got about 80 years to live.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes one moment of quiet reflection can make all the
difference.

 &HT;    WOMEN FIGHTER PILOTS BREAKING GENDER BARRIER ON IRAQI MISSIONS
 &HT;    With US-IRAQ-1219.
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seven years after the U.S. Senate lifted the ban on
using female pilots in combat, several women on the USS Enterprise
are flying fighter aircraft in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Although their names are not yet being released, nine female
pilots and seven naval flight officers are serving on the
Enterprise aircraft carrier, said Lt. William Day, a spokesman in
the U.S. Navy's Office of Information.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States and Britain launched a third wave of air
strikes on Iraqi military targets on Friday, the crew on the
aircraft carrier continued to play an integral role in what has
been dubbed, Operation: Desert Fox. The air strikes began
Wednesday, following an order by President Clinton, with the goal
of reducing Iraq's capability to threaten neighbors with weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   According to Day, the female pilots and naval flight officers on
the Enterprise have been flying the F-14B Tomcat, F/A-18C Hornet
fighters, EA-6B Prowler radar jammers, E-2C Hawkeye early warning
aircraft, S-3B Viking anti-sub aircraft and HH-60H Seahawk
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The use of women in combat is not without precedent, but until
recently was an extremely rare occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1991, the Senate voted to lift a 43-year-old law that
banned military women from flying combat missions. Although the
measure did not require the Navy and Air Force to use female
pilots, the Pentagon announced in 1993 that it would let women
pilot combat aircraft and assume other front-line roles.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1993, women had flown transport and tanker aircraft for
some time. However, the first time they served as pilots in combat
planes was from 1993 to 1995 during the Bosnia peacekeeping
mission, ``Deny Flight,'' Navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Women have also flown in the ongoing Operation: Southern Watch,
where they helped monitor the ``no-fly'' zones in Southern Iraq
after the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Although women have become an increasingly significant part of
the armed forces, critics were skeptical of exposing women to
violence by putting them directly in the line of fire. Women argued
that the prohibition against using their skills in combat hurt
their chances to be promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Day balked at the past controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its a non-issue for us,'' Day said. ``They're all pilots
whether they are male or female. We have great aviators, we have
great sailors, and gender is not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 222,000 women in the 2,034,000-member U.S.
armed forces. About 35,000 women served in the Gulf War. Eleven of
them died there, five in combat, according to news accounts.

<P>
   The trip from gown to town can be a bumpy one. Just ask anyone
who has invested in small-capitalization stocks. According to a
number of impressive academic studies, small-company stocks have
significantly outperformed their larger-cap brethren over the long
term _ a pattern known as the small-cap premium. Yet in the real
world over the last 15 years, despite spurts of outperformance,
small caps have generally lagged behind.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the performance of the Dimensional Fund Advisors 9-10
Small Co. fund, the index fund that most closely follows the
methodology of the academic studies. It invests in the 20 percent
of New York Stock Exchange stocks with the smallest market
capitalizations, as well as companies of similar size on the
American Stock Exchange and NASDAQ; such companies, on average, are
much smaller than those in the typical small-cap fund.
 &UR;  &LR;  DFA 9-10 Small Co. produced a 10.7 percent annualized return over
the last 15 years, through Nov. 30, according to Lipper Inc.,
versus 17.2 percent for the Vanguard Index 500, which tracks the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, a large-cap benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, small-cap stocks have rallied forcefully since
August, leading some people to predict that they will soon reassert
their historical dominance. But so far, such a belief is proving,
as Samuel Johnson once said, to be a triumph of hope over
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as the small-cap rally has been, the large caps have
performed even better: The Index 500 gained 22.5 percent from Aug.
31 to Dec. 11, versus 13.4 percent for the DFA fund.
</P>
<P>
   Several schools of thought have emerged to explain what is
happening to the small-cap premium. Each appears to hold a portion
of the truth.
</P>
<P>
   According to one school, it was wrong to ever think that the
small-cap premium was very large in practice. This group says
academic studies were seriously flawed because they ignored the
higher transaction costs incurred when trading small stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Those costs are substantial, according to research by Donald B.
Keim, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University
of Pennsylvania. Keim looked at the total costs of trading _ not
only commissions and bid-asked spreads, but also the impact of
trading on the prices of securities being bought or sold _ between
1991 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He found that total trading costs for the buying and selling of
the smallest stocks were sometimes more than 7 percent. For the
largest stocks, by contrast, they were about one-half of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such costs can quickly devour the small-cap premium. According
to Ibbotson Associates, a Chicago research firm, that advantage,
before trading costs, was just 3 percent, annualized, from 1925
through 1981. (Comparable figures are difficult to obtain after
1981, when Ibbotson started taking trading costs into account.)
</P>
<P>
   Does all this mean that the small-cap premium was a figment of a
few finance professors' misguided methodology? Some people say yes,
but Economics 101 tells us otherwise. Assuming a relatively
efficient market, small-cap stocks must outperform large caps over
the long term, in order to reward investors for their greater risk
and lower liquidity. This school holds that there must be a
small-cap premium in reality, not just in theory.
</P>
<P>
   If so, transaction costs are at most a contributing factor in
explaining the lack of a small-cap premium over the last 15 years.
One factor that can explain it is the growing institutional
dominance of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   According to two Harvard professors, Paul A. Gompers and Andrew
Metrick, the fraction of the United States stock market held by
large institutions nearly doubled from 1980 to 1996, from 28
percent to 52 percent. But, for a variety of reasons _ including
restrictions on what percentage of a company's outstanding stock
such investors can hold _ only a tiny amount of that institutional
ownership is in small caps. This has hurt the performance of small
caps by reducing the demand for them, relative to large stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the increasing institutional dominance of the
market has led to enormous stock market share being shifted from
small caps into large caps. No wonder that the small caps have had
such a hard time keeping up.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for small-cap investing is that this trend can't
last forever. And when it stops, or reverses, large caps will no
longer enjoy their performance advantage. No one can pinpoint when
this will happen, but the longer it takes, I believe, the stronger
the small caps' subsequent performance.
</P>
<P>
   Small caps will someday outshine large caps again. Yet even this
silver lining is accompanied by a gloomy cloud. The small caps'
relative advantage will not be big enough to pay the huge
transaction costs that would accompany frequent trading. &QL;

 &HT;    Food a major source of holiday comfort and joy
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not necessarily the family and friends that make
you feel so good during holiday celebrations _ it could be the
food.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday meals are a particularly strong concoction of
stimulants, sedatives and chemical aphrodisiacs. And between large
portions _ the average meal can contain up to 4,500 calories _ and
a heavy leaning toward carbohydrates, the traditional Christmas
feast can be a boon to diners' bodies and moods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're power-packing all the nutrient supplies in your body,''
said Kathleen Zelman, a Marietta(Ga.) dietitian. ``But let it be an
occasional indulgence because along with all those nutrients, come
a lot of excess calories.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, about a third of a traditional turkey holiday
meal is made up of carbohydrates, another 30 percent in protein,
and another 35 percent in fat, Zelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Carbohydrates, found in the desserts, rolls and the cranberry
sauce, can raise the levels of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is
an organic compound that at high doses gives a sense of calm and
well-being, according to Mitchell Ghen, a doctor of osteopathy at
the Atlanta Institute of Anti-Aging and Chronic Disease in
Dunwoody(Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   ``They stimulate the part of the brain that makes you feel kind
of good, kind of relaxed,'' he said. ``That's why Christmas is so
hard, because everyone is giving out the carbohydrates of the best
kind _ Godivas and the like.''
</P>
<P>
   Some historians even speculate that the rich meals in the fall
and winter were actually used as a natural buffer to the winter
blahs.
</P>
<P>
   A carbohydrate-rich, not a protein-rich, meal also increases the
level of tryptophan in the brain, making diners sleepy, according
to the National Turkey Federation. ``They often associate the
drowsiness they feel with the turkey,'' which contains tryptophan,
the federation wrote in ``The Book of Thanksgiving.'' ``To be more
accurate, they should associate their sleepy feelings with the
increased amount of carbohydrates consumed.''
</P>
<P>
   But carbohydrates aren't the only factor contributing to the
holiday mood.
</P>
<P>
   Other stimulants lead to a sense of joy; from caffeine, found in
coffee and soda, to theobromine, found in chocolate. ``All that
caffeine consumption is like putting your foot on the gas pedal and
taking it to the floor board of the car,'' said Ghen. ``It might be
fun, but in the end, it can be pretty wearing on the body.''
Theobromine, similar to caffeine in its effect, is a diuretic and a
smooth muscle relaxant.
</P>
<P>
   And then, there are those holiday staples that have been found
to make men and women more amorous.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 30 men and 50 women, the Smell &AMP; Taste Treatment
and Research Foundation in Chicago found that pumpkin pie _ for men
_ and banana bread and Good &AMP; Plenty candy _ for women _ increased
blood flow in sexual organs.
</P>
<P>
   The spice in pumpkin pie, for example, increased penile blood
flow by about 40 percent. Women's perfume, in contrast, only
affected physiological functioning by 3 percent, said Dr. Alan
Hirsch, the institute's director and author of ``Scentsational
Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch said they did the studies to find out whether odors
affected sexuality. In men, all odors caused a sexual response; but
in women, the smells were more specific. In fact, barbecued meat
and some men's colognes decreased blood flow, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diners' moods aren't the only thing boosted by the holiday meal.
They're also getting a bevy of vitamins and minerals from the
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   A serving of sweet potatoes gives the average man four times the
recommended daily allowance of beta carotene, an antioxidant
considered to be a deterrent to cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Cranberries are packed with vitamin C, as well as ellagic acid,
which boost the immune system as well as warding off certain types
of cancer. And the green leafy vegetables have compounds called
indoles, isothiocyanates and flavones that seem to give some
protection against lung and gastrointestinal cancers, according to
the ``Good Health Fact Book.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hirsch said if you want to truly have a merry Christmas, the
best recipe is ``Good &AMP; Plentys in a jar, pumpkin pie for dessert
and banana bread on the side.''
</P>

 &HT;    For landscape architect Dan Franklin, gardens happen one step at
the time
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dan Franklin's late getting all his pansies planted
this year. Last year, he never got all his tulip bulbs in the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   It's all because the Atlanta landscape architect stays so
swamped with work he has little time to garden. That may not seem
unusual for folks who enjoy Franklin's level of success _ unless,
of course, they're his age, 83.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great,'' he says. ``I have 45 jobs on the books right
now. Busier that I've ever been in my life. I'm kicking ass and
hope it stays that way until I drop dead. And I hope that happens
right here in my garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Meet Dan Franklin, whose tongue is as acid as the soil and as
legendary as his award-winning designs and much-visited garden.
</P>
<P>
   Gardening is what keeps him young _ that and enjoying his work,
staying active in his industry, pedaling his stationary bike 20
minutes a day and downing a few cocktails in his Collier Hills back
yard.
</P>
<P>
   There, he spent eight years developing the bones of a garden,
which Franklin knew were critical before the first daffodil could
ever be planted. He knew he needed to blend the house with the
garden (he added a glassed-in gallery for viewing the landscape),
to solve drainage problems (he laid pipes all over the back yard)
to amend the poor earth so that plants would flourish (he hauled
out three dump trucks of clay and replaced it with wheelbarrow
loads of his own recipe for compost).
</P>
<P>
   Only then did he begin to plant, carefully selecting shrubs and
perennials that would perform during different times of the year.
And Franklin's garden has never wavered from his original plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the idea _ to have a plan,'' Franklin says. ``People
waste so much damn time and money not having any idea of what they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin's been planning since childhood, when an accident led
to an appreciation for homes and gardens. When he was 8, he broke
his arm so severely he was confined to an upper-body cast for three
years. ``I was so weak I couldn't play with other kids, so I helped
my mother with her gardening,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   In their Ansley Park yard, his mother grew roses and cut flowers
and his dad raised vegetables, giving Dan a basic knowledge of
gardening.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Franklin also began to admire homes being built
around town, especially those of Atlanta architect J. Neel Reid,
whom he came to know. ``He really encouraged me,'' says Franklin,
who still has a floor plan he drew at age 12 for a house featured
in a magazine photo.
</P>
<P>
   By high school, he wanted to become an architect. But because of
the Depression, Franklin was discouraged from entering the field,
so he got an economics degree at the University of Georgia. He then
worked for Royal Crown Cola for 23 years until deciding to pursue
his original career goal _ design.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Athens 25 years after graduating and in three
years earned a degree in landscape architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 40 years, Franklin would gain a reputation
throughout the Southeast for small residential designs, though he
also took on large-scale projects such as the restoration of
Barnsley Gardens and the Swan House grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few people on the national level command his knowledge
and skill of small-scale design,'' says professor Allen Stovall,
development director for the University of Georgia School of
Environmental Design.
</P>
<P>
   Since hiring him to landscape her Morningside yard, Mary
Seawell's been most impressed by Franklin's ability to visualize a
design. ``He has a great eye and is so fascinating because he knows
every plant,'' she says. ``I feel honored to have him here.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin insists there's no one project he's enjoyed more than
others because he says no two are alike. ``I don't try to copy
anything. I don't want anyone to know I've been there,'' he says.
``That's what keeps it fun. And if you don't have fun in your work,
it's not worth doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, who never married, has always worked from his home,
always employing one assistant, usually an intern seeking
on-the-job training. In his attic are drawings from the hundreds of
plans he's drafted over the years _ ones he's donating to the
university's archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a warrior,'' Stovall says. ``As a frequent lecturer, he
tries to impress upon students all the opportunities there are in
residential landscape architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, who has established a scholarship in his name at the
school, is proud of how his industry has grown in only 100 years
since Frederick Law Olmstead, designer of New York's Central Park
and Atlanta's Druid Hills, established the first training course at
Harvard University. ``The environment has become so important to
people, and the landscape profession can solve so many problems
with it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the industry isn't without its challenges.
``He comes over here every few weeks raising hell about
something,'' Stovall says. ``He's cantankerous, but we love him
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest thorns in Franklin's side is people who waste
money on landscaping by not first developing a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he recommends hiring a professional to prevent costly
mistakes. ``But if you can't afford one, read a magazine or
newspaper, or attend a seminar,'' he says. ``There's plenty of free
help out there if you just ask.''
</P>
<P>
   His own garden presents quite a strong case for planning.
</P>
<P>
   The garden, featured in Southern Living magazine and PBS' ``The
Victory Garden'' series, had been in Franklin's mind for years when
he bought the house in 1984. He looked at more than 200 before
finding what he wanted _ a house that could be opened on the back
to flow into a terraced garden.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin designed a 5-foot-by-32-foot solarium across the back
so that visitors are lured into the garden upon entering the house.
Then, work began on the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin first made the lot sunnier by taking out all but three
of the lot's 35 trees. He then graded the back yard, poured the
slab for the terrace and built block walls and steps to the upper
garden. After two years, he began digging beds, but at 2 feet
encountered standing water so spent six months laying drainage
lines. The third year, Franklin set out to amend the soil, digging
out 18 inches and replacing it with a nutrient-rich mix.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth year brought a white latticed fence, cobblestone bed
edgings and a side wildflower garden filled with bulbs, ferns and
native plants. In year five, Franklin built his ``outhouse,'' a
free-standing screened and furnished room for enjoying the garden,
stuccoed the terrace walls and planted boxwoods in the corners.
Along the way he filled the beds with bulbs and perennials such as
irises, jonquils, foxglove, yarrow, daylilies and dianthus.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth year, Franklin set out zoysia grass, which he's
since replaced with fescue after the original lawn fell victim to a
garden tour that drew hundreds. And over the next two years, he
built a water garden and paved the terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin describes the design of the main garden, roughly 36
feet wide by 58 feet deep, as ``formal simplicity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who come here seem interested in the smallness of the
place,'' he says. ``It's the perfect size because at my age I can
take care of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if there are still a few flats of pansies awaiting his
weathered hands.

worm castings and Mr. Natural hen manure compost).

<P>
   The trip from gown to town can be a bumpy one. Just ask anyone
who has invested in small-capitalization stocks. According to a
number of impressive academic studies, small-company stocks have
significantly outperformed their larger-cap brethren over the long
term _ a pattern known as the small-cap premium. Yet in the real
world over the last 15 years, despite spurts of outperformance,
small caps have generally lagged behind.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the performance of the Dimensional Fund Advisors 9-10
Small Co. fund, the index fund that most closely follows the
methodology of the academic studies. It invests in the 20 percent
of New York Stock Exchange stocks with the smallest market
capitalizations, as well as companies of similar size on the
American Stock Exchange and NASDAQ; such companies, on average, are
much smaller than those in the typical small-cap fund.
 &UR;  &LR;  DFA 9-10 Small Co. produced a 10.7 percent annualized return over
the last 15 years, through Nov. 30, according to Lipper Inc.,
versus 17.2 percent for the Vanguard Index 500, which tracks the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, a large-cap benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, small-cap stocks have rallied forcefully since
August, leading some people to predict that they will soon reassert
their historical dominance. But so far, such a belief is proving,
as Samuel Johnson once said, to be a triumph of hope over
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as the small-cap rally has been, the large caps have
performed even better: The Index 500 gained 22.5 percent from Aug.
31 to Dec. 11, versus 13.4 percent for the DFA fund.
</P>
<P>
   Several schools of thought have emerged to explain what is
happening to the small-cap premium. Each appears to hold a portion
of the truth.
</P>
<P>
   According to one school, it was wrong to ever think that the
small-cap premium was very large in practice. This group says
academic studies were seriously flawed because they ignored the
higher transaction costs incurred when trading small stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Those costs are substantial, according to research by Donald B.
Keim, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University
of Pennsylvania. Keim looked at the total costs of trading _ not
only commissions and bid-asked spreads, but also the impact of
trading on the prices of securities being bought or sold _ between
1991 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He found that total trading costs for the buying and selling of
the smallest stocks were sometimes more than 7 percent. For the
largest stocks, by contrast, they were about one-half of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such costs can quickly devour the small-cap premium. According
to Ibbotson Associates, a Chicago research firm, that advantage,
before trading costs, was just 3 percent, annualized, from 1925
through 1981. (Comparable figures are difficult to obtain after
1981, when Ibbotson started taking trading costs into account.)
</P>
<P>
   Does all this mean that the small-cap premium was a figment of a
few finance professors' misguided methodology? Some people say yes,
but Economics 101 tells us otherwise. Assuming a relatively
efficient market, small-cap stocks must outperform large caps over
the long term, in order to reward investors for their greater risk
and lower liquidity. This school holds that there must be a
small-cap premium in reality, not just in theory.
</P>
<P>
   If so, transaction costs are at most a contributing factor in
explaining the lack of a small-cap premium over the last 15 years.
One factor that can explain it is the growing institutional
dominance of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   According to two Harvard professors, Paul A. Gompers and Andrew
Metrick, the fraction of the United States stock market held by
large institutions nearly doubled from 1980 to 1996, from 28
percent to 52 percent. But, for a variety of reasons _ including
restrictions on what percentage of a company's outstanding stock
such investors can hold _ only a tiny amount of that institutional
ownership is in small caps. This has hurt the performance of small
caps by reducing the demand for them, relative to large stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the increasing institutional dominance of the
market has led to enormous stock market share being shifted from
small caps into large caps. No wonder that the small caps have had
such a hard time keeping up.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for small-cap investing is that this trend can't
last forever. And when it stops, or reverses, large caps will no
longer enjoy their performance advantage. No one can pinpoint when
this will happen, but the longer it takes, I believe, the stronger
the small caps' subsequent performance.
</P>
<P>
   Small caps will someday outshine large caps again. Yet even this
silver lining is accompanied by a gloomy cloud. The small caps'
relative advantage will not be big enough to pay the huge
transaction costs that would accompany frequent trading. &QL;

TRANSPARENT ISN'T ALWAYS EQUAL TO BEING CLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Transparency is not just for glass, water and lies anymore.
There are transparent cities, transparent economies, transparent
countries. Musical performances and compositions are praised for
their transparency. And some cosmologists even call the earliest
glimpse of the universe ``the moment of transparency.''
</P>
<P>
   Transparency International, an organization devoted to fighting
governmental corruption, is celebrating its fifth anniversary and
recently rated 100 nations from most transparent (least corrupt) to
least transparent (most corrupt).
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting in Washington, the world's finance ministers
and central bankers discussed new rules of ``financial
transparency'' that would require countries to reveal more
information to investors and make it harder to hide an impending
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell Anderson, the new director of the Whitney Museum of
American Art in New York, said of the museum's reorganization,
``We're trying to be more transparent, more lucid.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a recent essay in The New Republic, Jonathan Lear, a
philosopher and psychoanalyst, analyzed Kenneth Starr's inquiry
into President Clinton's sex life as a ``demand for transparency.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, everything is transparent. Why is this see-through
word so hot now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Transparency does seem to be an ideal in all sorts of ways at
the moment,'' and it might have something to do with ``our
confessional culture,'' said the literary critic Peter Brooks.
``People don't think they exist unless they have something to
confess.''
</P>
<P>
   Lear sees just the opposite: our passion for transparency is an
attempt to repress hidden meaning. He takes his lessons from
Sophocles: ``Oedipus thinks that the only realm is what is
transparent to the human mind,'' Lear said. He hears the oracle and
thinks he knows exactly what the prophecy about killing his father
and marrying his mother means. (Get out of town.) The only problems
for him are practical problems. What he doesn't realize is that the
gods' real message is hidden, opaque. He is blinded by the apparent
transparency.
</P>
<P>
   Before transparency there were other watchwords that captured
the spirit of their time. Thirty years ago, in ``Sincerity and
Authenticity,'' Lionel Trilling noted that after a 400-year reign,
the word sincerity _ ``the avoidance of being false to any man
through being true to one's own self'' _ was ceding its authority
to a new word: authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Trilling said authenticity suggested ``a more strenuous moral
experience'' and had ``a wider reference to the universe and man's
place in it.'' It was a deeper, darker idea than sincerity, less
polite.
</P>
<P>
   Is transparency next in the procession of moral terms?
</P>
<P>
   These days politicians, diplomats and economists can't seem to
get enough of the word. In international affairs, it has become a
synonym for ``good governance.'' Shashi Tharoor, the communications
director for the secretary-general of the United Nations, said ``a
transparent government is one that is accessible to the governed,
that lets the public know what it is doing and why.'' When
governments are transparent, he said, they ``open themselves up to
the public scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Vogl, vice chairman of Transparency International, said
the idea was that ``if we can shine light on or make transparent
the government procurement of goods and services, then the
opportunities for vendors to pay kickbacks and bribes would be
reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   How was the name chosen? ``When we looked for a name for our
organization we found that transparencia is immediately
recognizable in many languages as being connected with corruption,
especially in Latin American, Italy and France,'' Vogl said. ``They
know we're not working for Kodak.'' Besides, ``it's better than
Honesty International or Integrity International.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he admitted, it is a euphemism. ``If you talk to people
in the U.N. and the World Bank, they shudder to talk about
corruption. It's diplomatically insulting. But there is a
willingness to use the word transparency.'' Everyone understands
that ``people who are not transparent are corrupt.'' In other
words, transparency is a code word. There is opacity built into it.
</P>
<P>
   That is the paradox of transparency. It seems perfectly clear
until you really start looking at it. Which may be why the people
who have the most experience with transparency _ architects, art
historians, literary critics and philosophers _ have all learned to
distrust it.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks suggests looking at history to understand the dangers of
the word. ``Transparency was a concept that came of age during the
French Revolution,'' during the Reign of Terror, he said. ``The
Jacobins believed that if you were not transparent, you had
something to hide. You were an enemy of virtue. They sent people to
the guillotine because they were opaque.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees a new version of transparency fever now. He called the
Clinton investigation a ``fascinating perversion'' of our passion
for transparency.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who is preaching the virtues of transparency, Brooks
suggested, should read Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In ``The
Confessions,'' Brooks said, Rousseau wishes to ``make his soul
transparent to the reader's eye.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Rousseau is no dummy,'' Brooks added. ``He realizes this
is an ideal state and that there are always obstacles between
discrete beings. He realizes that language doesn't permit
transparency. In that sense, he is the source of modernity.'' He
knows that every system of representation _ whether it is a
language, a painting or a confession _ ``disguises and distorts the
truth.'' You cannot make anything that is perfectly transparent.
</P>
<P>
   It is not for want of trying. In the 1920s and '30s, the
philosophers of the Vienna Circle in Austria and the architects of
the Dessau Bauhaus in Germany found a common cause in transparency.
And it wasn't just glass that they loved.

US GIVES NO PROMISES ON END TO BOMBING DURING RAMADAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD _ From the high perch of a minaret, four leaders of a
local mosque Thursday night searched the Western sky for the first
sign of the crescent moon. They did not find it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after Saudi Arabia announced that the new moon had been
sighted in that country, Iraq joined joined other Muslim nations in
ushering in Ramadan. The holy month, a time of fasting and
prayerful contemplation, was to begin at dawn Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan carries added significance here this year, as many
Iraqis believe the United States could not continue missile attacks
during the holiest period on the Muslim calendar. Indeed, they pray
it brings the end of Operation Desert Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But US officials say they have made no such promises. And two
hours after a pink-gray sunset turned to darkness Friday, the third
night of punishing air strikes and missile attacks was getting
under way with no sign of letting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Moselm and as an Iraqi, I would hope they would not bomb
on Ramadan,'' said Abdel Hamid, the leader of the call to prayer,
after climbing down from the spiraling stairs of the minaret at the
Takwa'a, or Fear of God, Mosque.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't trust America to live up to any promises. We can
only hope that this Ramadan, God will harshly judge America and
pour His anger out upon them,'' added Hamid.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein Aboud, 28, a chemical engineer and a leader of the
mosque, pointed to a home just across the street in the Al Adel
neighborhood that had been struck squarely with a cruise missile.
He said America was not targeting military sites, as it claimed,
but the homes of Iraqi civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The back of the house had a roughly 6-foot-diameter hole punched
through it from what Iraqi officals identified as a cruise missile.
It was guarded by Iraqi secret service and military officials
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another crusade against Iraq _ the first by Richard
the Lion Heart and this time by Bill The Liar,'' said Aboud,
referring to the British leader of the bloody 12th Century
Christian Crusades against the Arabs to President Bill Clinton and
the perjury scandal that threatens his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   For many Iraqis and Muslims throughout the Arab world, the US
and British bombing campaign is cast in religious terms, because of
its proximity to Ramadan. Many seem to see the attacks as a kind of
``clash of civilizations'' between the Muslim East and the
Christian West, backed by the Zionists of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clash of civilizations,'' a phrase coined by Harvard
historian Samuel Huntington, refers to the global phenomenon of
modern conflict defining itself in religious terms. The idea has
currency in the region, heard not just in academic circles but
among taxi drivers and hotel doormen in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   With a good ear for the cresting religion-based anger among
Muslims, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein included heavy religious
imagery in a brief, taped message Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the third day of enlightened days. We are not afraid
of anyone other than God. Cursed be the evil followers. America is
evil and so are the Zionist entity,'' said Hussein, who has built
his dictatorship on solidly secular Baath Party power, but who
recently has embraced a more religious tenor in his speeches of
defiance against the West.
</P>
<P>
   The same tone came from Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz,
who belongs to the small Christian minority in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about a recent statement by Pope John Paul expressing
sadness at the ``aggression'' of the US-British attacks on Iraq,
Aziz said, ``Frankly, those committing the aggression are Christian
in name and Zionist in their practices. There is no bond beyond the
Iraqi people and these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz repeatedly referred to Clinton's ``Zionist clique'' of
advisers, making specific references to Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, National Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger, and
Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Within the haze of religious symbolism, the four men who stood
in the Takwa'a Mosque Friday could not see the crescent moon
because it was obscured by a layer of low clouds. But the Saudi
royal palace announced its sighting.
</P>
<P>
   Under Islam, Ramadan marks God's revelation of the Koran,
Islam's holy book, to the Prophet Mohammed some 1,400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, home of Islam's holiest shrines in Mecca and
Medina and a pillar of the US-led coalition against Iraq in 1991,
was the first Muslim country to announce that Saturday will mark
the start of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf nations generally follow the kingdom's lead on the start of
Ramadan, but most other places in the Islamic world make their own
determinations. This year, under attack, Iraq decided to follow the
Saudi palace's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   So Friday night the Religious Ministry here carried out the
tradition of firing cannons to mark the start of Ramadan, and the
Iraqi people hoped that the arrival of dawn would mean the end of
the bombing.

UNDATED: they loved. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Peter Galison, a historian of science at Harvard University,
wrote in an article in Critical Inquiry, both groups were eager to
create ``transparent constructions'' _ buildings, philosophies and
even languages _ from simple, clear components. They vowed to
exclude everything that was ``decorative, mystical or
metaphysical.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Gropius designed the Bauhaus building in Dessau with
glass walls and a flat roof. The idea was to make a non-ornamental
building that revealed its own structure, materials and function.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the philosophers of the Vienna Circle, in opposition
to the metaphysicians of the past, tried to found a scientific
philosophy on simple statements and valid inferences. And at least
one member, Otto Neurath, tried to create an international language
of pictographs that anyone could understand. ``The Isotype system
(as it was called) was essentially a linguistic and pictorial form
of transparent construction,'' Galison writes. (It was also the
precursor to the system of international traffic signs we still
use.)
</P>
<P>
   So what went wrong? The Bauhaus buildings were not as functional
or as non-ornamental as they were supposed to be. And with Nazism
and Fascism on the rise, the Vienna Circle's belief in ``a purely
technical approach to social problems'' faltered. The ideal of a
simple, scientific philosophy never panned out. Transparency was an
impossible goal. The result was that the people who still clung to
transparency looked naive.
</P>
<P>
   What modernism taught us, Brooks said, is that ``honest art is
always honest about opacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the ideal of transparency in painting. ``In
the classical, mimetic theory of art, the picture plane is
understood as being transparent,'' a window onto reality, said
Yve-Alain Bois, a professor of art history at Harvard University.
``Modern art is against that idea. Modern art is constructed around
opacity.'' Why? Because ``transparency is an illusion, a
deception,'' he said. A painting is not a window, after all; it is
paint and canvas.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happened in sculpture. In the classic theory of
sculpture, there was the idea that ``under the surface of the work,
there is a core, a skeleton, or even a beating heart,'' Bois said.
You were supposed to be able to tell what was in the core from the
surface, because ``the surface depended on the core.''
</P>
<P>
   Modernism attacked this notion, too. Auguste Rodin ignored the
interior core completely by working in fragments and by grafting
pieces onto the surface, Rosalind Krauss observed in her book
``Passages in Modern Sculpture.'' So did Picasso. He created the
head of a woman out of two colanders, Bois said, proving that
``there is nothing inside, that it's hollow,'' that everything is
on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   In modernist painting and sculpture, transparency is synonymous
with illusion, and opacity is synonymous with honesty about
materials and construction. Which brings us back to the Bauhaus.
The very thing that modernist art historians call opacity is what
Bauhaus architects praised as transparency: letting the materials
show through in the final product.
</P>
<P>
   The word transparent is defined in the dictionary as ``clear,''
``without guile or concealment.'' But transparency has gotten
hopelessly tangled up. In ``Transparency,'' a 1963 book that is now
trendy, architectural historian Colin Rowe and painter Robert
Slutzky give two opposed definitions of ``transparent,'' one
meaning clear, the other meaning unclear. Literal transparency,
they write, is the kind you get with glass. But what they call
``phenomenal transparency,'' the illusion of transparency, is
created with spatial layering and architectural tricks. ``The
transparent ceases to be that which is perfectly clear and becomes
instead that which is clearly ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   It is enough to make you wonder whether anyone was ever clear
about transparency. In his 1926 book, ``Glass in Modern
Architecture,'' Arthur Korn tried a simple definition of glass: It
``is noticeable yet not quite visible,'' he wrote. ``It is the
great membrane, full of mystery, delicate yet tough.'' Oh, for the
days when glass was transparent, transparent was clear, and clear
was . . . Well, you get the picture.

BALLOONISTS LEAVE MOROCCO ON FIRST LEG OF ROUND-THE-WORLD VOYAGE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 160-foot-high balloon piloted by an all-star team of
long-distance balloonists rose from its launching pad Friday at
Marrakesh, Morocco, to begin a voyage that the balloonists hope
will take them around the world in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   In a few hours the big balloon, buoyed by helium and hot air,
reached a cruising altitude of more than 30,000 feet, and its crew
proceeded cross the Algerian border.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Branson, billionaire chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways
and captain of the balloon, said that eastward jet-stream winds
were ideal for the trip and that prospects were good that his team
would be the first balloonists to circle the world nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   Although winds are expected to carry the balloon across North
Africa, the team meteorologist said the track would avoid Iraqi
airspace by at least 50 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to arrive in Britain by New Year's Day,'' Branson said
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Flying with Branson is a former rival, Steve Fossett, an
American commodities broker who flew solo in four previous attempts
to circle the world. In August Fossett broke his own distance
record by flying more than 15,200 miles from Mendoza, Argentina, to
a crash landing in the Coral Sea that nearly cost him his life.
</P>
<P>
   The third team member, Per Lindstrand, is chairman of Lindstrand
Balloons Ltd., a British company that built the balloon, named the
ICO Global Challenge balloon. The ICO Global Communications Co. is
its main sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Branson and Lindstrand have made many long-distance balloon
flights together, including record-setting flights across the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Balloonists have had many failed attempts at circumnavigation
over the years, and more attempts are planned in the next few
months than ever. Four teams besides the ICO effort are preparing
to launch balloons before mid-February, and three plan to try from
sites in the Southern Hemisphere in July.
</P>
<P>
   Several earlier flights were aborted because countries refused
to permit balloonists to enter their airspace. Branson said that
this time ``practically all'' the countries that he expected to
cross, including China, had given permission.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the auspicious start, the balloonists were acutely aware
of the dangers that they faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm scared,'' Fossett said. ``My fall into the Coral
Sea in August reminded me how dangerous this is.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ If Russians are perplexed by the prospective
impeachment of President Clinton over his testimony about
extramarital sex _ and they are, to a man and woman _ perhaps they
can be forgiven. Their own Parliament, you see, is trying to
impeach President Boris Yeltsin over accusations of genocide,
treason and abetting murder. And almost no one gives it a second
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most people expect that the impeachment will still be
lumbering down the constitutional garden path when Yeltsin wraps up
his second term and leaves office in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the yawning divide between impeachments, U.S. and
Russian-style. One is saturnalia; the other Saturn, ungodly big and
going in circles. One is convulsing a nation; the other is so
somnolent that legislators have been known to snooze through
investigative hearings. One is extraordinarily partisan, but
rooted, at least in part, in the democratic axiom that no one is
above the law. Actually, so is the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important result of the committee's work is not
whether we have considered evidence of a crime in presidential
acts,'' Yelena Mizulina, the deputy chairwoman of the impeachment
committee in Russia's lower legislative chamber, the Duma, said in
an interview this week. ``It's that for the first time, a
constitutional precedent is created.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who occupy this post in the future will know that no
matter how sophisticated the process is, it is quite realistic.
They will have to control their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated is not the word most people might attach to the
proceedings, Ms. Mizulina readily admits.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party and its allies on the far right (in Russia,
the Communists are right-wingers, not leftists) inspired and have
managed the impeachment from its start in May.
</P>
<P>
   Most accusations against Yeltsin read like a party manifesto:
that he committed treason by signing the accord that dissolved the
Soviet Union in 1991; that he stage-managed the decline of Russia's
ragtag military forces; that he abetted murder when his troops put
down an armed rebellion by the Communist-led Parliament in 1993;
that he committed genocide by allowing living standards, and the
average Russian's life span, to decline.
</P>
<P>
   While many legislators resent Yeltsin's forceful quelling of the
1993 Parliament rebellion, not even the Communists who dominate the
impeachment commission have seen fit to charge the president with
manslaughter. Independent analysts dismiss the other charges as
confections whipped up to give the Communists a platform for
denouncing the Yeltsin government.
</P>
<P>
   Denounce they have, in regular Monday sessions that began in
June and are supposed to end soon, but probably will not. Yeltsin
has been called a clueless military strategist, a deserter of
constitutional principle and a pawn of NATO and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's most flagrant hothead, the Communist legislator
Viktor Ilyukhin, stunned many last week by declaring, during
hearings on the genocide charge, that fewer Russians would have
perished under Yeltsin's rule had the president not surrounded
himself with Jewish advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The final accusation _ that Yeltsin exceeded his powers by
waging a costly, failed war in Chechnya _ resonates more broadly
across Parliament. Ms. Mazulina, a member of the pro-democracy,
centrist Yabloko Party, supports the accusation. Were it to reach
the floor in Parliament, it might even be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   But for a raft of political and legal reasons, that seems
unlikely. In the United States, President Clinton's impeachment
would take a rapid, straight path to a Senate trial presided over
by the chief justice. Not so in Russia: a vote in the Duma to
impeach would first require a two-thirds majority of the chamber's
450 legislators. It would then have to pass muster in the nation's
Supreme Court and its Constitutional Court. Only then would
impeachment proceed to the more moderate upper legislative chamber,
the Federation Council.
</P>
<P>
   Most believe that will never happen. ``You should read the
Russian Constitution to realize that we will not have to deal with
this matter,'' the chamber's Speaker, Yegor Stroyev, said last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, all of this assumes that the Duma genuinely wants to
impeach Yeltsin, as the Communists insist. Most experts say the
party is content simply to flog Yeltsin in public hearings and hope
the economy continues to sour.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to undermine presidential authority while waiting
for 2000, when they'll win in elections because the situation will
continue to deteriorate,'' Sergei Karaganov, a political analyst
and head of the Moscow-based Institute of Europe, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mazulina said that tactic would explain why the impeachment
panel has spent months looking into ``ridiculous'' charges like
genocide and why, now that its official work is approaching a
close, some members want to tack on a new charge blaming Yeltsin
for this year's economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The tortuous process explains why Ms. Mazulina and some analysts
express admiration for America's quick and comparatively clean
method of presidential removal, even as they assert that removing a
Russian president for concealing adultery is unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost unimaginable. In denouncing the United States for
its attack on Iraq, the Communist Party leader, Gennadi Zyuganov,
sputtered on Thursday that the bombings are inextricably tied
``with the Yeltsin impeachment, with his relations with a certain
lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov stopped, then smiled. ``Clinton, of course. Clinton,''
he corrected himself.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Blizzard warnings were issued for northern Montana on Friday as
a bitterly cold Arctic air mass crossed the Canadian border.
Saturday, with the frigid air mass driven south by an
extraordinarily strong high pressure system over the Yukon, the
brunt of the Arctic chill will plunge southward into the Rockies
and western high Plains, while only oozing east toward the upper
Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the Arctic plunge will be extreme across the
central and southern Plains, with a shallow layer of Arctic air
penetrating into west Texas. Patches of freezing drizzle will glaze
the region. Snow will likely fall as far south as western Kansas,
where a deeper layer of Arctic air will gather. Snow and frigid air
will also team together from the Front Range of the Rockies to the
Continental Divide from northeastern New Mexico to Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Arctic air will ooze eastward into the western Great Lakes
region in the wake of a low pressure system that dove southeast
from Alberta a couple of days ago. Cold northerly winds behind this
``Alberta clipper'' will be moistened in transit over Lake
Superior, setting the stage for heavy snow squalls on Michigan's
upper peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   East of the clipper, broken areas of snow will develop across
upstate New York and northern New England as milder, moister air is
forced to rise over slowly retreating cold air. Meanwhile, clusters
of showers and isolated thunderstorms will form over the Southeast
and Middle Atlantic states as a weakening jet stream disturbance
lifts northeast from Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Alberta Clipper
</P>
<P>
   Alberta clippers are fast-moving low-pressure systems that dive
southeast from the Canadian province of Alberta during winter.
Because of their speed and the general lack of moisture along their
paths, snowfalls typically amount to no more than a few inches.
Heavier accumulations can occur near the Great Lakes and the
Northeast Coast, where additional moisture can be gleaned. But
Alberta clippers attain great notoriety because they are a
mechanism by which Arctic air is transported south. Saturday,
Arctic air will ooze into the upper Middle West in arrears of an
Alberta clipper in Ontario. &QL;

   BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ When President Clinton came to town this
week, Tanya Ghattas took her four children, gave them American
flags and went out to greet the unusual visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We waved to him, he smiled, and we were very happy,'' Mrs.
Ghattas recalled. ``He was like the prince of peace for us, and we
hoped that he would help us and bring peace. Now we're
disappointed, because he's hitting the Iraqi people. I don't love
Saddam Hussein, but I support the Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ghattas' disillusionment is widely shared across the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, where a visit by Clinton early this week gave
Palestinians a sense that their national aspirations had gained a
new level of recognition from a powerful new ally. For a few
fleeting days, there were hopes for a breakthrough in peace efforts
and signs of a closer, stronger relationship with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's failure to persuade Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Israel to carry out a further troop withdrawal in the
West Bank under the latest peace accord, and the American air
strikes on Iraq, have soured the mood. The warm welcome has been
replaced by bitter frustration and an outpouring of sympathy by
Palestinians for their fellow Arabs: ordinary Iraqis enduring the
American attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Anger welled up for the second straight day Friday afternoon
across the West Bank, where crowds of Palestinians took to the
streets after mosque prayers to protest the air strikes and to
denounce Clinton. The American flags raised for the presidential
visit were trampled and burned, replaced by Iraqi banners and
pictures of Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations have been dominated by militant Islamic and
leftist groups opposed to Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader,
and his agreements with Israel: Hamas, the pro-Iraqi Arab
Liberation Front, and two Marxist factions, the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition groups have seized on the attack on Iraq as proof
that the American sponsor of the Palestinian-Israeli agreements is
an enemy of Arabs and of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death to America!'' Hamas marchers shouted as they walked
through the alleys of Bethlehem Friday. ``Dear Saddam, blow up Tel
Aviv!''
</P>
<P>
   At the entrance to town, under a leftover banner that said
``Bill Clinton: Welcome to Palestine,'' protesters hurled stones at
an Israeli army checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   A youth masked with a red-checked head scarf ran toward the
soldiers with a flaming American flag that had been distributed by
the Palestinian Authority when Clinton arrived. A teen-ager stepped
on another flag as the crack of Israeli gunfire rang through the
streets, and tear-gas canisters traced arcs of white smoke as they
sailed toward the protesters. After a few hours of clashes, more
than a dozen Palestinians were reported hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The resentment among Palestinians has posed a problem for
Arafat, who has kept silent about the bombings. Although he is
anxious to preserve his newly strengthened relationship with
Clinton at a time of renewed crisis in talks with Israel, he cannot
ignore the sentiments of his own people.
</P>
<P>
   So the Palestinian police have permitted the pro-Iraq protests,
even as some local Palestinian television and radio stations have
been shut down for broadcasting the demonstrations and pro-Iraqi
remarks.

NO OPPOSITION ALLOWED, CHINA LEADER SAYS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In a pointed speech delivered to Communist Party
members in the Great Hall of the People, President Jiang Zemin made
clear Friday that China's economic reforms were not a prelude to
Western-style multiparty democracy and that those who challenged
the party's supremacy would be quashed.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the speech was intended to commemorate the 20th
anniversary of the Communist Party meeting that marked the
beginning of the reforms. But it also provided a vigorous, if
indirect, defense of the government's recent decision to try three
of the country's most prominent democracy activists on criminal
charges for their efforts to organize an opposition political
party.
</P>
<P>
   The trials of Wang Youcai and Qin Youming opened on Thursday.
They are accused of inciting subversion of the state, charges that
carry a minimum prison sentence of five years on conviction,
although neither trial has come to a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   And Friday the family of China's most senior dissident, Xu
Wenli, another organizer of the opposition party, was told that he
would stand trial on Monday, facing an even more serious charge of
subverting state power, which could bring a sentence of life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Xu has been detained since Nov. 30, after the police raided his
house and confiscated documents about the new opposition group, the
China Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   While vowing to move ahead with economic reforms, Jiang's speech
was more conservative politically than others he has made this
year. Again and again he invoked Communist Party dogma, using
phrases rarely uttered in the last year, like the ``four cardinal
principles.'' Those state that the leadership of the Communist
Party, adherence to the socialist path and the upholding of Mao
Zedong Thought and of Marxism-Leninism must serve as the foundation
for the country.
</P>
<P>
   During President Clinton's state visit in the summer, the world
saw President Jiang, agile international political leader, in
action. Friday he was once again General Secretary Jiang, Communist
Party stalwart.
</P>
<P>
   China's current political system ``must not be shaken, weakened
or discarded at any time,'' Jiang said, adding, ``The Western mode
of political systems must never be copied.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he said, ``We must be vigilant against infiltration,
subversive activities and separatist activities of international
and domestic hostile forces.'' China must ``fight against factors
disrupting social stability and nip them in the bud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's remarks on these topics echoed points made two weeks ago
by Li Peng, the former prime minister who now heads the National
People's Congress, in a rare interview with the German business
newspaper Handelsblatt.
</P>
<P>
   Li is usually associated with the more conservative faction of
the party. But Friday, as China is facing harsh criticism from
human rights groups and Western governments over its treatment of
the China Democratic Party's leaders, the same admonitions came
directly from Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang also said China should not rely too heavily on foreign
countries to boost its economic development, and he acknowledged
that the party had made some ``mistakes'' that had left citizens
dissatisfied. Presumably that was a reference to the millions of
layoffs caused by a shift toward a market economy, and to the
resulting demonstrations that have become commonplace in smaller
Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
   But it was, at heart, a back-to-basics talk, a reminder that
even though many of China's citizens wear tailored suits and tote
cellular phones, and even though its billboard-lined thoroughfares
resemble streets in the West, the country remains a one-party
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the founding members of the China Democratic
Party, a small, loose network of activists from all over the
country, hoped that there might be room for political opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Heartened by the relatively open discourse that surrounded the
Clinton visit and later by China's decision to sign the
International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, the
dissidents have repeatedly tried to register their fledgling party
as a government-recognized social organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, the official response has moved quickly
from neglect, to polite rebuff, to detention, to this week's
trials.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what will happen to the three men being tried or
the many other Democratic Party members who have been detained as
they have sought to protest the criminal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   At the trials of Wang in Hang-zhou and Qin in Wuhan, neither man
was represented by a lawyer, although allowed by Chinese law,
because prospective lawyers were intimidated or detained by local
officials, their families said.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-and-a-half-hour court session Friday, Wang defended
himself. No defense has yet been presented for Qin.
</P>
<P>
   Xu, who will go on trial on Monday in Beijing, has been given a
court-appointed lawyer, his wife said. Xu has already spent more
than 10 years in prison. His indictment accuses him of organizing
the China Democratic Party, accepting money from abroad, calling
for independent trade unions and making subversive statements in
interviews with foreign news organizations.

FOUR DIPLOMATS VIE TO HEAD TRADE ORGANIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Diplomats from four countries are vying to become the
next head of the World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based trade
arbiter, amid global economic strains that are making the process
particularly delicate.
</P>
<P>
   A replacement is being sought for the current director-general,
Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister who took over the
top post in 1995. Ruggiero plans to leave at the end of his
four-year term next spring, but the selection process is moving
cautiously, even glacially.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the 132 member countries met Friday to set
new deadlines for the process, which is behind schedule. They have
acknowledged that the original timetable, which called for a
mid-December selection, will not be met, and have set the end of
January as the new goal.
</P>
<P>
   The wrangling stems from many factors. One is the fact that the
member countries must make the decision by consensus, and right now
even trading allies are feuding. The United States and the European
Union, the world's trade giants, are distracted by skirmishing over
banana imports. Asian countries are leaning toward protectionist
measures to survive difficult economic times.
</P>
<P>
   And member countries are not eager for a reprise of the bitter
power struggle that kept Ruggiero's selection on hold for months.
In return for accepting him, U.S. officials received a pledge that
the next director-general would not be European.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the four candidates are Roy MacLaren, 64, a former
trade minister of Canada and ambassador to London; Hassan Abouyoub,
46, Morocco's trade envoy; Mike Moore, 49, a former prime minister
and trade minister of New Zealand, and Suphachai Phanitchpaphak,
52, a deputy prime minister of Thailand and a trade negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the job is an international post with a
six-figure salary and plush benefits, including a gorgeous view of
Lake Geneva, a hefty entertainment allowance and a chauffeur-driven
Lexus. But it is also a pivotal post if the World Trade
Organization is to thrive. The new chief must be a successful
evangelist, catalyst, peacemaker and administrator, among other
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   It might also be helpful to have a good sense of humor, as
Ruggiero found in October when he was hit in the face with a cream
pie thrown by environmentalists who called him a turtle killer.
They were protesting a ruling by the organization that many
environmentalists say undercuts laws protecting endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Given such situations, the Japanese trade envoy, Yoichi Suzuki,
said the next chief ``must be capable of communicating in a clear
and simple way what we are doing here.''
</P>
<P>
   To win the top spot, the four candidates have made obligatory
visits to various capitals, and last month were vetted before
assembled member states in Geneva. This gave less developed
countries a chance for firsthand questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, two top trade diplomats _ one from Brazil and one
from Switzerland _ have been consulting with individual countries
to rank the contenders and to find out if there are insurmountable
objections to any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Then a consensus has to be ``built around one, but that promises
to be a complex process,'' one trade representative said. Just how
complex was not readily apparent until the two trade diplomats
produced an interim report, reflecting support for Suphachai. The
French and African countries rallied to the support of Abouyoub,
who speaks French, and movement stalled until Friday's agreement to
set a new end date.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the European Union have not declared a
preference. But their views are paramount because they are involved
in the largest number of cases before the organization.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The current situation has probably made this a little more
difficult,'' said Roderick Abbott, the European Commission's
representative, referring to the banana dispute. He noted that
European countries did ``not have a single choice'' so far, adding
that the Europeans would have to consult with their U.S.
counterparts to avoid a replay of the 1995 selection tempest.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, U.S. officials have been unwilling to indicate any
preferences. ``We have said consistently that all four may be
qualified, but we have not yet come to a conclusion,'' said Rita
Hayes, the U.S. chief delegate to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Divisions within the Clinton administration have delayed the
selection of a preferred candidate. U.S. officials also recall the
last struggle to name a head of the organization, when Washington
strongly backed the outgoing Mexican president, Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, only to see his candidacy crumble amid turmoil in Mexico's
economy and within his family.
</P>
<P>
   Selection of the new trade chief now will not be before next
year, possibly close to Ruggiero's scheduled April departure.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, developing countries _ about 80 percent of
the group's members _ insist that it is time for one of theirs to
head the agency. These nations say that the benefits of freer trade
have not been fairly shared with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our turn,'' Munir Akram, Pakistan's trade envoy, said.
``We want somebody who can stand up to the big boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Also important are coming global trade negotiations, where
agriculture will be a prime focus. Developing countries want trade
restrictions dropped so they can more easily and widely export
their commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Moore of New Zealand has advocated freer agricultural trade, and
is unlikely to win support from Europeans, who heavily subsidize
farmers. Suphachai of Thailand, whose country is also an exporter
of agricultural goods, has similar views but is seen as less
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Suphachai, however, favors a two-tiered membership structure
that would give developing countries a less strict set of criteria
for qualifying for the organization. That approach is rejected by
countries that have overcome protectionist domestic interests to
win admission to the global trade club.

   UNITED NATIONS _ More than 100 U.N. relief workers left Baghdad
early Friday after two nights of bombing raids made their situation
precarious, officials said here.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement from the office of the Iraqi program that
oversees all nondisarmament work said 106 people had gone by road
to Jordan, leaving behind fewer than 30 essential officials,
including Prakash Shah, the secretary- general's special envoy, and
Hans von Sponeck, the relief aid coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 232 foreign relief workers will remain in the
autonomous Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, where they are
considered relatively safe.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Friday also said that oil exports were
continuing uninterrupted through the port of Mina al Bakr, but that
the absence of border inspectors checking goods purchased through
the ``oil for food'' program would mean interruptions in incoming
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   The border inspectors, who work for the private British customs
service, Lloyds Register of Shipping, were withdrawn from most
crossing points and the port of Umm Qasr on Wednesday, before the
bombing began.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't know. Can't figure this out. Thinking of turning in my
punditry merit badge. Can't get a grip.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I'm not used to getting things wrong. I never would
have believed that you could buy a gallon of gas at 93.9 cents per
gallon at the end of 1998. That gasoline would be cheaper than
bottled war. In the week that the House voted on impeaching the
president. While there was a war on in the Middle East. With the
stock market going up two days in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure. I can't anymore. Beats me.
</P>
<P>
   For something the TV people kept hyping as the ``high drama'' of
``this historic moment,'' the Impeachment Show was oddly flat.
Maybe we've been spoiled by the entertainment culture. It's hard
for a windy legislative body to compete with Cruise missiles coming
down live on Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the congressmen are held to too high a standard. Could we
be accustomed to 500 channels of world-class entertainers, highly
attractive and articulate folk, and that mere run-of-the-mill
politicoes look like sadsacks by comparison?
</P>
<P>
   Watching your House of Representatives in action is a task
requiring an effort to focus, the kind of effort required when
tuning in to ``your dental hygenist in action,'' ``your automatic
transmission specialist in action,'' or ``your sous chef at work on
the head of lettuce.'' I've seen Norm Abrams, TV's ``Yankee
Workshop'' carpenter, get more eloquent over a straight and true
length of quarter-sawn red oak.
</P>
<P>
   The officeholders weren't in their seats. Nor were the
spectators clamoring for admission to the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Led into battle by two confessed adulturers, the House
Republicans coalesced behind a very simple idea: we can get this
guy! If you voted for Clinton in '92 or '96, you might challenge
this sort of Rolling Coup to Reverse '92.
</P>
<P>
   As the Globe's White House correspondent when Richard Nixon's
fingernails were screeching down the Oval Office blackboard in '74,
I went to Tip O'Neill, the Democrats' Majority Leader during that
impeachment, to check on rumors that Nixon was going to pull some
kind of national security stunt. I asked: Would Nixon or his
hard-line intimates manufacture some kind of crisis _ foreign or
domestic _ to derail the impeachment freight train then bearing
down on him?
</P>
<P>
   With a wave of his great friendly paw, O'Neill cheerfully
scoffed at my fears. Naw, he said; the sensible people in both
parties would never let that happen. ``This is no banana
republic,'' he concluded with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four years later, Banana Republic is a garment chain,
O'Neill is dead; and his successor, Joe Kennedy, gave his final
speech Friday decrying the Congress's lack of concern with the poor
and the left-behind in its obsession with Clinton's sexual affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Tip O'Neill would be heartsick at the conduct of the House that
expires in two weeks. The Republicans are in the saddle _ but only
barely. Their leadership was repudiated in the November election,
where they lost some of their majority. Newt Gingrich rolled the
dice for 10 million bucks worth of anti-Clinton Monica ads, and
wound up repudiated himself by his own members.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was dumped in favor of Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.), but
Livingston's reign may be perilously short. He may be undone in
turn by his Impeachment-eve confession that he, too, like Judiciary
Chairman Henry Hyde, has been unfaithful to his wife. So far this
year four Republican House members have been unmasked as
adulturers. The Scarlet Letter keeps turning up in Washington like
a bad penny.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone believe that only four of the 220-plus Republicans
engaged in the same sort of immorality that brought Clinton low?
</P>
<P>
   In the sulfurous snakepit that the House became under Gingrich's
cruel reign, comity, amity and consideration evaporated. Both
parties have adopted the fang-and-claw style Gingrich introduced.
After Nixon's resignation, strong bonds of personal friendship and
mutual regard helped leaders like O'Neill and Gerald Ford bind up
the partisan wounds and heal the riven government. That atmosphere
no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill always kept a weather eye turned to the geographical
balance in Congress. For decades, there was a ``Boston-Austin''
axis, balancing regional and ideological differences, knitting
together a vast and disparate country of fiercely competing
rivalries. But the Republican Revolution of 1994 which brought
Gingrich to power tipped all the power in the House south and west,
to the Sunbelt.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans from the north and east withstood
considerable pressure from their leadership to oppose impeachment.
But the vast majority of the majority marched in lockstep in
support of the creeping coup.
</P>
<P>
   The polls show most Americans didn't approve of what was being
done, by Hyde and his henchpersons had the gavel, and that's all
they needed to control the debate, and choke off the censure
proposal that might have spared Clinton the ignominy of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   By throttling the censure motion in its legislative cradle, the
Republicans made and up-or-down impeachment vote the first order of
business. They ignored the argument that ``you have blood on your
hands'' for trying to decapitate the administration in the midst of
a shooting war.
</P>
<P>
   For those Americans who did not like what was being done, the
chance for revenge will not come till year after next, when these
representatives and their Republican colleagues at other levels
come back before the voters. Can you remember then how you feel
now? On that will depend the custody of the Congress and the White
House. Unless I'm figuring it wrong.

CARTER WELCOMES CHALLENGE   OF THE WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Anson Carter went to school at Michigan State in Ann
Arbor, slightly more than an hour outside Detroit. He never went to
Red Wings games, though. And he'd watch on television only if one
of his friends was facing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at the other team,'' Carter said. ``I try to
focus on my own team.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's team is the Bruins, and Saturday night, they'll be
focusing on the Red Wings _ the mighty Red Wings, that is, winners
of the last two Stanley Cups and 5-3 conquerors of Boston Wednesday
in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Carter took note of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they have a lot of experience and they're pretty deep
in talent,'' he said. But he also knows something about his club:
``If we're playing well, we're tough to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   And he acknowledges that the presence of the Wings gets the
juices flowing, even if that wasn't the case in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get pumped up because of their Stanley Cup
championships,'' he said. ``Every night you try to get pumped up
just because you're in the National Hockey League and you have to.
Anybody can beat anybody on any given night. The fact that they're
the Stanley Cup champions does make you a little more fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   But he won't be hyperventilating.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to play within yourselves,'' Carter said. ``Sometimes
less is more. If you get fired up too much, you tend to try to do
too much and give something up and get in a hole it's tough to
battle back from.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now Carter is trying to battle back from a slump. He has 3
goals and 9 points in 16 games after missing the first 12 in a
contract dispute, and Friday before practice, coach Pat Burns had a
talk with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see a little bit more from Anson,'' Burns said.
``I think he worries too much about everything else that goes
around him instead of making it a simple game. He's such a good
skater, a strong individual, he's got to skate down the wing and
take the shot to the net and go to the net. You can't defense
against those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter isn't overly concerned by his numbers. ``I try to play in
all three zones,'' he said, ``and if I do that, points will come.
I'm doing a lot of things well, to tell you the truth. I just carry
the puck in my danger zones, and sometimes I'm playing left wing,
sometimes right wing, and sometimes center. I've got to make sure I
stay sharp mentally because my role can change from shift to shift.
I've got to be ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame Carter's slump on missing training camp. He got in
plenty of work skating with Michigan State, Team Canada, trainer
T.R. Goodman, and the International Hockey League's Utah Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right when I got here, I felt I was ready to go,'' Carter
said. ``All the coaching staff did a tremendous job in preparing
for the season. It was a learning experience with Utah. It wasn't
the NHL but just a step below it. It did a good job of preparing me
for the NHL level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NHL players are the best in the world _ faster, bigger,
and stronger. But it's hockey no matter where you go. It's moving
two feet and playing in game situations.''
</P>
<P>
   But he knows the Red Wings bring it to another level.

SCHOLARS DIFFER WITH LAWMAKERS OVER USE OF IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was among the most incendiary statements of the House
Judiciary Committee's ever-fiery impeachment hearings: Sean
Wilentz, a historian at Princeton University, warned that ``history
will track . . . down and condemn'' those lawmakers who vote to
evict President Clinton from the Oval Office, but don't really
believe he should or will be ousted.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans angrily rejected that prediction as an unfair,
partisan attack on their motives. Its accusatory tone
notwithstanding, Wilentz's assessment of the constitutional intent
of impeachment seems to reflect the consensus of legal scholars,
political scientists and historians, regardless of their opinions
on the merits of the debate that began in the House Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment was designed as a device for removal and not for
punishment, the scholars agreed, but they said some House members
seem intent on using it as ``censure-plus'' or ``supercensure.''
They added that impeachment wasn't meant to be a vehicle for
legislators to demonstrate party loyalty or to express disapproval
of a president's behavior, yet some legislators appear to be
employing it in those ways _ believing their votes are ``safe''
because the Senate won't convict.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they vote for this, they should do so only because they
think he should be tossed out and think the Senate will finish the
job,'' said Hans Trefousse, a professor emeritus at Brooklyn
College who has written books about Andrew Johnson, the only US
president to be impeached. Trefousse argued strenuously that, based
on his study of Johnson's case and of deliberations by the
Constitution's authors, House Republicans are misreading their
authority in trying to oust Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a congressman, I should think I'd need to believe
there has to be enough there to actually remove him from office . .
. and not just punish him,'' added Robert Bork, the conservative
Supreme Court nominee who is now a scholar at the American
Enterprise Institute in Washington. Bork added that, based on an
``overabundance'' of evidence, he favors the president's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Whether to make Clinton the first president to be thrown out of
the White House is obviously at the core of the historic decision
Congress must make when it deliberates his fate. Since only the
Senate ultimately decides whether the president stays or goes,
however, the question of intent _ whether those voting truly want
him out or are casting their pro-impeachment ballots for some other
reason _ applies uniquely to the House.
</P>
<P>
   It would appear to weigh most heavily on those members,
predominantly Republicans, who have yet to announce their
intentions. But the scholars said it also should be considered by
lawmakers who, whatever their public pronouncements, planned to
approve articles of impeachment principally because they weren't
being offered a censure option and believed the Democrats' strength
in the Senate would prevent a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one thing for the House of Representatives to say, in
good conscience, that the Senate vote is not in stone,'' said
Jeffrey Abramson, who teaches politics and constitutional law at
Brandeis University. ``What is constitutionally out of bounds is
for members to say, in a stage whisper, that we don't even want the
Senate to remove this president; all we want to do is use
impeachment as censure-plus . . . with no expectation or even
desire for the president to be removed. That, I think, is a
violation of the spirit of the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed agreed on another key point: that it was
unfortunate, at a minimum, that the sentiment on impeachment is so
starkly divided along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Some said the main result of that split is to increase public
cynicism by reinforcing a perception that the process is based
solely on partisanship _ a view that conservatives, including Bork
and Duke constitutional law professor William Van Alstyne,
dismissed as incorrect. ``Any tangential negative effect is
unfortunate . . . but the only test is whether the aggregate
misconduct of the accused is such as to render this person unfit to
continue in office,'' said Van Alstyne.
</P>
<P>
   Others saw the chasm as having more significance. They said it
not only showed a Republican Party intent on deposing an elected
leader, but also provides evidence that impeachment has been
whittled down into a political tool _ a usage they said the
Constitution's framers had sought to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who will preside
over any Senate impeachment trial, wrote a book on impeachment in
which he agreed, at least in concept, with the notion that
partisanship undermines the process.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to the impeachment trials of Andrew Johnson in 1868 and
of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1805, Rehnquist said their
critics' motives were so overtly political that convictions would
have cast ``a long shadow . . . over the independence of the
judiciary and the president.'' He added in his 1992 book, ``Grand
Inquests,'' that impeachment successfully used in this way would
have turned the constitutional remedy into ``a sword of Damocles,
designed not to fall but to hang.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Carter, a law professor at Yale University who has used
the book in his classes, said Rehnquist's point is essentially that
``if two parties are duking it out, it's a power struggle rather
than a decision about right and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter was alone among those interviewed to assert that the
Constitution's authors didn't have a firm view of what actions
constitute an impeachable offense. He said that House Republicans
therefore can reasonably decide that Clinton had committed ``high
crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   He nevertheless criticized them for doing so, saying they were
acting with the strong belief that the president probably will keep
his job. ``I'm not sure, historically, that we've ever had a
situation where members voted on impeachment while believing the
chances for success were so small,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Tribe, the constitutional scholar and professor at
Harvard Law School, suggested some Republicans were misled by their
leaders into believing it was acceptable to vote for impeachment
essentially as a means of chastizing Clinton and then passing the
controversial issue to the Senate for a fuller investigation. That
sort of maneuver, Tribe and several others argued, is far from what
the Constitution's framers intended and could lead to undesired,
unpredictable repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should understand that the effect of voting to impeach is
not simply to authorize further inquiry,'' said Tribe. ``It
certainly does impose a permanent brand for all time . . . but it
also opens up the process of a protracted and potentially
paralyzing trial in the Senate.''

FIRST LADY APPEALS FOR RECONCILIATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Breaking her public silence, first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton appealed Friday for reconciliation as Congress
opened debate on articles of impeachment against her husband and
White House aides fought back with broadsides at Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A strange atmosphere gripped the White House _ its cheerful
Christmas decorations belying the turmoil inside. President Clinton
remained out of public view as he dealt for a third day with the
U.S.-British military mission against Iraq. Some aides worked to
stem the Republican tide against Clinton in the House and others
went about their daily chores.
</P>
<P>
   But Hillary Clinton provided the surprise of the day, ending the
silence she has maintained since January when she initially
defended her husband against accusations of his infidelity only to
learn later they were true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vast majority of Americans share my approval and
pride in the job that the president's been doing for our country,''
the first lady said, standing at the White House South Portico with
the Capitol dome visible behind her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in this holiday season, as we celebrate Christmas and
Hanukkah and Ramadan _ and at the time for reflection and
reconciliation among people _ we in our country ought to practice
reconciliation, and we ought to bring our country together. We
ought to end the divisiveness because we can do so much more
together,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She answered a reporter's question following an event promoting
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers' ``red ribbon'' campaign. She walked
away after answering the first question.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, her spokeswoman, confirmed the first lady has been
talking to House members about the impeachment issue. Berry said
the first lady spoke to members traveling with the president to the
Middle East and has been making telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman, offered a terse
assessment of the Republican strategy, not just on Capitol Hill but
within the national Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about politics and all about cynicism,'' Lockhart
told reporters in his morning briefing. ``What you see especially
in the last few days is a shift in what has been a very cynical
political strategy by the Republican leadership of the House from
impeachment to a building drumbeat to force the president to leave
office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lockhart stopped short of using the word ``coup d'etat''
that many of Clinton's supporters used during debate. ``I have not
used that word,'' Lockhart said, but he suggested House Republican
leaders deliberately engaged in a strategy to initially downplay
the importance of an impeachment vote. He quoted several members
saying the House action was similar to a grand jury and that the
Senate would be the place where Clinton would have a chance to
defend himself in a trial.
</P>
<P>
   But step two, Lockhart alleged, began last week with Republican
leaders demanding that Clinton resign if he is impeached by the
House, short-circuiting Senate action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm discussing a strategy where a conscious effort was made
to, in effect, dumb down impeachment, to dumb down and say the
process wasn't important, that the real action was someplace else,
and then, having gone through it, turn 180 degrees in the other
direction and say, `it's so important to this country and it's so
damaging that the president should resign,''' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also pointed to messages sent from the Republican
National Party and the Christian Coalition to more than 200
newspapers urging a call for Clinton's resignation in editorials.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman maintained that Clinton had little time Friday to
view the televised House debate. He said Clinton also had done
``very little'' to lobby House members. He made a couple of calls,
which Lockhart refused to detail, and he met with Rep. Christopher
Shays, the moderate Republican from Connecticut rumored to be
rethinking his opposition to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides had suspended their lobbying of members when
the United States launched ``Operation Desert Fox'' against Iraq.
The military action resulted in a one-day delay of the impeachment
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton kept his daily schedule, attending the MADD event,
meeting with European Union officials and consulting with his
HIV/AIDS Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very serious time, but the work goes on,'' said Richard
Socarides, a senior aide preparing to brief the president on the
HIV/AIDS Council session. ``I think the overall mood is one of
seriousness, one of some disbelief. I think people are starting to
realize more and more that this isn't really any longer about the
president's inappropriate conduct but really about whose political
agenda will succeed and survive in the coming months.''
</P>
<P>
   Socarides said Clinton's personal appearance at a senior staff
meeting Thursday bolstered staff morale. The president urged the
staff to continue the work they were doing despite the actions in
the House. &QL;

PROTESTANTS, CATHOLICS AGREE TO REFORMS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ For the first time since Ireland was
partitioned in 1922, leaders of Northern Ireland's Protestant
majority and its Roman Catholic minority agreed early Friday to
specific reforms that will give Catholics more power in this
British province.
</P>
<P>
   In a breakthrough after eight months of stalemate, the two sides
agreed to set up a 10-minister ruling executive cabinet for
Northern Ireland that would include two representatives of Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army. But
negotiators sidestepped the problem of disarming the IRA and other
guerrillas, which has blocked the peace effort since it was
approved in April.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 hours of talks that ended at 4 a.m., the leaders also
announced a new cross-border North/South ministerial council and
other committees to give the Irish Republic more influence in
northern affairs. The agreements cleared the way for the Assembly
to receive home-rule powers in February from the British
government, which took direct control of the province in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came as the Loyalist Volunteer Force, a small but
deadly Protestant paramilitary group, turned over a cache of
weapons for destruction, the first time in the 29 years of
sectarian warfare that any guerrilla group had surrendered any
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Evening television showed a screeching steel grinding wheel
throwing sparks as it sliced through automatic rifles at a
warehouse Friday morning. The destruction was witnessed by Gen.
John de Chastelain, former chief of staff of the Canadian army, who
heads the official disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Loyalist Volunteer Force to turn in dozens
of rifles and pistols and bomb-making equipment was used by
Protestant leaders to urge the overwhelmingly Catholic IRA, and the
larger Protestant guerrilla groups, to begin disarming.
</P>
<P>
   The political leaders decided to postpone until early next year
the appointment of officials to the new cabinet posts and other
political bodies, hoping that by then the disarmament problem would
be solved. If the problem persists beyond next spring, the entire
peace effort could collapse in a new round of violence.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, the first minister of the Assembly, who has
excluded the Sinn Fein from the new structures until the Catholic
guerrillas begin to disarm, said of the IRA: ``They have been given
an example. Let them and other paramilitaries follow it. It is now
more important than ever that the IRA join in the process. This is
now the only impediment to progress and to Sinn Fein taking its
part.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the agreement Friday was ``major step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, said it showed that
``progress is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did not say whether the specifics of the agreement, seen
by many officials as important concessions to the Catholic
Republican movement, would result in a start to IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians of both sides agreed that the Loyalist Volunteer
Force had made a public relations coup Friday by surrendering the
weapons. Many saw it as a stunt to gain attention in an attempt to
persuade the government to allow 25 of its members now in prison to
be released before the end of their sentences. About 200 other
paramilitaries, Protestant and Catholic, have been released since
the agreement was reached.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Police have warned in recent days that small splinter groups,
Catholic and Protestant, may be planning new attacks to damage the
peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of
Ireland welcomed the agreement announced Friday and indicated that
they hoped it would produce a conciliatory gesture by the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   But this group, which has held a cease-fire for nearly 17
months, issued no statement on Friday's events. Last week it
restated its refusal to disarm until the full implementation of the
peace agreement, which is scheduled for May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The April agreement set general goals and guidelines for drastic
governmental reforms in Northern Ireland. Friday, the politicians
approved what amounts to a cabinet of 10 ministers within the new
Northern Ireland Assembly, and six new bodies in which northern
ministers and those of the Irish Republic would coordinate such
activities as agriculture, trade and investment promotion, and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   While no mainstream politician mentioned it Friday, in the
obvious interest of emphasizing bipartisan progress, the reforms
are widely seen as concessions to Sinn Fein and the IRA. One of the
new bodies established Friday is to promote the Gaelic language, a
favorite Sinn Fein project.
</P>
<P>
   Since the current peace effort began in 1993, Adams has won a
series of concessions from the British and Irish governments. The
only concession the republican movement has made, most officials
say, is the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Even the nature of the new Assembly is a concession to
Catholics, who have about 43 percent of the population. To make it
impossible for the Protestant Unionist majority to govern roughshod
over Catholics, the voting system in the Assembly is diluted
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, a simple Unionist majority could vote down Catholic
proposals. Now approval of a measure requires a majority of the
votes among both the Protestant Unionist and Catholic nationalist
Assembly members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we start working together and harnessing the
international good will,'' said John Hume, head of the mainstream
Catholic Social Democratic Labor Party, ``we will start
transforming our society.''

AN UNCIVIL ACTION IN AN UNCIVIL TIME

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chaplain quoted St. Francis of Assisi, bidding
the lawmakers to sow love where there was hatred. The presiding
officer beseeched speakers to avoid ``personally abusive'' comments
about the president of the United States or other members of the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the appeals from the chaplain and the chair, for all
the talk about the legacy of Roman law and the lessons of the Magna
Carta, for all the allusions to the American founders and to
Americans yet unborn, Friday's remarkable House impeachment debate
served mostly to underline how uncivil American civil life has
become.
</P>
<P>
   If the House votes by midday Saturday, as expected, to impeach
President Clinton, it will be making an indelible mark on the
president and on history. But this moment _ coming amid the most
bitter partisan discourse since Reconstruction _ is also a marker
in America's political passage.
</P>
<P>
   Every element of the following sentence would have been
inconceivable only a decade ago: The House of Representatives met
in a lame-duck session a week before Christmas, prepared to impeach
the president on a party-line basis for having an affair with a
one-time intern in the Oval Office suite and then conspiring to lie
about it.
</P>
<P>
   And though major debates over the size and role of government
and the place of the United States in world affairs have raged for
two decades, modern politics more than ever is about trust and
truth and how the men and women who fill our political life do not
fulfill our expectations. ``The people's trust has been betrayed,''
House Judiciary Committee chairman Henry J. Hyde of Illinois said
Friday as he opened the impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   The road to this moment was paved by distrust and suspicion,
some of it rooted in Watergate, some of it reflecting cultural
changes in American institutions, some of it growing out of
evolving views of authority. But a body that for more than two
centuries has prided itself on being the ``people's House'' now
represents all the people's resentments under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   And though the discussion in the House chamber Friday was about
perjury and obfuscation and the rule of law, the dozen hours of
debate provided a portrait of an institution and a nation suddenly
bereft of the old rules, the old assumptions, the old folkways,
and, most of all, the old courtesies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now at the height of a cycle of negative attack,
character assassination, personal smears of good people, decent
people, worthy people,'' House minority leader Richard A. Gephardt
of Missouri said as the impeachment debate began. Representative
Diana DeGette, a freshman Democrat from Colorado accustomed to
being neither seen nor heard, put it crisply: ``Decency and
civility have been sacrificed.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't only Democrats, defending a president who has been
subject to constant attacks and whose private life invited even
more, who were complaining of the raw meanness in political
discourse. House majority leader Richard K. Armey of Texas, citing
``quite caustic and harsh characterizations of the motives of the
members,'' warned lawmakers that unless they showed respect for one
another, the proceedings would have to be interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   There have been flashes of passion and anger in Congress before,
of course. In 1798, Roger Griswold, a Federalist from Connecticut,
attacked Matthew Lyon, a Republican from Vermont, with his cane,
only to have to stave off Lyon's attack with fire tongs. In 1856,
Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina stormed into the
Senate and beat Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts so
viciously that Sumner was unable to return to Capitol Hill for four
years.
</P>
<P>
   But for more than a century, comity _ a word seldom used outside
Capitol Hill, where for generations it was used with reverence and
pride _ prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Then 40 years of Democratic rule in the House begat resentments
that Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia harnessed, an action
that in turn begat the attacks that drove House Speaker James C.
Wright Jr. from office, which in turn begat a new era of new
resentments.
</P>
<P>
   All these pent-up passions and resentments were on full display
on nine television networks Friday, reinforced by the latest furor,
the admission of Speaker-designate Robert L. Livingston of
Louisiana that he had not been faithful to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only word that comes to mind,'' said Representative Maxine
Waters, a California Democrat, ``is `hypocrite.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the bitter harvest of all the resentments. ``It's a
day,'' said Fred Zuercher, a political scientist at the University
of South Dakota, ``that will live in infamy.''

MUSLIM HOLY MONTH BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ramadan, the holy month of dawn-to-dusk fasting in the Islamic
calendar, begins this weekend for Muslims around the world. Its
start depends on the sighting of the new crescent moon.
</P>
<P>
   Because the U.S.-led attacks on Iraq have taken place just
before the holy month, some Muslims have been particularly
incensed. Though President Clinton said on Wednesday when the
attacks began that ``to initiate military action during Ramadan
would be profoundly offensive to the Muslim world,'' Washington has
suggested that the attacks may continue into Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 30 days, Muslims are enjoined from eating, drinking
and sensual pleasures like sexual activity, during daylight hours.
On a spiritual level, the ritual fast is a sacrificial act that
points to purification and renewal. It is accompanied by close
study of the Koran, the Islamic holy book, which the faith teaches
was revealed by God to the prophet Mohammed during the last days of
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   Observance of the fast is one of Islam's Five Pillars, the
foundational rules of the faith. The daily abstention from food is
broken after sundown with an evening meal.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, officials announced the sighting of the new
moon on Friday night, signaling that observance of Ramadan would
begin there on Saturday. According to news reports, the lunar month
will also begin Saturday in Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait,
Bahrain and Qatar. But Egypt and the south Arabian nation of Oman
will begin observance of Ramadan on Sunday.

HOLIDAY HIRING KEEPS JOBLESS RATE DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Holiday hiring by retail stores helped push the number
of unemployed people in Massachusetts to lows not seen since the
economic boom of 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The state Division of Employment and Training in its November
report said Friday the jobless rate fell by a half percentage
point, to 2.9 percent. The number of unemployed fell to an 11-year
low of 95,700 last month as the holiday season got under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``News could not be better for our working families during this
holiday season,'' Gov. Paul Cellucci said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   The state's jobless rate is now 1.5 percentage points below the
US jobless rate of 4.4 percent. Further, the national recession
that had been widely predicted last summer _ because of economic
contraction abroad, financial-market turmoil at home, and a sharp
slowdown in US manufacturing _ is becoming remote, though not
impossible, for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs report ``is a very welcome development,'' said Richard
DeKaser, senior economist for BankBoston Corp. But, he added, ``it
would be hasty to conclude the state is not on a slowing
trajectory.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, business, engineering, and management services
continued to be the biggest creator of jobs, adding 3,000 jobs
during the month, the state said.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when the labor force is already critically short
of skilled workers, stronger-than-average hiring by retail stores
preparing for the holidays also fueled an unusually sharp,
one-month decline in the unemployment rate. Retailers added 1,800
jobs last month.
</P>
<P>
   Economists two months ago were predicting job growth in
Massachusetts would slow by half next year, to less than 1 percent.
But with unemployment so low, there is now a danger a slowdown
would be triggered by the constraints of an extremely tight labor
market. If companies can't hire, they are unable to complete orders
or provide customer service.
</P>
<P>
   This presents ``a dilemma for the state economy,'' DeKaser said.
``Labor force restrictions are _ arguably at the present are _ a
binding constraint on future expansion activity,'' suggesting a
``return to past rates of growth is highly unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers in Massachusetts continued to shed jobs _ 2,000 _
in November, amid softness in exports. But while high-tech
manufacturing employment has shrunk over the past year,
non-manufacturers in high tech have more than made up for the tech
industry's losses, adding nearly 10,000 jobs in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The second-biggest area of job growth, after services, was
construction, which is enjoying mild weather. Construction
companies added 2,500 jobs last month.
</P>
<P>
   Construction was followed by 2,300 new jobs in the retail- and
wholesale-trade sector, and 1,000 jobs in the financial and real
estate sector.

REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS FEAR POLITICS OF SMEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans insisted Friday that there was no
similarity between House Speaker-designate Bob Livingston's
confessed adultery and the legal problems that have brought
President Clinton to the brink of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Retiring Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., chairman of the House
Rules Committee, maintained there was ``absolutely no connection''
between Livingston's adultery and Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``This impeachment procedure is not about sex,'' Solomon said.
``It is about obstruction of justice, perjury and abuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Two leading Democrats, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., and Rep. Charles. E. Schumer, D-N.Y., decried the toxic
atmosphere in the House as the lawmakers began debating four
articles of impeachment against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt drew a standing ovation from both Republicans and
Democrats, a rare sight these days, when he made an impassioned
plea for a truce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now at the height of a cycle of the politics of
negative attacks, character assassination, personal smears of good
people, decent people, worthy people,'' Gephardt said. ``It's no
wonder to me and to you that the people of this country are cynical
and indifferent and apathetic about our government and about our
country. The politics of smear and slash and burn must end.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, who moves to the Senate next month, complained that
normal political disagreements have escalated into vicious personal
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot forcefully advocate our positions without trying to
criminalize or at least dishonor our adversaries,'' Schumer
lamented. ``We are routinely using criminal accusations and scandal
to win the political battles and ideological differences we cannot
settle at the ballot box.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston admitted to his fellow Republicans Thursday night
that he had ``strayed'' several times during the course of his
33-year marriage. Livingston reminded his colleagues that he was
running for speaker, ``not for sainthood'' in the new Congress that
convenes next month.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's acknowledgement of adultery _ triggered by imminent
news media disclosure _ was the talk of the hallways of the House,
though not on the House floor. Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., who
presided in the speaker's chair during the debate, warned members
that ``proper decorum'' prohibited them from referring to
``personal misconduct on the part of the president'' or to make
comparisons to personal conduct of sitting House members.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Livingston steered clear of reporters and spent much
of the time pacing in the back of the House floor as the
impeachment debate continued. He was frequently surrounded by
Republican members who patted him on the back and shook his hand.
</P>
<P>
   But members had plenty to say about the adultery issue off the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a member of the House Judiciary
Committee who supports Clinton's impeachment, said he saw a big
distinction between Clinton and Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about criminal misconduct _ tramping on legal
systems as opposed to private misconduct,'' Graham said. He also
predicted that Livingston's martial indiscretions won't jeopardize
the likelihood that Livingston will be elected speaker when the new
Congress convenes next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't say `Bob, you can't be speaker because you violated
your vows with your wife,''' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Edward Porter, R-Ill., said Clinton, as the chief law
enforcement officer, was different from Livingston because the
president undermined the justice system by lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about human frailties,'' Porter said. ``All
of us have human frailties. We're talking about covering them up.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said Livingston's confession of
adultery pointed out hypocrisy on the part of Republicans and will
make it more difficult for Clinton's political opponents to
criticize the president for moral shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The indignation factor and the moral superiority factor
diminish some'' in light of Livingston's acknowledgement, Frank
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, D-Mass., said Livingston's confession
``just heightens and highlights the dual standard'' of the
Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the witch hunt for the sexual infractions of
government officials will continue ``unless we stop talking about
morality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We isolate sex _ that's the one bad thing,'' Kennedy said.
``This is just hogwash... When you start down the path of morality
in this place, you better be on your best behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's admission follows that of a parade of lawmakers who
have been forced to divulge marital indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J.
Hyde of Illinois, admitted to an extramarital affair in his past,
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., a constant critic of Clinton, acknowledged
that he had a child out of wedlock years ago. Rep. Helen Chenoweth,
R-Idaho, also admitted to a sexual relationship with a married man
when she was unmarried.

MURPHY MAKES THE DIFFERENCE FOR THE WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The time is embedded in Scotty Bowman's memory. It was
the NHL trade deadline, March 18, 1997, and it appeared the
afternoon would pass quietly, unceremoniously, for a team that
didn't appear to need much help in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting right here, and the phone rang at 10 minutes to
2,'' recalled Bowman, sitting in his office at Joe Louis Arena
earlier this week, pinpointing the very minute that the Red Wings
took one giant step toward their first Stanley Cup in 45 years.
``It was Cliff Fletcher. And he said, `Look, we're dumping salaries
up here. Do you want Larry Murphy?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hold on, Bowman told the then Maple Leafs general manager.
Bowman didn't have to be convinced of Murphy's value, how he would
enhance an already impressive blue line, but he would have to run
the numbers by Red Wings owner Mike Ilitch.
</P>
<P>
   The coach hung up the phone, jerked it back up, called Ilitch,
and went into a short dissertation on blue line vs. bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line was this: It came down to an $800,000
gamble,'' said Bowman. ``He had another year left on his deal at
around $1.8 million. But the Leafs were putting in some money, and
the way his deal was written, we could have bought out the final
year at $800,000. That was it _ $800,000.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Ilitch, never tightfisted when it comes to his hockey
team, said something like this: ``So, Scotty, why are you
calling?''
</P>
<P>
   Deal done.
</P>
<P>
   ``And by the end of the season,'' said Bowman, ``we'd re-signed
him for another two or three years. When you look at it, the whole
thing was very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, now 37, also earned his third Stanley Cup ring only some
10 weeks after arriving in Detroit. A year later, he had his
fourth. Is he the reason the Wings, in Boston to face the Bruins
Saturday night, are two-time defending Cup champs? Not entirely.
But for what now seems a ridiculously cheap, virtually no-risk
gamble, the Wings added a significant piece of experience and
stability to a back line that might not have withstood the grueling
pressures of playoff hockey without him.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Detroit has been a perfect fit for Murphy. At
most, Hockeytown might not be on the map without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know, I think it's a case of the rising tide lifts
all ships,'' said Murphy, who Wednesday night rammed home a
power-play goal, the 269th strike of his career, to help the Wings
rub out the Bruins, 5-3, in Detroit. ``I've seen that consistently
through my career. A good team makes everyone better.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit No. 1 in Murphy's career, of course, was Pittsburgh, the
fourth stop on his meandering itinerary. He came to the Penguins in
December 1990, in the heart of Mario Lemieux's prime and just as
Jaromir Jagr arrived, and within six months, Pittsburgh had its
first Cup. A year later, it had No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone picking up the theme here? Twice in Murphy's career, some
very good things have happenend to some very good teams when he
arrived in town. In the '90s, he's become the game's Cup closer. He
has won more Cup rings this decade than any other player. Not the
greatest skater, not the biggest hitter, not in possession of the
hardest shot, Murphy has spent nearly 20 years being vastly
overlooked and undervalued in the NHL, and all he'll have in the
end is at least four Cups and a polished plate in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe to the press and to the people outside the game, he's
been overlooked,'' said Bruins captain Ray Bourque, who began his
career in Boston in the fall of 1979, only 12 months before Murphy
launched his career in Los Angeles. ``But the guys who've played
with him and against him know what he's accomplished. You don't
keep putting up the numbers he's put up, doing the job he's done
all these years, without being a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Headed into Friday night's action, Murphy led all NHL defensemen
in scoring this season (4-19_23) and had 1,126 career points,
ranking third on the all-time list among defensemen and 36th
overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's even more remarkable this year,'' said Bowman, ``is
that he's leading the list and I don't even have him on my first
power-play unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's goal against the Bruins came on the man advantage, the
veteran cheating down low from the right point and roofing a relay
to the top shelf as he approached the inner edge of the right
faceoff circle. It took a blend of timing and touch, two of
Murphy's strongest suits.
</P>
<P>
   These are the twilight years for some great NHL defensemen, a
group that could be considered, collectively, the best ever to work
the blue line: Paul Coffey, Al MacInnis, Scott Stevens, Chris
Chelios, Bourque, and Murphy. Coffey was the sweetest skater in the
bunch. MacInnis had the hardest shot. Stevens had the rage,
especially in his earlier years, and the strength. Chelios had the
snarl, the switchblade attitude. Bourque had the best package, the
blend of power and finesse, offense and defense.
</P>
<P>
   What has Murphy had? A lot of all those things, but no single
distinguishing trait, a bunch of 8's, 9's, and 9.5's on a scale of
10. The critics _ especially a tough Capitals home crowd that
mocked his skating in his five-plus years with Washington _ pointed
to his lack of jump and speed. But his longevity has shown that
moderate speed, blended with positioning and savvy, often can win
the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed is definitely not my game,'' said Murphy, who recalls
being branded slow when he was 5 years old and finished in the back
of the pack in a race around his hometown rink. ``But the key on
defense is that you've got to move laterally, and I can skate
laterally with anybody. If a guy outskates me, that's unacceptable,
because I should never put myself in a position where a guy can
outskate me.''
</P>
<P>
   These days Murphy is paired mostly with Nicklas Lidstrom, the
hard-shooting Swede who is far less likely to jump into the play
than the more mobile Murphy. When at their best, the Wings play the
most uptempo game in the NHL, attacking with four lines that cannot
be matched for quality or depth. Murphy is right about the rising
tide. It is a very talented squad, but one enhanced by his ability
to orchestrate play when he's on the ice. He has that Brad
Park-like sense and skill to skate into the action, move to exactly
the right spot, and make it look like his freeze frame is doing
more than everyone else's fast forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say that it's never been a situation in my career
where accolades have been heaped upon me,'' said Murphy. ``I've
always taken pride in doing my job, satisfied that I've done it
effectively and to the best of my ability. There's no real flash
involved, I guess. I don't shoot 100 miles an hour. I don't skate
100 miles an hour. I don't run anyone through the boards. The truth
is, it's a real kick for me, an honor, whenever I'm even mentioned
in the same breath as some of the great defensemen.''
</P>
<P>
   If he has been overlooked, said teammate Brendan Shanahan,
perhaps it has been because of the teams he's played for, the
cities in which he's played. The Kings were woeful, the Caps ever
looking for an identity. The North Stars were laughable. Pittsburgh
was a great team but hardly a media mecca. And then of course,
there was Toronto, where Murphy took the brunt of the fans' ire, a
homeboy who got lynched by the locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he was going there to finish his career,'' said
Shanahan, ``but it didn't work out like that. You get out of a
situation like that, it's like you're a rookie all over again.
Sure, he's been overshadowed, but look at his career: He gets the
Cups, he gets the points. The truth is, he's one of the best
defensemen ever to play in the NHL.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Dec. 20, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Should congressional
Republicans' rush toward impeachment despite a lack of public
support really have come as a surprise? The merits of the case
against President Clinton aside, the outcome might well have been
inevitable, given the political dynamics that rule Washington
today. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-TWAIN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mark Twain's opinion of
politicians wasn't high. ``The political and commercial morals of
the United States are not merely food for laughter, they are an
entire banquet,'' he wrote. The House impeachment and Senate trial
of President Andrew Johnson gave him a lot to dine out on.
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING-DISORDERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some holiday shoppers
spend more than they should, for reasons they shouldn't. These
problem consumers are engaged in compulsive shopping, competitive
shopping and revenge shopping. Doctors say these feelings, which
reflect deeper psychological disturbances, may intensify around
Christmas, when people are inundated with subtle and not-so-subtle
messages to spend. By Tracie Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-REVIEW (Undated) _ Social Security reform might be the
one policy initiative that emerges next year from a Congress
otherwise fixated on impeachment. The system begins to run out of
money early next century when retirement of the baby boomers leaves
the system searching for revenue. Everyone agrees the system needs
a fix, the sooner the better. But the obvious solutions _ reducing
benefits, raising taxes and postponing retirement _ are
unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-REVIEW (Undated) _ Even analysts who urge the United States
to actively promote a coup d'etat against Saddam Hussein and
consider the sanctions a useful form of pressure on the regime say
that getting to the dictator will be extremely difficult physically
and politically. Some experts note that the Iraqi people still
accept and support Saddam, and that the bombings have little effect
on people accustomed to suffering. By Youssef Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-ARMS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Seven years after Saddam Hussein
promised to come clean about his weapons of mass destruction, and
days after yet another military confrontation with the West over
his continuing refusal to do so, the book on Iraqi arms is still
riddled with holes. Military experts say the unanswered questions
are serious and legion. Still unaccounted for are hundreds of
chemical arms, tons of nerve gas, more than 100 germ weapons and
parts for up to four nuclear warheads, which are said to lack only
the uranium to fuel them. By William J. Broad and Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-DESERTFOX (Undated) _ A look at the origins of the name
Operation Desert Fox. By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   LATAM-LEADERS-REVIEW (Miami) _ All across Latin America,
presidents and party leaders are looking over their shoulders. With
his landslide victory in Venezuela's presidential election on Dec.
6, Hugo Chavez has revived an all-too-familiar specter that the
region's ruling elite thought they had safely interred: that of the
populist demagogue, the authoritarian man on horseback known as the
caudillo. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-CHRISTMAS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Christmas has returned to
Cuba; Cubans are once again free to observe the holidays. By Mirta
Ojito.

<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ University of Massachusetts football coach
Mark Whipple ran into Georgia Southern coach Paul Johnson outside
the press conference room Thursday, and they congratulated one
another for making it to Saturday's 2 p.m. NCAA Division 1-AA title
game.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the coaches was prepared to receive such praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not where you guys are,'' said Whipple, the first-year
coach whose team has rebounded from a 2-9 debacle last season to
advance to its second championship game in school history while
posting an 11-3 record. He was alluding to the fact that Georgia
Southern is 14-0, ranked No. 1 in the nation, and seeking its fifth
national title.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson paused after Whipple's comments, then gazed at his
surroundings. ``Yes, you are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Southern coach is correct. Both teams have earned
their way to east Tennessee, having overcome obstacles in the
regular season and playoffs. And though Georgia Southern is favored
Saturday, Johnson knows UMass is capable of an upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure (UMass) would like to lull everyone into thinking
that they're the underdog and they have no business being here,''
said Johnson. ``But I tell you for one, we're not going to fall for
that. We've watched them play and we know they have a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson knows this is a most intriguing final, a contrast in
styles. Both teams feature high-powered, record-setting offenses
that average more than 400 yards a game, but UMass is primarily a
passing team. Georgia Southern runs the first option offense the
Minutemen will have faced this season, although Atlantic 10 foe
Delaware, which beat the Minutemen, 33-30, in the season opener,
runs a variation of it with its Wing-T.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern's attack has set 49 offensive records,
including 11 national 1-AA marks. It finished the regular season
ranked second in the nation in rushing (378.7 yards a game) and has
scored 69 of its 82 touchdowns on the ground. The Eagles reached
the final with a 42-14 victory over Western Illinois, which boasted
the top-ranked defense in 1-AA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia Southern can run, they have great speed, and they're
well coached,'' said Whipple, who should be familiar with the
option _ he ran the offense as a quarterback at Brown. ``They don't
have any weaknesses. We have to play close to a perfect game in
order to win.''
</P>
<P>
   While the option might cause some problems for the Minutemen, it
could also be seen as a UMass advantage because it is
rush-oriented. Delaware is the only rush-oriented team to beat
UMass this season. All the others, including favored postseason
foes McNeese State and Northwestern (La.) State, lost in part
because they were forced to pass more than normal just to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   One of the keys to the contest will be whether the UMass defense
can contain an offense that wears down opponents in the second
half. Georgia Southern has scored at least three touchdowns in the
second half of each of its three postseason contests while holding
its opponents to a total of 19 second-half points.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles are led by quarterback Greg Hill, a decent passer (90
of 150, 1,527 yards, 10 touchdowns, 7 interceptions) who is the
team's No. 2 rusher (262 carries, 1,359 yards, 22 TDs). Freshman
fullback Adrian Peterson (337 carries, 2,445 yards, 32 TDs) is
arguably the best rusher the Minutemen have faced since New
Hampshire's Jerry Azumah, the 1-AA player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the speed of UMass's linebackers will help against
Georgia Southern, Whipple said, ``From what I've seen on film, I've
seen Colgate (Georgia Southern's first-round opponent) get close to
them and I've seen UConn (the Eagles' second-round opponent) get
close with their linebacker play.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there's no doubt (UMass linebacker) Kole Ayi has to play
tremendous. Khari Samuel has to stop the middle, and Matt Dawson
has to be in the right position, and those guys have to make
tackles on the perimeter. Their offense forces you into so many
one-on-one situations where their athletes are better than the
other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Whipple makes no bones about the fact that in order for the
Minutemen to win, quarterback Todd Bankhead (286 for 500, 3,767
yards, 34 TDs, 20 interceptions) must have an exceptional outing.
Once again, the Minutemen face one of the quickest defenses in
1-AA, and the junior, who often struggles once flushed out of the
pocket, will be harassed all day.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore running back Marcel Shipp (393 carries, 2,298 yards,
15 touchdowns) must also have a solid outing. After sitting out the
McNeese State game with a knee injury, he has rushed for 349 yards
on 74 carries and scored two touchdowns in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Jimmy Moore, the Minutemen's leading receiver (86
catches, 1,431 yards, 16 TDs), has drawn much double and triple
coverage in the playoffs. All-America tight end Kerry Taylor (70
catches, 832 yards, 5 TDs) will also attract a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   That means Saturday could be big for speedy freshman tight end
Adrian Zullo (27 catches, 465 yards, 7 TDs), who surprised McNeese
State with a 31-yard touchdown catch, one of the biggest plays in
that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go out and play sound defensively,'' said Georgia
Southern lineman Eric Davis (60 tackles, 11 sacks). ``We have to
stick to our game plan, and everything will come out fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Whipple is banking on the same approach. ``We can't make a
statement and change the whole philosophy just because we're
playing Georgia Southern,'' he said. ``We're going to play football
UMass style. I don't want our kids to think they have to play
perfect; I want them to play perfectly with emotion, intensity, and
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do that, we will be right there in the fourth quarter.
And if we're there in the fourth quarter against Georgia Southern,
anyone who has seen us this year can tell you that anything can
happen with us.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Dec. 20, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Should congressional
Republicans' rush toward impeachment despite a lack of public
support really have come as a surprise? The merits of the case
against President Clinton aside, the outcome might well have been
inevitable, given the political dynamics that rule Washington
today. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-TWAIN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mark Twain's opinion of
politicians wasn't high. ``The political and commercial morals of
the United States are not merely food for laughter, they are an
entire banquet,'' he wrote. The House impeachment and Senate trial
of President Andrew Johnson gave him a lot to dine out on.
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING-DISORDERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some holiday shoppers
spend more than they should, for reasons they shouldn't. These
problem consumers are engaged in compulsive shopping, competitive
shopping and revenge shopping. Doctors say these feelings, which
reflect deeper psychological disturbances, may intensify around
Christmas, when people are inundated with subtle and not-so-subtle
messages to spend. By Tracie Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-REVIEW (Undated) _ Social Security reform might be the
one policy initiative that emerges next year from a Congress
otherwise fixated on impeachment. The system begins to run out of
money early next century when retirement of the baby boomers leaves
the system searching for revenue. Everyone agrees the system needs
a fix, the sooner the better. But the obvious solutions _ reducing
benefits, raising taxes and postponing retirement _ are
unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-REVIEW (Undated) _ Even analysts who urge the United States
to actively promote a coup d'etat against Saddam Hussein and
consider the sanctions a useful form of pressure on the regime say
that getting to the dictator will be extremely difficult physically
and politically. Some experts note that the Iraqi people still
accept and support Saddam, and that the bombings have little effect
on people accustomed to suffering. By Youssef Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-ARMS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Seven years after Saddam Hussein
promised to come clean about his weapons of mass destruction, and
days after yet another military confrontation with the West over
his continuing refusal to do so, the book on Iraqi arms is still
riddled with holes. Military experts say the unanswered questions
are serious and legion. Still unaccounted for are hundreds of
chemical arms, tons of nerve gas, more than 100 germ weapons and
parts for up to four nuclear warheads, which are said to lack only
the uranium to fuel them. By William J. Broad and Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-DESERTFOX (Undated) _ A look at the origins of the name
Operation Desert Fox. By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   LATAM-LEADERS-REVIEW (Miami) _ All across Latin America,
presidents and party leaders are looking over their shoulders. With
his landslide victory in Venezuela's presidential election on Dec.
6, Hugo Chavez has revived an all-too-familiar specter that the
region's ruling elite thought they had safely interred: that of the
populist demagogue, the authoritarian man on horseback known as the
caudillo. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-CHRISTMAS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Christmas has returned to
Cuba; Cubans are once again free to observe the holidays. By Mirta
Ojito.

BLEDSOE TO NURSE FINGER FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There's still another week to go before a
final decision is made, but as of now, it appears Drew Bledsoe will
not play against the New York Jets Dec. 27 in the regular-season
finale. In fact, he might not be seen again until the playoffs _ if
then _ should the Patriots get that far.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not in a good way right now,'' said coach Pete Carroll
Friday. ``The more time we can buy him, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, looking as down as he's ever been in his career, is
pessimistic about the immediate future as he continues to
rehabilitate his broken right index finger, which will force him to
the bench Sunday when Scott Zolak faces the San Francisco 49ers at
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not optimistic about playing next week,'' he said. ``The
reason is it's like a brand new injury. They just put the pin in
there and they have to allow for it to heal. Now that I've been out
for an extended period, I have to practice before I can play. If it
was a week or two weeks, a veteran quarterback can go that long
without practicing. I've had two practice days in the last month.
If I'm gonna play, I have to have the practice reps. It would be
foolhardy to go into the game next week with no practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who sports a wrap around the injured finger, with a pin
sticking out of the top, said, ``I'd have to have the problem
resolved by Wednesday or Thursday of next week. That's highly
unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was asked about the possibility of resting Bledsoe if
the Patriots qualify for the playoffs this weekend via a win over
the 49ers and a Tennessee loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much can (the finger) progress between now and then?'' the
coach said. ``It's not going to really repair itself. It's going to
be difficult for him to play next week, and Drew knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said that while he's optimistic about the team's chances
without him, ``I figured out today I've only been on the sidelines
for three games since 1990. I didn't know how it would be going
into a game knowing I wouldn't play. I've tried to help Scott and
been involved in the game plan with Scott and I'll be out there
rooting for Scott and supporting him. Right now that's all I can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to be able to play in the playoffs three weeks from now
but has no idea whether he will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' said Bledsoe. ``I would hope that would be the
case. I would have to see what our medical staff has to say _
whether that's next week or the week after, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   So it all comes down to Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran backup will likely have every opportunity to get the
rust out of his system. And then he may have a chance to beat Bill
Parcells at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see Drew playing against New York,'' said Zolak. ``Not
with that pin sticking out of his finger. At some point, you have
to worry about permanent damage to the finger.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells and Zolak have had a love-hate relationship. Two years
ago, Parcells was on Zolak about losing weight. Zolak also took a
big pay cut in the final year of Parcells's New England tenure,
from $800,000 to $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   When Ernie Zampese took over as offensive coordinator, there was
some talk about bringing in Jim Everett as the backup, but the
Patriots thought they were fine with Zolak and Tom Tupa.
</P>
<P>
   Now the team is trying to break in Northeastern's Jim Murphy,
who's on the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak said he's received more attention this week than ever
before. ``More than I deserve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been exciting. It's been a short week, really. Sunday we
go to the hotel and Sunday we play the game. It can't come soon
enough. I just want to go out there and do some positive things,
not try and win the game by myself. They're going to try and
confuse me. I've heard the comments from them that they'll treat me
like they do Drew, but I know that's just talk. They'll be coming
at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak says he can't look beyond Sunday, even though he's aware
he'll likely be the starter in both of the remaining games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get both, but you have to worry about this one
first,'' he said. ``It's a short two-game season for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak has distributed about 20 extra tickets to friends and
family. His father, who was his high school coach, will be at the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak said the team had a good week of practice, and it appears
his teammates are rallying around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's usually a guy who kids around and has some fun, but this
week he did none of that,'' said Chad Eaton. ``He was all business.
The guys on the team watch him in practice all the time, and he
does a great job. I think everybody knows Scott can get the job
done. Now we have to help him out. We have to have a great
performance by the defense.''

CITIZENS' FISH EARNS BIG PAYCHECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lawrence K. Fish, chief executive of Citizens Financial
Group, continued his status as one of the highest-paid bankers in
New England by pulling in $5.5 million in the bank's 1998 fiscal
year ended Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The figure, which represents a 47 percent raise from last year's
compensation, includes $789,600 in base salary, $4.62 million in
performance-related bonuses, and $137,760 in pension contributions
and other benefits, according to the company's proxy statement
released Friday. The proxy listed Fish's pay in British pounds,
which Friday exchanged at a rate of 1.68 US dollars to the pound.
</P>
<P>
   Bank analysts said Fish earned his big paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's worth every penny,'' said James Moynihan, senior vice
president of Advest Inc. in Boston. ``He's done a remarkable job.
If you look at his numbers, it just keeps getting better and
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Citizens had a banner year, Moynihan noted. The Providence,
R.I.-based bank posted a record $244 million in net income, up 32
percent from $185 million in fiscal 1997. Assets grew to a record
$17.3 billion in 1998, up 6.7 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Citizen's parent company, the Royal Bank of
Scotland, issued a statement defending Fish's pay package.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted to have the opportunity to pay this level of
compensation to Larry Fish,'' said George Mathewson, group chief
executive of the Royal Bank. ``The compensation package is formula
driven based on a pre-determined set of growth targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with those of his peers, Fish's $5.5 million salary is
both above and below average. Terrence Murray, chief executive of
Fleet Financial Group Inc., last year earned $3.8 million in salary
and bonus. BankBoston's CEO, Charles K. Gifford, made $3.3 million
in salary and bonus in 1997. (Their 1998 salaries will not be
disclosed until next year, when the companies will issue proxy
statements on their 1998 financial performance.)
</P>
<P>
   However, when stock awards and other stock incentives are taken
into account, Fish's salary is dwarfed by Murray's estimated $22
million total 1997 compensation package, which included a one-time
stock payment if Murray stays with Fleet until 2001. In addition to
his salary and bonus, Gifford also received a stock award of $1
million and stock options worth between $3 million and $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fish, by contrast, receives no stock awards, noted Gerard
Cassidy, an analyst with Hancock Institutional Equity Services.
``Larry Fish's compensation is different than some of the others
because he doesn't have the access to the stock options available
to some of his peers,'' Cassidy said.

three years after the United States emerged from an awful Civil
War, the House of Representatives debated the impeachment of a
president Friday. It scheduled for Saturday a vote on four articles
of impeachment ``for high crimes and misdemeanors'' against William
Jefferson Clinton. Ledeall. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   WASHINGTON _ Despite Russia's anger over the bombing of Iraq and
the recall of its ambassador from Washington, Moscow's private
conversations with U.S. officials reflect a desire to preserve and
protect the U.S.-Russian relationship, senior American officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian fury has been leveling off from its peak on Wednesday,
the officials said, noting that the most positive conversation yet
occurred Friday morning between Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov repeated an invitation for Albright to come to Moscow,
and she expects to go there toward the end of January, said her
spokesman, James Rubin. The conversation Friday, which lasted half
an hour with some translation, was ``an extremely important
exchange,'' Rubin said, and Ivanov emphasized ``that the Russians
understand the importance of maintaining a broad-based relationship
with the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said later: ``The Russians recognize that
they need to keep good political and economic ties to the West,
even if they are angry and embarrassed. And they won't risk all
that for the sake of Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov also passed on a relatively conciliatory message from
President Boris Yeltsin to President Clinton, officials said. On
Thursday, Clinton sent a letter to Yeltsin explaining the U.S. and
British decision to bomb Iraq and asking the Russians to work to
manage their differences with Washington and concentrate on vital
areas of common interest, including Moscow's financial
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, Vice President Al Gore telephoned Russia's
prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, to explain the U.S. position.
When Primakov asked Gore to stop the bombing, Gore responded that
the attacks would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the Russians recalled Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov,
who was due to retire and return to Moscow soon in any event.
Vorontsov left Washington Friday. The Russians simultaneously
recalled their ambassador from London.
</P>
<P>
   The recall was believed to be the first since 1979, when
Washington recalled its ambassador from Moscow because of the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the Soviets recalled their
ambassador from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But given the tensions of the nuclear-tipped Cold War, both
sides considered it more important to retain diplomats in each
other's capitals than to give vent to pique.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions with Moscow about its budget and possible new loans
from the International Monetary Fund are proceeding on a separate
track, the officials said. U.S. officials do not want the Russians
to think there is a crude economic or political price to pay for
their opposition on Iraq, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians will keep up loud, public criticism of American and
British actions so long as the bombing continues over Iraq, a
senior U.S. official said. ``No one should be surprised by that,
and we shouldn't overblow it,'' he said. ``Both sides are mindful
of the importance of bilateral relations, there will be more
meetings between officials next week and life will go on.''
</P>
<P>
   The official identified three reasons for Russian anger. First,
Moscow and Primakov personally have tried to be key players in
resolving the Iraq crisis, but their efforts have failed, producing
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov is an Iraq expert and knows its leaders well, including
Saddam Hussein and Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister. In
November 1997, Primakov, then foreign minister, personally arranged
a deal with Iraq to comply with U.N. resolutions and work with U.N.
weapons inspectors that short-circuited American plans to bomb
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But Saddam broke his promises to Primakov then, as he broke
similar promises made last February to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Russians felt insulted that they were not consulted,
as Security Council members, before the bombing began, and that the
bombing in fact began in the middle of a Security Council debate on
Iraq. While Washington says it consults Moscow, Russian officials
often complain that such consultations often have the humiliating
feel of lectures or briefings.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese and French sometimes complain of the same feeling,
U.S. officials admit.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Russian domestic politics essentially demands a tough
reaction to the U.S. superpower taking nearly unilateral action
against Russian wishes, whether it be in Iraq or in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People and bureaucrats in the Russian system itself are
frustrated by many factors, by the poor economy and Russia's
reduced status, and they want to vent,'' an official said. ``Events
like this one can become a way for Russians to vent their
frustrations about everything.''

REHNQUIST, JUDGE AT SENATE TRIAL, IS AN EXPERT ON IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 20)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a Senate trial of President William Jefferson
Clinton early next year, the man with the gavel will be Chief
Justice William Rehnquist, a staunch conservative, a history buff
and an expert on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution vests the chief justice with the responsibility
of presiding over Senate impeachment trials of presidents. It is a
role that seems well suited to Rehnquist, 74, author of the 1992
book ``Grand Inquests,'' which, among other things, recounts the
1868 trial of President Andrew Johnson, who was impeached by the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very familiar with role he'll be undertaking,'' said
Charles Cooper, a Washington lawyer and former Ronald Reagan
administration Justice Department official who served as a law
clerk to Rehnquist. ``If he hadn't done all that research already,
he'd have to do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is a scholarly treatment of what Rehnquist sees as a
watershed event in U.S. history that did much to flesh out the
Constitution's division of power between the executive, legislative
and judicial branches.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the stridently partisan Clinton impeachment debate
can take heart from portions of the book dealing with the Johnson
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a Southern Democrat who went to the White House in 1865
after the assassination of President Lincoln, incurred the wrath of
congressional Republicans over his opposition to post-Civil War
reconstruction in the South. Johnson's removal of War Secretary
Edward Stanton was the final straw, leading the
Republican-dominated House to impeach Johnson for violating a law
barring such dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist praises key senators who participated in the 1868
trial for treating the case, not as a political issue, but as a
``judicial proceeding'' dealing with violations of law.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, this bolsters their contention that the case
against Clinton essentially is a legal one involving a president
violating the law, which he has sworn to uphold.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Johnson ultimately died because not enough
senators thought Johnson's firing of Stanton violated the law or
felt that it was a close call, Rehnquist wrote. A guilty vote
requires two thirds of those voting, and Johnson escaped such a
verdict by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that on a factual level the charges against
Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky matter will be easy to prove.
Democrats disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist sees the Senate's acquittal of Johnson as an important
triumph of what he calls the American ``tripartite federal system
of government,'' where, unlike the parliamentary system, the
president is not subject to easy removal by the legislature for
political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   That view is good news for Clinton backers, who see the
impeachment and removal from office process as a politically
motivated ``coup d'etat'' by Republicans seeking to turn back
Clinton's two electoral victories.
</P>
<P>
   Some liberals are cautiously hopeful about how Rehnquist will
handle the trial of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have mixed signals on where (Rehnquist) would be,''
said Nan Aron, executive director of the Alliance for Justice, a
liberal judicial watchdog group. ``He has a background as a very
political justice, but his book urges caution and raises concern
over impeachment. One would hope he could rise above partisanship
to be fair..MDNM/''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the interpretation, Rehnquist's power at the Senate
trial will be limited. The 100 senators who serve as jurors are
free to submit written questions through the chief justice to
witnesses and lawyers. And senators irked by the chief justice's
rulings on the evidence or on procedural matters can call for votes
to overturn them.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist has a reputation as a crusader who has done much to
advance a conservative legal agenda in almost 27 years on the
Supreme Court. He wrote the dissent in Roe v. Wade, the landmark
1973 opinion legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a stalwart opponent of affirmative action and
expanded rights for criminal suspects, as well as a proponent of
the death penalty and efforts to lower the wall between church as
state.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist also authored the court's 1988 opinion upholding the
law authorizing independent counsels to investigate high government
officials. Under the law, Kenneth Starr was appointed in 1994, and
his investigation brought to light the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal
that led to the charges against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A Milwaukee native, Rehnquist practiced law and became active in
Republican circles in Phoenix in the 1950s and 1960s. There he met
Richard Kleindienst, who was deputy attorney general and later
attorney general under President Richard Nixon. Kleindienst brought
Rehnquist to Washington to serve in the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed to the high court in 1971 and sworn in on Jan.
7, 1972. Two years later, in the burgeoning Watergate scandal, the
court voted 8-0 to compel Nixon to turn over tape-recorded
telephone conversations to the special prosecutor. Rehnquist
abstained.
</P>
<P>
   President Ronald Reagan named Rehnquist chief justice in 1986 to
replace the retiring chief, Warren Burger. During his contentious
confirmation hearing that year, Rehnquist's own veracity came under
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, opponents charged that he had not told the
truth about his days in Phoenix in the 1960s as a GOP poll watcher.
They said he harassed and intimidated likely Democratic voters.
Rehnquist denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   James Brosnahan, now a San Francisco lawyer, testified at
Rehnquist's confirmation hearing that as a young assistant U.S.
attorney in 1962 he observed Rehnquist at a polling place and that
some voters accused him of challenging their right to vote. But
Brosnahan told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not
observe the alleged harassment himself.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his law office in San Francisco, Brosnahan said he
has no reason to doubt Rehnquist's ability to preside over an
impeachment involving allegations of perjury. ``That was then, this
is now, and he's the chief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist won Senate confirmation as chief justice on Sept. 17,
1986, by a vote of 65-33.

CLINTON STICKS TO TIGHT SCHEDULE AS HOUSE DEBATES IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the House debating the impeachment of a
president for the first time since 1868, Hillary Rodham Clinton
broke months of silence on her husband's plight Friday by urging
Americans to devote the holiday season to ``end divisiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's appeal contrasted to the public silence of
President Clinton on a make-or-break day in his presidency. White
House officials said the president was too busy working to make
public remarks or monitor the House debate on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, citing the confluence of the Jewish holiday of
Hanukkah, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Christian
celebration of Christmas, said the holidays are ``a time for
reflection and reconciliation among people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton spoke as she draped her arm around Julian Hill, 11,
whose 4-year-old brother was killed by a drunken driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in our country ought to practice reconciliation and we
ought to bring our country together and we ought to end
divisiveness because we can do so much more together,'' Mrs.
Clinton said, the Capitol dome in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that we as a nation would turn our attention to
what we could do together, what we could do positively and how we
could build each other up,'' Mrs. Clinton said in remarks after an
event to highlight the holiday efforts of the Mothers Against Drunk
Driving.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore rejected GOP appeals for Clinton to
resign. ``People can forget about that,'' Gore declared.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart lambasted a ``cynical
political strategy'' by Republican congressional leaders to force
Clinton's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will ``absolutely not'' step aside, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   J. Philip Wogaman, pastor at the Foundry Methodist Church in
Washington, said in a broadcast television interview with the
Public Broadcasting System's Religion &AMP; Ethics Newsweekly that
Clinton remains ``a man of great resiliency'' who is ``determined
to continue leading the nation in the midst of all this.'' The
Clintons attend Wogaman's church.
</P>
<P>
   With the president's crowded schedule, Lockhart said Clinton was
not watching televised coverage of the House debate. Instead, the
president reviewed U.S. combat operations in Iraq, held a summit
with two European leaders, mapped federal spending for fiscal year
2000 and met with advisers on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is ``clearly an issue that impacts him,'' Lockhart
conceded, adding: ``He does not have the luxury of not staying
focused on his duties (and) on the things that he's promised the
American public he'll do _ and that's what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton notably skipped an opportunity to use a meeting with
moderate Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., as a public platform to
address GOP moderates in an effort to staunch the threatened
impeachment vote on Saturday. Shays entered and left the White
House without public comment.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said that Clinton, who relishes the minutia of
policy and politics, was finding comfort in the details of official
duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he goes into a budget meeting, he quizzes his advisers
closely,'' Lockhart said. ``He's clearly conversant in all the
particular minutia of budget issues that (budget) people need him
to be fluent in to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's mood appeared to change during the day. The president
appeared pensive and determined as he walked past a pair of
reporters in a White House corridor as he escorted Shays to the
Oval Office area.
</P>
<P>
   A little while later, Clinton was jocular, bantering with
photographers escorted into the Oval Office to take pictures of his
meeting with European officials.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said White House officials are hoping that ``with a
couple of weeks off for Christmas and New Year's, we can all have a
New Year resolution that Congress will come back in the spirit of
bipartisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were pressing the Republican-led Congress
to approve a bipartisan resolution of censure to punish Clinton for
covering up his sexual affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky and lying to two federal court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that Clinton would return to work after a holiday
break determined to work for a bipartisan compromise to avoid a
protracted trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be up to Congress to decide if they can create a
spirit of bipartisanship and a spirit of putting America's
interests before their own political interests,'' Lockhart said.

   The House last debated the impeachment of a president after the
Civil War when President Andrew Johnson, a former governor of
Tennessee, was impeached by the House in a dispute over the
president's effort to ease the harshness of the federal occupation
of the defeated Confederacy. Johnson prevailed in the Senate trial
by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   President Richard M. Nixon, who faced articles of impeachment
approved by the House Judiciary Committee in 1974, resigned from
office before the House took up action on his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces four articles of impeachment lodged by the House
Judiciary Committee, charging him with two counts of perjury,
obstruction of justice and abuse of power in connection with his
cover-up of the Lewinsky affair.

AT THE BIG BOARD, THE STORY OF `A'  
 INDIVIDUALS HOLD MOST FOREIGN STOCKS  
 TWO POPULAR CATEGORIES BEATING THE S&AMP;P 500 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Dec. 20) 
(Eds: Bylines follow individual items.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the New York Stock Exchange can only watch from afar the
frenzied activity these days in Internet stocks, which generally
trade on Nasdaq, the Big Board is ground zero for intense
speculation of another kind: Which company is going to get ticker
symbol ``A''?
</P>
<P>
   Could it be Amazon.com?
</P>
<P>
   The issue arises because it seems likely that A _ possibly the
most coveted symbol among the single-letter elite _ will soon
become available with the completion of a merger between the
present holder, Astra AB, Sweden's biggest drug company, and
Britain's Zeneca Group.
</P>
<P>
   Given how quickly Citigroup moved to snap up Chrysler's recently
abandoned symbol _ ``The C went so fast it was incredible,'' a
spokeswoman said _ the sparring over A is already thought to be
fierce. But the Big Board is officially coy, the bargaining
presumably being conducted at such a high level that someone in the
symbol trenches, speaking on condition of anonymity, would say
only, ``It hasn't hit my desk'' yet.
</P>
<P>
   With companies increasingly eager to extract maximum public
relations and marketing mileage from easy-to-remember or clever
symbols, the exchange has a powerful recruiting tool for new
listings. Although there is no official monopoly, the Big Board has
all the single-letter symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the single letters are currently unassigned. I and M are
rumored to be lures in the exchange's campaign to attract Intel and
Microsoft, while Q has long been unassigned because, the
spokeswoman said, of a traditional association with bankruptcy. The
fourth is V, which would seem to be a natural for Venator, formerly
Woolworth, which so far has stuck with its Z.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the single-letter club is far less exclusive than it used
to be. Barnes Group (B) and Realty Income Corp. (O) are hardly
household names, and Jackpot Enterprises (J) somehow seems a pale
substitute for Standard Oil of New Jersey, now Exxon (XON), which
once endowed the letter with blue-chip appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can call it elite,'' one exchange official
said of the single-letter designation. ``We try to be very
accommodating.''

   Individuals, Not Institutions, Hold Most Foreign Stocks
</P>
<P>
   For years, institutional investors were the ones that ventured
abroad. Now, according to a study by Citibank, the banking
subsidiary of Citigroup, individuals hold the majority of foreign
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The study, released last week, found that individuals, either
directly or through mutual funds, controlled 55 percent of U.S.
investment in foreign stocks in 1997. By contrast, in 1991,
individuals accounted for just 21 percent of that investment.
</P>
<P>
   The study said the figure was expected to grow to 59 percent by
2003. One reason for the shift: individuals' interest in increasing
returns for retirement, according to James P. Donovan, Citibank's
global managing director for depository receipts. ``They can create
greater wealth by diversifying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, overseas investing has been treacherous this year.
That is reflected in Citibank's estimate that the dollar volume and
number of American depository receipts, or ADRs, issued by foreign
companies is down sharply this year. Overall, the bank estimated
that 83 companies would raise $9 billion by year-end, vs. 144
companies that raised $18.6 billion in 1997. ``It's the instability
of the markets,'' Donovan said. ``Nobody is going to raise capital
at a subpar value if they don't have to.''

   FUNDS WATCH
</P>
<P>
   Two Popular Categories Beating the S&AMP;P 500
</P>
<P>
   A curious phenomenon has bolstered some stock mutual funds
during the 1998 home stretch. On average, two of the more popular
stock fund categories are beating the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index, the benchmark that has been trouncing active fund managers
for years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lipper Inc., the S&AMP;P returned 7.63 percent from the
end of October through last Thursday. The average capital
appreciation fund, by contrast, returned 8.86 percent over that
time and the average growth fund returned 7.69 percent. (Micro-cap
funds, which would never invest in a company in the S&AMP;P 500, really
surged, providing a 10.55 percent return over the same period.)
</P>
<P>
   The source of the smart showing by these funds? ``We've begun to
see some giveback by the large caps,'' said Michael Lipper,
chairman. ``The S&AMP;P is not as all-powerful as it has been.'' The
surging telecommunication and technology sectors have had a
salutary effect, too.

   MARKET (New York) _ Investors seemed nonchalant Friday as the

the bombing of Iraq continued. Stocks rose, with the Nasdaq index
surging 2 percent to a new high, while the other major indexes rose
modestly. Bond prices inched higher while the dollar slipped lower.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Partisanship rages. Colleagues who once worked in
a spirit of cooperation are at each others' throats. Spin doctors
bombard us with embarrassing revelations and ludicrous propaganda.
And over it all looms the spectre of war.
</P>
<P>
   It happens every year, and it gets worse every year. It's
movie-awards season.
</P>
<P>
   And even though we're going to be subjected to three more months
of nonsensical hype _ the 71st Academy Awards will be presented
March 21, 1999 _ most of the desperate lobbying and special
pleading that's going to be directed toward Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences members already has been rendered moot.
</P>
<P>
   As is usually the case in the top Oscar races, they're
essentially over just as they kick into high gear. Despite a hiccup
or two in the preliminary heats _ the film scholar-dominated
National Board of Review's, the L.A. and New York film critics'
groups awards and the Golden Globe nominations _ you're not likely
to lose money on a ``Saving Private Ryan'' bet.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the International Free Food for Trophies Trading Co. ...
Whoops, I mean, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which puts
on the Golden Globes, gave more nominations to ``The Truman Show''
and ``Shakespeare in Love.'' But once the Oscar nominations are
announced Feb. 9, expect all those extra academy technical
categories (cinematography, editing, sound, etc.) to fall in behind
the ``Ryan'' victory march.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, ``Truman'' and ``Shakespeare'' will be Oscar's other
certain Best Picture contenders, and deservedly so. But just as
rightfully so, the momentum is with Steven Spielberg's Normandy
assault.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other slots, it looks like they'll be filled by two
of the following three titles: the respected ``Elizabeth''; the
dearly, if not universally loved ``Life Is Beautiful'' (which, due
to some arcane international food-for-trophy trading bylaw, did not
qualify for Globes consideration); and the little ultra-indie that
could, ``Gods and Monsters,'' the only movie that is racking up as
many pre-Oscar honors as ultra-production ``Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Best Actor award looks more and more like ``Monsters'' star
Ian McKellen's every day, too. If the British knight wins for his
psychologically intricate portrayal of horror movie director James
Whale, he'll be the first openly gay actor to do so for playing a
gay role.
</P>
<P>
   We can confidently guess that the other Best Actor nominees will
be ``Ryan's'' Tom Hanks, ``Life Is Beautiful's'' Roberto Benigni,
``Truman's'' change-of-pace Jim Carrey and Nick Nolte, who does
career-crowning work in the grim but mesmerizing, aptly titled
``Affliction.'' Which means, unfortunately, that Brendan Gleeson's
brilliant portrayal of an eccentric Irish crime lord in John
Boorman's equally award-worthy ``The General'' will go
unrecognized.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, heh heh, enough academy voters read this article.
</P>
<P>
   In a refreshing turn of events, Best Actress consensus is
growing for Brazil's Fernanda Montenegro, the 67-year-old veteran
who so bravely exposed her every dark insecurity in ``Central
Station.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the category is somewhat open, despite the dreary
inevitability of at least one slot getting taken up by those
dueling dying moms Meryl Streep (``One True Thing'') and Susan
Sarandon (``Stepmom''), neither of whom were in projects worthy of
their talents. Much better that this year's two best pseudo-Brits _
Australia's Cate Blanchett (``Elizabeth'') and our own Gwyneth
Paltrow (``Shakespeare'') _ are equally likely candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is: Will stodgy academy voters overcome their
prejudices against both comedy performances and experimental
hair-care products to nominate the trickiest female performance of
the year, Cameron Diaz's irresistably appealing work in ``There's
Something About Mary''? Hope so, but don't bet your Brylcreem on
it.
</P>
<P>
   Another great performance that risks being overlooked is Joan
Allen's tender ``Pleasantville'' turn as a '50s sitcom mom alarmed
and elated by newly discovered human passions. Though she won a
couple of critics groups' supporting-actress citations, Allen's
snub by the foreign press (who were evidently fed better by Brenda
Blethyn and Sharon Stone's people) could prove fatal, Oscar-wise.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, lack of Globe nominations pretty well quashed
``Pleasantville's'' once plentiful Oscar hopes. Also toasted by the
foreign feeders _ as in, they're toast _ were former hopefuls ``The
Thin Red Line,'' ``Waking Ned Devine,'' ``A Simple Plan'' (except
for supporting actor Billy Bob Thornton), ``Stepmom'' (except for
Sarandon), ``A Civil Action'' (except for supporting actor Robert
Duvall) and ``The Prince of Egypt'' (except for its noisy
Mariah/Whitney duet).
</P>
<P>
   Leading the Supporting Actress Oscar race at this point are Judi
Dench, who plays Queen Elizabeth in ``Shakespeare'' (has any
actress ever not been nominated for playing the virgin queen?) and
Kathy Bates for her eerily prescient ``Primary Colors'' portrayal
of a woman disillusioned by a Clinton-like politician's behavior.
The next most likely suspect is Lynn Redgrave for her
funny/touching, Igorish ``Gods and Monsters'' housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, Duvall, ``Truman Show's'' Ed Harris, ``Rushmore's''
Bill Murray and Geoffrey Rush (for either ``Elizabeth'' or
``Shakespeare'') look good in the Supporting Actor category.
</P>
<P>
   But there could be an upset nominee when the academy votes are
counted, and a worthy one at that. Jeremy Davies, who was the
complexly cowardly recruit in ``Private Ryan,'' reportedly has
impressed the acting branch voters far more than he has the outside
observers in the HFPA and the critics groups.
</P>
<P>
   Director? You have to ask? Sure, ``Red Line's'' Terrence Malick
topped Steven Spielberg in the New York Circle's vote, but that was
likely just because his South Pacific war film has prettier
foliage, and those snooty, concrete-bound critics tend to mistake
plant life for art. The Manhattanites still gave ``Private Ryan''
their Best Picture nod, so what does that tell you?
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the slate with Spielberg will be ``Truman's'' Peter
Weir, ``Shakespeare's'' John Madden and ``Life Is Beautiful's''
Benigni. Fifth spot's open; it probably will be filled by a
Globe-boosted actor-director such as Warren Beatty (``Bulworth'')
or Robert Redford (``The Horse Whisperer''). Historically, the
directors branch members who do the nominating view guys like them
as lesser competition for future work than a full-time filmmaker
who could win that Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   The writing categories are traditionally Oscar's most eclectic,
intelligent and _ because of those two factors _ unpredictable. We
will fearlessly predict, though, that on March 21 the cleverly
complicated and thoroughly satisfying ``Shakespeare in Love'' will
triumph over such inevitable contenders as ``Private Ryan,''
``Truman Show'' and ``Bulworth'' in the Original Screenplay
category.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been a banner year for adapted screenplays, but this
race may be where otherwise undermentioned films such as ``Simple
Plan,'' ``Affliction,'' ``Little Voice'' and ``A Civil Action'' get
recognized. If the writers are really in a perverse mood, they
could give a nomination to ``Thin Red Line.'' If they want to be
even sicker, how about the ``Psycho'' remake _ though that may
qualify more as an original than an adapted screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, things will change during the course of the Oscar
season, but it would be unrealistic to anticipate surprises on a
par with, say, Newt Gingrich's resignation of the House speakership
or the bombing of Iraq. They'll probably be more along the lines of
incoming House Speaker Bob Livingston's forced admission of marital
infidelity: perhaps not expected, but once you think about it, no
real surprise at all.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitable, though, will be more misguided hype (Variety already
has run Best Actress consideration ads for the little girl from
``The Parent Trap'') than humanly imaginable, all in pursuit of
insanely overvalued, gold-plated statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   There are hard times ahead, America. Lace up your combat boots. &QL;

HUSTLER PUBLISHER REVELS IN ROLE IN LIVINGSTON SEX DISCLOSURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was, in some ways, perhaps inevitable that
Hustler publisher Larry Flynt would immerse himself in the
infidelities of President Clinton and other Washington politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Raunchy, flamboyant, self-serving and defiant, Flynt was fully
enjoying his notoriety Friday just as he did more than 25 years ago
when he leveraged a string of Ohio strip clubs into the start of a
publishing empire that pushed _ and is still pushing _ the limits
of sexual tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt is taking credit for the disclosure by House Speaker-elect
Bob Livingston that he had carried on adulterous affairs in his
past. Apparently the disclosure was made after Livingston learned
that Hustler was set to publish a story that says that the
Republican lawmaker had the affairs with at least four different
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we were getting ready to go with this story and are
disappointed he scooped us,'' Flynt said in a statement Friday
morning, hours before he held a news conference in his offices
overlooking Wilshire Boulevard. He has said he will publish it in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago Flynt paid $85,000 for a full-page ad in The
Washington Post offering up to $1 million to any woman who could
prove that she had a sexual relationship with a member of Congress
or a high government official. The ad was vintage Flynt. More than
20 years ago he placed a similar ad in The Post after two
congressmen, Reps. Wayne Hayes, D-Ohio, and Wilbur Mills, D-Ark.,
were caught in sex scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Although Flynt has been fond of saying, ``All I wanted to do was
make some money and have some fun,'' his aspirations and obsessions
have seemed a little deeper than that.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt has raged against what he views as sexual hypocrisy and
became an improbable champion of the First Amendment when the
Supreme Court in 1988 overturned a jury's $200,000 award to the
Rev. Jerry Falwell for ``emotional distress'' over a Hustler
magazine parody that portrayed him as an incestuous drunk. The 8-0
ruling broadly re-affirmed and extended the court's rules
protecting criticism of public figures as free speech, even if the
criticism was ``outrageous'' and offensive.
</P>
<P>
   What has stamped Flynt's life and career was not only
controversy _and the outrageous style of ``Hustler'' _ but a
virtual obsession with self-promotion and publicity. He has been in
and out of court on obscenity trials. He even ran for president in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Alexander, co-author with Larry Karaszewski of ``The
People vs. Larry Flynt,'' the Milos Forman-directed film about the
publisher, once said that when Flynt campaigned for the presidency,
he ``practically hijacked the front page of the daily newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, you'd open the paper and he was doing something
outrageous,'' he said. ``One day he'd be running for president, the
next he would show up in a courtroom wearing a diaper. After that,
he'd pay his fines with garbage bags loaded with one-dollar bills,
delivered by hookers. He just kept topping himself, as if he was
addicted to getting in the news.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynt's life has been marred by tragedy. His wife, Althea
Leasure, died of AIDS. Flynt himself was paralyzed below the waist
in 1978 when a drifter who once belonged to the Ku Klux Klan and
the American Nazi Party shot him during a pornography trial in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt, who has lived in a 24-room Bel Air mansion for years,
later became addicted to painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   His associates have said that, in recent years, Flynt has turned
into a relatively serene figure, especially in contrast to his
earlier years when he brought the sex industry to America's
heartland.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, it seems that his earlier stated goal of having
money and fame are only a small part of what drives Flynt now.
``People have a very sketchy idea of my life,'' he said last year.

RELIGION: MANDELA PRAISES CHURCHES' ROLE IN EDUCATION AND
LIBERATION
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early generations of Christian missionaries from Europe and the
United States often fared poorly in the popular media. They have
been depicted in novels and films as arrogant or, worse, tools of
colonial adventurers.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, the work of missionaries, specifically in
education, received a word of praise from a source widely regarded
as one of the late 20th century's moral leaders, President Nelson
Mandela of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela turned up as a nearly unexpected but quite welcome guest
on Sunday, Dec. 13, at the Eighth Assembly of the World Council of
Churches, meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe. The assembly, whose
delegates represent 339 Protestant and Orthodox Christian churches
worldwide, had been expecting South Africa's deputy president,
Thabo Mbeki. But Mandela sent word a couple of days before the
assembly that he would be going instead.
</P>
<P>
   In part, he went to thank the council for its support in the
1970s and 1980s for organizations like his African National
Congress, in their struggles against white-minority governments in
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, the council initiated its Programme to Combat Racism,
which eventually called for an end to bank loans to South Africa's
apartheid government, advocated economic sanctions against South
Africa and, in a contentious move upsetting some of the council's
own members, gave cash grants (for humanitarian purposes, the
council said) to groups fighting for majority rule in South Africa
and in the former Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your support,'' Mandela said to delegates gathered at the
University of Zimbabwe, ``exemplified in the most concrete way the
contribution that religion has made to our liberation, from the
days when religious bodies took responsibility for the education of
the oppressed because it was denied us by our rulers, to support
for our liberation struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he singled out the work of missionaries in education,
ad-libbing his thanks to missionary teachers who worked in South
Africa when he was a child. ``My generation is the product of
church education,'' Mandela said. By contrast, he said, the
government of his day ``took no interest whatsoever'' in educating
Africans, people of mixed race or Indians.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were the second by a prominent African on the
subject of church-sponsored schools recently. In November, United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan received the World Methodist
Peace Award, and in response he favorably recalled his education in
a Methodist school in Ghana. Annan is quoted in the current issue
of the magazine The Christian Century saying he was fortunate to
have had teachers ``who understood the value of knowledge infused
with a moral purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   At the assembly, Mandela's arrival generated enough excitement
to pack the hall with delegates wrapping up their 12-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Before they adjourned Monday, delegates put the council on
record as favoring cancellation of the foreign debts of the world's
poorest countries and also released a statement on human rights,
calling for the elimination of the death penalty, condemning
violence against women and declaring religious freedom to be a
fundamental right. They also passed a statement condemning the use
of children as soldiers in conflicts around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they issued the declarations, delegates were made
aware of a potentially difficult financial future for the council,
which has twice reduced its staff to eliminate budget deficits in
the A report by the assembly's finance committee showed the council
relied on western European churches for 82 percent of its budget.
</P>
<P>
   The report said those churches were under financial pressure,
facing changes in tax policies in their nations or declining
membership. It recommended measures like the replenishment of
reserve funds and the improvement of fiscal forecasting, while also
warning that the council had ``no room for complacency'' on this
issue.

   FORT STEWART, Ga. _ All along the thin ribbons of blacktop that
connect Fort Stewart with the rest of the world, homemade signs
hang from the pines to welcome home soldiers returning from
postings overseas. The welcomes, to ``Leigh'' and ``Boo-Hoo'' and
others, are painted in giant letters on bedsheets, so that the
returning husbands, wives, mothers, fathers and sweethearts cannot
possibly miss them as they drive in.
</P>
<P>
   But when some of these soldiers finally get home this time, the
painted messages will have faded. The loved ones put them up just a
little too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Fort Stewart, headquarters for the 3rd Infantry Division
(Mechanized), as at other military bases around the country,
President Clinton's decision to bomb Iraq has canceled the
homecoming of many from the Persian Gulf and will probably cause
others to ship out to the gulf over the next few days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was supposed to come home today,'' Stefanie Terrell said of
her husband, Sgt. Terrence Terrell, who has been stationed in
Kuwait since August.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, just as Terrell was planning to board a plane for home,
the missiles began to fall on Baghdad and his unit got new orders:
Stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt panic,'' Mrs. Terrell said. And also some anger. Why
just now, she wondered. Why, after so many months of standoff and
diplomacy?
</P>
<P>
   Like Mrs. Terrell, a lot of people here do not want to believe
that the soldiers of their own families could be put in harm's way
because Clinton needed a diversion to try to forestall impeachment.
But the timing, they say, does look bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was right,'' said Mrs. Terrell, whose
husband had promised the middle of their three children, 8-year-old
Dominic, that he would be home by Saturday, the boy's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell will instead be with the crew of his Bradley Fighting
Vehicle _ a fast-moving fortress of armor equipped with an antitank
missile, a cannon and a machine gun _ although his wife does not
know where.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me at four this morning,'' said Mrs. Terrell, who
works as a maid at the Holiday Inn in Hinesville, a town bordering
this base just west of Savannah. ``He told me not to worry, and
that he loved us. I asked him if he was going to be where there was
any fighting, but he couldn't say. It was hard. I immediately
thought of the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the attack on Iraq has been limited to air strikes,
there is always the fear here that ground soldiers like Mrs.
Terrell's husband will have to take part later on, even as officers
and social workers tell her there is nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   The same frustration can be found up and down the strip
developments that make up Hinesville, where spouses wonder whether
Clinton's decision to bomb Iraq was purely a strategic one, or
whether he is playing politics with lives.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Herrera's husband, Porfirio Herrera, is a track mechanic
who planned to spend Christmas here with his family, but now he has
begun preparing to ship out. He is expected to be ordered to the
Persian Gulf sometime in the next few days, said Mrs. Herrera, who
works in the produce section at a Kroger supermarket in Hinesville.
They have two children, ages 7 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to tell them, and I don't know what to
think,'' she said when asked whether she was angry with the
president. After a few minutes, she added, ``I think they should
send Clinton to Iraq and send our men home.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were worried, but not angry. They believed that Clinton's
decision was based not on political strategy but on that of his
military advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Roseberry, a manager at Kroger, is married to a soldier
based in Kuwait. ``He's a gunner on a Bradley,'' she said. ``If
there is a war, he'll be the one pulling the trigger. He was
supposed to be home this week.''
</P>
<P>
   But her husband, Sgt. David Roseberry, told her by telephone
that he believed the decision was a military one. ``It's something
that just happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many families here that had expected to have their loved ones
home for the holidays are disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Hall's boyfriend, Matthew Neely, is a tank crewman who is
now expected to ship out immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got the call,'' she said. ``Christmas is not a good
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Terrell, though brokenhearted, knows that this is all part
of being married to a military man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always waiting for him to come back,'' she said.

CLINTON STICKS TO TIGHT SCHEDULE AS HOUSE DEBATES IMPEACHMENT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the House debating the impeachment of a
president for the first time since 1868, Hillary Rodham Clinton
broke months of silence on her husband's plight Friday with an
appeal to ``end divisiveness'' this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's appeal contrasted to the public silence of
President Clinton on a make-or-break day in his presidency. White
House officials said the president was too busy working to make
public remarks or monitor the House debate on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, citing the confluence of the Jewish holiday of
Hanukkah, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Christian
celebration of Christmas, said the holidays are ``a time for
reflection and reconciliation among people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton spoke as she draped her arm around Julian Hill, 11,
whose 4-year-old brother was killed by a drunken driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in our country ought to practice reconciliation and we
ought to bring our country together and we ought to end
divisiveness because we can do so much more together,'' Mrs.
Clinton said, the Capitol dome in the distance.

   ``I would hope that we as a nation would turn our attention to
what we could do together, what we could do positively and how we
could build each other up,'' Mrs. Clinton said in remarks after an
event to highlight the holiday efforts of the Mothers Against Drunk
Driving.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore rejected GOP appeals for Clinton to
resign. ``People can forget about that,'' Gore declared.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart lambasted a ``cynical
political strategy'' by Republican congressional leaders to force
Clinton's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will ``absolutely not'' step aside, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   J. Philip Wogaman, pastor at the Foundry Methodist Church in
Washington, said in a broadcast television interview with the
Public Broadcasting System's Religion &AMP; Ethics Newsweekly that
Clinton remains ``a man of great resiliency'' who is ``determined
to continue leading the nation in the midst of all this.'' The
Clintons attend Wogaman's church.
</P>
<P>
   With the president's crowded schedule, Lockhart said Clinton was
not watching televised coverage of the House debate. Instead, the
president reviewed U.S. combat operations in Iraq, held a summit
with two European leaders, mapped federal spending for fiscal year
2000 and met with advisers on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is ``clearly an issue that impacts him,'' Lockhart
conceded, adding: ``He does not have the luxury of not staying
focused on his duties (and) on the things that he's promised the
American public he'll do _ and that's what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton notably skipped an opportunity to use a meeting with
moderate Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., as a public platform to
address GOP moderates in an effort to staunch the threatened
impeachment vote on Saturday. Shays entered and left the White
House without public comment.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said that Clinton, who relishes the minutia of
policy and politics, was finding comfort in the details of official
duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he goes into a budget meeting, he quizzes his advisers
closely,'' Lockhart said. ``He's clearly conversant in all the
particular minutia of budget issues that (budget) people need him
to be fluent in to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's mood appeared to change during the day. The president
appeared pensive and determined as he walked past a pair of
reporters in a White House corridor as he escorted Shays to the
Oval Office area.
</P>
<P>
   A little while later, Clinton was jocular, bantering with
photographers escorted into the Oval Office to take pictures of his
meeting with European officials.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said White House officials are hoping that ``with a
couple of weeks off for Christmas and New Year's, we can all have a
New Year resolution that Congress will come back in the spirit of
bipartisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were pressing the Republican-led Congress
to approve a bipartisan resolution of censure to punish Clinton for
covering up his sexual affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky and lying to two federal court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that Clinton would return to work after a holiday
break determined to work for a bipartisan compromise to avoid a
protracted trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be up to Congress to decide if they can create a
spirit of bipartisanship and a spirit of putting America's
interests before their own political interests,'' Lockhart said.

TOY MAKERS SCRAMBLING JUST TO STAY IN PLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 20) 
(bl) 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attention: just five more days until Christmas. But even as
children of all ages and sizes cram the malls in a final frenzy,
there are signs of unrest in toyland.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 14, Mattel, the world's biggest toy maker, warned that
its results for the fourth quarter and the year would be
disappointing. In the next breath, the company announced that it
was issuing $3.8 billion of its stock to buy The Learning Co., a
leading consumer software maker. Wall Street, unimpressed, gave
Mattel shares their worst one-day pasting in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The same day, Hasbro, No. 2 to Mattel, said it had tapped
Herbert Baum, the chief executive of Quaker State Corp., as its
president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Sean McGowan, an executive vice president at Gerard Klauer
Mattison, an investment banking and research firm, took some time
last week to discuss where in the world this $22 billion industry
is going.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does Mattel's earnings warning presage a cold Christmas for
all toy makers?
</P>
<P>
   A. The whole industry will not do as badly as Mattel, even
though it may be a flat year. This year is a tough one by
comparison with 1997, because last year was above normal. You had a
lot of hot toys last year, like Batman and Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about the retailers? Are there changes on that side of
the business?
</P>
<P>
   A. There is continued consolidation. The biggest surprise of
1998 will be that Wal-Mart is a bigger retailer of toys than Toys
``R'' Us. And if that does not happen, it will be true that
Wal-Mart is a bigger buyer of toys than Toys ``R'' Us. In terms of
share, five years ago Wal-Mart was about half as big.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the purpose behind the Mattel-Learning Co. deal?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think there is a lot of logic in putting the two companies
together. The consumer software-entertainment business has evolved
in ways that make it very much like the toy business. Brands and
licenses are more important, as is the use of television
advertising, managing retail inventories and managing a shrinking
retail base.
</P>
<P>
   Also, this is a business of constantly coming up with new ideas
in order to generate growth. For a $5 billion company like Mattel,
that means coming up with a $1 billion idea, which is about as big
as the third-biggest toy company. They have to look outside the toy
business for that sort of growth.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do these companies need to look elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   A. Kids are not buying toys the way they used to. They are
graduating out of toys at a younger age. If a 10-year-old spends a
lot of time downloading on the Net, it is hard to go back to
Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   Toy companies are facing three options: They can sell more
products to existing customers, sell more products to new
customers, or they can sell new products. As I said, the companies
have maxed out in the first area. And they are trying hard in the
second, as the effort to market collectible Barbies to 50-year-old
women shows. New products are the next big push.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What sort of products?
</P>
<P>
   A. Blends of video and software. But also I could see toy
companies buying sporting goods companies, comic book and gum
companies, apparel companies. These businesses will become
increasingly horizontally integrated. It might make sense for Walt
Disney Co., which licenses most of its toys through Mattel, to
branch out and buy a toy company. And Hasbro is already a fairly
significant candy company.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Speaking of Hasbro, what about its hiring the head of Quaker
State? It's hard to see the connection between motor oil and toys.
</P>
<P>
   A. Herb Baum's hire is the logical move in the sense that Hasbro
is looking at itself as more than a toy company. Before he was at
Quaker State, he ran the North and South American operations for
Campbell Soup. So while he doesn't have an entertainment
background, he is someone who can provide advice on how to grow the
company.
</P>
<P>
   I think Hasbro has excellent prospects for next year. I like the
management change, and they have a new line of ``Star Wars'' toys
coming out in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are toy stocks good investments?
</P>
<P>
   A. One of the things that attract investors to the toy industry
is to find the company that can come out of nowhere and do very,
very well. That happens, but every toy stock that has gone public
in the last 15 years has experienced some period of sharp
volatility. The barriers to entry and exit are very low in this
business. So it is not a place for long-term investors. And it is
not an industry to look at going into December, which is a reliably
tough month for the stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Aside from Hasbro, are there other toy stocks that you like?
</P>
<P>
   A. Noodle Kidoodle, a tiny retailer. They sell specialty toys
and educational products. They are having a terrific Christmas.

MERCEDES ENTERS LUXURY STATION WAGON MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sport-utility vehicle might have become the vehicle of
choice for many upscale buyers, thanks to luxury models from
Toyota, Lexus, Infiniti, Land Rover, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, GMC,
Isuzu, Acura, Mitsubishi and even Jeep.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone who needs extra space in a family hauler wants
to drive a truck, and most of the sport-utilities are trucks
underneath, no matter how fancy they are.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves a market for a luxury station wagon, hence Mercedes'
introduction last year of its latest high-end wagon, the E320.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, paying $50,000 or more for a midsize station wagon
seems a bit extravagant, especially considering that a Lexus LX 470
or Range Rover costs about the same but offers a whole lot more
bulk for the money.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes is selling the E-class wagons at a rate of about 3,500
a year, so apparently there are enough customers to make the
vehicle worth producing. Personally, I'd go for the Lexus or Range
Rover for the same money. But if I were looking to spend that much
on a wagon, the E320 would deserve consideration.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's the only wagon in that price class. The nearest
competitors are the Volvo V70 and V90 wagons, which list for under
$40,000. And Mercedes' M-class sport-utility with the same engine
as the wagon costs about $10,000 less than the E320, which is
probably why the company is selling about 40,000 of those per year.
</P>
<P>
   A popular option on the Mercedes wagon is the full-time
all-wheel-drive system, a $2,790 extra that raised the base price
of our test vehicle to $49,990 (plus $595 transportation).
</P>
<P>
   This is a full-time system that uses a 35/65 front-rear torque
split and requires no driver action. Mercedes says that half of the
wagon buyers opt for the all-wheel-drive. With some other goodies
tacked on, our vehicle's bottom line was a whopping $54,935, which
put it above the Lexus LX 470 but slightly below the Range Rover.
</P>
<P>
   The E320's best attributes are its luxury-sedan ride and
handling, something you won't find in a truck-based sport-utility
such as the LX 470 or Range Rover. Close your eyes in the E320
wagon and you can't tell the difference between it and the E-class
sedan. It's not a bulky vehicle like most sport-utilities, either;
it's just six-tenths of an inch longer than the E-class sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Power comes from a high-tech, 3.2-liter, aluminum V-6 engine
rated at 221 horsepower and 232 foot-pounds of torque _ the same
engine used in the E-class sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The engine has two platinum-tipped spark plugs for each cylinder
and three valves per cylinder. Sequential fuel injection and a
drive-by-wire throttle make for acceleration that is smooth as
silk. Coupled with the Mercedes five-speed automatic transmission,
this engine will move the all-wheel-drive E320 from zero to 60 mph
in just 8.2 seconds (7.8 seconds with standard two-wheel drive).
</P>
<P>
   Like several of the high-end sport-utilities, the E320 wagon is
equipped with a standard folding third-row seat, giving it seating
for up to seven people. Also like many of the SUVs, the third seat
is best left to children or pets; it's hard for adults to get in
and out of this one.
</P>
<P>
   Because the wagon was all new last year, there are few changes
for 1999. Among them are a new-generation radio system that uses
fiber-optic technology and integrates controls for the sound system
and optional telephone. Our test vehicle came with a dash-mounted
AM/FM/cassette unit with weather band, and there was a separate
remote-mounted compact-disc changer (a $750 option)..
</P>
<P>
   Safety features abound on the E320 wagon. As with all 1999
Mercedes-Benz passenger vehicles, it comes with antilock brakes,
dual front air bags and door-mounted side air bags. It also comes
with ``brake assist,'' which Mercedes says is ``the only safety
system in the world that can actually shorten stopping distances in
emergency braking situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Brake assist is designed to detect a `panic' stop by how quickly
the brake pedal is applied. Then it applies full braking force
faster than the driver can. In addition, there is a three-point
seat belt for each of the seats.
</P>
<P>
   For people with small children who have to ride up front, the
E320 comes with the ``BabySmart'' automatic child-seat detection
system, which turns off the front passenger-side air bag if a
compatible infant or child safety seat is placed there. It has to
be one of Mercedes-Benz's infant, toddler or child-booster seats
that contains a transponder to alert the system to the seat's
presence. The three seats, each designed for a different age and
weight group, are available from Mercedes dealers. Of course, for
safety's sake, all children should be in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Traction control is standard on all E-Class models. In the
all-wheel-drive model, this system allows one wheel to deliver
driving power if it has traction, even if all three of the others
are spinning on slippery surfaces. The optional Electronic
Stability Program or ESP, a $1,000 extra, is available on the E320
wagon. It can detect an impending spin or slide and apply selective
braking on any of the four wheels to keep the car going where the
driver is steering it.
</P>
<P>
   There is lots of cargo room if you don't need the third seat for
passengers, and the rear hatch flips up for easy loading. With the
third seat folded down, there is 44 cubic feet of room for luggage
or camping gear. With the middle and rear seats folded, the space
expands to 83 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension system _ double wishbones up front and a
five-link rear arrangement _ is the same as in the Mercedes E320
sedan, providing the carlike ride and handling of the wagon. Also
included is automatic rear level control to let the wagon carry
heavy loads without overtaxing the suspension system.
</P>
<P>
   Among standard features of the E320 wagon are automatic
dual-zone climate control, leather seats, 10-way power front seats
and head restraints, one-touch (up and down) power windows, power
tilt and telescoping steering column, three-position memory (for
the front seats, mirrors and steering wheel), walnut interior trim,
integrated three-button garage door opener, and high-performance
eight-speaker cassette audio system.
</P>
<P>
   There is no conventional ignition key; an infrared signal from
the high-tech ``key'' allows you to start and run the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Our car came with a several options. Xenon gas-discharge
high-intensity headlights, headlight washers and automatic
rain-sensor windshield wipers were included in a package for
$1,200; parchment-leather seats cost $1,325; and the dark turquoise
paint job was an extra $750.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings for the wagon certainly are better than
those of the average sport-utility: 20 miles per gallon in the city
and 26 mpg on the highway (28 mpg highway with two-wheel drive).
The tank holds 18.5 gallons of fuel, down from 21.1 gallons in the
E-class sedan.

   IMPEACH (Washington) _ Ledeall: For the first time since Feb.
24, 1868, three years after the United States emerged from an awful
Civil War, the House of Representatives debated the impeachment of
a President today. It scheduled for Saturday a vote on four
articles of impeachment ``for high crimes and misdemeanors''
against William Jefferson Clinton. Although they protested bitterly
and ardently, Democrats acknowledged that passage of at least one
of them, and a Senate trial next year that could result in the
president's removal from office, had finally become inevitable. By

RUSSIAN-US RELATIONS AT LOW EBB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Along with the wrecked buildings and destroyed Iraqi
military facilities caused by the American and British attack on
Baghdad, there may be a far more lasting casualty: The close ties
Russia and the United States have enjoyed since the collapse of the
Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Angry that Washington has ignored its calls to halt the
bombardment, Russia warned Friday of potential serious damage to
the relationship between the world's largest nuclear powers that is
one of the main dividends of the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of an unraveling of relations clearly concerned the
White House. A spokesman said President Clinton, who infuriated the
Kremlin by not tipping off President Boris Yeltsin before the raids
on Iraq, had sent the Russian leader a letter explaining his
decision _ and that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was
proceeding with plans to visit Moscow next month.
</P>
<P>
   This came a day after Moscow took the rare step of recalling its
ambassador to the United States, something the Soviet Union never
did during all the spy scandals, arms races and political standoffs
during its 40-year confrontation with the United States after World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this action is not stopped, Russian-American relations can
seriously suffer,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told
Albright in a phone call. ``Everything must be done to rule out a
setback in our relations.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior military official, General Leonty Ivashov, went
further, saying Moscow may ``be forced to change its military and
political course and may become the leader of a part of the world
community that disagrees with the dictate'' of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Some reports said the Russian Northern Fleet, home to the
ballistic-missile-carrying nuclear submarines that form a large
part of Russia's strategic arsenal, was putting some units on alert
because of the Iraq crisis. But Russia's Defense Ministry denied
that ships or troops were being deployed, and other officials said
the move was merely symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   But the message was decisively chilly and the US administration
scrambled to reassure Moscow. State Department spokesman Jamie
Rubin described the Albright-Ivanov conversation as ``useful
exchange'' that reaffirmed the importance of US-Russia ties, even
while acknowledging ``a profound disagreement on the wisdom of
using force against Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the US-Russian relationship has been frayed for some
time. It has suffered from Russia's August economic collapse, the
appointment of a new Russian government that has been slow to
embrace economic policies favored by Washington, and an increase in
anti-Semitic and jingoistic statements from among Russian
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   What was supposed to be the Clinton administration's greatest
foreign policy success, aiding the transformation of Russia to a
liberal, market-oriented and law-abiding state, has fizzled. Not
only has billions of dollars in Western aide from the International
Monetary Fund gone wasted, but now it appears that Russia will need
another bailout in the form of a restructuring package, or join
Sudan as the only two countries to default on an IMF loan.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the IMF does pitch in _ something it says it does not
want to do until Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov shows the fund a
realistic 1999 budget _ Russia will likely be unable to pay more
than a fraction of billions of dollars it borrowed from private
investors. The money was lost when Russia admitted in August it
could not meet its obligations on its treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott warned
the Primakov government it would get no help from international
lenders until it put its finances in order. It was a significant
about-face for Talbott, an architect of Clinton's Russia policy who
once was optimistic about Russia's reforms.
</P>
<P>
   US officials only slightly softened that stance at a briefing
during a visit here by Talbott and Deputy Treasury Secretary Larry
Summers, saying that they were ready to talk ``business'' with the
Primakov government but that they had not made any new
breakthroughs on aid.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, meanwhile, is smarting from more than hurt feelings over
having its efforts to end the Iraq crisis squelched by the US and
British airstrikes on Baghdad. Friday, Russia said it had also
recalled its ambassador to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   What really makes Russian politicians angry is knowing their
country, which in Soviet days struck fear in the hearts of Western
policymakers, cannot respond to the US attack. They cannot because
today's Russia depends on the United States for aid to its nuclear
scientists, to keep them from defecting to countries that want to
make nuclear weapons, like Iraq. Another US-funded program is
keeping Russia at the forefront of space travel. A third is aimed
at helping Russia feed its hungry this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Russians are) so agitated because they feel so
helpless,'' said Marshall Goldman, associate director of the Davis
Center for Russian Studies at Harvard. ``They just been completely
emasculated. What else can they do but roar and rant? It's such a
stange position for them to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, issued emotional
denunciations of US policy for the second straight day. The Duma
has already shelved plans to ratify the 1993 Start-2 treaty
reducing nuclear weapons. One lawmaker compared Clinton to the
Roman emperor Nero, and another warned that Washington was planning
nuclear strikes against North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the US embassy in Moscow, an angry crowd of about 100
Communist and nationalist sympathizers shouted ``Clinton!
Murderer!'' and burned American flags. Later, 300 Muslims held a
rally outside the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said he doubted this amounted to a new Cold War rift, a
sentiment echoed by Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes that under no circumstances should we
slide towards confrontation,'' Yakushkin told a briefing. ``But we
should call things by their name. The military strikes are
unacceptable and should be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Russians feel the have been driven to their current
helpless state because Yeltsin had trusted the traditional US enemy
too much.
</P>
<P>
   The man who forged those ties as foreign minister from 1992 to
1996, Andrei Kozyrev, was one of the few voices here Friday who
pointed out that Saddam Hussein, traditional Moscow ally though he
may be, posed a threat to Russia, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at our reaction, I feel like I'm living in the old
days,'' Kozyrev said. ``The presence of chemical, bacteriological
and nuclear weapons in the Middle East is more of a threat to
Russia than to America.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one here listens to Kozyrev, a discredited liberal from
Russia's discredited liberal past. They listen to people like
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who said Friday the Western
strikes threatened Moscow's relations with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Russia grudgingly accepted the Western alliance's
plans to expand to include former Soviet satellites in Eastern
Europe in return for a role as a NATO partner. But Russian
politicians no longer trust NATO, and Sergeyev canceled plans to
attend a NATO meeting Friday in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we talk about cooperation and partnership with the
alliance now, when Russia's opinion is openly ignored?'' Sergeyev
remarked.''

HOUSE MEMBERS DEBATE IMPEACHMENT; VOTE SET FOR SATURDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time since Feb. 24, 1868, three years
after the United States emerged from an awful Civil War, the House
of Representatives debated the impeachment of a president Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It scheduled for Saturday votes on four articles of impeachment
``for high crimes and misdemeanors'' against William Jefferson
Clinton. Although Democrats protested bitterly and ardently, they
acknowledged that passage of at least one of them, and a Senate
trial next year that could result in the president's removal from
office, had become inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a Democrat who was badly beaten
during the civil-rights demonstrations in the South during the
1960s, stilled the sometimes fractious House when he advised his
colleagues, ``The spirit of history is upon us and the fate of the
Republic before us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a grave and momentous day. For many, it was a grim day,
without joy or satisfaction. Some of the participants said they
were troubled that Congress seemed out of sync with the American
people. Others ``hated to get out of bed this morning,'' as Rep.
Tom Davis of Virginia put it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the 74-year-old chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee, sounded the Republican theme in his
opening statement, asserting that ``no man or woman, no matter how
highly placed, no matter how effective a communicator, no matter
how gifted a manipulator of opinion or winner of votes, can be
above the law in a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip in the House,
called impeachment ``a runaway train headed for a cliff.'' Rep.
Robert Wexler of Florida, another Democrat, raised the ugly specter
of McCarthyism and demanded of the Republican majority, in a
distinct echo of the Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954, ``Have we no
sense of decency?''
</P>
<P>
   The debate, sharply partisan like all the others in recent
months, lasted through the day and into the evening. It took place
as British and American warplanes rained bombs upon Iraq for the
third day running, and as Hillary Rodham Clinton offered a rare
public defense of her husband time since he admitted to having had
a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It came, too, in a coincidental conjunction that would have
delighted Kafka, at the very height of the holiday season, with
festive parties scheduled every night at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of Americans share my approval and pride in
the job the president has been doing for our country,'' Mrs.
Clinton said on the White House lawn, with the dome of the Capitol,
where the impeachment debate was underway, looming behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Louise Slaughter, a Democrat from upstate New York, urged
Clinton to think about resignation if he is impeached. She said
that ``his usefulness would be lost in dealing with other
nations.'' Rep. William Lipinski of Illinois, another Democrat,
spoke in the same vein.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, replied that the
president would ``absolutely not'' consider resigning, and he
launched a fresh attack on the Republicans on Capitol Hill,
accusing them of scheming to drive Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself spent the day focused on Iraq and the
international economy and in meetings with several foreign leaders,
including Chancellor Viktor Klima of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that the president had committed
``reprehensible'' acts and made ``deceitful'' statements to cover
them up, Democratic members of the House argued that his actions
did not come close to warranting impeachment, that they should be
given an opportunity to vote on censure as an alternative to
impeachment _ an option the majority has denied them _ and that the
debate should not be taking place in any case during military
action in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president did was wrong,'' said Rep. John Dingell of
Michigan, the dean of the House, who has represented a district
near Detroit since 1955, in direct succession to his father, also
John Dingell, who had represented it since 1932. ``What we are
doing is equally wrong _ an exercise in the abuse of power by the
majority over the minority.''
</P>
<P>
   The House's only independent member, Rep. Bernard Sanders of
Vermont, decried the prospect of a vote ``perhaps to paralyze our
government as the Senate explores Bill Clinton's extramarital
relations.'' He said that he had realized as never before ``just
how out of touch this institution is with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans pressed resolutely forward with their accusations
that Clinton had committed perjury, had obstructed justice and had
abused his powers as president, all to conceal the truth about the
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dramatic and possibly telling interventions came
from Rep. Tom Campbell of California, a moderate Republican often
criticized in his district for being insufficiently conservative.
He said in a soft voice that he could never trust Clinton again _
indeed that he had been persuaded that the bombing campaign was
legitimate only when Pentagon officials said it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is in his interest not to tell the truth,'' the
Californian said in a blunt indictment of Clinton, ``he will not
tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's flawless legal pedigree _ son of a federal judge,
star student at the Harvard Law School, clerk to a Supreme Court
justice, former professor at Stanford Law School _ lent weight to
his words.
</P>
<P>
   Another California Republican, Rep. Frank Riggs, one of 41
departing members who will cast the last votes of their
congressional careers Saturday, said he had talked on Wednesday to
two prominent Republicans, former President Gerald Ford and former
Sen. Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee. Both, he
reported, said that they would have voted to impeach.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ray LaHood, who comes from the quintessentially Middle
American city of Peoria, Ill., presided over the protracted debate,
in which dozens of members participated. He urged decorum as
speeches began at 9:29 a.m., Eastern time, but he had difficulty
maintaining it, repeatedly pounding his gavel for order.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde made a not entirely successful attempt to lend a sense of
patriotic majesty to the occasion. He cited not only Roman law, the
Magna Carta and the Constitutional Congress but also the Civil War,
and the battles of Bunker Hill and Lexington and Concord.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the debate was more a series of political set
pieces rather than a clash of oratorical titans in the mold of Clay
or Webster.
</P>
<P>
   A low buzz hovered over the House chamber for most of the day,
fed by whispered chats among members, ad hoc conferences, the
rustle of turning newspaper pages and speeches practiced in stage
whispers. A few times, hissing and hooting was heard.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats bemoaned the lack of civility characterizing the
entire process that has brought the president and the nation to the
current moment of crisis. Applause greeted a demand by Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, for an end to ``the
politics of slash and burn.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning, the public galleries were packed and almost
all the House's 435 members were in their brown leather seats. But
by midday, the chamber itself was half empty, as if all the drama
had been wrung out of the debate as soon as it started. By late
afternoon, only 38 members were there, though there were still
lines of people waiting for gallery seats.
</P>
<P>
   In backstairs conferences Friday morning, the two sides reached
an agreement on the length and of the debate and other rules,
avoiding a series of noisy public procedural squabbles that both
decided they did not want.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans moderated their rhetoric a bit, softening the
prosecutorial tone they adopted in the Judiciary Committee's
proceedings. But the Democrats' fury showed through.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers of Michigan said that he was witnessing ``a
Republican coup d'etat,'' and the same phrase was used by his party
colleagues, Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York and Rep. Maxine Waters
of California. At another point, in a more analytical mood, Conyers
stated one of the central Democratic contentions: ``Impeachment was
designed to rid this nation of traitors and tyrants, not attempts
to cover up an extramarital affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rep. Ike Skelton, D.-Mo., said the Republicans wanted to
``decapitate their commander in chief.'' Rep. Steven Rothman,
D.-N.J., complained of a ``Republican juggernaut, driven by the
right wing.'' Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D.-R.I., a nephew of the late
John F. Kennedy, spoke of ``a political lynching,'' and Rep. Danny
K. Davis of Illinois denounced what he described as ``a lynching.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D.-Ill., son of the civil rights leader,
said impeachment constituted an attack not only on Clinton but also
on the accomplishments of the New Deal, the Fair Deal and the Great
Society. African-Americans, who benefited hugely from all of those
programs, have been among the president's staunchest backers from
the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1868,'' Jackson said, referring to the impeachment of
President Andrew Johnson, ``it was about Reconstruction. In 1998,
it's still about Reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   There were repeated references to the Johnson impeachment, which
was voted upon in the same House chamber where the debate took
place Friday, and to the Watergate case in 1974. Articles of
impeachment never reached the full House on that occasion, because
Richard M. Nixon concluded that his conviction in the Senate was
certain and resigned the presidency to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my colleagues,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio of California, a
Democrat who is retiring, ``obsess about Slick Willie in the same
way that those on my side of aisle used to about Tricky Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   But the continuing air assault on Iraq came up even more often.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggested that the Democrats saw a political opening in the
Republicans' decision to stage the debate while the bombs were
still falling. But some seemed genuinely offended; their views were
crystallized on Thursday night by Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y.,
who served in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't separate the president from the
commander-in-chief,'' he said. ``You can't salute him in the
morning and impeach him in the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, Rep. Sam Johnson of Texas, a former pilot
who languished for seven years in a North Vietnamese
prisoner-of-war camp, made this retort: ``Our military fighting men
want the Congress to carry on our responsibilities every day.''
</P>
<P>
   A potentially volatile ingredient was injected into the
political equation by the confession of marital infidelity Rep. Bob
Livingston of Louisiana, the Speaker-elect, made on Thursday
evening. But there were only a few heavily veiled allusions to his
difficulties during the debate, all from the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the item under debate Friday was called House
Resolution 611.
</P>
<P>
   As read out Friday morning in a somber voice by the House
reading clerk, Paul Hays, it began, ``Resolved, that William
Jefferson Clinton, president of the United States, is impeached for
high crimes and misdemeanors,'' and went on to accuse Clinton of
perjury before a grand jury and in the Paula Jones lawsuit, of
obstructing justice in a variety of ways, and of abusing his power
by lying to and misleading Congress in his answers to 81 questions
posed by the House Judiciary Committee.

   WASHINGTON _ If US and British forces intend to wreak much
damage on Saddam Hussein's military power, the bombing of Iraq will
have to go on a while longer _ well into the Islamic holiday of
Ramadan, which starts at dawn Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually detailed data released by the Pentagon Friday show
that the air strikes Wednesday and Thursday struck some of their
targets with deadly force, but left many more just lightly damaged
or untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Air-strikes have steadily been stepped up over the past three
days, not just from cruise missiles fired by B52 bombers and ships
at sea, but also from combat planes dropping laser-guided bombs.
Baghdad has been hit, so far, only by cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Even the B1 bomber made its first entry into combat, though it
amounted to a cameo, a single plane flying one sortie. The
aircraft, which can carry 84 500-pound iron-bombs, unloaded a
barrage on an unspecified military target outside of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   True to the modest claims he has made for this campaign from the
start, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Friday that he was
``satisfied'' with the results of Operation Desert Fox so far. But,
in one of several official hints that the assault may continue into
the Islamic holy month, Cohen added, ``The strikes are not
complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry H. Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
heralded ``some very good success with our strikes,'' and showed a
few videotapes of direct hits. ``Not all of them have gone
according to plan,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said that the purpose of the air strikes
is to ``degrade'' and ``diminish'' Hussein's ability to threaten
his neighbors with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. By that
vague criterion, the president could call the troops home now, but
the results have not yet been what any military analyst would call
substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the situation on the ground in Iraq, the information
released by the Pentagon Friday was noteworthy on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe it was the first time during any military
operation that US officials had released comprehensive data on
``bomb-damage assessment'' and _ just as unusual _ spy-satellite
photographs showing how a number of targets looked before and after
an attack.
</P>
<P>
   The data showed that, over the first two nights, US and British
forces attacked 89 targets in Iraq, striking 77.
</P>
<P>
   Of those hit, eight were destroyed, 10 were severely damaged, 18
moderately damaged, and seven only lightly damaged. The damage
inflicted on 33 targets, over one-third of those attacked, had not
yet been assessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very early in the assessment,'' Rear Admiral
Thomas Wilson, the Joint Staff's director of intelligence, told
reporters. ``It is a very incomplete picture. ... We haven't even
looked at all the targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, by any military criteria, the data available suggest the
operation itself is at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're off to a really encouraging start, but it looks to me
like they've got a long ways to go,'' John Pike, a weapons analyst
at the Federation of American Scientists, said after examining the
data. ``There's an awful lot of `light to moderate damage,' but I
don't see very much in the `destroyed' or 'severe damage'
columns.''
</P>
<P>
   The results seem particularly unimpressive for the attacks on
the main target of this campaign _ the facilities that develop,
produce, store, and protect Hussein's nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons. Of 19 targets attacked that relate to the
security of these weapons, two were destroyed, one was severely
damaged, four were lightly damaged, and one was missed.
</P>
<P>
   Of 11 targets attacked that involved the production of weapons,
none were reported destroyed or severely damaged, though eight of
them are still being assessed for damage by intelligence
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether many weapons are missing their targets
or whether the weapons are simply too small to do much damage to
these targets, many of which are quite large.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise missiles and laser-guided bombs range from 1,000 to
2,000 pounds in explosive energy. That's enough to demolish small
structures or punch holes in large ones, but not enough to wreck,
say, a large office building or a blast-resistant airplane-hangar.
</P>
<P>
   Targets included missile-production factories, intelligence
headquarters, communications transmitters, airfields,
security-guard barracks, air defense sites, and _ the only
``economic'' target _ a refinery in Basra that reportedly has been
used to export oil in violation of United Nations sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials declined to comment on reports that they have
avoided bombing Iraqi chemical plants, for fear of releasing deadly
substances. However, Shelton noted they have not gone after
``dual-use'' facilities that make both chemical weapons and
civilian products.
</P>
<P>
   There has apparently been no resistance by Iraqi military
forces, other than scattered and ineffective anti-aircraft
artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   Officials refuse to say how many weapons have been launched at
these targets, though they have acknowledged that over 300 cruise
missiles have been fired _ at roughly $1 million apiece. They have
also said over 80 strike aircraft have dropped weapons, with most
carrying two to four laser-guided bombs; that's at least an
additional 200, or over 500 weapons in all.
</P>
<P>
   All this suggests each of the 89 targets has received, on
average, the firepower from at least five weapons. Some no doubt
were hit by more, others with fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials have raised the possibility of an early end to
the air strikes, due to the start this weekend of the Islamic
Ramadan holiday. Both Clinton and Cohen have promised to be
sensitive to this factor, but they haven't disclosed how long the
campaign might continue.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan has not stopped wars in the past. The 1973 Arab-Israeli
war took place during Ramadan. The Iran-Iraq war went on for eight
years with no breaks for the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   National security adviser Sandy Berger said Friday that Ramadan
``is not an automatic deadline'' to end the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign that military officers are looking toward a much
longer operation was the announcement Friday that more armed forces
are continuing to come into the Persian Gulf area.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Carl Vinson aircraft-carrier battle group was slated to
steam into the area Friday night. Additional troops and weapons
just started to load up from US shores Friday, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon Friday announced that bombs aren't the only thing
US aircraft were dropping on Iraq. They said A10 attack planes have
dropped leaflets on Iraqi soldiers in the southern part of the
country, warning them not to invade Kuwait again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraqi soldiers, save yourselves!'' one pamphlet reads. ``Only
those units who support the Baghdad regime were targeted. Your unit
was not targeted, but it is being watched. ... Stay in your
positions. Do not head south.''

THE GENTLE ART OF PERSUADING SHOPPERS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By DAVID COLMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It began innocently. On a recent Saturday, I was
waiting at the counter at Troy, the pristine, so-hip-it-hurts
furnishings store in SoHo, where my loved one, John Goodfriend, is
the manager. I was waiting for John to finish up while a
never-ending stream of holiday shoppers eddied around me. Waiting.
Waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in frustration, I approached an absolute stranger and
spoke the fateful words: ``Is there anything special you're looking
for?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, just browsing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. I found a young man who, in fact, was looking for
something special. I steered him to some minimalist Lucite picture
frames, whose chief allure, in my opinion, was the ease with which
the pictures inside could be exchanged for new ones whenever the
whim struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are fickle times,'' I pointed out. He bought two.
</P>
<P>
   Next I sold three bowls carved of horn to a charming young woman
shopping for a friend. In less than an hour, I had cleared $350
worth of merchandise. By then, John was ready to leave, and boy,
was he surprised at what I had been up to. ``You were really
selling things?'' he asked, unsure whether I had broken some
little-known rule. Later, he asked me again, as if waiting for me
to tell him I had been kidding.
</P>
<P>
   But I wasn't. Not only had I been selling, I had loved it. For
the brief three-quarters of an hour, I had been surrounded by
people, popular, a far cry from my usual days spent writing at a
computer alone in my apartment.
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of my Wisconsin boyhood, a time when for three
years running, I outsold every other student in my school in our
annual scholarship drive, selling cheese door to door.
</P>
<P>
   (Yes, cheese. Don't laugh. It was Wisconsin. OK, laugh.)
</P>
<P>
   It all came back to me: the rush of a sale, the wicked thrill of
getting to my friends' next-door neighbors and parents before they
did. To write the Details column for the Sunday Styles section, I
spend days going from store to store, shopping for a living.
</P>
<P>
   But I had never thought much about the person on the other side
of the transaction _ the salesman or saleswoman. Now I wondered:
Had I missed my true calling? Had I been cut out all along to be an
heir to Willy Loman?
</P>
<P>
   I called Troy Halterman, the owner of Troy, and asked if I could
come back to the store the following Saturday to move more
merchandise. He readily agreed. After all, it was the holiday rush.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning rolled around fast. Before I had time to blink,
it seemed, there I was, blasting ``You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch''
on the store hi-fi and sipping a second coffee as the first
customers trickled in. It was just like home, except there were
people there. What a relief from my usual solitary mornings.
</P>
<P>
   I was soon told, however, that I couldn't really blast music or
drink coffee on the sales floor.
</P>
<P>
   And then came a second blow to my high expectations. Selling
cheese to Wisconsinites (especially if you happen to be a cute
blond child on a bike) is a breeze compared with selling pricey
trinkets, however chic, to jaded New Yorkers. Everyone needs
cheese. But does everyone need an Italian gray glass decanter for
$280?
</P>
<P>
   Troy specializes in cool, hard-edged housewares that are the
apotheosis of today's vogue for modernist design. What the staff
calls its Christmas tree is actually a Dan Flavin-like chandelier
of red fluorescent tubes. The house gift wrap is a
cardboard-and-cellophane package with an Op Art pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers seemed intimidated by the merchandise. A simple
smile and a polite offer of help seemed to be getting me nowhere. I
decided to try more unconventional tactics. ``Are you looking for
anything special?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything ordinary, then?'' This got peoples' attention. So
did, ``Do you have any idea at all what you're looking for?'' and
``Do you have any questions, problems or feelings about the holiday
season that I can address?'' Although the answer was almost always
the old, ``No thanks, just browsing,'' I usually got at least a
smile out of the bargain, and on several occasions, customers came
round a little later and asked for help.
</P>
<P>
   I sold a lot of picture frames.
</P>
<P>
   But irreverence did not work on everyone. One woman looked at me
as if I were deranged, and my favorite sales come-on _ ``If you
want to spend a lot of money, please just let me know'' _ did not
go over well with anyone. The fashion designer Gene Meyer, who
wandered in around 2 o'clock, seemed put off by my methods. He
bought a lime-green 1960s Seth Thomas desk clock from someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Since I wasn't a full-time employee, I had no inhibitions about
telling people what I thought was a good buy, and what, in my
opinion, was an overpriced piece of debris. Surprisingly, some
customers were suspicious of this approach.
</P>
<P>
   While showing some beautiful glasses _ only 8 bucks a pop _ to a
woman in her 40s, I got the feeling that she thought I was trying
to unload some overstock and holding back on the good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   All told, I was able to ring up a couple of thousand dollars in
sales, not counting an additional $700 sale I arranged to have
charged over the phone on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By 6 p.m., however, my feet were killing me. If you think
walking around shopping is exhausting, you haven't experienced true
fatigue. I was dying for a drink, and I had finally snapped
``Fine!'' at the 1,000th person to say, ``No, just browsing.'' Once
we got home, John got out the movie listings, and I passed out for
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, over lunch with a friend, he suggested a movie
that afternoon, but I declined. I felt strangely drawn back to
Troy, where, minutes after I had my coat off, I was back on the
floor, selling away. I was determined to move one of the handmade,
watercolor-and-wenge-wood games of concentration, my favorite item
in the store. I had almost sold one the day before; the sticking
point, the couple explained, was they wanted it for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   I understood. I wanted it for myself, too. But the funny thing
now was that I wanted to sell it more than I wanted to buy it. Like
Willy Loman in Arthur Miller's famous description in ``Death of a
Salesman,'' I was riding on a shoeshine and a smile.
</P>
<P>
   I've got a little Willy Loman in me, I know now. So come into
Troy some time. I'll be the one asking, ``Do you have any idea at
all what you're looking for?''

IN A HOUSE BITTERLY DIVIDED, `THIS DREADFUL DAY' UNFOLDS

   WASHINGTON _ The strangest sound of all in the debate to impeach
President Clinton was the shockingly bipartisan roar of cheers and
applause suddenly erupting across the House of Representatives when
the plaintive cry came forth: ``The politics of smear and
slash-and-burn must end!''
</P>
<P>
   For the briefest moment in a day of bear-pit partisanship,
Republicans and Democrats rallied as one, finding common ground
over the haunting pathology of character attack that has become
text and subtext of the impeachment debate and the political
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   For that moment, debaters confronted the fact that the politics
of personal stalking is a force that can move overnight upon anyone
in their ranks _ even the speaker-elect, Rep. Robert Livingston,
R-La., who was forced to admit to marital infidelities on the very
eve of the impeachment debate. Except for their united roar of
anguish, however, House members offered the nation a day of
visceral partisanship that spilled beyond the debating floor.
</P>
<P>
   In a corridor encounter, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who first
instigated the impeachment drive against the president, emerged
from the debate after finishing his remarks with the flourish of
quoting President Kennedy on obedience to the law during the racial
integration crisis of the 1960s. He was intercepted by a furious
Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., a nephew of the late president.
</P>
<P>
   ``How dare you!'' Kennedy demanded. ``Anybody who has been to a
racist group has no right invoking my uncle's memory,'' he fumed,
referring to a speech Barr made to a group that espouses white
supremacist views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young man,'' Barr began drily addressing Kennedy in reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a duly elected representative of my state,'' Kennedy
snapped back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed,'' Barr sarcastically retorted. ``I'm duly
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Members and staffers moving through the corridors beyond the
swirl of high-stakes oratory could sample a parallel world of
bottom feeding: a depth of raw-edged rumor and casual amusement
about the shape of personal revelations certain to come, someone
said, and at any minute, someone else advised _ as soon as Hustler,
the sex magazine, sends something fresh up the media food chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people view government as war, and anything goes,'' said
Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., who admitted to a bleak mood as he
took a break from the debate. He smoked a cigar in the speaker's
lobby, with sunlight cutting in from the world beyond onto the
leather chairs as the two sides went at it just beyond the doorway
to the debating chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much at stake,'' Boehlert said quietly. ``Today
it's just sort of melancholy, you know?'' He soon was darkly amused
at the memory that last year, even before the impeachment struggle
came to gnaw on Washington, lawmakers from both sides felt obliged
to go off for a bipartisan weekend retreat. ``On civility!'' he
said in grim amazement. ``Can you believe that?''
</P>
<P>
   Once the House chaplain, the Rev. James Ford, finished his
gentle invocation (from St. Francis of Assisi: ``Where there is
hatred, let us sow love, etc.''), members burst forth as if from
gladiators' pens in the Roman coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catch the falling flag as we keep our appointment with
history,'' Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., pleaded as he led off for the
Republicans and invoked patriotic tableaux from Bunker Hill to
Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Bursts of heartfelt partisan applause marked the opening
speeches, rare in the House routine, but a vivid measure of the
national passions at work. There were groans and boos, too,
especially when the day's decorum reminder was read out with a
special caution against ``engaging in comparisons of the personal
conduct of sitting members.'' Democrats took this as a warning that
Livingston's indiscretions were off limits, while the president's
were dead center on the table.
</P>
<P>
   The day's brief unity cheer against the ``politics of smear''
was sparked by Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the minority leader, who
moved on to urge mercy and censure for the president. Republicans
firmly rebuffed the idea as unconstitutional for the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the peoples' voice come in and let fairness reign,''
Gephardt pleaded even as Republicans across the aisle settled into
the day with the patient demeanor of majority politicians who sense
it's all over but the oratory.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the fateful clash between the parties, the single
most arresting outburst of the day came from Paul Hays, the House
reading clerk, when he began reciting the content of House
Resolution 611. At first it sounded like the highway appropriations
bill, but then Hays read his way to the heart of the matter:
``Resolved that William Jefferson Clinton, president of the United
States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   The chilling notion was officially uttered at 9:30 a.m. The
fateful issue was at hand. What one speaker termed ``this dreadful
day'' began unfolding before the nation.

 DAVE WILLIAMS, TEAMS WON 16 NCAA GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dave Williams, who coached the University of Houston golf team
to 16 NCAA championships and sent a host of players to the PGA
Tour, died Wednesday in Wharton, Texas. He was 80 and had been ill
for several years, the university's sports information department
said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was the dominant college in golf during Williams'
36-year tenure. In addition to the 16 national championships, the
Cougars won 14 conference championships and 340 tournaments under
Williams. Seven of Williams' golfers won NCAA individual
championships, and 41 of his golfers were all-America selections.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the world's best golfers were coached by Williams in
college, including Fred Couples, the 1992 Masters champion; Steve
Elkington, the 1995 PGA Championship winner; John Mahaffey, the
1978 PGA champion, Bill Rogers, the 1981 British Open champion, and
Fuzzy Zoeller, who won the 1979 Masters and the 1984 U.S. Open.
Others coached by Williams who became winners on the PGA Tour
include Billy Ray Brown, Keith Fergus, Bruce Lietzke, Ed Fiori,
Homero Blancas and Kermit Zarley.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the Golf Coaches Association of America named its
collegiate coach of the year award in honor of Williams. He retired
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was recruiting me, Coach Williams called me in
Australia every Saturday for one year,'' Elkington said. ``He
convinced me to leave Australia when I was 18 years old, and I owe
my start in America to him. Nobody else was recruiting me at that
time, and he convinced my mother that he'd take care of me, even
though I'd be thousands of miles away from home. That's the kind of
influence he had on people.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarded by many as the father of college golf, Williams had a
far-reaching impact on the game. Before 1955, teams competed
against each other in dual matches using match-play format. But in
the 1955 All-America Intercollegiate Invitational, Williams thought
it was more logical and economical to play several opponents at
once, using stroke play in a tournament format. That scoring method
eventually became standard for college golf, and it was Williams
who also started the practice of outfitting teams with uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Navy during World War II and reaching the
rank of lieutenant, Williams joined Houston's engineering faculty
in 1946. He became the university's golf coach in 1952 at the
urging of his friend Harry Fouke, who was the school's athletic
director. In 1956, Houston won the first of five consecutive
national championships.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Williams' players never saw him swing a club. He was not
a great player, and he never pretended to be an authority on
technique. Yet, his players swore by his methods.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is survived by his wife, Virginia; a son, Joel; a
daughter, Peggy, and four grandchildren.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ If Saddam Hussein is still in control of Iraq
when the bombing ends, arms-control experts say, the Security
Council should not abandon arms inspections but should quickly
reimpose rigorous monitoring in every area of weapons development.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern to some experts is Saddam's track record
of trying to build nuclear bombs and the readiness of the
organization chosen to monitor that program, the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to declare that Iraq's nuclear program
is now finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to avoid a situation where military action results in
no inspections, weakened sanctions and a Saddam Hussein determined
to get nuclear weapons,'' said David Albright, president of the
independent Institute for Science and International Security in
Washington and a former nuclear inspector in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Khidhir Hamza, an Iraqi nuclear scientist now in exile in the
United States, said any loosening of nuclear monitoring would be
doubly dangerous, because the Iraqi nuclear program also provides a
cover for work on biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Arms-control officials here and independent experts confirm that
there is evidence of overlapping programs at some Iraqi weapons
centers, and they say there could be additional evidence if the
nuclear installations were considered relatively free of surprise
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, and most recently this week, the IAEA, which
experts say did not detect work on nuclear weapons in Iraq over 20
years, has declared Iraq to be free of nuclear arms and largely
cooperative with inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Special Commission, whose latest allegation of
inadequate cooperation was cited by the Clinton administration as
the basis for attacks on Iraq this week, is more independent. The
Security Council created it solely to disarm Iraq of biological and
chemical weapons and certain missile systems. Its staff is not
drawn from U.N. workers, but is made up of experts loaned by a
number of countries.
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of the atomic agency, Russia, France and
other Security Council members propose ``closing the file'' on
Iraq's nuclear weapons as an incentive to Saddam to cooperate more
strongly in other areas. That argument had also had begun to be
heard among some administration officials in Washington, Hamza, the
defector, and other experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the bombing continued, Iraqi officials in Baghdad and
its diplomats here were saying that the government would be willing
to work with inspectors again, but that they should all be like
those of the atomic agency.
</P>
<P>
   The latest report from the IAEA was praised on Wednesday by
Iraq's representative at the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon.
Washington, Hamdoon said, manipulated the work of Richard Butler,
executive chairman of the U.N. Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IAEA is not politicized,'' Hamdoon said. ``It is a highly
professional organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler, asked on Thursday about the gaps in findings between the
atomic agency's report and his, said that he was not prepared to
characterize the nuclear report. But he noted that it did not use
the phrase ``full cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The IAEA has a different job from ours, because they were
never dealing with a completed weapons program,'' he said. ``That
makes it vastly different from what we've has to deal with _
missiles, chemical and biological weapons _ where we were dealing
with fabricated weapons, and that's a very different situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamza, who formerly directed the Iraqi effort to design a
nuclear bomb, said in an interview that closing the nuclear file
just because no bombs had been found would play directly into
Saddam's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a big achievement for the Iraqis,'' Hamza said.
``If you close the book on nuclear weapons you would only have more
work on biological and chemical weapons. The biological and
chemical groups within the nuclear program are larger than in the
biological and chemical programs themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamza said up to 12,000 scientists and other experts might be
working under the umbrella of the nuclear program, including a
significant number of biological and chemical specialists capable
of advanced research, development and engineering. Only a few
hundred technicians with lower-level skills remain in the separate
biological- and chemical-weapons programs, he said, and they have
been under intense scrutiny by the U.N. Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week Albright, with whom Hamza works at the
Institute for Science and International Security, said that the
latest report by the atomic energy agency was ``a strained attempt
to say something positive about Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Iraq has not answered the remaining historical questions
about their secret nuclear weapons program,'' he said, adding that
there was no indication that Iraq was cooperating with the nuclear
inspectors ``or will do so in the future if the action team
conducted controversial inspections.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the agency say fears about Iraqi actions with
nuclear weapons are exaggerated, because the agency will have
effective monitoring in place. Critics say Iraq could damage it or
could refuse to allow on-site inspections when monitoring turns up
information that points to weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make the nuclear program off limits for surprise
inspections then you've created a sanctuary for all kinds of
activities,'' said Gary Milhollin, president of the Wisconsin
Project, an arms control center in Washington. Moreover, he said,
``it doesn't make sense to discriminate among weapons of mass
destruction in giving Iraq a clean bill of health.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monitoring is useless,'' Milhollin said, ``unless you can act
on something you find during monitoring with surprise
inspections.''

ATTACKS LEAVE MANY TARGETS LIGHTLY DAMAGED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If US and British forces intend to wreak much
damage on Saddam Hussein's military power, the bombing of Iraq will
have to go on a while longer _ well into the Islamic holiday of
Ramadan, which starts at dawn Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually detailed data released by the Pentagon Friday show
that the air strikes Wednesday and Thursday struck some of their
targets with deadly force, but left many more just lightly damaged
or untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Air-strikes have steadily been stepped up over the past three
days, not just from cruise missiles fired by B52 bombers and ships
at sea, but also from combat planes dropping laser-guided bombs.
Baghdad has been hit, so far, only by cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Even the B1 bomber made its first entry into combat, though it
amounted to a cameo, a single plane flying one sortie. The
aircraft, which can carry 84 500-pound iron-bombs, unloaded a
barrage on an unspecified military target outside of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   True to the modest claims he has made for this campaign from the
start, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Friday that he was
``satisfied'' with the results of Operation Desert Fox so far. But,
in one of several official hints that the assault may continue into
the Islamic holy month, Cohen added, ``The strikes are not
complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry H. Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
heralded ``some very good success with our strikes,'' and showed a
few videotapes of direct hits. ``Not all of them have gone
according to plan,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said that the purpose of the air strikes
is to ``degrade'' and ``diminish'' Hussein's ability to threaten
his neighbors with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. By that
vague criterion, the president could call the troops home now, but
the results have not yet been what any military analyst would call
substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the situation on the ground in Iraq, the information
released by the Pentagon Friday was noteworthy on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe it was the first time during any military
operation that US officials had released comprehensive data on
``bomb-damage assessment'' and _ just as unusual _ spy-satellite
photographs showing how a number of targets looked before and after
an attack.
</P>
<P>
   The data showed that, over the first two nights, US and British
forces attacked 89 targets in Iraq, striking 77.
</P>
<P>
   Of those hit, eight were destroyed, 10 were severely damaged, 18
moderately damaged, and seven only lightly damaged. The damage
inflicted on 33 targets, over one-third of those attacked, had not
yet been assessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very early in the assessment,'' Rear Admiral
Thomas Wilson, the Joint Staff's director of intelligence, told
reporters. ``It is a very incomplete picture. ... We haven't even
looked at all the targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, by any military criteria, the data available suggest the
operation itself is at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're off to a really encouraging start, but it looks to me
like they've got a long ways to go,'' John Pike, a weapons analyst
at the Federation of American Scientists, said after examining the
data. ``There's an awful lot of `light to moderate damage,' but I
don't see very much in the `destroyed' or 'severe damage'
columns.''
</P>
<P>
   The results seem particularly unimpressive for the attacks on
the main target of this campaign _ the facilities that develop,
produce, store, and protect Hussein's nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons. Of 19 targets attacked that relate to the
security of these weapons, two were destroyed, one was severely
damaged, four were lightly damaged, and one was missed.
</P>
<P>
   Of 11 targets attacked that involved the production of weapons,
none were reported destroyed or severely damaged, though eight of
them are still being assessed for damage by intelligence
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether many weapons are missing their targets
or whether the weapons are simply too small to do much damage to
these targets, many of which are quite large.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise missiles and laser-guided bombs range from 1,000 to
2,000 pounds in explosive energy. That's enough to demolish small
structures or punch holes in large ones, but not enough to wreck,
say, a large office building or a blast-resistant airplane-hangar.
</P>
<P>
   Targets included missile-production factories, intelligence
headquarters, communications transmitters, airfields,
security-guard barracks, air defense sites, and _ the only
``economic'' target _ a refinery in Basra that reportedly has been
used to export oil in violation of United Nations sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials declined to comment on reports that they have
avoided bombing Iraqi chemical plants, for fear of releasing deadly
substances. However, Shelton noted they have not gone after
``dual-use'' facilities that make both chemical weapons and
civilian products.
</P>
<P>
   There has apparently been no resistance by Iraqi military
forces, other than scattered and ineffective anti-aircraft
artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   Officials refuse to say how many weapons have been launched at
these targets, though they have acknowledged that over 300 cruise
missiles have been fired _ at roughly $1 million apiece. They have
also said over 80 strike aircraft have dropped weapons, with most
carrying two to four laser-guided bombs; that's at least an
additional 200, or over 500 weapons in all.
</P>
<P>
   All this suggests each of the 89 targets has received, on
average, the firepower from at least five weapons. Some no doubt
were hit by more, others with fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials have raised the possibility of an early end to
the air strikes, due to the start this weekend of the Islamic
Ramadan holiday. Both Clinton and Cohen have promised to be
sensitive to this factor, but they haven't disclosed how long the
campaign might continue.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan has not stopped wars in the past. The 1973 Arab-Israeli
war took place during Ramadan. The Iran-Iraq war went on for eight
years with no breaks for the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   National security adviser Sandy Berger said Friday that Ramadan
``is not an automatic deadline'' to end the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign that military officers are looking toward a much
longer operation was the announcement Friday that more armed forces
are continuing to come into the Persian Gulf area.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Carl Vinson aircraft-carrier battle group was slated to
steam into the area Friday night. Additional troops and weapons
just started to load up from US shores Friday, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon Friday announced that bombs aren't the only thing
US aircraft were dropping on Iraq. They said A10 attack planes have
dropped leaflets on Iraqi soldiers in the southern part of the
country, warning them not to invade Kuwait again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraqi soldiers, save yourselves!'' one pamphlet reads. ``Only
those units who support the Baghdad regime were targeted. Your unit
was not targeted, but it is being watched. ... Stay in your
positions. Do not head south.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House is already bracing for a new
battle: tamping down anticipated pressure on President Clinton to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, even before the first House votes were cast on
impeachment, White House aides were accusing Republicans of
orchestrating a forceful resignation push.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have here is what I believe is a cynical political
strategy,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman. Lockhart
accused Republican leaders of calling for the president to resign
after they had told moderate House members their votes for
impeachment were not likely to dislodge Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart insisted the Republican strategy would fail. ``I can't
imagine a scenario where, if there would be a trial on the Senate
floor, that the president would not vigorously defend himself,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that the president would consider
resigning. In Jerusalem, he said at a news conference earlier this
week that resigning had ``never crossed my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with National Public Radio Friday, Vice
President Al Gore insisted that Clinton would not resign. ``I think
the results of a meteor strike are more likely than the resignation
of the president,'' he said. ``He is just not going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the impeachment drive have already called on the
president to step down voluntarily. On CBS' ``Face the Nation''
last Sunday, Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee,
said that resigning would be a heroic act and give Clinton a way of
``going out with honor.'' The same day, the majority whip, Tom
DeLay, renewed his call for Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have been calls, mostly from Republicans and
conservatives, for Clinton to resign ever since the sex and perjury
scandal became public last January. DeLay, for example, called for
Clinton's resignation on Aug. 19, even before Kenneth Starr filed
his impeachment referral with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first Republicans to demand the president's
resignation last winter was Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ashcroft intensified his effort. His political action
committee, Spirit of America, delivered stacks of petitions calling
for the president's resignation to the office of Trent Lott, the
Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The petitions demonstrate that many Americans believe the
president has disqualified himself from service,'' said Jack
Oliver, the PAC's executive director. Ashcroft is also looking for
conservative support for a presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   There is little evidence that there has been much talk of
resignation elsewhere in the Senate. ``The only way there's going
to be a resignation is if public opinion changes so drastically
that he has no choice,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who chairs
the Senate Judiciary Committee
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., dismissed a question about
resignation as silly, saying no one on the Democratic side expected
Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy did confirm that a Democratic effort spearheaded by
Clinton allies to get senators to sign an anti-impeachment petition
had never gotten off the ground. ``I've heard indirectly such
discussions,'' he said. ``It's not going to happen. You'd have 40
potential jurors saying they won't vote to convict in any
circumstances. Think how that would look. It just ain't going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A few Democratic voices have called on Clinton to relinquish his
office. New York Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter said this week
that if Clinton were impeached by the House, he should step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he would have to resign at that point because his
usefulness would be lost in dealing with other nations.'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, former Gov. Dick Lamm and the state Democratic
Party chairman, Phil Perington, both said the president should
consider resigning if he's impeached.
</P>
<P>
   As for other organized resignation campaigns, columnist Arianna
Huffington in September set up an Internet site called
Resignation.Com. The Web site offers resignation trinkets, such as
T-shirts that are emblazoned with ``Gore '98,'' as well as
historical documents including famous resignation speeches, such as
President Nixon's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at an impasse,'' Ms. Huffington said in an interview
Friday. ``We are calling to the better angels in the president's
nature to get us out of this. Only he can get us out by
resigning.''

<P>
   The House impeachment debate commanded the full attention of the
big broadcast networks and the all-news cable networks for most of
Friday morning, but eventually gave way to occasional reports from
Iraq and ultimately, for most network stations, to the attraction
of soap operas.
</P>
<P>
   The news departments of ABC, CBS and NBC all continued their
network coverage of the impeachment debate throughout the day, but
between 11 a.m. and 12:45 p.m. all three offered their stations the
opportunity to switch off to the regular line-up of daytime
programs, mostly soap operas. The vast majority of stations opted
for the likes of ``Days of Our Lives'' and ``The Young and the
Restless.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Falco, the president of the NBC network said, ``It was a
day of multiple feeds: impeachment, Baghdad and soap operas.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC, for example, covered the impeachment debate on its full
network only until 11 a.m., when the anchor, Tom Brokaw, said some
stations would leave for their own programming. NBC's coverage
continued for the stations that wanted to take it.
</P>
<P>
   Even NBC's flagship station, WNBC in New York, switched from the
impeachment coverage to join an episode of ``Sunset Beach'' in
progress. WNBC rejoined NBC's impeachment coverage at 3 p.m., after
``Days of our Lives'' and ``Another World.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC also programs its own all-news channel MSNBC, which
continued its impeachment coverage throughout the day, along with
some coverage from Iraq such as a news conference with foreign
minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS, the network covered the debate in full from 9 a.m. until
12:30, when it adopted the same policy, keeping the network's
coverage going with its anchorman, Dan Rather, in place, while
offering stations the opportunity to switch to ``The Young and the
Restless.'' The majority did, including WCBS, the network's
flagship station in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But several CBS stations, including those in Boston, Baltimore,
San Francisco, Houston and St. Louis, stayed with the impeachment
coverage for at least some time beyond the start of the soap
operas.
</P>
<P>
   In ABC's case, the network maintained full coverage until 12:45,
when it allowed its stations to join the show ``Port Charles'' in
progress. ABC also continued to offer stations the events happening
in the House though without any commentary from its anchor, Peter
Jennings. Most ABC stations opted for the entertainment shows,
including ABC's flagship station, WABC.
</P>
<P>
   All three all-news cable channels focused all day on the
impeachment events, though they all occasionally interrupted for
developments from Baghdad including the news conference by Aziz and
a taped statement by Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The cable channels kept up their full coverage until the end of
the debate Friday night. The networks were to stay with their
prime-time lineups, but each of them devoted at least an hour to
special news coverage of the day's events.
</P>
<P>
   Each network announced it would cover the actual votes on
articles of impeachment live on Saturday. If they take place later
than the expected time of between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m., CBS will
face the biggest problem because of its commitment to cover the New
York Jets-Buffalo Bills football game at 12:30. But the network
said it would interrupt the game to show any vote live.

DIFFERENT MEDIA STANDARDS BRING DIFFERENT COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Emerging from the US Capitol Friday after watching
the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, Toni
Peterson shook her head in disgust when she glimpsed a legion of
television reporters across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so blown out of proportion,'' declared Peterson, 54, of
Salisbury, Md. ``The TV networks are a mess. I wish they would take
it completely off the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance. The appetite of networks and newspapers for the
White House sex scandal, insatiable all year, has been intensified
still further by the current impeachment drama. It is a drama in
which the media themselves have played a central, perhaps
unprecedented, role.
</P>
<P>
   L'affaire Clinton has illustrated how much the media culture has
changed since the last time a president was threatened with
impeachment, transformed into a national echo chamber by the
emergence of 24-hour cable news channels, with their indefatigable
talking heads, and by the increased willingness of reporters to
play pundit on weekend talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standards have changed tremendously,'' said Jack Nelson,
chief Washington correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, who
covered the final days of Richard Nixon's presidency in 1974. ``The
media has been aggressive in pushing for prosecution in this case.
I've never seen anything quite like it. In the Nixon case, they did
an objective job in covering it.''
</P>
<P>
   But one reporter/pundit whom Nelson singled out for criticism,
Cokie Roberts of ABC News, pointed to the impeachment proceedings
themselves as proof that the story of Clinton's affair with former
White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky _ and the charges of perjury,
abuse of power, and obstruction of justice spawned by the affair _
justified the media's unrelenting attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our point all along,'' Roberts said emphatically
Friday as she monitored the impeachment debate. ``You cannot have
staring you in the face the possibility of the removal of the
president of the United States and not cover it. The fact that the
details were tawdry is not our fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary McGrory, a columnist for The Washington Post, said that
``people are always telling me this story is media-driven. I think
in the beginning it was, but it acquired a momentum of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Most TV and print reporters interviewed during another hectic
workday Friday said they were just doing their jobs, that the
nature of the Clinton scandal demanded comprehensive coverage, and
that public hostility toward their role is not surprising because
the citizenry often takes a kill-the-messenger attitude toward
bearers of unwelcome news.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been lots of times in our history that people have
been unhappy with the media, and thought the media is out of
step,'' said Roberts. ``What's different now is the pervasiveness,
now that we've got the 24-hour channels reporting every teeny
little factoid.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the magnitude of the moment began to sink in Friday,
there were also stirrings of media introspection.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said half-jokingly that she was ``proud of the fact that
the most explicit word I used all year was `breast.' '' while
reporting and analyzing the sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Franken, the respected congressional correspondent for CNN,
said he believes his own network behaved creditably in
distinguishing fact from ``self-serving leaks'' by insisting on two
credible sources for each story. But Franken expressed misgivings
that other members of the media did not hew to similar standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very easy to get too ambitious and cut corners, and
some people did,'' said Franken. ``There have been a lot of people
out there who have used this as a ratings ploy. ... There are many,
many, many reporters who are careless.''
</P>
<P>
   As he wrote his story on the House impeachment debate Friday,
Frank Aukofer, the veteran Washington bureau chief for the
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, mused about how much more attention the
media now pay to the personal lives of politicians than it did when
Aukofer covered the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how we got here,'' said Aukofer. ``It's a
chicken-and-egg thing. Did we create it, or did the public demand
it?''
</P>
<P>
   There is little question in the mind of Nelson, the Los Angeles
Times correspondent, that the answer is the former when it comes to
the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media has done a lot to feed the fire of impeachment,'' he
said. ``An awful lot of them don't like Clinton, have never liked
him. A lot of what I've seen on television is unbelievable. There's
an intense competition to be first and wittiest. In the Nixon
impeachment story, the media was much more sober in the way they
approached it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Roberts of ABC maintained that the story of the sexual
relationship between a president and an underling had ramifications
far beyond the political realm where it is now being thrashed out.
``One of the questions I brought up is what it means for young
women in the workplace,'' she said, adding that the president's
conduct sent a message that could create ``a hostile work
environment for other women.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the media's role in the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal
began almost as soon as the story broke. White House correspondent
Sam Donaldson was roundly condemned for saying after the story
erupted in January, that ``Mr. Clinton, if he's not telling the
truth and the evidence shows that, he will resign, perhaps this
week.'' NBC Washington bureau chief Tim Russert also drew flak for
booking Internet gossip Matt Drudge as a guest on ``Meet the
Press'' in January. (Drudge now has his own talk show on the Fox
News channel.)
</P>
<P>
   But the Washington media have also had to contend with an
unprecedented barrage of leaks, spin, and rumor throughout this
year, and have often been forced to chase stories aired or printed
by the competition. Reporters made clear Friday they are not
overjoyed at having been transformed into a ``sleaze patrol.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lister of the BBC's Washington bureau said he has
noticed how many thinly sourced stories the American media have
floated this year, but said that is partly due to the elusive
nature of the truth when it came to the Lewinsky matter. ``The BBC
has always been particular about sources, but so much about this
story is difficult to pin down,'' said Lister.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans alike have aggressively worked the
Washington media throughout this year, jockeying for spots before
the microphone at places like the ``elm tree site'' where Franken
and other TV reporters were stationed Friday. At one point Friday,
Representative Patrick Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island, was
denouncing the impeachment proceedings in an interview with Franken
while, footsteps away, Representative J.D. Hayworth, Republican of
Arizona, was defending them.
</P>
<P>
   As the interviews ended, the spin continued. Hayworth cracked to
Franken: ``If you want the real story, I'll talk to you.'' A few
moments later, Kennedy drew Franken aside and asked if he could do
another interview after the debate, vowing to ``come in swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Franken and Carl Cameron of the Fox News channel voiced
qualms Friday about the growing prominence of talking heads on
network talk shows, who they said often know less than they pretend
to know and seldom have contact with the principals of stories they
opine about.
</P>
<P>
   But despite those qualms, and his concerns over some parts of
the media handled the story, Franken defends the coverage overall.
``Was all this coverage appropriate?'' he asked. ``You bet. Because
of the high stakes involved.''

LEONARD RIESER, OPPONENT OF ARSENAL HE HELPED CREATE, DIES AT 76  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Vt.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON

<P>
   Leonard Moos Rieser, a physicist who helped usher in the nuclear
age with the Manhattan Project and crusaded to curb the arsenals it
spawned, died on Tuesday at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center
in Lebanon, N.H. He was 76 and lived in Norwich, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said officials at Dartmouth College, where
he was a professor and administrator for 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rieser (pronounced REE-zer) helped steer Dartmouth through a
period of considerable growth. He was nationally known as president
and chairman of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science in the 1970s, and was chairman of the Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists from 1985 until his retirement in June.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Dartmouth faculty in 1952, was appointed professor
of physics in 1960 and retired in 1992. After his retirement, he
remained with Dartmouth as a senior fellow of the John Sloan Dickey
Center for International Understanding, which he had served as
founding director, beginning in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Rieser's administrative service spanned 25 years, during which
he was chairman of the physics department, deputy provost for the
sciences, dean of the faculty and provost.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Chicago, Leonard Rieser graduated with a degree in
physics from the University of Chicago in 1943, and was then posted
by the Army to the Manhattan Project, which produced the first
nuclear chain reaction in 1942 and ultimately developed the atomic
bomb. He worked at the Manhattan Project's metallurgical laboratory
in Chicago and at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where he
witnessed the first atomic explosion.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he worked as a researcher for the physicist Otto
Frisch at Los Alamos, and received his doctorate in physics from
Stanford University in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Bulletin of the Atomic Sciences, Rieser was
seen in many news photographs resetting the publication's
``Doomsday Clock'' to dramatize the threat of nuclear annihilation
and the need for peaceful alternatives to nuclear conflict.
</P>
<P>
   He did so one more time in June in response to the test
explosions set off by India and Pakistan, advancing the clock by
five minutes to 11:51 p.m. and warning of ``perilous times.''
</P>
<P>
   Rieser is survived by his wife of 54 years, Rosemary Littledale
Rieser; a daughter, Abigail, of Northampton, Mass.; three sons,
Leonard, of Philadelphia, Timothy S., of Washington, and Kenneth
Willis of Princeton, N.J.; two brothers, Lawrence, of Jackson,
Wyo., and William, of Perkasie, Pa., and three granddaughters.

SEN. BOXER SEEKS A SPEEDY RESOLUTION TO IMPEACHMENT IN THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., held out the
possibility Friday that President Clinton might avoid a Senate
trial after an expected impeachment vote by the House on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that six or more Republicans might defect and team
up with Democrats to abort such a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Senate rules don't compel lawmakers to automatically conduct a
trial, Boxer said. The rules allow lawmakers to scuttle the
proceedings and devise a penalty, short of removal from office,
such as censure or a fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think many colleagues want to go that route,'' Boxer said.
But she declined to name any Republicans who might be in that
group.
</P>
<P>
   A simple majority, or 51 votes, is required to pursue the
no-trial option, she contended. In January, when the Senate takes
up the impeachment issue, it will have 55 Republicans and 45
Democrats, meaning that at least six Republicans would be needed to
avoid a trial.
</P>
<P>
   If a trial is held, Republicans may find it difficult to convict
Clinton on any article of impeachment. In order to gain the
necessary two-thirds majority required by the Constitution to
convict and remove a president from office, 12 Democrats would have
to break ranks, assuming all 100 senators vote.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's remarks run counter to comments by Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who has said that if the House
impeaches Clinton, the Senate will hold a trial rather than quickly
settle on a punishment short of removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the Senate would proceed if Clinton is impeached, Lott
said this week that it would take the first ``preliminary steps''
toward a trial shortly after it convenes Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   As attention shifts to the Senate, Boxer said that Clinton's
support runs high among Democrats. ``I don't know any Democrats in
the Senate that say he should resign,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer is related to Clinton by marriage. Her daughter Nicole is
the wife of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother Tony
Rodham.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., predicted Thursday that the
Senate ultimately will settle on a punishment less severe than
removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president will always have the stigma of being impeached''
by the House, Feinstein said. ``I don't know how much blood, so to
speak, one feels you have to get out of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   She rejected the idea that the Senate might be able to conduct
regular business during the day and devote evenings to an
impeachment trial. ``The Senate, during time of impeachment, will
be consumed by the matter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's Aug. 17 admission of an inappropriate
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern,
Feinstein was highly critical of the president, asserting that her
faith in his credibility had been ``shattered.''

WORLD DRAMA CAN'T BREACH CADETS' HOLIDAY JOVIALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ As their commander in chief was nearing
impeachment, as their comrades in arms were pounding Iraq, 11 men
and one woman tossed their caps high in the air Friday and stood
before a tumultuous world as the newest graduates of the United
States Military Academy.
</P>
<P>
   The brief graduation ceremonies, for West Point cadets who
missed the larger and more traditional May commencement, were a
celebratory reminder that the nation's underpinnings remained in
place and its civic and institutional lives carried on, even as
Washington smoldered and Baghdad burned.
</P>
<P>
   In other countries at such unsettling times, West Point might
easily be imagined as the seat of dissent for a restive and
independent military. Instead, the academy built on the site George
Washington called ``The Gibraltar of America'' was a hotspot of
holiday cheer, a bunker of best wishes.
</P>
<P>
   At the graduation in Eisenhower Hall, named for the academy
graduate-turned-president, families and friends basked in the
achievements of the 12 newly minted Army second lieutenants, who
stood at attention in their finest uniforms, white gloves, dress
sabers and the maroon sashes that signified their ascent into the
ranks of officers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the academy's walls, the adjacent town of Highland Falls
looked almost suspiciously like the fictional Bedford Falls from
``It's a Wonderful Life,'' its stores bedecked with wreaths and
ribbons, its residents shopping and dining, laughing and calling
greetings to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, beneath the surface, there were deeply held beliefs
about the impeachment proceedings and the bombing campaign, as well
as the revelations the night before about the next House speaker's
own infidelities. But they could be elicited only from civilians
and only with prodding, in keeping with the military's prohibitions
on speaking out publicly against a superior officer or elected
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has their own private thoughts about it, of course.
But I haven't seen too much heated, open discussion of it here, and
I doubt you will, either,'' said Col. Rick Machamer, director of
West Point's new Center for the Professional Military Ethic.
</P>
<P>
   The center was organized to promote character development and
help enforce the West Point Honor Code, whose words seemed to have
been written by the House Republicans pressing toward President
Clinton's impeachment: ``A cadet will not lie, cheat or steal, or
tolerate those who do.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, those words rolled off the tongue of Toni Parry, 49,
owner of The Okemo Inn in Ludlow, Vt., whose son graduated from
West Point in 1997. She returned to the academy to watch a friend
of her son graduate Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For four years, they lived here under a code of honor. They
take pretty much the same oath that the president takes,'' said
Parry, who was picking out West Point Christmas tree ornaments in
the academy's gift shop. ``We should expect nothing less of our
president than we do of our cadets.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Ortland of nearby Newburgh, a 1982 West Point graduate who
now works as an IBM engineering manager, saw a silver lining in the
president's problems. ``It's heightening awareness of morality.
Maybe it will make the country a more moral place,'' said Ortland,
38. As he spoke, his wife picked through Army-themed gifts, from
stuffed bears wearing West Point shirts to framed posters with the
phrase, ``Eat, Drink and Beat Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not one of nearly two dozen people interviewed Friday on or near
the academy grounds said they thought the Iraq attack was a ploy to
delay the impeachment vote, though several declined to comment,
citing their own or their relatives' military oath. Several said
impeachment should have waited until American forces were out of
harm's way, but there was general confidence the country would not
be damaged by its current travails.
</P>
<P>
   There also was near-unanimity that Clinton and Saddam Hussein
deserved their respective fates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was head of any major corporation, he would have been
fired and sued,'' said Wallace Gibbs, an airline trainer from
Dallas. ``It's embarrassing to the country, but he needed to be
impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Williams, 25, a hotel manager from Chicago, said the Iraq
bombing was overdue: ``I think it's scary, but I think it was the
only choice, the right thing to do. At first I wondered about the
timing, but I don't think it was just for politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was so focused. At the Park Restaurant, across
Main Street from the academy, waiter Donald Pozo spoke for those
who cared neither about impeachment nor Iraq: ``It has nothing to
do with me, my life, so I'm not paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   At the graduation ceremonies, no mention was made of either
issue. In blessing the new lieutenants, Rev. Edson J. Wood spoke of
``this afternoon's drama'' but it was clear he meant only the
culmination of more than four grueling years of cadet life.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, when the commandant of cadets, Brigadier Gen. John P.
Abizaid, told the dozen members of the graduating class and their
250 guests to ``lead by personal example'' and ``put selfless
service above self-interest'' it was hard not to think of the
debate going on in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the graduation, West Point's granite buildings and cadets
in gray tunics stood as tall and straight as ever, buffeted but
unbowed by cold winds that whipped past Bear and Breakneck
mountains and onto the academy fields. Clusters of cadets raced
across The Plain, a parade ground that dates to Revolutionary days,
and onto waiting buses to catch holiday flights home.
</P>
<P>
   During a bus tour of the academy, there were snickers when the
guide pointed out the ruins of Fort Clinton. She quickly noted that
it was named for Gen. George Clinton; its original name, Fort
Arnold, was changed after the honoree _ Gen. Benedict Arnold _
tried to betray the Colonial forces.
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid was that Fort Clinton leads to ``Flirtation Walk,''
a wooded trail reserved for cadets and their most personal guests.
There is a huge pair of painted lips on a rock halfway down the
trail; according to legend, if a guest refuses a cadet's request
for a kiss, the entire academy will crumble into the Hudson River
below.
</P>
<P>
   At the West Point Museum, which celebrates the academy's
196-year history as well as the much longer history of warfare,
homage is paid to alums with names like Lee, Grant, Patton,
Bradley, MacArthur and Schwarzkopf.
</P>
<P>
   Display cases bulge with dioramas of battle scenes, muskets and
M16s, mementos from bygone Army-Navy games, and a saber carried by
Gen. Thaddeus Kosciuszko, a Pole who served with the Continental
Army and who helped design West Point. On it, in Spanish, is an
inscription that seemed metaphorically applicable to both the
impeachment debate and the bombing of Iraq: ``Do not draw me
without reason; Do not sheath me without honor.''
</P>
<P>
   But another, more modern name was also prominent in the museum.
In the gift shop, seven copies of Kenneth Starr's Report to
Congress stood on an eye-level shelf, waiting for buyers.

`OLD MASTERS' FIND DEPTH IN COPPER CANVAS  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The new show at the Phoenix Art Museum is called
``Copper as Canvas,'' but forget the copper, you can't really see
it, anyway. It is covered up with paint.
</P>
<P>
   But what paint! The show is one of the best in years at the
museum and is a must-see for anyone who loves art.
</P>
<P>
   It began as a piece of scholarship. Museum curator Michael
Komanecky and his colleagues have done an exhaustive amount of work
on the question of when, why and how artists used copper as a base
to paint on.
</P>
<P>
   We know a great deal about the canvases and wood panels most
artists used, but until now, we knew much less about the sheets of
copper that were sometimes used from the 16th to 18th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   For that research, gathered in a spiffy catalog that will be
published in February, we must thank Komanecky and the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as I said, you cannot see the copper in question, because
so many artists have hidden it with really wonderful images.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the show special are those images, and the artists
who made them.
</P>
<P>
   And there are some big names: Rembrandt, El Greco, Claude,
Chardin, Guido Reni and others. This is a show of what used to be
called ``Old Masters.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the copper does mean something; you (BEGIN ITAL) can (END
ITAL) see a difference.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons that artists chose to paint on copper was
that the metal was very smooth, flat and dimensionally stable. With
canvas, you cannot paint images more detailed than the weave of the
fabric; it is a limiting factor. With wood panels, you can make the
surface smooth, but you always run into the warping and checking of
the wood as it is subjected to temperature and humidity changes.
</P>
<P>
   Copper solved both problems.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, most of the paintings in this show are notable both
for the incredible detail and for the smoothness of their paint _
almost like enamel.
</P>
<P>
   Few artists used copper exclusively, but Jan Brueghel the Elder
came close. The son of the more peculiar Pieter Brueghel and father
of the more obscure Jan Brueghel the Younger, he was also the
younger brother of the painter Pieter Brueghel the Younger.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dynasty of artists, but a confusing clan, made slightly
more coherent by their nicknames. The paterfamilias was known as
``Peasant'' Brueghel for the many peasant paintings he made; his
son, Pieter the Younger, is known as ``Hell'' Brueghel for the
popular depictions of perdition he created. And Jan the Elder is
known as ``Velvet'' Brueghel for his incredible ability to produce
detail and texture.
</P>
<P>
   It was copper that made the detail possible.
</P>
<P>
   And it is that ability that is so stunning in this show. Over
and over _ and he is the best represented painter in the show _ he
creates paintings of such incredibly fine detail that you are
reminded of modern microsurgery. He must have painted with a brush
with only one bristle, and what is more, that single bristle must
have been somehow sharpened like a tiny pencil into an even more
delicate point.
</P>
<P>
   As you look into his ``Harbor Scene With St. Paul's Departure
From Caesarea,'' painted in 1596, you can hardly find St. Paul in
the crowd. Although the painting is only 14- by 21-inches, it
depicts at least 200 people on the dock, and you can make out the
faces and expressions of most of them.
</P>
<P>
   There are also more than 30 ships and boats in the scene, about
50 newly caught fish, a city and a mountain range. That's a lot of
information to store in such a small picture. Gigabytes.
</P>
<P>
   But the surface is smooth and incredibly beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the issue of another important contribution made by
the copper. Whether it is, as claimed, the reflection of the light
off the metal below the pigment, or just the creamy smoothness of
the paint on such a polished surface, the paint nevertheless seems
to glow with rich, glorious color.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's installation helps this, with each painting _ most
of them small _ lit like a jewel so it sparkles.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, you come up with a start as a painting seems more
exquisite than you had imagined.
</P>
<P>
   There is the tiny ``Allegory of Painting'' by Frans van Mieris
I, from 1661, which is a stunning portrait of a Dutch woman in a
steely blue satin dress. She holds a dramatic mask, a painter's
palette and a plaster statue that is so white it almost seems
incandescent.
</P>
<P>
   Or the ``Floral Still Life With Shells'' from 1622 by Balthasar
van der Ast, which is rich as pastry.
</P>
<P>
   Or the profoundly moving face in the 1750 ``Portrait of an Old
Woman'' by Christian Seybold, with skin as translucent as the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The use of copper petered out around the time of the American
Revolution for several reasons. Perhaps the most obvious from the
show is that painters, with their brushwork loosened up and their
subjects more generalized, no longer were concerned with profuse
detail. They simply no longer needed the copper.
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious in the paintings: When you get to the time of
Chardin, you begin to see the origins of Impressionism that would
follow a century later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copper as Canvas'' is notable for a couple of other things,
too. Included are a large number of New World paintings, mostly
Mexican, that show the importance of copper among Spanish Colonial
painters.
</P>
<P>
   And there is considerable background information on the mining
and smelting of copper, with large chunks of the stuff on view,
including several raw ingots and a tall wisp of native copper that
might as well be a 20th Century sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   But over and over, I come back to the work of Brueghel. In
``Ceres and the Four Elements,'' painting in 1604 in collaboration
with Hendrick van Balen, you fall into a sybaritic reverie of
animals and textures. Van Balen painted the figures, and they are
rather conventional, but Brueghel surrounded them with a veritable
Eden of finny, furry, feathered life and intensely colored
wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   It is the work of a man obviously in love with the things of
this world, and he communicates that love to us, standing in
appreciation in front of the painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copper as Canvas'' will travel to the Nelson Atkins Museum in
Kansas City, Mo., after it closes here, and then will move on to
the Mauritshuis in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for a show to originate at a prestigious
European museum and travel through the United States. It is a
wonderful thing for Phoenix that we can mount a show worthy of
returning the favor. &QL;

SAN FRANCISCO REPORTS RECORD NUMBER OF HOMELESS PEOPLE DIED IN
1998 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By BILL STAGGS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ More homeless people died in San Francisco in
the last 12 months than in any year since the tracking began, an
increase that has alarmed and frustrated advocates for the homeless
and city health workers.
</P>
<P>
   The 157 deaths were detailed in the Homeless Death Review,
issued this week by the San Francisco Department of Public Health
and covering the period from December 1997 through November 30.
Last year's report counted 104 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The review, the third such analysis since the city took over the
annual project from a neighborhood newspaper, is compiled from data
released by the medical examiner's office. The breakdown indicates
how deadly life on the streets has become in San Francisco, where
the mayor's office estimates that 4,000 people are homeless on any
given night. There are at most 2,000 emergency shelter beds.
</P>
<P>
   The causes of death range from drowning to asthma, but substance
abuse is the leading killer.
</P>
<P>
   Drug overdoses were responsible in 62 cases, either from heroin
alone or in combination with other drugs. Ten died from
alcohol-related problems. Seven had heart disease, and two died
from AIDS. Seven committed suicide, six were murdered, and five
died after being struck by cars. The average age at time of death
was 42.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials and advocates were reluctant to name specific
reasons for the increase. Many cited the intense winter, while
others blamed police sweeps that displaced many homeless from
places like Golden Gate Park.
</P>
<P>
   Housing is scarce, too, according to Marian Pena, director of
the Department of Public Health's homeless program.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just can't find housing,'' Ms. Pena said. ``Hundreds of
units have been lost to fires or to tourism, with a room with no
bath renting for $600 and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Heroin also played a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a huge increase in the number of heroin-related
deaths in the past two years,'' Ms. Pena said. ``It has been more
pure, cheaper and in some cases contaminated.''
 &UR; OPTIONAL CUT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kandace Bender, Mayor Willie Brown's press secretary, said the
major role of drugs and alcohol in the deaths was something Brown
has made efforts to address.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last three years,'' Ms. Bender said, ``the mayor has
provided $11 million for substance abuse programs and mobile
outreach programs. The mayor is very concerned about this problem,
and continues to work on a continuum of care that combines shelter,
outreach, counseling, jobs, and transitional housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Boden, director of the San Francisco Coalition on
Homelessness and a participant in the report's creation since its
inception, said he would like to see city officials find a way to
better use the information agencies have gathered on the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so frustrating,'' Boden said, ``is that for all these
folks that they are finding dead in the city, there is a lot of
information available about them. They have been through intake
programs, screenings, for substance abuse, for housing. All that
information is centralized. But the information is simply not being
used.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; END OPTIONAL CUT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In a modest attempt at intervention, the public health
department last year initiated a Death Prevention Program, made up
of three health care workers and a nurse, an under-funded program
that does not even have a vehicle for its rounds of the city's
poorest areas. The team attempts to identify high-risk cases and
get individuals into treatment quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some resources,'' Ms. Pena said, ``but we don't have
enough. We need to stop pretending that we do have enough. And it's
absolutely futile to talk about substance abuse without dealing
with the housing issue.'' &QL;

 &HT;    GSU Senate condemns Holocaust ads
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the first time in the three years since its
student newspaper began running ads questioning whether the
Holocaust actually happened, a cross-section of the entire Georgia
State University community this week condemned the advertisements
and the group paying for them.
</P>
<P>
   By passing a resolution that ``categorically rejects the
position ... that the Holocaust did not take place,'' the
University Senate _ comprising students, faculty, staff and
administrators _ hopes to pressure the student newspaper, the
Signal, to stop running ads provided by the Committee for Open
Debate on the Holocaust, based in San Diego. The University Senate
has no power over the Signal. ``It has run three times in our
student paper and it became clear that it would continue to run on
an annual basis, so we tried to do something,'' said Carol Winkler,
chairwoman of the Senate Executive Committee.
</P>
<P>
   This year's ad, which appeared Sept. 8, offered $250,000 to
anyone who can arrange a nationally televised debate between CODOH
and the Anti-Defamation League, which combats anti-Semitism and
other forms of discrimination, on such issues as whether gas
chambers were used to exterminate Jews and if ``The Diary of Anne
Frank'' is fiction, not fact.
</P>
<P>
   Signal editor Jennifer Smith said the paper's ad policy states
that ads will not be rejected because of the political or personal
views of the person or group running it. It's also a First
Amendment matter, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``As supporters of free speech, the Signal does not feel any
paper, administrator, faculty group or individual has the right to
determine which opinion is worthy of being heard and which is
not,'' Smith said. ``The fact that a particular opinion might be
offensive to some does not excuse censorship in any form.''
</P>
<P>
   Several college newspapers, including those at Georgia Tech and
Emory University, have refused the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler, who, as chairwoman of GSU's communications department,
supports free speech, said the Signal has to look deeper at how the
decision to run the ad affects other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Jewish members of our community, to have their history
denied is offensive to them and makes them question whether they
are fully integrated into our community,'' said Winkler. ``And the
community needs to send a strong signal that we are aware of what
happened. Our heads are not buried in the sand on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said no one at the Signal believes the Holocaust never
happened, adding that the issue is old news and that it is time for
the paper and university to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Signal is well aware of the plethora of evidence proving
the existence of the Holocaust and believes the CODOH ad calls for
the debate of some issues, not the denial of the Holocaust,'' said
Smith. ``As with any newspaper, the acceptance of an ad for
publication is not an indicator of the paper's position of the
content of the ad. Accepting the CODOH ad for publication is in no
way to be construed as acceptance of or agreement with the opinions
expressed in the ad.''

DIFFERENT MEDIA STANDARDS BRING DIFFERENT COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Emerging from the US Capitol Friday after watching
the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, Toni
Peterson shook her head in disgust when she glimpsed a legion of
television reporters across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so blown out of proportion,'' declared Peterson, 54, of
Salisbury, Md. ``The TV networks are a mess. I wish they would take
it completely off the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance. The appetite of networks and newspapers for the
White House sex scandal, insatiable all year, has been intensified
still further by the current impeachment drama. It is a drama in
which the media themselves have played a central, perhaps
unprecedented, role.
</P>
<P>
   L'affaire Clinton has illustrated how much the media culture has
changed since the last time a president was threatened with
impeachment, transformed into a national echo chamber by the
emergence of 24-hour cable news channels, with their indefatigable
talking heads, and by the increased willingness of reporters to
play pundit on weekend talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standards have changed tremendously,'' said Jack Nelson,
chief Washington correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, who
covered the final days of Richard Nixon's presidency in 1974. ``The
media has been aggressive in pushing for prosecution in this case.
I've never seen anything quite like it. In the Nixon case, they did
an objective job in covering it.''
</P>
<P>
   But one reporter/pundit whom Nelson singled out for criticism,
Cokie Roberts of ABC News, pointed to the impeachment proceedings
themselves as proof that the story of Clinton's affair with former
White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky _ and the charges of perjury,
abuse of power, and obstruction of justice spawned by the affair _
justified the media's unrelenting attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our point all along,'' Roberts said emphatically
Friday as she monitored the impeachment debate. ``You cannot have
staring you in the face the possibility of the removal of the
president of the United States and not cover it. The fact that the
details were tawdry is not our fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary McGrory, a columnist for The Washington Post, said that
``people are always telling me this story is media-driven. I think
in the beginning it was, but it acquired a momentum of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Most TV and print reporters interviewed during another hectic
workday Friday said they were just doing their jobs, that the
nature of the Clinton scandal demanded comprehensive coverage, and
that public hostility toward their role is not surprising because
the citizenry often takes a kill-the-messenger attitude toward
bearers of unwelcome news.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been lots of times in our history that people have
been unhappy with the media, and thought the media is out of
step,'' said Roberts. ``What's different now is the pervasiveness,
now that we've got the 24-hour channels reporting every teeny
little factoid.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the magnitude of the moment began to sink in Friday,
there were also stirrings of media introspection.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said half-jokingly that she was ``proud of the fact that
the most explicit word I used all year was `breast.' '' while
reporting and analyzing the sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Franken, the respected congressional correspondent for CNN,
said he believes his own network behaved creditably in
distinguishing fact from ``self-serving leaks'' by insisting on two
credible sources for each story. But Franken expressed misgivings
that other members of the media did not hew to similar standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very easy to get too ambitious and cut corners, and
some people did,'' said Franken. ``There have been a lot of people
out there who have used this as a ratings ploy. ... There are many,
many, many reporters who are careless.''
</P>
<P>
   As he wrote his story on the House impeachment debate Friday,
Frank Aukofer, the veteran Washington bureau chief for the
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, mused about how much more attention the
media now pay to the personal lives of politicians than it did when
Aukofer covered the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how we got here,'' said Aukofer. ``It's a
chicken-and-egg thing. Did we create it, or did the public demand
it?''
</P>
<P>
   There is little question in the mind of Nelson, the Los Angeles
Times correspondent, that the answer is the former when it comes to
the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media has done a lot to feed the fire of impeachment,'' he
said. ``An awful lot of them don't like Clinton, have never liked
him. A lot of what I've seen on television is unbelievable. There's
an intense competition to be first and wittiest. In the Nixon
impeachment story, the media was much more sober in the way they
approached it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Roberts of ABC maintained that the story of the sexual
relationship between a president and an underling had ramifications
far beyond the political realm where it is now being thrashed out.
``One of the questions I brought up is what it means for young
women in the workplace,'' she said, adding that the president's
conduct sent a message that could create ``a hostile work
environment for other women.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the media's role in the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal
began almost as soon as the story broke. White House correspondent
Sam Donaldson was roundly condemned for saying after the story
erupted in January, that ``Mr. Clinton, if he's not telling the
truth and the evidence shows that, he will resign, perhaps this
week.'' NBC Washington bureau chief Tim Russert also drew flak for
booking Internet gossip Matt Drudge as a guest on ``Meet the
Press'' in January. (Drudge now has his own talk show on the Fox
News channel.)
</P>
<P>
   But the Washington media have also had to contend with an
unprecedented barrage of leaks, spin, and rumor throughout this
year, and have often been forced to chase stories aired or printed
by the competition. Reporters made clear Friday they are not
overjoyed at having been transformed into a ``sleaze patrol.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lister of the BBC's Washington bureau said he has
noticed how many thinly sourced stories the American media have
floated this year, but said that is partly due to the elusive
nature of the truth when it came to the Lewinsky matter. ``The BBC
has always been particular about sources, but so much about this
story is difficult to pin down,'' said Lister.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans alike have aggressively worked the
Washington media throughout this year, jockeying for spots before
the microphone at places like the ``elm tree site'' where Franken
and other TV reporters were stationed Friday. At one point Friday,
Representative Patrick Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island, was
denouncing the impeachment proceedings in an interview with Franken
while, footsteps away, Representative J.D. Hayworth, Republican of
Arizona, was defending them.
</P>
<P>
   As the interviews ended, the spin continued. Hayworth cracked to
Franken: ``If you want the real story, I'll talk to you.'' A few
moments later, Kennedy drew Franken aside and asked if he could do
another interview after the debate, vowing to ``come in swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Franken and Carl Cameron of the Fox News channel voiced
qualms Friday about the growing prominence of talking heads on
network talk shows, who they said often know less than they pretend
to know and seldom have contact with the principals of stories they
opine about.
</P>
<P>
   But despite those qualms, and his concerns over some parts of
the media handled the story, Franken defends the coverage overall.
``Was all this coverage appropriate?'' he asked. ``You bet. Because
of the high stakes involved.''

 &HT;    Kuhlman bought by Borg-Warner
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Savannah-based Kuhlman Inc., which has been on a
five-year acquisition spree, will itself be bought by Borg-Warner
Automotive Inc. in a deal valued at as much as $750 million in
cash, stock and debt.
</P>
<P>
   For Chicago-based Borg-Warner, the prize is Kuhlman's booming
Schwitzer Group subsidiary, which makes turbochargers that add
power to diesel engines. The unit accounted for $346 million, or 54
percent, of the company's 1997 sales of $643 million.
</P>
<P>
   Borg-Warner, the world's largest maker of automatic transmission
parts, said it would sell the rest of Kuhlman's businesses once the
acquisition is completed. The company also makes power and
instrument transformers and electronic wires and cables.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhlman shares jumped 18 percent Friday to close at $37.37 1/2,
up $5.87 1/2. Borg-Warner shares closed at $50.75, down 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is subject to Kuhlman shareholders' approval as well as
regulatory approval. It is expected to close in the first quarter
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, at Kuhlman Corp., found Borg-Warner's offer attractive and
felt compelled to accept it as being in the best interests of our
shareholders,'' said Roger S. Jepson Jr., chairman and chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent and continuing changes in the transportation and
automotive industries favor larger and internationally-based
organizations,'' he added. `` Our Schwitzer Group and its employees
will now be part of a much larger organization which will be
well-positioned to thrive and to be more responsive to the global
needs of its customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuhlman spokesman Rick Walker said Borg-Warner also intends to
close Kuhlman's Savannah headquarters, which moved to the coastal
city from Lexington, Ky., in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhlman employs a total of 4,454 people at 30 facilities in five
countries. The only Georgia facility is a Schwitzer Group plant in
Gainesville that employs 220 workers. Schwitzer's total employment
is 2,803, while Kuhlman Electric and Coleman Cable together employ
1,633 and account for $300 million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhlman has acquired six companies since December 1993,
including the 1995 acquisition of Schwitzer that put it in the
turbocharger business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do at least one a year,'' Jepson said earlier this year
when the company was ranked fifth in The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution's annual Best of Business top 10 survey of
Georgia public companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dream no small dreams,'' said Jepson, a former banker who
operates Jepson Vineyards in Ukiah, Calif., in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
   The Kuhlman purchase is Borg-Warner's second in a month. The
company completed its purchase last week of Germany's AG Kuhnle,
Kopp &AMP; Kausch's turbocharger division for an undisclosed amount of
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Turbocharger sales are booming, driven by the need for fuel
economy and mandated clean air standards. Makers of auto and truck
parts have been consolidating to broaden their product lines and
offer complete parts systems as automakers seek to cut
manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew LaGrone, an analyst at Birmingham-based Sterne, Agee and
Leach who follows Kuhlman, said the company's sales have been
growing by 22 percent and net income by 57 percent, compounded
annually, during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   But stock performance has not kept pace, said LaGrone. The stock
remains well off its 52-week high of $51.37 1/2, reached in March.
LaGrone has forecast 16 percent net income growth for Kuhlman in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted more acquisitions of smaller, high-performing
companies like Kuhlman by larger firms, because the stock market
does not favor the smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the market won't reward them with valuation, another
company will by buying them up,'' LaGrone said.
</P>
<P>
   Borg-Warner offered $39 per share, or $660 million. The
transaction includes both cash and $150 million of stock, which
will be issued to Kuhlman shareholders. The company will pay $510
million in cash and assume about $80 million to $90 million of
Kuhlman's debt, John Fiedler, Borg-Warner's chairman and chief
executive, told Bloomberg News Service.

 &HT;    Deadline on water extended for a year
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ Georgia, Florida and Alabama now have another
year beyond the original Dec. 31 deadline to settle their
decade-old water war.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the governors of the three states, meeting in
Montgomery on Friday, signed agreements to extend until Dec. 31,
1999, the deadline for devising a water allocation formula to
divide up the waters of two river basins: the
Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa basin (ACT) and the
Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint basin (ACF). The ACT basin flows
through Georgia and Alabama, but the waters of the ACF are shared
by all three states.
</P>
<P>
   Under two interstate water compacts approved last year by
Congress, negotiators for the three states began deliberations in
February to come up with a formula that would guarantee each state
an equitable share of the waters from the basins. However, devising
such a plan has proved complicated, and the three states still have
major differences over how much water each state will get.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a long way to go, but there is a light at the
end of the tunnel,'' said Richard Laird, the chief negotiator for
Alabama. Each state has its own different proposal for how the
waters will be divided, and the negotiators are trying to work out
a plan that all three states can agree on.
</P>
<P>
   No state will get all the water it wants. ``If each of the
states cannot agree to give up something, then we will face
failure,'' said Bob Kerr, Georgia's chief negotiator. ``A year (to
come up with a formula) is a short time; the tasking is immense.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake for Georgia in the negotiations is enough water to
nurture metro Atlanta's growth and most of the growth of North
Georgia. In exchange for guarantees of enough water for growth
during the next 30 years, Georgians may have to pay higher
electricity rates as hydropower production is reduced. Strict
limits on water for irrigation may be imposed on southwest Georgia
farmers. In metro Atlanta, permanent restrictions on outdoor
watering and other stern conservation measures may be put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Thomas, who was appointed by President Clinton to
represent federal agencies in the negotiations, said that while the
deliberators are concerned most about water quantity, they also
must be concerned about keeping the water clean and enough of it
flowing in rivers and streams to support fish and other aquatic
life.
</P>
<P>
   If the negotiators fail to agree on a water allocation formula,
then the water war will be thrown into the Supreme Court for
settlement. Thomas also has the authority under the interstate
compacts to veto an agreement if it is not acceptable to federal
agencies.

 &HT;    Cox Communications hires BBDO ad agency
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cox Communications has hired the local office of BBDO
to develop a new ad campaign to promote itself as a provider of all
kinds of new digital communication services.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company expects to spend $3 million annually
with BBDO South, which had $247.5 million in billings last year.
The Cox Communications account represents the fifth new client BBDO
South has signed in 1998, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   BBDO beat out 17 other ad agencies nationwide. It was selected
for its ``strategic consumer insight and outstanding creative
work,'' said Virginia Gray, Cox Communications' vice president of
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The change in agencies comes at an important time for Cox
Communications. It has been expanding beyond the company's
traditional cable TV business.
</P>
<P>
   In systems spread from coast to coast, the company has been
increasingly offering telephone service and high-speed access to
the Internet through its new digital network.
</P>
<P>
   The company ultimately wants to become a general provider of
communications services, offering customers one-stop shopping for
cable TV, telephone and Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strategy requires a new brand identity, the company
believes. Right now, few of its 3.8 million customers know Cox
Communications offers more than cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications executives say they are looking for an ad
campaign that does two things. First, the company wants a
consistent look and feel for the branding of its growing roster of
products.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it wants people to begin seeing the company not as a
cable system but as a new breed of communications company that
offers all kinds of reliable services.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, BBDO executives say they share Cox
Communications' world view. ``We've seen the future, and the future
is digital,'' says Chris Hall, chief executive of BBDO South.
</P>
<P>
   BBDO South is a unit of BBDO Worldwide. Its clients include
Georgia-Pacific, Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza, and the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development.

SEN. KENNEDY WANTS CIGARETTE TAX TO PAY FOR MEDICARE DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ US Senator Edward M. Kennedy Friday said he will file
legislation for a 70-cent tax on a pack of cigarettes to help pay
for the uncovered drug costs of Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy unveiled the plan at a State House press conference
during which officials also announced that four major HMOs have
agreed to help subsidize seniors' prescription costs not covered by
the federal health insurance program.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a loophole in a 1997 federal law that allowed
Medicare HMOs to begin capping drug benefits in Massachusetts,
seniors and lawmakers have been scrambling to find a way to bridge
the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, Governor Paul Cellucci and Mayor Thomas M. Menino have
been pressuring the state's largest HMOs to put aside their bottom
lines and help ease what could be a financial crisis for thousands
of elderly people in the state when the policy change takes effect
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Fallon Community Health Plan became the fourth HMO in
the state to establish a financial assistance program to aid
seniors with high drug costs. Fallon said it would commit $2
million to help seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon officials said that figure could increase depending on
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new transitional plan gives seniors with high prescription
costs an opportunity to continue receiving medication they need
without undue financial harship,'' said Fallon co-executive
director James J. Egan. ``Short of offering unlimited prescription
benefits, we believe this is the best alternative for seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   With Fallon now on board, all four will provide some additional
coverage _ but just for the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains, then what?
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two months ago, a federal judge barred Massachusetts from
implementing its own law guaranteeing seniors the option of
unlimited prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he will ``continue to demand that Congress allow
us to reimplement our own law that provides unlimited drug benefits
to seniors at no cost to the state or federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kennedy said he wanted a new 70-cent tobacco tax to fund
Medicare drug coverage nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-nine percent of the private sector companies provide
(drug coverage) but the federal government does not,'' Kennedy
said. ``I'm a strong believer that we should. And I'm going to
introduce legislation that will. And I'll pay for it by an
additional 70 cents on the tobacco tax. That will provide the
funding for all of this need nationwide for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's plan could put Cellucci, who has taken a no new taxes
pledge, in an awkward spot while trying to find a solution for the
drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't support raising taxes here in Massachusetts.
I think I've said in the past the extent that raising taxes here
puts us in an uncompetitive position, I don't think that's a good
thing,'' Cellucci said. ``Because it would be a national situation,
I find that less objectionable.''

GOOD SHOW! BUT DICTIONARY ISN'T LAST WORD  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I have often thought of simplifying my life, dumping
most of my possessions in a misguided attempt to make living
easier. I hear Henry Thoreau's voice in the back of my head:
``Simplify, simplify.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the shedding of the snakeskin, and the urge hits strongest
for most of us right after a divorce, or just before we move to a
new house.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this scheme for me has always been to get rid of the
mountain of books in my house and slim down to those I would
consider essential. That means a King James Bible and a complete
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   But when I make such schemes, I know that there are other things
I cannot do without: Among them is a dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   And immediately, things start getting complicated. For no single
dictionary is sufficient. To this day, 243 years after Samuel
Johnson brought out the first popularly successful English-language
dictionary, not one is entirely satisfactory. The best is the
Oxford English Dictionary _ a huge multivolume tome _ but it has
two strikes against it. It is English rather than American, and it
was completed in 1928 and even with its supplements is dreadfully
out of date in an MTV world.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as the Random House Webster's Dictionary, market
their book as a repository of all the newest, trendiest words. If
you want to know what a ``pop-up video'' is or a ``valley girl,''
you need to have one of these with-it word books.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, none of them is as scholarly or inclusive as the
OED.
</P>
<P>
   So that has always meant that I need more than one. So much for
simplifying one's life.
</P>
<P>
   And now, another kind of dictionary has come out: one that
features lots and lots and lots of pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The Illustrated Oxford Dictionary (DK Publishing, $45 until
January; $50 after that) is this season's flashiest new entry into
the field. It is chock-a-block with helpful drawings and
photographs, showing you rather than merely telling you, what a
forceps is, or a hansom cab.
</P>
<P>
   Older dictionaries often had illustrations, too, mostly
postage-stamp size pictures of black-and-white aardvarks or
dibbles. But they were usually dated and inadequate _ although they
often maintain the attraction of nostalgia we have developed for
them from the first dictionaries we consulted in elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   The new IOD, however, uses illustrations as a primary means of
defining some words. It is certainly easier to see a murex shell
than to understand one solely from the defining words. Once you see
one, all spiky and purple, you are not likely to forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, there is no aardvark picture, only a definition
that calls it a ``nocturnal animal of southern Africa . . . with a
tubular snout and a long tongue, that feeds on termites.''
</P>
<P>
   Compare this with Sam Johnson's definition of a rhinoceros: ``A
vast beast of the Indies armed with a horn on his front.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new dictionary is generally promiscuous with pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The entry on golf shows a photograph of a man in plaid trousers
_ what else? _ holding a 5-iron. Under him are all the clubheads
currently used in the game, from wood to wedge, and a map of a
schematized 18-hole golf course. It takes up half a page.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the entries are more like brief encyclopedia articles
than dictionary definitions. One very pretty page is given over to
showing the different kinds of fruit, all in full color, with whole
and halved fruits spread out graphically on the paper.
</P>
<P>
   It contains 180,000 definitions and 4,500 full-color
illustrations. It includes such current words and phrases as
``voice mail'' and ``velociraptor.'' Some 600 entries are full- or
half-page ``feature illustrations'' that depict, for instance,
eight kinds of dolphins, both oceanic and river, and a separate
cutaway view of dolphin anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   The book is out just in time for Christmas gift giving; and no
doubt, it is an excellent dictionary to give to a young student.
Perhaps it is the best for a grammar-school pupil.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the dictionary I have been looking for. It will
not simplify my life.
</P>
<P>
   Although, it does simplify the language: It is only interested
in defining words and showing pictures of them. A real dictionary
does much more.
</P>
<P>
   There are no etymologies in it, for instance, and no quotations.
A dictionary like this leaves its readers asea when it comes to the
fine points of what a word means. And it is those fine points that
are not only most interesting, but carry the emotional weight of
the language.
</P>
<P>
   For words are not merely the equal of their definitions. They
are like ink spots dropped on a blotter, with a clearly defined
center, but a spreading nimbus of meaning diffusing out in
irregular patterns.
</P>
<P>
   There are no synonyms in the English language. The very idea is
a phantom. Each variation of an idea carries with it a different
connotational universe.
</P>
<P>
   If you think a ``collier'' is a coal miner, think again. You
cannot think of a coal miner without thinking also of banjoes and
guitars; or a collier without his brass bands playing
``Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   They even have different literatures, with D.H. Lawrence on one
side and Loretta Lynn on the other.
</P>
<P>
   A dictionary like the OED gives us so many quotations _ usage
examples _ that as we ferret through the book, we learn some of the
finer distinctions that allow us to use the word with a proper
appreciation of its perfect cultural pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The IOD is, by that standard, tone deaf.
</P>
<P>
   So, when I slough off that lizard skin and fulfill my fantasy of
an unencumbered life, this new dictionary will not be part of it.
But I may have to cart around the sheer poundage of the OED.
</P>
<P>
   Life is never simple. &QL;

FUTURE OF UN INSPECTION TEAM IN DOUBT IN WAKE OF RAIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A secret computer video feed that enables UN
inspectors in New York to monitor Iraq's weapons facilities went
dead Friday, probably the result of the US bombing campaign,
according to UN sources.
</P>
<P>
   The technical breakdown was the latest setback for an
organization whose future has grown increasingly uncertain since
Washington launched its missile strikes on Iraq. In the first two
days of the air raids, the Pentagon says it has destroyed 75 key
military installations, raising questions about whether the UN
Special Commission will have anything left to inspect if it ever
returns to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The target list _ which included Iraq's defense ministry,
intelligence headquarters, the Republican Guard barracks, and the
Al Taji and Ibn Al Haytham's missile production factories _
contains many of the locations under the inspectors' scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the documentary evidence may have been blown up,''
said a senior UN official. ``If UNSCOM ever goes back in, it's
almost like they were in '91 starting from scratch trying to put a
trail together.''
</P>
<P>
   As the UN arms specialists in New York came to grips with their
predicament, the chairman of the UN Special Commission, Richard
Butler, said Friday that he is worried that the future of his
mission is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about where we will go next, and will we still be
able to do our job,'' said Butler, who has insisted that he will
not give up his post until Iraq is a weapons-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's staff declined to confirm the existence of video
monitoring station at UN headquarters _ which is classified.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Duelfer, the UN Special Commission's deputy
chairman, signaled that the UN's capacity to monitor Iraq weapons
facility had been eroded by the American campaign. ``There is a
coincidence of location between our cameras and America's bombs,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States' insitence that the Special Commission
will play an important role in Iraq when the bombs fall silent,
inspectors in New York remain anxious over the prospects of its
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I going to be here in a month's time? Possibly yes,'' said
one official who requested anonymity. ``Six months time? I don't
know.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The outgoing House speaker, Rep. Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., uttered a thanks, but no thanks, as did the man who will
replace him next month, Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La.
</P>
<P>
   Too messy, too contentious, they said, at least privately, in
reference to presiding over the House vote on the impeachment of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., who is independent-minded and
respected for his comity, was only too ``honored'' to accept the
task. So when the House began its momentous, highly charged debate
on Friday, LaHood was the man occupying the speaker's chair, gavel
in hand, presiding over his colleagues and their inflamed passions.
</P>
<P>
   From his elevated position high above the well of the House,
LaHood's job was to recognize the ``gentle lady'' or the
``gentleman'' before they spoke or gavel them into silence if they
got out of hand. With all the efficiency of a study-hall monitor,
LaHood constantly interrupted members' speeches because their
colleagues were loitering in the aisles. ``I'm going to ask
everyone in the chamber to take a seat,'' he repeatedly said. ``If
you want to be in the chamber, you have to be in a seat. If you
want to remain in the chamber, you have to be in a seat. We have to
have order. All _ both sides will require order.''
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over the House as speaker pro tempore is not a new
role for LaHood, 53, who was elected to Congress as part of the
rebel class in 1994, has eschewed the fiery oratory of most of his
classmates for the subtler, consensus-building approach of his
onetime boss, the former minority leader Robert Michel. With his
reputation for evenhandedness and his parliamentary prowess, which
he gleaned as Michel's aide, LaHood was tapped early on, and often,
after Republicans won the majority, to handle the duties of the
chair, a responsibility that in theory belongs to the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   LaHood will also be the one who decides, when the House actually
votes on the articles of impeachment Saturday, when to use the
gavel to cap off a vote or when to hold off, a move that gives the
``whips'' a few extra minutes to cajole members into changing their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an art form,'' said retiring Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo.,
who often presided over the House when his party was in control.
``It takes an ability to sense the mood of the House, track the
chemistry of what is going on in the floor, apply the gavel lightly
or hard, depending on what is warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   LaHood has occupied the chair during some of the House's most
emotional debates, including votes on a form of late-term abortion
and on Medicare. He was also given the job of overseeing former
Rep. Robert Dornan's one-minute speeches on the House floor, which
tended to turn into seething diatribes against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of his revolution-minded colleagues, LaHood reveres
Congress as an institution and has worked to shore up decorum.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he joined forces with Skaggs to organize a
well-attended bipartisan retreat in Pennsylvania to encourage more
civility among members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It is an attitude, LaHood said, that has permeated his
Republican district, once the territory of Everett McKinley
Dirksen, who went on to be elected to the Senate and helped
shepherd the civil rights bills of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   LaHood also flashes an independent streak when he chooses, like
when he became one of only three Republicans who did not sign the
Contract With America, the party's 1994 manifesto. As for Clinton's
impeachment, while no one expects him to buck the leadership,
LaHood says he falls into the undecided category.

LOUISIANA CONSTITUENTS SHRUG OFF LIVINGSTON NEWS

   METAIRIE, La. _ News of infidelities by the House speaker-elect,
Robert L. Livingston, was instant fodder for the morning talk shows
in his congressional district Friday, and judging from the
reaction, Livingston is in no political trouble.
</P>
<P>
   As the chatter bubbled over WWL radio's ``The Andre Show,''
broadcast live from Livingston's hometown of Metairie, callers
rallied to his defense and railed instead at President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy from Kenner observed that ``if every congressman who had
an affair turned to dust then Washington would look like a desert.
. . . On personal matters, the media should lose freedom of the
press.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger from Metairie asked the show's hostess, Andre Trevigne, to
``use your investigative powers to find out who's going to get the
million dollars from Larry Flynt. Maybe Bill Clinton's going to get
the money.''
</P>
<P>
   News reports had identified Hustler magazine as the source of
disclosures about Livingston. But the magazine's publisher, Larry
Flynt, who had offered up to $1 million for tips on infidelities by
congressmen, denied his publication was behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most radio talk shows have a conservative
constituency, but so does Livingston's district. Although President
Clinton carried Louisiana in 1996, he won only 37 percent of the
vote in Livingston's 1st congressional district. Livingston, on the
other hand, has been re-elected without opposition in the last two
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The district covers three rural parishes north of Lake
Pontchartrain as well as the predominantly white suburbs
surrounding New Orleans, where the warrens of bungalows and
stretches of strip malls have little of the character of the
state's colorful politics.
</P>
<P>
   Inasmuch as Louisiana repeatedly returned Edwin W. Edwards to
the governor's office even as he boasted of his extramarital
affairs, a groundswell rising against Livingston seems that much
more unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   A forgiving editorial Friday in The Times-Picayune of New
Orleans, which commended Livingston for being ``forthright about
what he had done,'' seemed to sum up local sentiment. ``There is a
feeling of disappointment, of course. But his willingness to take
responsibility for his actions is arguably part of what makes him a
leader,'' it read.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's Republican allies also were quick with expressions
of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably a lot of people are disappointed, but that's not to
say that he will have to step down,'' said Jon Gegenheimer, clerk
of the Jefferson Parish court system and a prominent Republican.
``I think it will blow over just like the case of Henry Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, admitted
earlier this year to an adulterous affair. The disclosure had
little effect on his role in Congress or his stature in his home
district in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson Serio, a Metairie accountant who serves on the state's
Republican central committee, said the news of Livingston's
indiscretion ``came as a surprise, but it won't have much impact on
his constituency.'' Serio, a member of a Christian right faction
that controls the committee, called Livingston ``an extraordinarily
honorable person, and people appreciate the honorable way he stood
up and spoke out.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Livingston's announcement would disminish the
congressman's popularity, Steve Swain, another member of the state
GOP committee, said, ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of Livingston's friends, Swain turned the topic toward
Clinton. ``I have to be really partisan and say that the Democrats
want to destroy the messenger. Clinton's problem is based on
perjury, not adultery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Renwick, director of the Institute of Politics at Loyola
University in New Orleans, said he doubts Livingston will suffer
much political damage. ``This might bring somebody out of the
woodwork to challenge him in the year 2000, but if he does a good
job as speaker he shouldn't have any trouble. This is not that big
a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Powell, a professor specializing in Louisiana history at
Tulane University, sounded one of the few discouraging words:
sanctimonious. ``That's the thing that bothers me, Livingston being
so sanctimonious,'' Powell said. ``But I don't think the people
will give a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   State Representative Charles Lancaster, a Metairie Republican,
said Livingston has such a ``reservoir of good will'' that he can
overcome his current difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Even the executive director of the state Democratic Party, Trey
Ourso, minimized the political consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a really secure district,'' Ourso said. ``It's been so
long since he was challenged, I don't know if he could ever be
beaten.''

FATHER IN ALLEGED KIDNAP READY TO MAKE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Stephen Fagan's attorney and two daughters will meet
Monday with Middlesex District Attorney Thomas Reilly to discuss a
deal in which Fagan would plead guilty to parental kidnapping
charges but escape jail time.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which sources said is likely to be accepted, would
mark an abrupt turnaround from the public stance of prosecutors who
had pledged to bring the case to trial.
</P>
<P>
   But faced with the daughters' unwavering support for Fagan _ who
took the children from their mother 19 years ago and raised them
under new identities in Florida _ prosecutors felt that they would
have a difficult time convincing a judge or jury that Fagan
deserved to be jailed, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The session between Fagan's daughters and prosecutors will
follow an 11 a.m. meeting in which Barbara Kurth, the girls' mother
and Fagan's ex-wife, will be updated by Reilly, the outgoing DA,
his successor Martha Coakley and assistant DA Lynn Rooney, who is
prosecuting the case.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan has argued that he felt compelled to take the girls, then
5 and 2 years old, from Kurth, whom he described as an alcoholic
and a neglectful mother. He told the girls, Rachael and Lisa, that
their mother had died in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Fagan changed his name to William Martin, married
two wealthy women and lived a luxurious life as a social-climbing
socialite who passed himself off as a consultant and CIA agent.
However, Fagan does not appear to have worked since he fled
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, 56, was arrested April 16 at his oceanfront mansion in
Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth, who adamantly rejects her ex-husband's portrayal of her
as an unfit mother, has not seen her daughters since Fagan's
arrest. They have refused to visit her while charges are pending
against their father.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth,, 48, is a molecular biologist at the University of
Virginia Medical School. Her attorney, Jacob Atwood, said Friday he
was surprised by reports of a possible plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lynn Rooney and I remain in close contact, and she told me
repeatedly that the case is going to trial,'' Atwood said. ``I've
talked to Tom Reilly in the past, and he told me that this case
would never be plea-bargained and would go to trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said that Fagan's attorney, Richard Egbert, recently met
with Reilly and Rooney, but the meeting was not productive. Then
about 10 days ago, Atwood said, Egbert asked the district attorney
if Fagan's daughters ``could plead their case that they don't want
their father to go to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara's brother, Peter Kurth, said Friday that no one from the
district attorney's office has contacted him or his sister to
discuss the possible deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara is perfectly willing to see this go to trial. She is
not frightened. But, in the end, it isn't her decision,'' Peter
Kurth said. ``Speaking for myself, there is no punishment that can
fit this crime, so I'm not sure what difference going to jail would
make.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Heffron, a spokesman for Reilly, declined to comment on
the proposal. However, he said that discussions about plea
agreements are routine in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   A previously scheduled preliminary hearing is scheduled for Dec.
28 at Middlesex Superior Court in Cambridge. Prosecutors are
believed to want a compromise hammered out before then.
</P>
<P>
   If an agreement is reached, Fagan would recover the $250,000
cash bond he posted in April in Cambridge. Last month in Florida,
he paid a $12,000 fine and surrendered a 1998 Honda on charges that
he falsely identified himself when he registered that car and a
Bentley worth more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan's carefully constructed life in Florida unraveled in
April, when was arrested by Massachusetts state troopers and police
from Framingham, where Fagan had lived before his disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Fagan never returned Lisa and Rachael Martin from a
weekend visit with him to the North Adams home they shared with
their mother. A contentious divorce ended their marriage in 1978
and Kurth was granted custody of the children.
</P>
<P>
   The daughters, now young women, apparently heard that their
mother was alive when Middlesex County prosecutors visited them.
Since then, the sisters _ known to former teachers, coaches and
neighbors as well-adjusted, determined, successful and happy _ have
publicly supported their father.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, Barbara Kurth received a phone call from a
Palm Beach lawyer who said Fagan's sister had confided his secret
identity to him. Kurth allegedly phoned Atwood immediately,
triggering the investigation into Fagan's identity.
</P>
<P>
   Both daughters have said repeatedly they would testify for their
father despite any crimes he may have committed. Barbara Kurth also
made a public appeal, asking her daughters to visit when they were
ready.

   BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ When President Clinton came to town this
week, Tanya Ghattas took her four children, gave them American
flags and went out to greet the unusual visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We waved to him, he smiled, and we were very happy,'' Mrs.
Ghattas recalled. ``He was like the prince of peace for us, and we
hoped that he would help us and bring peace. Now we're
disappointed, because he's hitting the Iraqi people. I don't love
Saddam Hussein, but I support the Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ghattas' disillusionment is widely shared across the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, where a visit by Clinton early this week gave
Palestinians a sense that their national aspirations had gained a
new level of recognition from a powerful new ally. For a few
fleeting days, there were hopes for a breakthrough in peace efforts
and signs of a closer, stronger relationship with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's failure to persuade Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Israel to carry out a further troop withdrawal in the
West Bank under the latest peace accord, and the American air
strikes on Iraq, have soured the mood. The warm welcome has been
replaced by bitter frustration and an outpouring of sympathy by
Palestinians for their fellow Arabs: ordinary Iraqis enduring the
American attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Anger welled up for the second straight day Friday afternoon
across the West Bank, where crowds of Palestinians took to the
streets after mosque prayers to protest the air strikes and to
denounce Clinton. The American flags raised for the presidential
visit were trampled and burned, replaced by Iraqi banners and
pictures of Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations have been dominated by militant Islamic and
leftist groups opposed to Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader,
and his agreements with Israel: Hamas, the pro-Iraqi Arab
Liberation Front, and two Marxist factions, the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition groups have seized on the attack on Iraq as proof
that the American sponsor of the Palestinian-Israeli agreements is
an enemy of Arabs and of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death to America!'' Hamas marchers shouted as they walked
through the alleys of Bethlehem Friday. ``Dear Saddam, blow up Tel
Aviv!''
</P>
<P>
   At the entrance to town, under a leftover banner that said
``Bill Clinton: Welcome to Palestine,'' protesters hurled stones at
an Israeli army checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   A youth masked with a red-checked head scarf ran toward the
soldiers with a flaming American flag that had been distributed by
the Palestinian Authority when Clinton arrived. A teen-ager stepped
on another flag as the crack of Israeli gunfire rang through the
streets, and tear-gas canisters traced arcs of white smoke as they
sailed toward the protesters. After a few hours of clashes, more
than a dozen Palestinians were reported hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The resentment among Palestinians has posed a problem for
Arafat, who has kept silent about the bombings. Although he is
anxious to preserve his newly strengthened relationship with
Clinton at a time of renewed crisis in talks with Israel, he cannot
ignore the sentiments of his own people.
</P>
<P>
   So the Palestinian police have permitted the pro-Iraq protests,
even as some local Palestinian television and radio stations have
been shut down for broadcasting the demonstrations and pro-Iraqi
remarks.

DOOM LOOMS FOR CLASSICAL MUSIC  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The death of classical music ain't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and '70s, the death of classical music referred to
the inability of living symphonic and chamber-music composers to
connect with an audience. Orchestras and chamber groups became
museums of music written by the moldering dead. This process, which
had begun long before, reached a peak in those first decades of pop
culture hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s and '90s, the phrase broadened to indicate the
commercialization of classical music through marketing and
cross-over, especially as limned by English critic Norman Lebrecht
in his celebrated (if that's the word for the announcement of an
art form's termination) 1997 book of that name.
</P>
<P>
   This pattern established, you might think this is a never-ending
morbidity, a dying without death. But with the coming of a certain
event, I am convinced the ``death of classical music'' will come to
mean a kind of transformation into something else. Classical music
will surrender its identity, and ease into the mainstream of pop
culture.
</P>
<P>
   In many places, that transformation is already under way. One of
those places is the United States of America outside its major
cultural capitals such as New York, Chicago, San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip to New York, I barely managed to get a ticket
to a sold-out New York Philharmonic concert. Walking down Fifth
Avenue, I overheard someone singing to himself a snatch of
Schubert. Back in Phoenix, I walked into Phoenix Symphony Hall for
a concert and had my choice of seats. I have never overheard anyone
singing or whistling anything from the classical canon on the
streets of Phoenix _ or even of Tempe in the area of the Arizona
State University School of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Classical music exists in little packets in places like Phoenix,
among communities of those who care for it the way others care for
origami or chess. It's a passion for a few people and a pleasant
alternative to pop music for some, while for most it is something
heard on occasion on PBS, or transmogrified into television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   An upcoming watershed will make everywhere more like Phoenix and
less like New York.
</P>
<P>
   What is this nuclear bomb ready to explode in the face of
classical culture?
</P>
<P>
   The millennium. The big 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on classical music of the millennium will be akin to
the infamous Y2K problem. Y2K is the knot created by a lack of
foresight on the part of those who designed IBM-clone computer
chronometers. Only two digits indicate the year, so there is no way
the computer can ``know'' it is the year 2000; it will read ``00''
as 1900. It has been programmed to jump back a century.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto classical music.
</P>
<P>
   But while computer scientists are working to unleash the cyber
future from its virtual past, real-life classical music is stuck
forever in reverse, because it is definable only in terms of past
values.
</P>
<P>
   Even the name dates it. ``Classical'' music must belong to a
bygone time, else it is not classical. Yet, bygone is relative, and
until now we have been enjoying music of composers from two
centuries ago, or a century ago, or early this century.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 will push everything farther away. Looking back
over our shoulders, Mozart and Haydn will be slipping over the
horizon, with Beethoven barely visible. The 19th century _ the last
century dominated by Western art music _ won't be ``last century''
anymore. ``Last century'' will refer to the century that initiated
pop music's international dominance. Brahms, Wagner, Tchaikovsky _
even Debussy and Mahler, who lived into the 20th century _ will be
buried in another hundred years of history overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Naysaying? Doomspeaking? Indigestion?
</P>
<P>
   Item: Polygram Records, a company comprising among others the
prestigious classical labels Deutsche Grammaphon, Philips and
London Records, was sold this year to Seagram, the ``entertainment,
spirits and wine'' corporation that also owns Universal Music, a
pop music giant. Rumblings from within indicate fears that
bottom-line priorities will mean fewer serious recordings. A press
release from Polygram following the restructuring refers to
``classical'' music as ``an art form which appears completely at
odds with a dominant, flashy and hubris-laden pop culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Item: Record label BMG's classical division has dropped
conductor Leonard Slatkin from its roster of artists, along with
Slatkin's orchestra, the Washington, D.C.-based National Symphony.
Slatkin has recorded for BMG for more than 20 years, and his and
National's recording of John Corigliano's Symphony No. 1 won the
Grammy for Best New Classical Recording in 1996. BMG cited
financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   These are just proverbial iceberg tips. The real damage to the
titanic store and tradition of Western art music goes much deeper.
It has to do with fundamental ways of thinking and feeling, with
the traditional Western values classical music exemplifies and
their replacement by other, new values.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``classical music'' covers a lot of ground, from high
medieval plainchant to the most recent symphonic essays. But from
chanting monks to living composers Aaron Kernis and Bright Sheng,
with music between as different as Bach fugues and Schubert lieder
and Stravinsky ballets, the music has operated on the assumption
that such things as beauty, order and some level of complexity are
essential to expression.
</P>
<P>
   Those things are no longer thought essential. In some quarters,
they are even considered to be negatives: Beauty is equated with a
vapid ``prettiness,'' order is suspect as the cultural equivalent
of fascism, and complexity is elitist. In pop music, the beat _
steady and unending _ has taken on a supreme and unquestionable
function, supplanting harmony as the defining feature of music.
Social and political content have become important. Whole new
theoretical structures have grown up around rock music and its
derivatives. It's a new aesthetic that contradicts the old.
</P>
<P>
   What does that have to do with classical music? Everything, not
only because pop music has so much muscle and money, but because
when the average, well-educated person thinks of music, especially
new music, they think of pop. Composer-author Ned Rorem has pointed
out that when talk at a party turns to new novels, the names that
come up are John Updike or Joyce Carol Oates. But when talk turns
to new music, it's Madonna or The Symbol Formerly Known as The
Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Pop music is no longer an alternative to classical music; it is
its replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Item: Perry Meisel, a professor of English at New York
University, having written books about Thomas Hardy and Virginia
Woolf, turns his writing gifts to a book about contemporary music.
The subject: the roots of rock and roll. From the (classical)
musician's point of view, it is as if someone who has written about
Stravinsky and Charlie Parker (jazz being close to classical music
in many ways) turns to literature and decides to write about the
origins of romance novels.
</P>
<P>
   Item: The ``Wall Street Journal'' recently reported that more
than 14,000 students graduate annually from our country's
conservatories and music schools, many of these with specialization
in instruments. Yet fewer than 200 positions at America's full-time
symphony orchestras come available each year on average.
</P>
<P>
   It's necessary sometimes to whistle in the dark. People who have
put their lives and careers into classical music have to ignore a
lot, to keep going in spite of things, or they'd simply give it up
and go to law school. Some have.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not good not to face the facts, either. And the facts
pertaining to classical music's health are not good. A huge
psychological event such as the turning of a century/millennium
will almost certainly not make things better.
</P>
<P>
   When Michael Greene, president and CEO of the National
Association of Recording Arts and Sciences (the Grammy people) was
in Phoenix last year, I asked how it was that the Rolling Stones,
geezers even by baby boomer standards, had a huge following among
the young. Greene said it was because the Stones had come to
``symbolize rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how pop culture works. It puts things in slots and keeps
them there. You've got your official music of rebellion, and don't
even think of rebelling against it. You've also got your rap, your
country, your various other subdivisions, including your classical.
</P>
<P>
   Classical is quickly becoming a slot in pop culture. It's the
Three Tenors and Yo-Yo Ma. It's dead people's music performed by
media personalities.
</P>
<P>
   After the millennium, classical music to all but a small handful
of people will be a symbol of the past, just as the Stones are a
symbol of rebellion. Its absorption by pop culture will be
complete.
</P>
<P>
   To a classical music lover, Bach's B-minor Mass is something the
angels sing before the throne of God, the Beethoven string quartets
are essays in the very nature of Mind, and Shostakovich's Symphony
No. 10 is an individual's cry of ``Shame!'' in the face of the
almighty State.
</P>
<P>
   After the millennium, those pieces and great works like them
will be, for almost everyone who counts, for the educated and the
economically powerful, symbols of a sensibility disappearing over
the hills of yesterday, ``choices'' among myriad others in the vast
table of diverse symbols. &QL;

CLINTON-SENATE (Washington) - It turned out to be one of the most
intensely partisan debates in memory, and the House vote seemed
certain to be almost along party lines. And, if it continues to
unfold that way, impeachment is certain to fail in the Senate for a
very important historical reason: The founding fathers
intentionally made the Senate a brake on impeachments like this one
that don't attract broad support. Alexander Hamilton said that the
Senate's right to review the House's impeachment action ``guards
against the danger of persecution from the prevalence of a factious
spirit in either of those branches.''

CLINTON-RHODES (Phoenix) - Former House minority leader John
Rhodes, who was part of a contingent of Republicans who convinced
Richard Nixon to resign, said he believes President Clinton should
be censured, not impeached. By MICHAEL MURPHY. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
EDIT-CLINTON (Undated) - At long last, the full House of
Representatives has begun deciding whether to impeach President
Clinton. For all the fits and starts, unseemly revelations and even
bombing attacks, we have arrived at this historic vote with the
president having had any number of opportunities to explain himself
honestly, to present his case candidly.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Clinton has done neither. This nation has survived wars,
assassinations, riots and any number of corrupt politicians. It
certainly is big enough to handle an impeachment trial. Story moved
in the ``K'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FANTASY-FOOTBALL (Undated) - For many, the withdrawals are already
starting. The NFL season is dwindling down to a precious few games,
and you know what that means _ the end of fantasy football. Without
fantasy leagues, the NFL is much like the inside of Kevin Greene's
skull: a bleak void, bereft of all meaning. But I feel your pain.
If the shakes get too bad, you can always try playoff fantasy
football. By BILL MULLER. Story moved in the ``S'' category.

<P>
   &QL; 
CLASSICAL-DECLINE (Phoenix) - As 1999 arrives and the countdown to
a new millennium begins, a ``classical music'' culture that is
already creaking faces the prospect of aging a century overnight.
With a new century - not to mention a new millennium - Beethoven,
Brahms, and company will seem still further in the background,
still less relevant to today. That is, unless something is done
about it. By KENNETH LAFAVE. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DICTIONARIES (Phoenix) - I have often thought of simplifying my
life, dumping most of my possessions in a misguided attempt to make
living easier. I hear Henry Thoreau's voice in the back of my head:
``Simplify, simplify.'' But when I make such schemes, I know that
there are other things I cannot do without: among them is a
dictionary. And immediately, things start getting complicated. For
no single dictionary is sufficient. By RICHARD NILSEN. Story moved

 &QL; 
COPPER-PAINTING (Phoenix) - The Phoenix Art Museum's ``Copper as
Canvas'' show opens this week. The exhibition brings together for
the first time 105 of the most spectacular and best-preserved
examples of painting on copper. It surveys the works of 65 masters
- including Rembrandt and El Greco - and covers allegory and
mythology, portraiture, landscapes, still life and sacred themes.

 &HT;    CLINTON ADDRESS LIKELY AFTER IMPEACHMENT VOTE
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will likely address the nation
Saturday after a scheduled House vote targeting his presidency,
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made no public remarks about since Thursday morning
about the impeqachment that many see as inevitable. But it was
widely believed that he would want Americans to know his side of
the story as they absorbed news reports about Saturday's scheduled
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect that at some point you will probably see him,'' said
Lockhart, who declined to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also planned to meet at the White House with House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and other members of the
House Democratic leadership, immediately after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   With White House hopes for avoiding impeachment fading, Lockhart
accused Clinton's foes of ''partisanship and cynicism'' in an
effort to hound the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   In a possible preview of what Clinton might say in a speech,
Lockhart said House Republicans have played a duplicitous game. He
noted that after first insisting that impeachment was little more
than a green light for a more comprehensive and meaningful Senate
inquiry, Republicans have begun making the case that Clinton should
resign if impeached on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''A conscious effort was made to, in effect, dumb down
impeachment ... and say that this process wasn't important, that
the real action was someplace else, and then, having gone through
it, turn 180 degrees in the other direction and say, 'It's so
important, it's so important to this country and it's so damaging
that the president should resign,'' Lockhart said at a White House
briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a political strategy at work here that is
cynical and is not in the best interests of the American public,''
Lockhart said. ''You don't make something right by compounding it
with another wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Since House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois
and House Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas suggested in Sunday
talk show appearances that Clinton resign, many other Republicans
have joined in. Even a scattering of Democrats have agreed that
Clinton should resign, or consider doing so, in order to save the
nation the trauma of a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton himself said this week, ``I have no intention of
resigning. It's never crossed my mind.'' And several people close
to the president told reporters Friday that he would never leave
office voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can forget about that,'' said Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As 13 hours of bitterly partisan impeachment debate unfolded
Friday on Capitol Hill, Clinton stayed out of sight, hunkered down
at the White House working on subjects ranging from the continuing
U.S. air strikes in Iraq to the battle against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   He did ``very little'' to help the battle against impeachment,
Lockhart said, other than spend an hour meeting with Rep.
Christopher Shays of Connecticut, an undecided Republican, in the
presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Shays said later he knew no details of the
conversation and that Shays had no plans to announce his decision
until the vote. Lockhart also declined comment about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore conducted a series of radio interviews arguing against
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And after weeks of relative silence, first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton took reporters questions at the White House this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the vast majority of Americans share my approval and
pride in the job that the president's been doing for our country.
And I think that view is shared not only by the vast majority of
Americans, but by people all over the world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said that because the holiday season is ``a time
for reflection, reconciliation among people, we in our country
ought to practice reconciliation and we ought to bring our country
together and we ought to end divisiveness because we can do so much
more together.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has admitted wrongdoing in engaging in an intimate
relationship with Lewinsky, a former White House intern, and then
later misleading prosecutors and the nation about the nature of
that relationship.
</P>
<P>
   He has maintained, however, that his conduct does not rise to
the level of an impeachable offense. Instead, Clinton has suggested
that the House vote to censure him in a stern rebuke that would
leave a permanent record of Congressional condemnation of his
activities.

   IMPEACH (Washington) _ For the first time since Feb. 24, 1868,
three years after the United States emerged from an awful Civil
War, the House of Representatives debated the impeachment of a

AFTER THE GOLD RUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 20, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Universities move science from the laboratory to the
marketplace, supporting 250,000 jobs and contributing $30 billion
to the economy. Academic research improves the quality of life and
creates jobs.'' It was under that headline that the Association of
University Technology Managers last week released the results of
its annual survey.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to disagree, in general, with that?
</P>
<P>
   The data from its survey of the licensing activities of 175
member institutions are always interesting. But beyond the
commonplace that universities and hospitals are nurseries for for
new science that has practical applications, there is relatively
little in the report to support the authors' choice of verb.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to say it is the universities that are doing the
``moving?''
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly 20 years since the United States declared a
pell-mell gold rush on the intellectual property frontier. The time
has come to begin toting up the results. The vigorous association,
composed of lawyers, scientists, and other professional
intellectual property managers within universities, is one of the
indisputable fruits of the scramble. A lot of rich PhDs are
another.
</P>
<P>
   What else have we got to show for it?
</P>
<P>
   University and hospital technology managers date their modern
charter to 1980, when Congress passed a law directing them and
small businesses for the first time to patent and license
inventions developed under federally funded research programs. This
was the Bayh-Dole Act, sponsored by Senators Birch Bayh (D-Ind.)
and Bob Dole (R-Kan.); before it, technology transfer had happened
_ but haphazardly and lackadaisically.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Congress rationalized the patent procedure for
the first time in in 150 years, establishing a specialized
appellate court to hear patent cases, the Court of Appeals of the
Federal Circuit. Previously, patent cases had been heard in each
district in quite inconsistent ways. The new court quickly
strengthened patent protection.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, patenting surged in the United States. Having
fluctuated at a level of around 60,000 a year from 1945 until 1980,
patents by American inventors doubled in the 15 years after 1982.
Neither Japan, France, Germany, nor the United Kingdom display a
pattern since the mid-1980s anything like that. The European trends
remained flat; the steady Japanese increase that had been going on
since the 1950s leveled off in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the frontier of knowledge expanded
dramatically. The personal computer was invented. The Internet
boomed. The biotech revolution unfolded. And the health care system
underwent a dramatic transformation. And of course the US economy
grew vigorously, adding jobs and sending asset prices to record
levels.
</P>
<P>
   So what caused what? Did a stronger protection of intellectual
property rights precipitate a technological revolution? Or vice
versa? How well have the university middlemen managed their stream
of deals? What credit belongs to the shrewd money managers who,
starting in Boston and California in the years after World War II,
learned how to breath life into the markets for new technologies?
Only in the last few years have economists begun to measure and
assess the gold rush with a view to answering these questions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting attempts to appear is a paper by
Josh Lerner and Sam Kortum that asks, ``What's Behind the Recent
Surge in Patenting?'' Because Lerner is representative of a new
approach in the nation's leading business schools _ until recently,
they were citadels of self-delight _ it is worth briefly
considering the arc of his career.
</P>
<P>
   A 1982 graduate of Yale, he worked for several years in
Washington on issues in technological innovation and public policy
_ at the Brookings Institution, for a public-private partnership,
and on Capitol Hill. Then he did a PhD in economics at Harvard for
Zvi Griliches, the guru of R&AMP;D research, and moved to Harvard
Business School to teach venture capital with William Sahlman.
</P>
<P>
   Economists in the early 1990s were struggling to come to grips
with the mechanics of technological change. For many years, they
had simply assumed that it would take place at a fairly steady
rate, come what may; but new work had placed technology squarely
within the economic system.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to grips empirically with these ideas is not easy, as
Adam Jaffe of Brandeis University has written. Investigation
``requires confronting the reality that many of the relevant
activities...are carried out in institutions such as universities
and government laboratories, and may not be amenable to analysis
with the standard tools of the theory of the firm.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lerner teamed up with Boston University's Kortum with a view
to identifying and measuring some of the components of the ``black
box'' that previously had been labeled ``technological change.''
They started with the patent system, and quickly identified three
major theories of what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Friendly Court'' hypothesis held that the change in the
legal environment was crucial. A ``Fertile Technology'' hypothesis
saw a burgeoning technological revolution at the heart. A third
notion _ ``Regulatory Capture'' _ suspected that that the American
patent system had suddenly become far less friendly to foreign
inventors after 1982; hence a surge in ``home cooking'' by domestic
inventors.
</P>
<P>
   After the usual number of statistical and theoretical trials and
errors, Lerner and Kortum concluded that Friendly Court and
Regulatory Capture could be rejected, and that the Fertile
Technology hypothesis seemed to apply generally across the board.
It seemed therefore appropriate to credit ``changes in the
management of innovation'' for the surge in patents, including the
shift to more applied science.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what changes? Lerner himself has moved on to the next
likely suspect: venture capital and equity funding. He is among the
organizers (Brandeis' Jaffe and Yale's Jean Lanjouw are the others)
of a conference on patent policy and innovation in Santa Barbara.,
Calif., next month, sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic
Research. The idea is to bring together intellectual property
practitioners with well-equipped economic students of their work _
the better to gauge the effects of public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Sample paper titles: ``Do Patents Matter? Evidence After the
General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade''; ``The Determinants of
Patenting in the Computer and Semiconductor Industries''; ``Private
and Public Responses to the US Plant Variety Protection Act of
1970''; and ``Optical Patent Length and Breadth.''
</P>
<P>
   A great deal rides on the results of such new work. The great
gold rush into computers, telecommunications, biotech, and medicine
that commenced in earnest in the late 1970s may be winding down.
Soon the territories are going to have to settle down and become
the equivalent of law-governed states. Programs designed to
stimulate the settling of these frontiers will have to stand up to
a much higher level of scrutiny in the years to come.

 &HT;    Multiple breaking stories send networks scurrying to keep up
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Depending which station you watched at what time
Friday, you saw just about anything: the impeachment hearings from
Washington; the latest bombing news from Iraq; the press conference
of recovering Falcons coach Dan Reeves; ``The People's Court,''
with TV judge Ed Koch presiding.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you saw at least two of those things on the same
channel at the same time. And if you were speed-surfing through the
different channels, there were times when you could catch almost
all of those things at once.
</P>
<P>
   What's been called the ``split-screen presidency'' turned into
wildly splintered TV coverage on Friday. The unprecedented
impeachment debate was often met by networks and local stations
with the news equivalent of attention deficit disorder. One minute
the impeachment debate was ``something you have not seen in your
lifetime'' (ABC's Peter Jennings); the next minute it was replaced
by the soap opera ``All My Children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting news day. The whole event is surreal,''
said WAGA general manager Gene McHugh, whose Fox-owned station
carried ``The People's Court'' and ``The Sally Jessy Raphael Show''
(topic: family feuds during the holidays) before it aired part of
the impeachment hearings at 11 a.m., 90 minutes after they'd
started. WAGA then stuck with the hearings until early in the
afternoon, even after most of the other networks had left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to avoid the dreadfully dull, and basically if we
see something happening have the opportunity to go live,'' McHugh
added. ``We feel our role has modified in the last few years, to
reporter and summarizer. It's what our audience seems to prefer. My
role is to provide the community an option and not just turn the
camera on an event.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of a historical event such as Friday's impeachment
debate no longer is a clear-cut, gavel-to-gavel proposition for the
major broadcast networks and their affiliates. Either they have
their own cable entities, such as MSNBC or the Fox News Channel, to
give viewers continuous coverage, or they've ceded continuous
coverage to the all-news networks, such as CNN, which along with
C-SPAN and Atlanta public station WPBA, stuck with Congress
throughout most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's media environment, there are other places for
people to go who want to see all the details of that kind of
procedural stuff,'' WXIA general manager Bob Walker said of his
station's in-and-out coverage of the impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   WXIA, Atlanta's NBC affiliate, didn't take the network's news
feed until 40 minutes after it began _ 10 minutes after the
impeachment hearings started _ and instead aired the locally
produced kaffeeklatsch ``Peachtree Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said WXIA gave viewers the NBC feed as soon as the
articles of impeachment were read _ a purely procedural event _ and
the debate in Congress got under way.
</P>
<P>
   The station then left Congress again at 11 a.m. to cover the
press conference at Piedmont Hospital of Falcons coach Dan Reeves,
his first since heart surgery early this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make decisions based on whether (an event) is boring
or not,'' Walker said. ``We make it based on whether this
information is breaking news that the community needs to have right
now. We are in a business where people have a wide array of
opinions, and we just try to make the best decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the day of niche television for people who want to
tune in to pure political arguments all day from both sides,''
added WXIA news director Dave Roberts. ``When major developments
occur, such as the start of the attack in Iraq, NBC will use all of
its affiliates and cable outlets to bring the big story to
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It set up MSNBC following the Gulf War because of the
advantage CNN had.

NEW AUTOPSY SCHEDULED FOR SLAIN JOURNALIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARMINA DANINI  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mexican authorities will allow an FBI-hired medical examiner to
observe a second autopsy of an American journalist who was slain in
a mountainous region of western Mexico, a U.S. Embassy official
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An initial autopsy performed Thursday indicated that Philip
True, 50, had been strangled with a cord or neckerchief. True was
the Mexico City correspondent for the San Antonio Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy also indicated evidence that True had been sexually
brutalized.
</P>
<P>
   True's body was discovered Wednesday in a makeshift grave in a
canyon of the Sierra Madre Occidental. He had been missing for a
week after failing to return from a solo backpacking trip.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Emma Lew, a Miami-based forensic pathologist who does work
under contract with the FBI, was headed to Mexico City on Friday
and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lew, an assistant medical examiner with the Miami-Dade County
Medical Examiner's Office since 1991, will observe but not
participate in the autopsy, said a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy
in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican Attorney General's Office has requested that the
FBI send a pathologist to observe the autopsy,'' said the
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   David Najera, a spokesman for Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo,
said the president ordered a second autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will determine the date and time of death, the origin of
the wounds and the true cause of death,'' Najera said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Washington, a State Department spokeswoman said
the United States was following ``very closely'' the Mexican
government's investigation into the slaying of True.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen the news accounts indicating that Mr. True was
murdered, and have been informed by the coroner in Guadalajara that
the cause of death is strangulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we reserve making a judgment until the final report of
the Mexican authorities is made, we are very disturbed by what
appears to be the violent demise of a journalist who had undertaken
an effort to report on a little-covered region in Mexico,'' the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   True left Mexico City on Nov. 29 for a trek into the Sierra
Madre range in the states of Jalisco and Nayarit to report on the
life and customs of the Huichol Indians.
</P>
<P>
   He was reported missing by family and colleagues when he failed
to return home on Dec. 9. A Huichol Indian found True's body
Wednesday and led a search party to the location. By the time the
search team got there, the body was gone, but followed a trail of
feathers from True's sleeping bag some distance to a hastily dug
grave.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials praised the Mexican government for
allocating 250 men, five helicopters and four dogs to the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate further excellent cooperation as the Mexican
authorities continue their investigation,'' the State Department
spokeswoman said.

<P>
   Frank Weise strode confidently to the podium. As chief executive
of Cott Corp. since June, Weise had ambitious long-term goals that
he was eager to lay out for the audience of money managers and
analysts at a beverage industry conference in New York last month.
</P>
<P>
   But before he could utter a word, almost everyone left the room.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the exodus could be attributed to an earlier
speaker's question-and-answer session in an adjacent room, the
stampede was symbolic of Cott's fall from grace.
</P>
<P>
   The company was a Wall Street darling just a few years ago, with
its brazen challenges to Coca-Cola Co. and Pepsico Inc. and the
runaway growth of its cornerstone business, private-label soft
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   But a price war between Coke and Pepsi eroded Cott's main
advantage as the low-priced alternative, while internal problems
erupted in areas ranging from profitability to accounting practices
to customer service. And then Cott's founder, biggest shareholder
and guiding spirit, Gerald Pencer, died in February after a
yearlong struggle with brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Cott is still the fourth-biggest soft-drink company in the
world, behind Coke, Pepsi and Cadbury Schweppes, which makes Dr
Pepper and 7-Up. But the brand-name giants no longer worry about
Cott. ``We take all forms of competition seriously,'' said Larry
Jabbonsky, a Pepsi spokesman. ``But private label has not been
among our top concerns of late.''
</P>
<P>
   Cott was in disarray when Weise arrived. A veteran of Procter &AMP;
Gamble and Campbell Soup Co., Weise, 53, went directly into
turnaround mode despite the uncertainties facing the company.
``There are many times when I walk down dark hallways, and
sometimes you don't know what's going to happen when you open one
of those doors,'' he said. ``But you stick to your knitting. You
stick to your values.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beverage conference, Weise stuck to his speech, and later
noted proudly that many analysts returned to the room as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Weise was recruited by a search firm retained by the Pencer
family, and he sought the approval of Thomas Lee, the buyout
specialist who now controls much of the Pencer stake, before taking
the job _ probably a wise move, since Cott's board is heavy with
Lee appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Weise's first order of business, after hiring new executives for
key marketing and sales positions, was to tackle the customer
service problem. The record was pretty bad: Forty percent of
customers were getting orders filled incorrectly, late or both, the
company said. And it took a toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last summer, we couldn't ship all of the product we had, and
some customers delayed or canceled promotional activity because of
that,'' Weise said. Even though the company had brought efficient
new plants on line, he said, ``we'd never trained the people
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors were also annoyed with Cott when Weise arrived. To
ease their concerns, he did away with an unpopular accounting
practice _ amortizing slotting fees paid to supermarkets over the
life of contracts _ that many felt had the effect of exaggerating
earnings. He also switched to a Dec. 31 fiscal year and began
reporting results in U.S., not Canadian, dollars. (The company is
based in Toronto.)
</P>
<P>
   Cott's rapid growth had left it an unwieldy hodgepodge, with
more than 2,000 different brands and packages to track in the
United States, Britain and Canada. Now, Weise said, unprofitable
accounts will be pruned, sluggish businesses like a line of pet
foods will be sold, and capital expenditures are on hold. ``I'm
going to make these assets sweat,'' he said. To turn up the heat on
senior management, Weise requires them to invest in Cott shares,
and he says most of his own money is invested in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Improving efficiency and accountability is one thing; getting
the company to grow on the top line is another. ``The part that
remains a question mark is the growth,'' says Bill Pecoriello, a
beverage analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. Coke and Pepsi are
aggressively aiming at mass merchandisers like Wal-Mart Stores,
historically Cott's biggest outlets, Pecoriello said. And competing
private-label beverage makers regard Cott as a sitting duck.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have two categories of competition _ first Coke and Pepsi,
the national brands, and second, the regional private-label players
who are trying to cherry-pick Cott's customers,'' Pecoriello said.
``Cott has had such horrible customer service in recent years, and
that's what these regional companies try to use to steal the
customers away.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, which sells the Sam's line of soft drinks made by
Cott, is not about to drop the company, but the competition gives
Wal-Mart negotiating ammunition and may cut into Cott's profits,
analysts said. A Wal-Mart spokesman said only that the company is
``very pleased with our relationship with the Cott Corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   The third-quarter results, announced Friday, brought more bad
news for Cott: a net loss of $68.3 million, or $1.10 a share. Most
of that loss was because of restructuring, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to find signs of worry in the bright blue eyes and
dazzling smile of the courtly Weise. Enthusiasm may be his
strongest suit, though he also has a track record in innovation. At
Procter, where he was hired in 1967 fresh from a master's program
in business economics at Lehigh University, he oversaw the
development of Olestra, the fat substitute now used in potato chips
and other foods. Lured away in 1992 to become chief financial
officer of Campbell Soup, Weise helped acquire a salsa company and
pushed for expansion at the Pepperidge Farm and Godiva divisions.
</P>
<P>
   It still stings that Campbell passed him over for its top job
last year, but in his typically chipper manner, he said that
departing Campbell gave him more freedom ``to control my own
destiny.'' His last stop before Cott was a family-held maker of
private-label sanitary products; he helped sell the company before
he left.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In style, Weise could not be a greater contrast to his
flamboyant predecessor. Cott used to be the screaming eagle, or
maybe parakeet, of the soft-drink business, and Pencer was at the
forefront, declaring full-scale war on the market leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were poking a little finger in the eyes of some very big
bears,'' said John Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, a
newsletter. Cott never approached Coke or Pepsi in sales volume,
but its presence did force them to lower prices in supermarkets, a
major profit source for soft-drink companies, because stores used
the Cott threat to gain leverage in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Cott-Coke confrontation turned nasty in 1994 when M. Douglas
Ivester, now Coke's chairman and chief executive, gave a speech at
an industry meeting in which he scoffed at ``parasites'' in a
context that made clear he was referring to Cott. Pencer riposted
shortly afterward that he was happy to be a parasite, if that was
``someone who has the arrogance to offer a comparable product to
Coke's at a significantly lower cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Cott's approach is more conservative now. ``There is room for
both private-label and branded offerings,'' Weise told the November
beverage conference. And in an interview, he said: ``Coke and Pepsi
are getting sharper, but I'm not after Coke and Pepsi. We're
playing in a specialty segment, a $5 billion segment, and we have a
40 percent share of that. It's Coke, Pepsi and a third player, and
I want to be that third player.''
</P>
<P>
   What to make of this evolution? Cott has ``basically gone from
double-breasted to pinstriped,'' said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney who followed the company in the
days when Pencer was in charge. ``There's no more complicated
accounting, no more `We're going to beat Coke at their own game.'''

told the House of Representatives that 16,000 people in California
alone have been prosecuted for perjury, and 155 people are in
federal prisons now for the crime since Bill Clinton was first
elected president. He's right, according to federal figures. By

 &HT;    THE SCENE IN THE CAPITOL
 &HT;    1450 words
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ History, humbug!
</P>
<P>
   On this bright, cold December day, they had come from across
America and waited in line for an hour to watch the full House of
Representatives debate the impeachment of a president for only the
second time since the founding of the nation. They expected to hear
soaring rhetoric and sound reasoning. They envisioned a chamber of
statesmen advancing arguments for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   But in an era of split screens and sound bites, and on an
occasion in which only the bile was bipartisan, they listened a
while and then left disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't seem like it was the historic, solemn occasion that
one might think,'' said Jonathan Shazar, a senior at Valley Stream
Central High School on Long Island, N.Y. ``Both sides just want to
get in a shot at the other. It's more spiteful than serious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bitter _ nothing that I would consider an historic
debate,'' echoed Elisabeth Williams, 83, a docent at the Washington
state capital in Olympia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ho-hum. Everybody was inattentive, and the place was
three-fourths empty,'' complained David Janzen from Ontario,
Canada. ``Where was everyone? Why even have the debate? The only
people paying attention were in the visitors gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the day began with almost all the 435 House members
seated, but by midmorning, the House chamber was largely deserted.
Drama would have to await a vote on Saturday. A few floor leaders
from the Judiciary Committee directed the stream of speakers to the
podium, and Republican Rep. Ray LaHood, a parliamentary expert from
Peoria, Ill., wielded the gavel.
</P>
<P>
   As ever in the era of C-SPAN, representatives spoke more to the
TV cameras than to each other. On the floor, the sparse audience of
members read papers and chatted _ occasionally reaching a noise
level at which LaHood would direct them to take their conversations
to the cloakroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It upset me that (LaHood) had to repeatedly ask for order. I
thought 'how rude.' I teach eighth- and ninth-grade art, and the
people in my classroom pay more attention than the people in the
House of Representatives,'' said Barb Newman of Aberdeen, S.D. She
was in Washington to see the ornament she had made for the White
House Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all kinda had their own agenda,'' said Holli Hotchkiss of
Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the hundreds of tourists who took a turn at watching the
debate over articles of impeachment filed against President Clinton
had come to the nation's capital on other matters. But the chance
to witness history had drawn them to the marble corridors of the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll tell your grandchildren about this day,'' Janet Lee Hay
told her flock of gifted elementary school students from Sommerset,
Pa. Hay takes her students on a Christmas cultural outing every
year. They went to the White House on Friday morning and then
raised hands on whether to visit the FBI Building or the House
debate. The vote was split.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is history in the making,'' said Hay, explaining the
tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   The daylong bickering between Democrats and Republicans
disturbed many of the observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to see such partisan lines drawn in the sand,'' said
Bob Wolfe, a retired industrial arts teacher from Santa Cruz,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution itself is a document born of compromise,''
said his wife, Bonnie, a retired history teacher. ``Now to see such
a lack of any willingness to compromise is discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I taught this stuff passionately for 25 years,'' she said,
explaining that she intended to return Saturday to watch the
impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   In congressional offices, staffers munched on holiday goodies
while they divided their attention between work and the floor
debate occurring on their TV screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whichever side members are on, they view it as an historic
occurrence,'' said Christopher Ptomey, a legislative aide for Rep.
Mac Collins, R-Ga. ``Mac certainly does.''
</P>
<P>
   But Karleen Mahn, a staffer for Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., had
pragmatic concerns of moving into a new office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get any boxes unpacked'' with all attention directed
at the impeachment debate, she said. ``It's too bad they're up
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The representatives are rarely on Capitol Hill so close to
Christmas, of course, so unusual provisions had to be made.
</P>
<P>
   The Members Dining Room opened with a very limited menu: Stuffed
shells marinara for $7.25. Chicken breast teriyaki for $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   Providing for the comforts of his charges, Majority Whip Tom
DeLay of Texas provided pizza and salad to Republican members.
</P>
<P>
   On the Capitol grounds, the importance of the day was documented
by a forest of microphones, satellite dishes, lights and TV
cameras. But the mood was curiously subdued.
</P>
<P>
   A few demonstrators held placards, and an anti-impeachment
activist strung together letters on a long cord to form various
messages. ``No HIGH CRIME'' hung out for a while, then was replaced
by ``HATE &AMP; HYPOCRISY.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I doing this? Because our democracy is in danger,''
said Beverly Roberts, the message maker. ``They're going to totally
mess up the separation-of-powers doctrine. If I wasn't doing
something to try to stop it, I couldn't sleep at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the rhetoric did soar on the floor of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, it's your country. The president is our flag bearer,''
said Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stands out in front our people when the flag is flowing.
Catch the falling flag as we keep our appointment with history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The events of the last days sadden me,'' said Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. ``We are now at the height of a cycle of
the politics of negative attacks, character assassination, personal
smears of good people, decent people, worthy people. It's no wonder
to me and to you that the people of our country are cynical and
indifferent and apathetic about our government and about our
country. The politics of smear and slash and burn must end.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Turner, an English teacher from Long Island, savored such
phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish my students would speak like that,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   But more often, spectators left feeling let down at having heard
the same arguments that have been propounded on TV talk shows for
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty repetitive,'' said Jane Clemons, a Democratic
state representative in New Hampshire. ``We have a little more
enthusiasm in our debates. This subject has gotten so old that it
is probably hard for them to be enthusiastic about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., _ who has been leading the
anti-impeachment effort on the Judiciary Committee for months _
left the debate early to go home and nurse a cold, Scripps Howard
Newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little anti-climactic,'' he explained. ``The leading
actors have all been talking about it, and we all know the outcome.
This is not an emotional event for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they had heard the arguments before, the visitors in the
gallery listened intently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very clear there are intense differences between the
Democrats and Republicans,'' said Deborah Kraft, who took her two
children out of school in Andover, Conn., for this trip to
Washington. ``The Democrats were outraged and insulted that the
debate was even taking place while we are bombing Iraq. And I
understand their point very well about wanting censure to be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as a parent, I was listening more to the other side,'' she
continued. ``No one is above the law. No one can commit perjury
regardless of the subject. We teach our children not to lie. So how
can we make an exception to that?''
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Williams had heard it all before, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought up the same points over and over and over again.
Neither side is going to give up one inch,'' she said. ``I think
the Republicans have wasted the last six months over this. I've
been voting for 62 years, and November was the first time I voted
for nearly all Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   It all seemed a bit subdued to Sandra and Stephan Barden, who
are visiting from their home near London.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to Parliament, Sandra said, ``They're very
well-behaved.''
</P>
<P>
   While Congress is generally less raucous than Parliament, LaHood
had begun this day with a warning for members to mind their
manners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the personal conduct of the president is at issue,''
he cautioned, ``the rules prohibit members from engaging in
generally personal abusive language toward (him), and also engaging
in comparison to personal conduct of sitting members in either
house of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   That final admonition was aimed at anti-impeachment speakers who
might point out that Hyde and House Speaker Bob Livingston, R-La.,
-- two impeachment leaders -- had admitted to sexual affairs of
their own. It drew a chorus of boos from the Democrats.

NEW AUTOPSY SCHEDULED FOR SLAIN JOURNALIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Refiling to some points.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARMINA DANINI  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mexican authorities will allow an FBI-hired medical examiner to
observe a second autopsy of an American journalist who was slain in
a mountainous region of western Mexico, a U.S. Embassy official
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An initial autopsy performed Thursday indicated that Philip
True, 50, had been strangled with a cord or neckerchief. True was
the Mexico City correspondent for the San Antonio Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy also indicated that True had been sexually
brutalized.
</P>
<P>
   True's body was discovered Wednesday in a makeshift grave in a
canyon of the Sierra Madre Occidental. He had been missing for a
week after failing to return from a solo backpacking trip.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Emma Lew, a Miami-based forensic pathologist who does work
under contract with the FBI, was headed to Mexico City on Friday
and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lew, an assistant medical examiner with the Miami-Dade County
Medical Examiner's Office since 1991, will observe but not
participate in the autopsy, said a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy
in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican Attorney General's Office has requested that the
FBI send a pathologist to observe the autopsy,'' said the
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   David Najera, a spokesman for Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo,
said the president ordered a second autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will determine the date and time of death, the origin of
the wounds and the true cause of death,'' Najera said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Washington, a State Department spokeswoman said
the United States was following ``very closely'' the Mexican
government's investigation into the slaying of True.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen the news accounts indicating that Mr. True was
murdered, and have been informed by the coroner in Guadalajara that
the cause of death is strangulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we reserve making a judgment until the final report of
the Mexican authorities is made, we are very disturbed by what
appears to be the violent demise of a journalist who had undertaken
an effort to report on a little-covered region in Mexico,'' the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   True left Mexico City on Nov. 29 for a trek into the Sierra
Madre range in the states of Jalisco and Nayarit to report on the
life and customs of the Huichol Indians.
</P>
<P>
   He was reported missing by family and colleagues when he failed
to return home on Dec. 9. A Huichol Indian found True's body
Wednesday and led a search party to the location. By the time the
search team got there, the body was gone, but followed a trail of
feathers from True's sleeping bag some distance to a hastily dug
grave.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials praised the Mexican government for
allocating 250 men, five helicopters and four dogs to the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate further excellent cooperation as the Mexican
authorities continue their investigation,'' the State Department
spokeswoman said.

 &HT;    Chaplains tend to their flocks' holiday, deployment needs
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For military chaplains, the day-to-day duties of
ministry are intensified in times of action. Some chaplains are
with troops in the Persian Gulf. Others are with military families
back in the States. Still more are with military personnel who are
awaiting a possible call to duty.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield near Savannah, Ga.,
holiday activities are in full swing _ along with preparations for
possible deployment to the Persian Gulf for action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   As Jews continue celebrating Hanukkah, the eight-day festival of
lights, Chaplain Avrohom Horovitz, an Orthodox rabbi, is conducting
two services a day. A Muslim congregation on the base is preparing
to celebrate Ramadan, a monthlong observance of fasting and prayer,
under the leadership of a soldier who is also a lay religious
leader. And Christians, under dozens of chaplains, are getting
ready for Christmas and performances of Handel's ``Messiah'' on
Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplain (Col.) William Morrison, installation staff chaplain at
Ft. Stewart-Hunter, said he sees little difference in chaplains'
responsibility as a result of military activity in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldiers are always deployed, so as chaplains we have to be
prepared to provide ministry to family members as well as soldiers
who are not deployed to make the holidays as happy and meaningful
as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the several Southern Baptist chaplains already in the
Gulf, ``I'm finding there's high morale,'' said Chaplain Bob
Vickers, a retired colonel who serves as director of chaplaincy for
the Southern Baptist Convention. ``Our chaplains are feeling very
good about the preparation and the quality of the soldiers, the
sailors, the Marines and the airmen who are with them. I think they
sense that they're on a very important mission and they're doing
what needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   For chaplains actually in the Gulf, Vickers said, the primary
focus is only helping the military personnel stay focused on their
duties. Chaplains are also called upon to help military people
under stress deal with philosophical issues, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of questions occur at times like this _ What if I'm
injured? What if it's worse than that? There are a lot of questions
about ultimate things.''
</P>
<P>
   Young people seeing actual military action, perhaps for the
first time, may also have moral and ethical concerns about people
who may be injured or killed as a result of their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes we have a tendency to think we have bred
war-mongers,'' he said. ``But it's incredible the kind of
compassion service persons have for people on the receiving end.
You kind of see yourself in that. They're doing what they must do,
but they're always hoping there's not personnel there, or at least
not civilian personnel. The face of the enemy is constantly in the
mind of the combattant.''
</P>
<P>
   As they deal with the everyday issues of life, intensified by
danger and separation from family, some military personnel become
more interested in religion.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplain Charles McMillan, a retired Army chaplain and director
of Presbyterian Council for Chaplains and Military Personnel, said
he has been in touch via e-mail with some of his denomination's
chaplains aboard ships in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have noted an increase in attendance at religious
functions,'' he said.

AFTER THE GOLD RUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 20, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Universities move science from the laboratory to the
marketplace, supporting 250,000 jobs and contributing $30 billion
to the economy. Academic research improves the quality of life and
creates jobs.'' It was under that headline that the Association of
University Technology Managers last week released the results of
its annual survey.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to disagree, in general, with that?
</P>
<P>
   The data from its survey of the licensing activities of 175
member institutions are always interesting. But beyond the
commonplace that universities and hospitals are nurseries for for
new science that has practical applications, there is relatively
little in the report to support the authors' choice of verb.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to say it is the universities that are doing the
``moving?''
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly 20 years since the United States declared a
pell-mell gold rush on the intellectual property frontier. The time
has come to begin toting up the results. The vigorous association,
composed of lawyers, scientists, and other professional
intellectual property managers within universities, is one of the
indisputable fruits of the scramble. A lot of rich PhDs are
another.
</P>
<P>
   What else have we got to show for it?
</P>
<P>
   University and hospital technology managers date their modern
charter to 1980, when Congress passed a law directing them and
small businesses for the first time to patent and license
inventions developed under federally funded research programs. This
was the Bayh-Dole Act, sponsored by Senators Birch Bayh (D-Ind.)
and Bob Dole (R-Kan.); before it, technology transfer had happened
_ but haphazardly and lackadaisically.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Congress rationalized the patent procedure for
the first time in in 150 years, establishing a specialized
appellate court to hear patent cases, the Court of Appeals of the
Federal Circuit. Previously, patent cases had been heard in each
district in quite inconsistent ways. The new court quickly
strengthened patent protection.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, patenting surged in the United States. Having
fluctuated at a level of around 60,000 a year from 1945 until 1980,
patents by American inventors doubled in the 15 years after 1982.
Neither Japan, France, Germany, nor the United Kingdom display a
pattern since the mid-1980s anything like that. The European trends
remained flat; the steady Japanese increase that had been going on
since the 1950s leveled off in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the frontier of knowledge expanded
dramatically. The personal computer was invented. The Internet
boomed. The biotech revolution unfolded. And the health care system
underwent a dramatic transformation. And of course the US economy
grew vigorously, adding jobs and sending asset prices to record
levels.
</P>
<P>
   So what caused what? Did a stronger protection of intellectual
property rights precipitate a technological revolution? Or vice
versa? How well have the university middlemen managed their stream
of deals? What credit belongs to the shrewd money managers who,
starting in Boston and California in the years after World War II,
learned how to breath life into the markets for new technologies?
Only in the last few years have economists begun to measure and
assess the gold rush with a view to answering these questions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting attempts to appear is a paper by
Josh Lerner and Sam Kortum that asks, ``What's Behind the Recent
Surge in Patenting?'' Because Lerner is representative of a new
approach in the nation's leading business schools _ until recently,
they were citadels of self-delight _ it is worth briefly
considering the arc of his career.
</P>
<P>
   A 1982 graduate of Yale, he worked for several years in
Washington on issues in technological innovation and public policy
_ at the Brookings Institution, for a public-private partnership,
and on Capitol Hill. Then he did a PhD in economics at Harvard for
Zvi Griliches, the guru of R&AMP;D research, and moved to Harvard
Business School to teach venture capital with William Sahlman.
</P>
<P>
   Economists in the early 1990s were struggling to come to grips
with the mechanics of technological change. For many years, they
had simply assumed that it would take place at a fairly steady
rate, come what may; but new work had placed technology squarely
within the economic system.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to grips empirically with these ideas is not easy, as
Adam Jaffe of Brandeis University has written. Investigation
``requires confronting the reality that many of the relevant
activities...are carried out in institutions such as universities
and government laboratories, and may not be amenable to analysis
with the standard tools of the theory of the firm.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lerner teamed up with Boston University's Kortum with a view
to identifying and measuring some of the components of the ``black
box'' that previously had been labeled ``technological change.''
They started with the patent system, and quickly identified three
major theories of what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Friendly Court'' hypothesis held that the change in the
legal environment was crucial. A ``Fertile Technology'' hypothesis
saw a burgeoning technological revolution at the heart. A third
notion _ ``Regulatory Capture'' _ suspected that that the American
patent system had suddenly become far less friendly to foreign
inventors after 1982; hence a surge in ``home cooking'' by domestic
inventors.
</P>
<P>
   After the usual number of statistical and theoretical trials and
errors, Lerner and Kortum concluded that Friendly Court and
Regulatory Capture could be rejected, and that the Fertile
Technology hypothesis seemed to apply generally across the board.
It seemed therefore appropriate to credit ``changes in the
management of innovation'' for the surge in patents, including the
shift to more applied science.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what changes? Lerner himself has moved on to the next
likely suspect: venture capital and equity funding. He is among the
organizers (Brandeis' Jaffe and Yale's Jean Lanjouw are the others)
of a conference on patent policy and innovation in Santa Barbara.,
Calif., next month, sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic
Research. The idea is to bring together intellectual property
practitioners with well-equipped economic students of their work _
the better to gauge the effects of public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Sample paper titles: ``Do Patents Matter? Evidence After the
General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade''; ``The Determinants of
Patenting in the Computer and Semiconductor Industries''; ``Private
and Public Responses to the US Plant Variety Protection Act of
1970''; and ``Optical Patent Length and Breadth.''

   A great deal rides on the results of such new work. The great
gold rush into computers, telecommunications, biotech, and medicine
that commenced in earnest in the late 1970s may be winding down.
Soon the territories are going to have to settle down and become
the equivalent of law-governed states. Programs designed to
stimulate the settling of these frontiers will have to stand up to
a much higher level of scrutiny in the years to come.

BOSSES SHOULD BEWARE WHEN BENDING THE TRUTH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Lying has consequences. Dire ones.
</P>
<P>
   That became all too clear last week, as the president, accused
of swearing to a lie, found his credibility shattered and his every
move and motive suspect.
</P>
<P>
   What applies to political leaders applies equally to business
leaders. When Bill Gates appears to dance around the truth under
oath in the Microsoft antitrust trial, his credibility, too, takes
blows.
</P>
<P>
   But actions of admired leaders like Gates and Clinton can do
damage far beyond their own reputations. When a culture of lying
with impunity is perceived to have taken hold at the top, it bodes
ill for behavior in the rest of an organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there's this raging ambiguity and there's no
accountability, people will start generating more and more lax
responses to morally ambiguous situations,'' said Steven Berglas, a
management consultant and a clinical psychologist at the Harvard
Medical School. ``Most people will start lowering standards for
what's tolerable. And that manifests itself in people going along
with what's being reinforced. People are going to lie for
expediency.''
</P>
<P>
   Now we are not talking here about a failure to tell every bit of
the truth every waking minute, a feat that no mortal manages.
Success in modern life is next to impossible without the
maneuvering room afforded by a bit of calculated vagueness here and
a strategically bitten tongue there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not telling the full truth is different from outright lying,''
said Joseph L. Badaracco Jr., professor of business ethics at the
Harvard Business School and author of ``Defining Moments: When
Managers Must Choose Between Right and Right'' (Harvard Business
School Press, 1997). ``If you're going to run a big company or run
the country, you can't put all your cards on the table; that's
simply naive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is a series of different games,'' he continued, ``and you
sort of play by the rules'' when it comes to levels of candor in
different circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Even fresh-faced business school students appear to distinguish
between posturing and outright lying. In a recent survey at Ohio
State and Harvard, MBA students were asked to rate from 1 (bad) to
7 (good) the ethical appropriateness of various negotiating
tactics. The students gave a rating of 5.84 to ``making an opening
demand that is far greater than what one really hopes to settle
for.''
</P>
<P>
   But they gave a much lower score, 1.99, to ``intentionally
misrepresenting factual information to your opponent in order to
support your negotiating arguments or position.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also times when telling the whole truth is simply
cruel, as when a doctor can choose whether to tell a dying patient
in clinical detail how his health will decay. ``There's great room
for discretion, for knowing when not to speak,'' said Sissela Bok,
author of ``Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private Life''
(Vintage Books, 1989).
</P>
<P>
   But discretion was not the better part of Gates' or Clinton's
valor. Spinning or denying uncomfortable facts and professing not
to understand the definitions of simple English words _ Gates
wondered what ``concerned'' meant, and Clinton famously construed
``is'' _ were more their pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a managerial point of view, you should have a strong
prejudice toward being clear, direct and honest,'' because lying
``becomes a bad habit,'' Badaracco said. ``You might get caught.
You set a bad example. The people who work with you probably aren't
dumb; they'll copy what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Can either Clinton or Gates expect the whole truth from the
people who work for them? A leadership policy of ``Do as I say, not
as I do'' cuts no ethical ice. And it probably wouldn't work
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Once a leader blurs rules about what is acceptable _ say, during
sworn testimony on national TV _ then no one knows the boundaries
any more. Many in the rank and file will conclude that they are
free to, and perhaps ought to, emulate the boss.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, hubris often blinds powerful leaders and their followers
to the seriousness of the damage. In the Clinton case, politicians
fret most about the power calculus of impeachment and the
presidency; in the Microsoft case, executives worry most about
competition, innovation and monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't there something much more important to fear _ that
each sworn lie by an admired leader will make us one measure more a
nation of liars?
</P>

DEBATE SHARES AIR TIME WITH IRAQ, NETWORK COMMENTATORS AND SOAP
OPERAS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CARYN JAMES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The television screen showed the House of Representatives more
than three-quarters empty. And if Congress wasn't watching, why
should we? The House floor was meant to be the site of
history-making drama, but the action Friday was all off-stage. It
was definitely on camera, though, captured in the talk of reporters
and commentators who helped shape the political spin and
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The day and the television coverage had started with a far
different tone, dramatic and anachronistic in its aura of ceremony
and historical import. Paul Hays, the house reading clerk, read the
four articles of impeachment against President Clinton. A balding,
nondescript man, he looked like Middle America, an odd touch of
realism in the midst of chiseled television correspondents and
politicians with conspicuous hair weaves.
</P>
<P>
   The weight of the impeachment process seemed to sink in further
each time he repeated the words ending each article: ``William
Jefferson Clinton has undermined the integrity of his office, has
brought disrepute on the presidency, has betrayed his trust as
president.'' The portentousness did not come exclusively from the
content; every network and cable channel focused on this reading
without commentary, creating the rare, unanimous sense that this
was truly a moment of history.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, there was a passionate argument on the floor, as Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the Judiciary Committee chairman, spoke in
favor of impeachment and Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the minority
leader, objected to having the debate during the U.S. military
attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But as the speeches became familiar echoes of the Judiciary
Committee hearings, the networks cut away to talking heads. In the
most lightweight and ludicrous instance, while most network cameras
were still focused on the House floor, NBC went to a Maria Shriver
interview with Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif., whose on-screen
identifications included ``Elected in 1998'' and ``Widow of Rep.
Sonny Bono.'' In this celebrity-driven moment, as Ms. Bono repeated
without analysis the often-heard Republican line that the
impeachment was about ``the rule of law,'' it seemed as if Vanity
Fair magazine were setting the tone for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The serious news came with updates from Baghdad, as these two
stories continued to veer erratically in and out of each others'
paths. The networks carried a briefing by Defense Secretary William
Cohen. The cable channels (and, briefly, NBC) cut away from
Congress to cover a news conference by Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime
minister of Iraq. But, when word came that the debate would
continue until 10 p.m., with the impeachment vote scheduled for
Saturday, the networks returned to their soap operas. (NBC and CBS
offered local stations a choice of network news coverage or
entertainment shows.)
</P>
<P>
   There was every reason to leave. The votes had been counted if
not cast. As Tom Brokaw said on NBC, in words often echoed through
the day, ``Barring an unforeseen miracle on behalf of the
president, he will be impeached by noon tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable channels dutifully dipped in and out of the debate all
day. But when Judy Woodruff of CNN looked at the nearly-empty House
floor and described ``this building, where all the action is
today,'' it sounded like a rote lesson from an outdated history
book. The action was clearly elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   George Stephanopoulos offered a more sophisticated sense of the
battle that was actually taking place. As he had pointed out the
previous day on ABC, the Democrats knew the impeachment fight was
lost; it was now a matter of who would win the spin.
</P>
<P>
   That made a briefing by White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart
at least as relevant as what was happening in the House. Lockhart
said Republicans were ``dumbing down impeachment'' and using a
``cynical political strategy'' in first playing down the importance
of impeachment and then using an impeachment vote to call for
Clinton's resignation. Analyzing that news conference on MSNBC,
Brian Williams said, ``Notice the talking point: dumbing down
impeachment. It's been handed to the Democrats; you will hear it
all day.'' (He was right; the term had already been heard in the
House debate.) Don't think for a second that dissecting a press
conference is trivial or merely time-filling. It is crucially
important in this political equivalent of a chess game, with
Republicans and Democrats looking several moves ahead to a possible
trial in the Senate, and floating every idea on television.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the cable channels went to Baghdad every time an air
raid warning sounded. In one false alarm, what seemed to be a new
bombing attack turned out to be a cannon set off to announce that
Ramadan would begin at dawn. Though the pictures from Iraq
continued to be startling, a fresher turn in the coverage came
after the first attack Wednesday. In daylight, reporters have been
making it clear how short a leash they are on, being led to see the
damage the Iraqis want to show, unable to wander freely to verify
damage or deaths independently.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, reporters and commentators were looking ahead to the
statement promised from the president after the impeachment vote,
and beyond that to a Senate trial or (possibly floating ideas for
both sides) a censure deal.
</P>
<P>
   And, looking at the empty House floor, some commentators
speculated that the representatives and the public were following
the debate on television. There was no reason to think they were,
or that they should, when television's talking heads were so
clearly the ones moving this process along.

PATRIOTS MOVE SHOULD BE BLOCKED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no way the Patriots should be allowed to move to
Hartford, and someone of stature in Massachusetts should take a
lawsuit to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   If the National Football League owners vote in favor of such a
move, they will be in violation of their own guidelines, set down
by the late commissioner Pete Rozelle, who first stated them under
oath in court testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The top two guidelines as laid down by Rozelle in court
basically said:
</P>
<P>
   (1) If the fans in a community are supporting a team, the league
would not vote approval to move. Since Bob Kraft has owned the
team, the Patriots have not played to an empty seat in five years.
</P>
<P>
   (2) If the business community is supporting the team, the league
should not permit a move. The most recent audit of the NFL,
completed in the last two weeks, shows that the Patriots are one of
the top revenue-producing teams in the league, certainly in the top
10 overall and second in stadium revenue among 30 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the fans who buy the tickets and the local businesses
_ radio, television, advertising, etc. _ have unquestionably given
the Patriots tremendous support.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what Rozelle said under oath in the case against the
Oakland Raiders when the league tried to stop Al Davis from moving
the team to Los Angeles in 1982-83:
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the NFL has some `moral' responsibility to
geographical areas which loyally supported exisitng franchises.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the Raiders: ``They were the fifth highest in the
league in revenue, I think, so that is clear indication they were
getting strong support from the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about Raider fans: ``With the support they have given,
we cannot bail out on them. We feel that we are interlocked with
them and that they are deserving of our support.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the city of Oakland building a stadium for the
Raiders: ``(The fans) were told that if they supported the team,
they would have the team forever. I do not believe that any NFL
team ought to transfer to a different city unless there are good
reasons for making such transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   The court in Los Angeles allowed the Raiders to move and told
the NFL it did so basically because the NFL had no guidelines for
such a situation, so its attempt to stop the Raiders was arbitrary.
This prompted Rozelle to set up formal guidelines, and he didn't
take long to enforce them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Leonard Tose, then the owner of the Philadelphia
Eagles, announced abruptly late in the season that he was going to
move his team to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Rozelle immediately called a league meeting and told Tose he
wouldn't allow the move because the fans and the city of
Philadelphia had supported the Eagles. Tose backed down, even
though he left a very lucrative deal on the table in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   We have heard in the last month or so, since the Patriots'
potential move became public, that Hartford is in the ``region.'' I
wrote at the time that this was a new word in the NFL lexicon. I
don't find any ``regions'' in the NFL constitution, but there is
the word ``territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is what the league constitution says about territorial
rights:
</P>
<P>
   (4.1) Home Territory Defined: ``Home Territory'' with respect to
any club means the city in which such club is located, and or which
it holds a franchise and plays its home games, and includes the
surrounding territory to the ``extent'' of 75 miles in every
direction from the exterior corporate limits of such city.''
</P>
<P>
   This franchise was granted to Boston and belongs to Boston.
Boston is 100 miles from Hartford. Hartford is not in Boston's
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Boston has played an important role in NFL history. In 1966, the
AFL, of which the Patriots were a charter member, and the NFL
agreed to merge. However, that merger could not go through unless
approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the merger ran into trouble in Washington. At that
time, the late, great John W. McCormack of South Boston was the
Speaker of the House, one of the most powerful politicians in the
land.
</P>
<P>
   Rozelle asked the late Bill Sullivan, then the owner of the
Patriots, to go to McCormack for help. There were also threats that
if the Patriots could not find a permanent place to play, they
would move. McCormack reportedly told Sullivan two things: Tell
Rozelle to grant the next expansion franchise to New Orleans
because Hale Boggs of Louisiana would hold up the merger until it
did so; and promise that the Patriots would not leave the Boston
area. That deal was made, and McCormack shepherded the legislation
to passage, setting the stage for the modern NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Even though current owner Bob Kraft has made a deal with
Connecticut to move the Patriots to Hartford, it is not a deal
until the 31 NFL owners vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way they should approve it because it would break
their own rules, and if they do, the state of Massachusetts should
sue for damages. Kraft and his son Jonathan are on the record
numerous times saying that the state would lose more than $10
million in direct revenue, and much more than that in indirect
revenue, if the team left.
</P>
<P>
   The state should go after them for all that money, times 30, the
number of years on the Patriots' lease in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   When the Colts left Baltimore and headed to Indianapolis, they
were playing to an average of 35,000 fans in a 60,000-seat stadium.
When the Cardinals left St. Louis for Arizona, there were 25,000
empty seats per game; ditto when the Rams left Anaheim for St.
Louis. These moves preceded the most controversial move of all,
that of the legendary Browns from Cleveland to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   America went bonkers. The league was so embarrassed that it made
the team leave behind the name and all logos and markings of the
Browns, considered synonymous with Cleveland. It also promised
Cleveland a new team, which will begin play in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the rub. Cleveland played to an average of 15,000 empty
seats a game the last few years. The Browns' season ticket base had
fallen under 40,000. The present Patriot season ticket base is
57,000, and Jonathan Kraft said recently the team has a waiting
list of 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of their stay, in no way did the city of
Cleveland offer the Browns the corporate support the Patriots enjoy
in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   The facts are there. No team in history has moved when it has
been supported the way the Patriots have been for the last five
years. It will be a disgrace and total hypocrisy on the part of the
NFL to do so. Get the lawyers.
</P>
<P>

   Mo Vaughn has hit .284 lifetime in Anaheim (40 for 141), with
eight home runs. He has batted .327 at Fenway Park . . . Nice
gesture. Referee Bob McElwee's crew, in Boston to work Sunday's San
Francisco-Patriots game, will throw a party for some youngsters at
Children's Hospital Saturday. Pizza, cake, and gifts from the NFL
will be on the menu, and the crew will even wear the tops of their
uniforms to give the youngsters a better idea of what they do . . .
If the Patriots do wind up in Hartford with their present
sweetheart of all sweetheart deals, BankBoston will make a score
with them. Reportedly, the bank, which funded the Krafts' purchase
of the team, has an agreement giving it 10 percent of the value of
the team above what the Krafts paid for it. The Krafts paid $160
million. Estimates are that in Hartford, the money-making machine
will be worth $500 million, so the bank's end of the deal will
appreciate by about $35 million on paper, and it will collect when
the team is sold.

   We have said all along that it doesn't make any difference how
much money you spend in the NFL if you don't pick the right players
in the draft or sign the right ones in free agency. Case in point:
the spending in the league for this season.

THIS TRUE GM CAR GUY IS A WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Del., Tenn., Canada)   (For release Sunday, Dec. 20)  
(lb) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Ever since General Motors was formed through a series
of mergers early in this century, executives have often risen to
the top without ever managing a factory, relying instead on
personal friendships commonly made while serving in the company's
powerful treasury office in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now the world's largest automaker is about to put a true car guy
in charge of its Saturn division _ only the car guy is a woman,
Cynthia Mary Trudell. On Jan. 1, she will become the first woman to
run a car division for a U.S. or foreign automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Trudell has spent most of the last 19 years in factories,
mainly transmission and engine factories and a foundry, some of the
grittiest, dirtiest, most macho and most dangerous workplaces in
the auto industry. Along the way, she has accumulated the kind of
experience that GM has concluded it needs in senior executives, but
has seldom found among its men.
</P>
<P>
   At a company that has lost more sales and profits from recent
strikes than Microsoft Corp. sells or earns in a year, Ms. Trudell
has won a reputation for working closely and harmoniously with
factory union leaders in the United States, Canada and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   At a manufacturer perceived as having out-of-touch factory
bureaucracies, Ms. Trudell has worked her way up through
engineering jobs on factory floors. And at an automaker that
invented the full-size sport utility vehicle only to lose much of
the highly profitable market to Ford Motor Co., Ms. Trudell has
spent the last year and a half as president of a GM subsidiary in
England that manufactures and markets sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Few auto analysts have met Ms. Trudell, but her track record has
impressed them. ``She's obviously got a true love for the industry,
which is rare to find in anybody,'' said Wesley Brown, an analyst
at Nextrend Inc., an automotive consulting firm in Thousand Oaks,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   While senior European and Japanese auto executives tend to be
engineers, top U.S. executives these days usually have master's
degrees in business administration. Ms. Trudell, who is 45, took a
very different route into the industry.
</P>
<P>
   She did a doctorate in physical chemistry at the University of
Windsor in Ontario, only to decide after a year and a half in a
postdoctoral fellowship that she did not want to spend her life in
research. As the daughter of a new-car salesman in Saint John, New
Brunswick, she decided to try auto manufacturing instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked a lot with my Dad in the dealership and I grew to
love cars,'' she said in a telephone interview on Friday from her
current office in Luton, England, 35 miles northwest of London.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stint as a Ford chemical-process engineer, Ms.
Trudell worked from 1981 to 1990 in two GM transmission factories,
first in Windsor and then in Ypsilanti, Mich. She decided to
specialize in engines and transmissions partly because their sheer
complexity appealed to her intellectual curiosity and partly
because, she said, ``they're the heart and soul of the car.''
</P>
<P>
   An early job in Windsor consisted of overseeing 150 workers who
were machining transmission gears _ a job she chose because she
wanted to learn manufacturing from the ground up. As a prank, the
factory's manufacturing superintendent painted her new office
entirely in pink.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that after she laughed about it and set to work
without complaint, someone had the office repainted a week later in
a shade somewhere between beige and peach. She keeps a can of pink
paint in her office as a memento, she said, adding that graduate
work in chemistry had prepared her for often being the only woman
in a group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud and secure in my gender, but I've never thought
it to be a big deal,'' she said.

   While Ms. Trudell describes her time in the transmission
factories as ``great years,'' fellow auto executives shake their
heads at the idea. ``I'm just having trouble with the thought of
spending nine years in a transmission factory,'' said Donald
Hudler, a longtime sales executive who is Saturn's current chairman
and president. ``I suspect it would be more of a challenge for a
woman than for a man, but I suspect in the next nine years it will
be easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudler will retire from GM on Jan. 1, when Ms. Trudell will
succeed him in both Saturn jobs. Hudler, 64, will become the chief
executive of a new company that Saturn is setting up to own some of
its dealerships.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After her years in the transmission factories, Ms. Trudell did
engine research for nearly two years, spent three months in an
executive course at Harvard Business School, served as site manager
of an engine factory and foundry in Ontario and then ran an
assembly plant in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   At all these factories, her knowledge of chemistry allowed her
to understand metal castings, plastic-molding machinery and other
industrial processes, and to seek solutions before things broke
down.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Trudell, who is married to a high school teacher of math and
physics and has two children, also developed a strong, early
interest in labor relations, regularly seeking the advice of local
union leaders. ``They bring a perspective that a lot of times I
never would have thought about, and it makes a difference in
execution,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Trudell won admiration within GM for keeping the peace with
no fewer than five unions at the sport utility vehicle factory in
England. The factory has no executive dining rooms, designated
parking places or other perks for managers.
</P>
<P>
   So the chance to work at Saturn, with its partnership of labor
and management in Spring Hill, Tenn., has delighted her. ``It's a
dream come true,'' she said.

   MANAMA, Bahrain _ More than half of the U.S. strike aircraft at
ground bases in the Persian Gulf region have been kept out of the
attack on Iraq because of objections from Saudi Arabia, Western
military officers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100 fighters and bombers at bases in the region, only
those in Kuwait and Oman had joined in the campaign by Friday
evening, the Western officers said. They include four B-1 bombers
in Oman, the first time those advanced aircraft have joined in a
combat operation.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the force, about 60 F-16 and F-15 fighters, have
been effectively grounded in Saudi Arabia, which has repeatedly
refused to permit attacks against Baghdad to be launched from its
soil. Saudi Arabia was the main base of U.S. operations against
Iraq during the 1991 war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not asked the Saudis for permission to use aircraft
from their bases,'' Capt. Michael Shavers, an Air Force spokesman,
said by telephone from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. That is because the
answer would have been no, Western officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The episode has underscored the limitations on U.S. military
operations in the region, where anger over the U.S.-led attack was
vented in the verbal bombardment printed in many newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Arab Emirates, the daily al-Khaleef called the air
strikes an act of ``blatant aggression,'' and urged other to follow
the Emirates in demanding an immediate end to the attack. ``Letting
it pass without a stand means that the Arabs have become a whipping
boy for the American empire,'' the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 13 months, U.S. officials including Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen have
paid repeated visits to Saudi Arabia to discuss Iraq and its
refusal to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   But the Saudis have been so clear in their opposition to
permitting Saudi-based planes to attack Iraq that the U.S.
emissaries stopped asking permission months ago. As recently as
last month, the defense minister, Prince Sultan, reiterated the
Saudi view. The Saudis say little publicly to explain their
reasoning, and Saudi officials have made no public comment about
the raids. While the Saudis were determined to oust Iraq from
Kuwait, they apparently are sensitive about punishing a nation when
there is no territory in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have sought to gloss over the dispute, saying
they are confident that Saudi Arabia, a key ally, would provide any
support needed by the United States. In fact, Saudi Arabia has
allowed KC-130 refueling aircraft based in the kingdom to service
other strike aircraft planes on their way to and from Iraq, Western
military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is the purpose of having all that firepower there if it
can't be used?'' once Western military official said, reflecting
military complaining that the United States spends heavily to
protect the Saudis, but it is deprived of full access to that
weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi objections have made the United States rely on
aircraft on the Navy carrier Enterprise that is less-advanced
militarily. It is being used to back up what has been primarily a
cruise-missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy dependence on cruise missiles reflects the advantages
of those weapons, Western officers said. Hundreds of those missiles
were launched in the first two nights of the attack, both from Navy
vessels in the Gulf and from about 15 B-52 bombers based on the
British island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike aircraft, the missiles are unmanned, and so their use
greatly minimizes the risk of U.S. casualties.
</P>
<P>
   But even on the first night of the attack, F-14 and F-18 fighter
aircraft were launched from the Enterprise at the rate of one a
minute, officers on board the Navy vessel have said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that those aircraft-together with some two dozen F-16
and A-10 fighters from Kuwait and that the four B-1s from Oman have
been used to reinforce the cruise missile attacks have made clear
that U.S. military planners believe that unmanned strikes alone are
not sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Citing what they called ``host-nation sensitivities,'' Capt.
Shavers and officers at the U.S. Central Command declined to
provide a precise breakdown of where U.S. warplanes in the region
are based. But other Western officers said they understood that
Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia where the only Gulf countries where
U.S. fighters and bombers are currently based.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia is not the only American ally bordering Iraq whose
reluctance has limited U.S. options. Turkey, to Iraq's immediate
north, has also signaled reservations about attacks on Iraq, and
none of the several dozen U.S. fighter planes has joined in the
current air campaign.

WORLDWIDE ARAB CYNICISM OVER BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT CITY _ A government official was reiterating his
country's mantra of cautious support for the US attack on Iraq
Friday when, abruptly, he ended the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, of
course,'' he snapped. ``It's about saving your president; everyone
seems to realize this except Americans. Even those with great
reason to distrust Saddam Hussein find it hard to countenance this
aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Middle East and around the world, Arabs and
Moslems displayed similar cynicism, and frequently rage, toward the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Across the West Bank, though Palestinian authorities tried to
contain the protests, crowds bellowed anti-American and pro-Iraqi
slogans. In Manger Square in Bethlehem, where President Clinton was
greeted almost as a hero a few days ago, demonstrators chanted,
``Saddam, Saddam, our beloved'' and ``Death to America, death to
Clinton, death to Britain!''
</P>
<P>
   Other Arabs and Moslems demonstrated from the Netherlands to
Hong Kong. In Malaysia, seldom infected by the virulent
anti-Americanism commonplace in other Islamic nations, protesters
outside the US Embassy in Kuala Lumpur hoisted placards that read:
``US is ruled by Lust and Lies'' and ``Iraq People shouldn't have
to pay for Clinton's Zippergate.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Kuwait, which provides a crucial base for allied
fighter-bombers and for thousands of American troops, cynicism
toward US policy is rampant, though inhabitants of the oil-rich
emirate still despise and fear the Iraqi dictator next door.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of those who lambasted the US-British assault Friday
made it clear that they do not believe Hussein and his government
are faultless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We condemn this attack which is part of crimes committed by
America and England against the Islamic world,'' a senior cleric in
Iran, Ayatollah Mohammed Emami Kashani, said in a sermon at Friday
prayers. ``We hope God will rid the Islamic nation of these
arrogant oppressors.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Emami Kashani, a spokesman for one of the
nation's senior clerical organizations, told worshippers at Tehran
University: ``Of course Iraq's government is also responsible and
is condemned. Why does it not cooperate with the United Nations and
carry out United Nations resolutions?''
</P>
<P>
   Across Pakistan, militant Moslems shouted ``Death to America''
during a series of small but angry protests. And in The Hague,
Dutch police charged Iraqi demonstrators with batons when some
started throwing rocks outside the US Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   While there were protests across the West Bank and Gaza Friday,
Palestinian authorities seemed intent on preventing a repeat of the
widespread pro-Hussein demonstrations that captured worldwide
attentiond during the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the denunciations of the United States, and especially of
Clinton, were striking in light of the warm reception he received
from Palestinians just days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very strange for me that we've just been waving the
American flag and I saw the same flag burned today,'' Nasri Abu
Jheish, 28, one of the demonstrators in the West Bank community of
Nablus, told journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The anger was deepened by the coincidence of the Israeli
government's abrupt suspension of an American-brokered deal that
would require the Jewish state to relinquish control of additional
territory to the Palestinians in return for security.
</P>
<P>
   Many Palestinans, and Moslems elsewhere, view the US attacks
against Iraq as utmost hypocrisy _ punishing an Islamic nation for
failing to abide by UN resolutions while sticking by Israel when it
also snubs international opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian protesters in Gaza implored Hussein to strike Israel
with Scud missiles, as he did in the 1991 Gulf War, while jeering
Clinton for the sexual escapades that appear increasingly certain
to result in his impeachment. ``Clinton, you coward, go look for
women,'' crowds of youths chanted.
</P>
<P>
   At Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest shrine,
Moslem cleric Mohammed Hussein characterized the assault on Iraq on
the cusp of Ramadan as ``an aggression on all humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among Persian Gulf states warm to the United States and
favoring economic sanctions against Iraq, official support was
lukewarm, at best, for bombing waves that have struck Baghdad and
other Iraqi targets for three successive nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pray a peaceful solution to this crisis could be reached to
spare the Iraqi people a lot of misery and suffering,'' said a
spokesman for Qatar's Foreign Ministry, in an official government
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Only a month ago, when Washington and London were poised to
attack, even Islamic countries traditionally opposed to US policy
seemed to accept that it was Hussein who was bringing international
rage down on his people by defying UN arms inspectors. Now,
however, there seems almost universal sympathy in the Moslem world
for Iraq, if not for Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   A view expressed by ordinary people and governments alike is
that the wrongs cited by the chief UN arms inspector, Richard
Butler, did not warrant the swift retaliation, and that Baghdad
should have been allowed a bit more time to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be there should be a time of military reckoning with
Saddam Hussein,'' said Ahmad Mutawa, a Kuwaiti academic educated in
the United States and generally a supporter of US policy in the
region. ``But this is too much, too soon. There is an obscenity to
these attacks against Iraqis who have become so helpless they can
hardly lift a weapon to defend themselves. It is especially
offensive as we enter Ramadan.''
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian university students took to the streets in Cairo,
chanting pro-Iraqi slogans and warning that any attack by the West
against an Islamic country represents a threat to all Moslems.
``Egypt, wake up!'' the youthful crowds repeated. ``Your turn might
come next!''
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus, a group of Syrians staged a sit-in outside the US
Embassy, a rare public display of political outrage in the tightly
ruled state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to express our anger at the strikes which were
mainly directed against the people of Iraq, who have been suffering
for eight years due to sanctions,'' said Jamal Mahmoud, one of the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed an almost universal view across the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In Yemen's capital, Sanaa, where police increased security
around the US mission, thousands took to the streets following
Friday prayer services, yelling anti-American slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic preachers, in angry sermons, stood at the head of
mosques and branded the United States and Great Britain as
``infidels.''

FUTURE OF UN INSPECTION TEAM IN DOUBT IN WAKE OF RAIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A secret computer video feed that enables UN
inspectors in New York to monitor Iraq's weapons facilities went
dead Friday, probably the result of the US bombing campaign,
according to UN sources.
</P>
<P>
   The technical breakdown was the latest setback for an
organization whose future has grown increasingly uncertain since
Washington launched its missile strikes on Iraq. In the first two
days of the air raids, the Pentagon says it has destroyed 75 key
military installations, raising questions about whether the UN
Special Commission will have anything left to inspect if it ever
returns to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The target list _ which included Iraq's defense ministry,
intelligence headquarters, the Republican Guard barracks, and the
Al Taji and Ibn Al Haytham's missile production factories _
contains many of the locations under the inspectors' scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the documentary evidence may have been blown up,''
said a senior UN official. ``If UNSCOM ever goes back in, it's
almost like they were in '91 starting from scratch trying to put a
trail together.''
</P>
<P>
   As the UN arms specialists in New York came to grips with their
predicament, the chairman of the UN Special Commission, Richard
Butler, said Friday that he is worried that the future of his
mission is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about where we will go next, and will we still be
able to do our job,'' said Butler, who has insisted that he will
not give up his post until Iraq is a weapons-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's staff declined to confirm the existence of video
monitoring station at UN headquarters _ which is classified.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Duelfer, the UN Special Commission's deputy
chairman, signaled that the UN's capacity to monitor Iraq weapons
facility had been eroded by the American campaign. ``There is a
coincidence of location between our cameras and America's bombs,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States' insitence that the Special Commission
will play an important role in Iraq when the bombs fall silent,
inspectors in New York remain anxious over the prospects of its
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I going to be here in a month's time? Possibly yes,'' said
one official who requested anonymity. ``Six months time? I don't
know.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: A HOUSE MORE DIVIDED THAN EVER 
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: 2ndTAKE will move by 9 p.m. ET.) 
(htv) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the acrid, rueful and righteous debate went on
throughout Friday, the House stood poised to do what once was
unimaginable, even to its Republican leaders: impeach a Democratic
president on a near party-line vote, against the will of the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the way something as momentous as impeachment was
supposed to take place. It was not what Rep. Henry Hyde, the
Illinois Republican presiding over impeachment, had once described
when he said, ``This has to be a bipartisan exercise. It's
important that we have the confidence of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, with the partisan gulf seemingly unbridgeable in the
House, Hyde was left insisting that impeachment was not ``the
ravings of some vindictive political crusade'' but was about
protecting ``the basic structure of our freedoms _ the rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was clear from the debate and the talk in the Capitol's
corridors that a quarter of a century of resentments had loomed up
as well: the disputes over the war in Vietnam and the Nixon
impeachment, the personal and political battles over Robert Bork
and John Tower, the House's own bitter fights over two speakers,
Jim Wright and the man who forced him out, Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from the work schedule, to the redistricting maps, to
the speeded-up news cycles of 24-hour television has played a role,
but on Friday the House was far more like the polarized
Reconstruction-era House that impeached Andrew Johnson of 1868 than
the House that was ready, sorrowfully, to impeach President Richard
M. Nixon when he resigned in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   And Washington politics has become meaner than ever. ``There's
live ammunition,'' said Kenneth Duberstein, a former White House
chief of staff under President Ronald Reagan. ``You now shoot to
destroy one side or the other. The Washington I grew up in, you
always left somebody a side door or a back door. Now it is search
and destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   In part the polarization in the chamber known as the People's
House is a function of political shifts that have occurred since
Nixon departed grudgingly from the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   The years have brought about the near extinction of the southern
Democrats who were once a swing block that could pull both parties
to the center. ``Those people disappeared,'' said Richard F. Fenno,
a professor of political science at the University of Rochester in
New York. ``They were the mediators, they were in the time of
Watergate. And they just disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   So the parties in the House are divided into a largely
southern-dominated, conservative Republican party and an
urban-centered, Democratic party, more left-leaning than the party
at large. This time the moderate Republicans, from districts that
also voted for Clinton, were supposed to be the bridge between the
parties. But one after another, after weeks of agonizing, most of
them said they had decided to vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional redistricting has also heightened divisions as the
two parties in state houses across the nation have conspired to
create a maximum number of ``safe seats'' that cluster together
either Republican or Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   And both the voter apathy of recent years and the candidates'
needs for campaign funds for television ads have made House members
more responsive to their parties' most loyal _ and most partisan _
voters. ``Certainly in the mid-term election, as in this election,
you want to play to the hard-core,'' said Charles O. Jones,
professor emeritus of political science at the University of
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   These factors have created a stark divide on emotional issues
from abortion, to school prayer, to welfare policy to tax cutting.
Also adding to the polarization was the uncompromising ways of the
conservative Republican class of 1994, which came into office with
a sharp ideological agenda and a sense of urgency coming from term
limits and little experience in government.
</P>
<P>
   But all of this only partly explains the raw, angry emotion
wafting through the House on Friday. For much of it is also due to
the meanness of post-Watergate politics and political journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The search for scandal has become so dominant in campaigns that
rafts of operatives specialize in ``opposition research'' that no
longer focuses on forgotten votes or speeches but on the scouring
of private lives that began when Gary Hart was asked if he had
committed adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, this now also the era of the independent counsel.
``Now we are routinely using criminal accusations and scandal to
win the political battles and ideological differences we cannot
settle at the ballot box,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, New York's
senator-elect. ``It has been used with reckless abandon by both
Democrats and Republicans and we are now at a point where we risk,
deeply risk wounding the nation we all love.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every member of Congress had a theory of when this all
began. Perhaps it was when the Democrats refused to confirm John
Tower and Robert Bork. Perhaps it was the wedge politics practiced
by the late Republican, Lee Atwater.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats blamed Newt Gingrich, who in his ascent to
speaker constantly accused Democrats of corruption and forced the
resignation of a former Democratic speaker, Jim Wright, on ethics
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans say it is Clinton himself who did so much to
bring about this mood through his embrace of the idea of government
as a permanent campaign, with a war room on every issue and White
House aides who practice ``quick response'' politics playing to the
news cycles.

CHRYSLER PLANS PREVIEW OF NEW POWER WAGON  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the '40s, the Dodge Power Wagon was a famously rugged truck
that moved from military service to civilian duty. Now Chrysler has
revived the name for a show vehicle that combines handcrafted
luxury with aggressive styling and an immense 7.2-liter diesel
engine.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler is withholding details of the design until the Power
Wagon makes its debut next month at the North American
International Auto Show, although the company released a
sneak-preview photo last week.
</P>
<P>
   Executives said at a technology briefing that the truck would
serve not only as a design study but would provide a platform to
explore the prospects for diesel technology.
</P>
<P>
   The concept vehicle is equipped with a turbo-charged
direct-injection in-line 6 from Caterpillar. It is capable of 250
horsepower and 780 foot-pounds of torque, compared with the 450
foot-pounds of Chrysler's most powerful current Ram truck engine,
an 8-liter gasoline V10.
</P>
<P>
   Diesels achieve 5 percent to 10 percent better economy than gas
engines. ``Sooner or later fuel economy is really going to
matter,'' Bernard Robertson, Chrysler's senior vice president of
engineering technologies and general manager of truck operations,
said in an interview. ``Consumers' No. 1 complaint with large
trucks and sport utilities is poor fuel economy _ but then they'll
ask if we've got a bigger engine.''

   WASHINGTON _ Their ranks include Rep. Sidney Yates, a liberal
Democrat from Chicago, who is retiring after 48 years in the House,
and Rep. Vince Snowbarger, a conservative Republican from Kansas
who lost his seat after a single term.
</P>
<P>
   Among the household names are Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia,
who said after the Republican Party's disappointing showing in the
November elections that he would leave the House, and Rep. Joseph
Kennedy II, D-Mass., who decided to leave politics after the death
last winter of his brother Michael.
</P>
<P>
   They are the lame ducks in the House, 21 Republicans and 17
Democrats, not including two Republicans and one Democrat who won
election to Senate seats. And as the House took up impeachment
Friday, they streamed back into the Capitol to deal with what for
many is the most momentous issue of their careers in public
service, one they variously view as unfortunately necessary or just
unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last issue I will address after 17 years in this
body, after thousands of votes, only a few of which I regret,''
said Rep. Barbara Kennelly, D-Conn., who is leaving after running
unsuccessfully for governor and opposes impeachment. ``I do not
want to regret this incredibly important vote.''
</P>
<P>
   With their status comes, theoretically, a freedom from the party
whip and from the need to explain their decision to the voters. Yet
with most of them standing firmly on one side or other of the
ideological divide and representing districts that remain safely in
the hands of their parties, only a few of them are likely to break
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democrats who are leaving, only one, Rep. Paul McHale
of Pennsylvania, is likely to vote in favor of impeaching President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   McHale said he is fairly certain that about two-thirds of the
voters in his district would prefer a vote against impeachment and
want the president, whatever his faults, to remain in office. Asked
if public opinion would matter more to him if he were not retiring,
he said it would not.
</P>
<P>
   ``After scouring my own conscience, I believe Edmund Burke is
right,'' McHale said. ``I am obligated to exercise the best
judgment I can, even if it means in the short term I may be in
conflict with what may be the passing public will.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the departing Republicans, nearly all have come out in
favor of impeachment. Indeed, there has been little agonizing among
the departing members of either party. Among the Republicans in
particular, there is a sense that their final act in Congress will
be a weighty but entirely appropriate one, the strongest measure
available to them under the Constitution to register their
disapproval of Clinton's actions in both legal and moral terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one last monumental change in American history before
I leave office,'' said Rep. Mark Neumann, a two-term Republican
from Wisconsin who gave up his seat for an unsuccessful Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first went to Washington the primary concern was
balancing the budget, which we got accomplished,'' Neumann said.
``We leave making a statement that I hope is heard loud and clear:
that even though a lot of people say the economy is strong and
their jobs are secure and that they're content, that this country
is about more than money. Especially for young people, the message
should be that an extramarital affair plus perjury is not
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   They have been stripped of the trappings of power already. Most
have closed their offices and lost their staffs, and many will be
reduced to working from a cubicle with a single phone line in the
basement of the Rayburn Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly all of them plan to be present and vote. Even Rep.
Jay Kim, R-Calif., who lost his primary race after pleading guilty
to a campaign contributions offense, plans to vote, aides said. Kim
told a newspaper in California that he was leaning towards voting
against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In several cases, Republicans who favor impeachment will turn
their seats over in three weeks to Democrats. Rep. Mike Pappas,
R-N.J., announced on Wednesday that he would vote for impeachment.
The Democrat who defeated him, Rush Holt, said that he opposes
impeachment and that Pappas should abstain.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, the Illinois Democrat, was elected to the House in 1948
and has served there since, except for two years during the 1960s
when he ran unsuccessfully for the Senate. He said the situation
struck him as a preposterous example of how rampant partisanship
has taken over Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should never have occurred,'' Yates, who is 89, said of the
Republican decision to force a vote on impeachment, ``and it
wouldn't have occurred in any Congress preceding this one.''

 &HT;    AIR STRIKES VICTIMS EMBITTERED BY TRAUMA OF HIGH TECH WARFARE
 &HT;    With US-IRAQ-1219.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD _ Jassim Ghelan says he used to like doing business with
Americans, but that was before an American missile slammed through
his wall. It crashed through the kitchen and bathroom and sent
pieces flying into the bedroom where he slept with his wife and
frightened children.
</P>
<P>
   The missile demonstrated, in one way, the ultra-high-tech nature
of this series of the air strikes the United States and Great
Britain launched on Iraq this week. It did not explode, possibly
because missiles can be deactivated when they run off course, as
this appears to have done. Had it exploded, there might be nothing
left of the Ghelan family household.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the murky casualty counts through the start of another
round of air strikes Friday night seemed small, maybe just in the
dozens. But, as this incident in a tony section of town a day
before showed, even the most advanced form of warfare is rife with
personal trauma and tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Ghelan, a wealthy engineer, and his wife had gone to sleep with
their children when seven-year-old daughter, Susan(CQ) said she was
scared. Now, the parents, their 20-day-old baby and their toddler
are all in hospitals with minor to serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Ghelan, 40, said he traveled to the United States twice 20 years
ago for business, but now he wants revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Mr. Clinton say they won't bomb children or
civilians,'' Ghelan strained to say from his bed in one of
Baghdad's dilapidated, antiquated, hospitals. ``(Iraqi President)
Saddam Hussein must not be quiet. He must destroy Clinton and the
(U.S.) government. The Arab people must take revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghelan had a broken jaw, broken vertebrae, a head injury and a
black eye. In a ward with six other bomb victims with little
medical equipment visible, he lay under an old tiger-striped
blanket in the same bloody sleeveless undershirt he wore when
injured.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbors said they helped remove large parts of the missile
from the inside of the house. From the outside, passersby could see
several windows shattered, window frames askew and metal gratings
dangling off them. In the back, there was one hole just a couple of
yards wide. Houses next door were undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   Information on casualties has been scarce, but Iraqi officials
and those trying to survey hospitals for a count have estimated
that possibly 35 people have died, and dozens have been injured.
That is from a barrage of well over 200 missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Al Yarmouk Hospital, a major facility with 750 beds, had 50
patients through Thursday and 13 had died. Most had shrapnel wounds
and some were burned.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable seller Khamis Hatem Khuder broke his leg in four
places when the bus he was riding flipped over as the result of a
nearby missile blast. This was just after midnight Thursday morning
and was among the first volleys of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He heard the approach of the missile, which he said sounded like
an airplane, and saw it land and explode. He was thrown from the
bus and knocked unconscious, but others on board died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This accident increased my insistence to resist America,'' he
said. ``God willing, we will win.''

JEWISH GROUP OBJECTS TO LABEL ON PAINTING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ The World Jewish Congress charged Friday that the
Boston Museum of Fine Arts used ``misleading'' language in a
special label it applied a week ago to a Monet waterlily after the
disclosure that the painting had probably been looted by the Nazis
from the collection of a French Jew.
</P>
<P>
   But the MFA was eager to add more complete information to the
label, only to have the wording vetoed by the French government,
which had loaned the artwork to the MFA for its ``Monet in the 20th
Century'' exhibition, according to Leonard Zakim, the New England
director of the Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   Zakim, who was consulted by the MFA on the issue, said the
language that the French deemed acceptable ``whitewashes history.''
He said a more detailed flier that the MFA produced separately
contains language that is ``acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues is a claim in the special label that the French
had exhibited and loaned the painting over the years ``in order to
facilitate its identification.''
</P>
<P>
   As The Globe has reported, the French government took virtually
no steps over several decades to seek the owners of -- or even
publicize -- the Monet and about 2,000 other artworks that were
recovered from the Nazis after World War II and returned to France.
The artworks have long since been scattered among France's public
museums, and the French government has refused to open its
classified files on the artworks.
</P>
<P>
   When the MFA exhbition opened in September, the only clue to the
painting's fate was the notation, on its label, that it had been
``recovered after World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe disclosed on November 30 that the Monet was part of
the plundered collection of French dealer Paul Rosenberg, and that
it spent the war years in an illicit art collection maintained by
Nazi Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. The same week,
Rosenberg's heirs filed a formal claim in Paris seeking the return
of the Monet.
</P>
<P>
   Elan Steinberg, the executive director of the World Jewish
Congress, complained in a letter sent Friday to MFA Director
Malcolm Rogers that the new label is ``misleading and incomplete.''
</P>
<P>
   While the label notes that France restituted 45,000 artworks to
their owners after the war, Steinberg wrote, it omits the fact that
13,000 other artworks were auctioned off by the French government,
which kept the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most troubling, however, is the statement that the Monet had
been lent out `in order to facilitate its identification,' ''
Steinberg wrote. ``Indeed, if identification were the real purpose,
why didn't the MFA simply indicate originally that the painting had
been stolen by the Nazis and (the MFA was) displaying it `in order
to facilitate its identification.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Gifford, an MFA spokeswoman, said Rogers was traveling and
had not seen the WJC letter. But she said that the Anti-Defamataion
League had agreed to the wording on the label.
</P>
<P>
   Zakim, however, said Gifford was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said he and other members of the ADL board, at a
meeting with Rogers two weeks ago, proposed more complete language.
``Malcolm Rogers didn't take two breaths before he said `Yes,' ''
Zakim said late Friday. ``We found the MFA totally receptive and
responsive.''
</P>
<P>
   But the French government objected, he said. ``They refused to
agree to the more detailed language that included the historical
context,'' he said. Zakim said the MFA informed him the French had
the final say.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``the plaque doesn't quite make it. It is most
noteworthy for its omissions. It whitewashes history from the
French side,'' Zakim said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Gifford again contradicted Zakim, insisting that while
the French government was consulted on the wording, the final
decision on what to say rested with the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, in his letter, urged Rogers to make changes in the
label, even though the exhibition closes Dec. 27, ``so that
fidelity is shown to the memory of the victims of Nazi
rapaciousness and the concomitant spoliation of Jews in France. I
am sure you agree that the historical record of these traumatic
events -- the greatest assault and dislocation of Western cultural
objects ever undertaken - demands no less.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Steinberg said the labels, both the original
and its replacement, are ``disgraceful, incomplete and, in part,
false.'' A casual reader of the new label, he said sarcastically,
``would want to applaud the fine job the French Ministry of Culture
and the MFA have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Zakim, for his part, said the MFA has been cooperative, and has
even signaled its interest in an ADL suggestion that it host a
conference on Nazi-looted art next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real onus here is on the French to come clean,'' said
Zakim. The French, he said, have been rightly criticized for a lack
of due diligence on the homeless artworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these 2,000 artworks should ever be displayed again
without full information included,'' Zakim added.
</P>
<P>
   After the Monet exhibition concludes, it is scheduled to travel
to the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Although Rosenbergs' heirs
have agreed to allow its exhibition in London, the French
government has decided to have the painting returned to France amid
expectations that its appearance in London would be a further
embarassment to France.

French side,'' Zakim said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Gifford again contradicted Zakim, insisting that while
the French government was consulted on the wording, the final
decision on what to say rested with the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, in his letter, urged Rogers to make changes in the
label, even though the exhibition closes Dec. 27, ``so that
fidelity is shown to the memory of the victims of Nazi
rapaciousness and the concomitant spoliation of Jews in France. I
am sure you agree that the historical record of these traumatic
events -- the greatest assault and dislocation of Western cultural
objects ever undertaken - demands no less.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Steinberg said the labels, both the original
and its replacement, are ``disgraceful, incomplete and, in part,
false.'' A casual reader of the new label, he said sarcastically,
``would want to applaud the fine job the French Ministry of Culture
and the MFA have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Zakim, for his part, said the MFA has been cooperative, and has
even signaled its interest in an ADL suggestion that it host a
conference on Nazi-looted art next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real onus here is on the French to come clean,'' said
Zakim. The French, he said, have been rightly criticized for a lack
of due diligence on the homeless artworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these 2,000 artworks should ever be displayed again
without full information included,'' Zakim added.
</P>
<P>
   After the Monet exhibition concludes, it is scheduled to travel
to the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Although Rosenbergs' heirs
have agreed to allow its exhibition in London, the French
government has decided to have the painting returned to France amid
expectations that its appearance in London would be a further
embarassment to France.

ALLTEL CORP. BUYING TOP PHONE COMPANY IN NEBRASKA FOR $1.5 BILLION 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Colo., Neb.)  By LAWRENCE M. FISHER  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alltel Corp., a telecommunications company based in Little Rock,
Ark., said Friday that it had agreed to acquire Aliant
Communications Inc., a midwestern telephone company, for $1.5
billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal reflects a long-running expansion by Alltel into
less-populated regions of the country at a time when larger
competitors are focusing their efforts on urban areas with far more
customers. Aliant is the dominant phone company in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a kind of plain vanilla combination that has proven to
work in the past,'' said Bette Massick Colombo, an analyst with
Bear, Stearns. She said the merger offered some opportunities for
cost savings but would improve Alltel's earnings even without
savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both companies have been aggressive about rolling out Internet
and long-distance service,'' she said. ``This is kind of a
second-tier mentality because competition is not going to come to
Nebraska first.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination will create a company with $5.3 billion in
annual revenues, 6.3 million communications customers in 24 states,
22,000 employees and more than 1,000 information-services clients.
</P>
<P>
   Aliant shareholders will get $39.1275 in Alltel stock for each
share, about a 27 percent premium to Aliant's Thursday closing
price of $30.875. News of the deal sent Aliant shares to a new
52-week high, closing at $37.25, up $6.375, in Nasdaq trading.
Alltel closed at $55.875, down $1.125, on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the mild competitive and regulatory environment in
Nebraska made Aliant an especially attractive acquisition for
Alltel, and that the premium price represented a good return for
Aliant shareholders. Based in Lincoln, Aliant is the major local
provider of wire-line service for that city and 22 surrounding
counties, but not Omaha. It is the leading cellular provider for
Nebraska, including Omaha, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal fits Alltel's strategy of growth through acquisition
and serving midsize and rural markets. Alltel acquires lesser-known
telephone companies in smaller markets and enhances their
franchises with Alltel's strong brand name and improved management,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger of Alltel and Aliant will expand Alltel's
geographic footprint in a dynamic manner,'' Joe T. Ford, Alltel's
chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. ``This merger
also increases Alltel's wire-line and wireless overlap in our
communications markets and makes the merged company a more
formidable competitor in the communications marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph, Aliant has long been
one of the better regional service providers, said Salvatore Muoio,
an analyst with S. Muoio &AMP; Co. in New York. ``This is one of my
favorite telephone franchises in the country. They really dominate
the whole state and are somewhat impervious to competition. It's a
nice deal for Alltel.''
</P>
<P>
   Alltel also said Friday that it had agreed to acquire the
Durango Cellular Telephone Co. operations in the Durango, Colo.,
area. The Durango's service area in southwestern Colorado is
adjacent to Alltel's wireless coverage in northern New Mexico.
Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Alltel completed the $4.2 billion acquisition of 360
Communications Co., the former cellular business of the Sprint
Corp. Alltel, which has made more than 250 acquisitions since the
1950s, began as a rural phone company, but has branched out into
cellular service, and recently into long-distance and Internet
services.

 &HT;    WEEK PACKED WITH CRISES PLACES STRAIN ON CLINTON
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fighting Iraq with one hand and impeachment with
the other, an embattled President Clinton battened down the White
House hatches Friday, ducked out of public sight and threw himself
into his job.
</P>
<P>
   A week packed with tough peace talks in Jerusalem, political
battling against impeachment and a war on Iraq has subjected
Clinton to an excruciating set of pressures that few chief
executives could imagine.
</P>
<P>
   He has made no secret, moreover, of his pain over the difficult
job of mending fences with his wife and daughter over his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton _ who hasn't partaken of his favorite stress-buster,
a round of golf, in two weeks _ pushed aside his personal and
professional anxieties Friday.
</P>
<P>
   All but ignoring the bruising House debate on his future a few
blocks away on Capitol Hill, Clinton spent the day engaged on
subjects ranging from the first federal budget of the new
millennium to the quest for an AIDS cure.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton's morale
had been boosted by the holiday atmosphere in the West Wing, where
offices were brightened by Christmas trees and stocked with enough
caramel popcorn and reindeer-shaped cookies to keep even the
grinchiest spirits afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night, Clinton found himself swaying to the beat
of ''Santa Claus is Coming to Town,'' with his arm around a beaming
Hillary Rodham Clinton, at a White House Christmas gala to
recognize the the Special Olympics, a worldwide sports movement
benefitting people who are mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   He later retired for the best night's sleep _ seven hours _ he
has had all week.
</P>
<P>
   The past few days, though, haven't been all glamor, and earlier
Thursday it was clear the strains of the week had taken their toll.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared at the start of a national security briefing
looking drawn and spent, his speech lacking the punch and passion
that normally animates his every utterance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be an understatement to say that the president has
been tested over the last week,'' Lockhart told reporters. ''I
think what you can see, and what he's demonstrated, is he's up to
the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in a generation _ since President Nixon resigned in 1974 to
avoid almost certain impeachment during the waning days of U.S.
involvement in the Vietnam War _ has an American president faced
the combined stress of war and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, added another to the list, starting the week
chewing into the gristle of a Mideast peace process stalled by
broken promises on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian divide.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the 11-hour journey from Washington to Jerusalem on
Saturday, spent Sunday in bitterly contentious talks with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about possible ways to restart
the peace process, then proceeded to a joint press conference
dominated by questions about the looming impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing physically drained and emotionally spent, Clinton
often could only stare, almost blankly at times, into a phalanx of
cameras and scandal-primed reporters.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton flew by helicopter for a long day in
Palestinian-controlled Gaza, where he lent his blessings to the
notion of Palestinian statehood. Back in a Jerusalem hotel that
night, a senior administration official made clear the toll the day
had taken. Wheezing blearily through a series of questions,
including one on how he was holding up, the official said only,
''I'm awake,'' then quickly ordered a cappuccino.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, after more talks and visits to holy sites in
Bethlehem and Masada, Clinton made the long flight back home across
the Mediterranean and Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Uncharacteristically, neither Clinton nor any administration
official wandered back to the press cabin at the rear of Air Force
One to answer questions about how the president was spending his
time.
</P>
<P>
   The reason became clear only Wednesday night, when Clinton
announced the air strikes on Iraq he had approved in a conference
call from Air Force One with Vice President Al Gore and key members
of the White House national security team.
</P>
<P>
   At a 7:30 a.m. meeting Wednesday _ just seven hours after he
returned to the White House _ Clinton reaffirmed his decision to go
forward with the strike, preparations for which were already well
under way.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that his staff might become despondent with
impeachment proceedings looming, Clinton left his security briefing
to make an unusual appearance at the morning staff meeting of the
White House press office.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped by, Lockhart said, ''basically to say that the
important thing for all of us here as White House staff is to
concentrate on the jobs we were sent here to do, that ultimately
the American people get it right and he believes that they will
here.''

REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS TRADE JABS DURING IMPEACHMENT DEBATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York Democrat Charles Rangel and Georgia
Republican John Linder found themselves sharing a Capitol elevator
Friday morning as they rode up to begin the historic debate on
impeaching the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little warm in here,'' remarked Linder.
</P>
<P>
   ``And its going to get a lot hotter,'' promised Rangel.
</P>
<P>
   The doors opened and the congressmen proceeded to the House
chamber where for more than 12 hours lawmakers debated _ in heated,
solemn, and tired voices _ the fate of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The final deliberations sounded many of the same sour partisan
notes that have been heard repeatedly since independent counsel
Kenneth Starr delivered his 36 boxes of material to the House four
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans bickered over everything from the time
limits for the debate to whether the discussion should be happening
at all while the United States was bombing Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   There was little suspense about the outcome, however, as even
Democrats have conceded that Republicans have enough votes to
impeach.
</P>
<P>
   And by late morning the chamber had largely emptied out as
lawmakers took turns repeating well-worn arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans recited their mantra that presidents are not above
`` the rule of law,'' while some Democrats cried ``coup d'etat.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the predicability of the debate, the gravity of what the
435 Representatives are preparing to do with votes Saturday seemed
to take hold when the clerk of the House in solemn tones recited
the resolution against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resolved, that William Jefferson Clinton is impeached for high
crimes and misdemeanors,'' he intoned before a full and silent
chamber ay 9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   A short while later, the members made the only display of
bipartisanship of the day when they burst out in applause after
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., implored that the
``politics of smear and slash and burn must end.''
</P>
<P>
   That message resonated with Republicans, many of them still
reeling from the latest bombshell; the confession by their new
leader, House Speaker-designate Robert Livingston, R-La., that he
had extramarital affairs while in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But for the remainder of the day the divide in opinions mirrored
the physical separation of the members, who are seated by party.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intensity of feelings, the lawmakers remained civil
on the floor. Several of them clutched Bibles, while others laced
their talks with references to Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln,
Roman law and the Magna Carta.
</P>
<P>
   One of the president's most vociferous critics, Rep. Bob Barr,
R-Ga., displayed a copy of the criminal code as he lectured
colleagues on how Clinton violated the law.
</P>
<P>
   But Barr also sparked a confrontation when he quoted former
President John F. Kennedy in a speech defending impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward the deceased president's nephew, Rep. Patrick Kennedy,
D-R.I., confronted Barr in the adjacent speaker's lobby, saying
``Anybody who has been to a racist crowd like that has no right
invoking my uncle's name.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was referring to a speech Barr gave earlier this year
before a white supremacist group. Barr has asserted he was unaware
of the organization's views when he gave the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Barr responded that Kennedy was wrong and then further annoyed
the 31-year old congressman by calling him ``young man'' and
chiding him for criticizing another representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a problem with that, and calling me a young man, I'm a
duly elected member of my state's delegation,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed, duly impressed,'' Barr shot back.
</P>
<P>
   There were moments of solidarity and support as well as
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate was unfolding, White House special counsel Greg
Craig was spotted in the marbled hallways of the Capitol chatting
with an elderly man, who asked if it would be all right to give the
president's defender a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Craig smiled, shrugged his shoulders and bent down to the man
who gave him a peck on the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're doing a great job for the president. Tell him we're
behind him,'' the man said.
</P>
<P>
   There were few signs in or out of the building of mass public
indignation that the White House hoped might stave off only the
second impeachment of a president in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Television cameras outnumbered the smattering of
anti-impeachment protesters on the Capitol lawns.
</P>
<P>
   The spectator section in the House balcony remained largely
empty for most of the day, though there were some tourists lined up
to watch the unusual proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   And they sounded as passionately divided in their views about
the president and his fate as the lawmakers at the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a law enforcement officer did what he did, he would be
removed,'' said Gail Forbes of San Diego, who favored impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lied and should be held accountable,'' said Rob Rowello, an
impeachment advocate from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But standing right in front of him, Paul Nolan, who said he
voted twice for Clinton, was opposed to Congress removing the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan, an attorney from Washington D.C., called the impeachment
proceedings ``the most disgraceful public process in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Heath Fallin, an impeachment opponent visiting from North
Carolina, said he wanted to come to the Capitol before the vote, a
move he said was ``dirtying the whole process.''

STRIKES A NEW TEST FOR RAYTHEON WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ongoing airstrikes against Iraq will test the improvements
Raytheon Co. has made to smart weapons like the Tomahawk cruise
missile, which received mixed reviews for its performance during
the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon is perhaps best known as the producer of the Patriot
air-defense missile, made famous by the earlier conflict. But a
round of acquisitions in 1997 now make Raytheon a main supplier of
offensive weapons to the United States military as well.
</P>
<P>
   With munitions like the Tomahawk and the High-Speed
Antiradiation Missile, or HARM, now in use against Iraq, defense
analysts say the US attacks will show whether Raytheon has fixed
the weapons' earlier shortcomings. For example, a new generation of
Tomahawks is being used in the current attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clearly recognized that there was work to be done (on
the weapons), even though it wasn't always admitted,'' by the
military, said Harvey Sapolsky, a professor at MIT's security
studies program. This time, ``Raytheon is out to show they work,''
said Richard Shultz, who teaches at Tufts University's Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the Gulf War, the Pentagon touted its use of
smart weapons, at one point claiming the Tomahawk had a 98 percent
effectiveness rate.
</P>
<P>
   But a 1997 report by the General Accounting Office found the
Pentagon and weaponsbuilders made overstated or misleading claims
about the effectiveness of those attacks. The GAO noted that the
Pentagon itself had concluded the Tomahawks missed their targets as
often as they found them.
</P>
<P>
   The chief builder of Tomahawk at the time of the reports, Hughes
Electronics Corp., did not respond to the findings. Raytheon, which
acquired the Hughes defense business last year, also declines to
respond to the GAO's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ancient history...that has no bearing on the current
performance'' of the Tomahawk, said Dave Shea, a onetime Hughes
spokesman now in Raytheon Systems Co.'s Arlington, Va.
headquarters. Despite the Pentagon audit suggesting a hit rate
around 50 percent, Raytheon cites older figures showing Tomahawks
struck their targets about 85 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Raytheon has been busy updating the Tomahawk, which
it builds in Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to finding its target with a satellite-based Global
Positioning System instead of pre-programmed radar flight path
maps, the newest Tomahawk missiles include better software allowing
them to fly loops in order to coordinate arrival with that of other
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of greater sophistication is considerable,'' says
Chris Hellman, senior analyst at the Center for Defense
Information, a nonprofit group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With about 3,000 Tomahawks in the Navy's arsenal before the
start of the current air strikes, Raytheon's Shea said the company
doesn't expect the military to replace used Tomahawks with a large
order anytime soon. The weapons cost between $500,000 to $750,000
apiece at current prices.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon, based in Lexington, Mass., also supplies a range of
smart bombs to the military, a business it acquired from Texas
Instruments Inc. in 1997 and is in the process of moving to Tucson.
These include the HARM, now in use against Iraqi missile-defense
sites. Raytheon also produces the Joint Standoff Weapon, a glider
bomb that pilots can launch from up to 50 miles away, and the
Paveway smart bomb, whose effectiveness has also been questioned by
the GAO.

CLINTON IS SAID TO BRACE HIMSELF FOR CONTINUING STRUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JAMES BENNET    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mindful as ever of his standing in history,
President Clinton is said by associates to feel devastated about a
scar he now regards as inevitable: a vote to impeach him Saturday
in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, aides and friends of Clinton say,
America's most tested political fighter has steeled himself for the
battle of his life, believing that his opponents are acting not out
of constitutional duty but partisan rage. Friday, his tried but
enduring ally, Hillary Rodham Clinton, again rallied to his side,
breaking weeks of silence about his predicament.
</P>
<P>
   The president is negotiating to bring in new lawyers to
represent him during a Senate trial, associates said, even as he
bears down, as he did again Friday, on the budget priorities and
other legislative goals that he believes will sustain his public
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goodness, how do you think he is?'' expostulated one
adviser to Clinton on Friday. ``This guy reads history books on
every president. He can cite you details about every president. So
on the one hand he's devastated about what this will do and has
done for his legacy. But on the other hand, he looks at how it's
being done as pure politics.''
</P>
<P>
   And politics is something that Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vast majority of Americans share my approval and
pride in the job that the president's been doing for our country,''
Mrs. Clinton said, in an extremely rare response Friday morning to
a reporter's question. She spoke on the South Portico of the White
House, with the Capitol dome in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton made a plea to ``end divisiveness'' during the
holiday season, and turn attention to ``people who need help and
support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still, you know, abused and neglected foster
children that are not getting well taken care of,'' she said.
``There are still people with health care problems who need tending
to.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the first lady appealed for unity, elsewhere at the
White House, aides took up their cudgels. Anticipating calls for
Clinton's resignation, press secretary Joe Lockhart accused
Republicans of a ``cynical, political strategy,'' to downplay
impeachment for weeks, and then argue now that it should prompt
Clinton's resignation. He accused the Republicans of ``not being
straight with the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, a more pugnacious and sharper-tongued spokesman than
his predecessor, Mike McCurry, came to his daily briefing Friday
armed with a stack of quotations from Republican congressmen to
illustrate his point.
</P>
<P>
   At his right, Lockhart's deputies sat beneath an advertisement
torn from the newspaper and stuck with silver duct tape to the
wall: ``Forgive or Condemn?'' it read. ``Let him who is without sin
cast the first vote.''
</P>
<P>
   On a crisp, clear wintry day, a sense less of history than of
historic wrong, and of grievance, settled over the White House.
Furious aides ridiculed congressional Republicans as bent only on
Clinton's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrong for 11 months,'' said Paul Begala, Clinton's
counselor. ``For 11 months I said this was all about sex, and I was
wrong. It is all about power, and politics and partisanship.''

THEATER OF THE UNREAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There has probably never been a time when
``surreal'' was such a common word in American parlance. ``This is
so surreal that you couldn't write a movie like this,'' said a
friend, ``where everything is so partisan.'' Or where the scenario
changes so swiftly, from impeachment to war to a House
speaker-designate's ``Oprah''-like confession.
</P>
<P>
   For all the bizarreness of what has been happening here, though,
the atmosphere seems less like a Fellini film than a Tom
Clancy-like thriller in which readers have a hard time believing
that the government could come to such a state of affairs, on both
sides of the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   For a newcomer to the Beltway and its odd customs, the first
gasp is at what a very different city Washington is from Boston. It
almost feels like a different country, or at least a ``pretend''
city -- a Las Vegas feeding on politics instead of gambling, a
Disney World of ideological division where Democrats and
Republicans go at it like cowboys and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is like a giant set,'' said a Massachusetts friend
who used to call Washington home. What she means is, there's
Washington the Movie, as beautiful a city as you could imagine, but
step outside the radius of ``official'' Washington and there's some
of the most unrelenting crime and poverty in the country. It's
something like ``The Truman Show,'' the movie in which the lead
character thinks he's living a life of nonstop comfort only to find
that his life has been designed as a televised entertainment for
the rest of the world and that he can't escape the TV set.
</P>
<P>
   You can escape it here, but it takes some doing. ``Official''
Washington is steeped in historical grandeur, from its architecture
to its amenities. Charming old hotels usher you into a room with a
stereo system preset to the classical music station; a restaurant
menu offers a mouth-watering replica of dinner in the manner of
Thomas Jefferson. Buildings like the Capitol are breathtakingly
beautiful, inside and out.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy in such a world of comfort and privilege to feel
``Truman''-ized. That seems particularly so for politicians, as if
each one is the star of his ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' there
to do the will of the people even as they get further and further
removed from them. And of course the disconnect works both ways, as
people become disillusioned with a man who imagines there won't be
any negative consequences for using the office of the presidency,
literally, as a trysting place or for congressmen who ignore the
country's sense of what the penalty for such behavior should be.
</P>
<P>
   If, as Neil Gabler suggests in his book ``Life the Movie''
everything in the public eye is becoming a movie, nowhere is that
more evident than on Capitol Hill. As a colleague got out of a cab
at the House of Representatives Friday and saw plots of microphone
banks everywhere (with no shortage of politicians to fill them) and
as a camera turned toward him in case he was somebody, he noted,
``Just like the Oscars.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, though, the movie was ``Dull and Duller'' despite the
import of the proceedings. There were flashes of oratory, certainly
-- Henry Hyde's historical perspective, Charles Schumer's
mythological metaphors, John Lewis's thundering intonations
recalling the calls to conscience of the civil rights movement. The
late Lionel Barrymore would have been perfect to play Hyde, and
Harvey Keitel with a voice transplant could be Barney Frank, but
looking out into the gallery didn't provide much inspiration, in
any regard. Mary Bono, Sonny's widow, moved restlessly across the
chamber, from one representative to another, bringing a smile to
the face of Hyde and every other Republican male she approached.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, this could have been a convention of shoe salesmen,
and to judge from Bob Livingston's Thursday-night confession, even
the straightest-looking of straight arrows here is apt to behave
like a conventioneer. But then, in ``Washington the Movie,''
everyone gets to be Harrison Ford. Perhaps the most astute summary
was offered by California Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren: ``I share with
fellow Americans the feeling of unreality.''

 &HT;    Appearances of momentous day deceiving
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First, a word about the empty seats in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little odd, given all that was said Friday about how
historic and important this impeachment debate was, that when all
the high-flown rhetoric rose to the visitor's gallery above the
House floor, only about half the seats were filled with listeners.
To take this as a sign the public isn't paying attention would
repeat an error committed many times in the course of this story,
however.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, this was the first presidential impeachment
debate of the C-SPAN age. For all we know it may have as large an
audience as any congressional debate in history. But Americans
accustomed to the Internet and all-news television understand, as
members of Congress certainly do, that you don't have to be in the
room to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the members were in their seats when the debate began
Friday, but by midmorning the House settled into a typical pattern,
with members drifting on and off the floor as they waited their
turn to talk about their grave responsibility and their fateful
task.
</P>
<P>
   Here again, appearances could be deceiving. If they went about
it in a routine way, the import of the day did seem to weigh
heavily on many members. Rep. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia spoke of
the lump in his throat that came on during a morning interview with
a Macon radio station. Rep. Sue Myrick of North Carolina had tears
welling in her eyes when she left the floor after her speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very down for the last couple of weeks,'' the
Charlotte Republican said. ``It's kind of like getting in a funk
you can't get out of.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charlie Norwood of Georgia sat through almost all the
proceedings, although the Augusta Republican said he heard nothing
that would sway him from voting for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're past the point of me making my decision. I just feel
duty bound to be sitting there,'' Norwood said.
</P>
<P>
   For a number of House members who are not returning, their
remarks on impeachment were also their farewell addresses, and many
were the most affecting speeches of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last vote I will make in the House, and the most
troubling in all my years,'' said Democrat Bill Heffner of North
Carolina. Then he spoke of how hatred, like a tell-tale disease,
had changed even the physical appearance of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``What began 25 years ago with Watergate as a solemn and
necessary process to force a president to adhere to the rule of
law, has grown beyond our control so that now we routinely using
criminal accusations and scandal to win the political battles and
ideological differences we cannot settle at the ballot box,'' said
Democrat Charles Schumer of New York, who is leaving the House for
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Democrats picked up on that theme, sometimes coming
close to public regret at their party's contribution to the descent
_ the scandal over drinking and womanizing which blocked the
Cabinet appointment of Republican John Tower, Schumer noted, was
``not too dissimilar'' to that of Clinton. Rep. Vic Fazio of
California, another member making his last speech in the House,
said some Republicans were obsessed with ``Slick Willy'' the way
some Democrats 25 years ago were obsessed with ``Tricky Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   The moments in which debate rose above partisanship were brief,
however, and the partisan rancor droned on into the night.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats insisted that Americans were witnessing
nothing less than a political coup. Republicans, they cautioned,
were exploiting the mechanism of impeachment _ and the raw power of
their majority in the House of Representatives _ to remove a
president who had long been in their cross hairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benjamin Franklin spoke of impeachment as an alternative to
assassination,'' said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. ``Today, this body
is contemplating a constitutional assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans dismissed such dire warnings as diversionary
tactics, aimed at helping a popular leader evade accountability.
They said they were fulfilling their duty to protect the integrity
of both the government and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``No man or woman, no matter how highly placed, no matter how
effective a communicator, no matter how gifted a manipulator of
opinion or winner of votes, can be above the law in a democracy,''
said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee. ``That is a rock-bottom, irreducible principle of our
public life.''
</P>
<P>
   As members of the full House took up the debate over articles of
impeachment against President Clinton Friday, they quarreled
perhaps most angrily over each other's motives and over which party
was truly dedicated to the intentions of the Constitution and the
rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   In a marathon session of elegant oratory and inelegant
wisecracks, of wistful glances backward in time and anxious glances
forward, each party tried to sell itself to the American people and
to its most loyal constituents as the group on the side of the
angels.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, a Vietnam veteran spoke of the importance
of proceeding with impeachment even as the country conducted
airstrikes in Iraq. For the Democrats, African-Americans spoke of
their familiarity with overzealous, discretion-blind prosecutors, a
category in which they placed Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties cloaked themselves in patriotism and
fidelity to the Constitution, but to make points in direct
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said that in treating Clinton's
alleged attempts to conceal an extramarital affair as impeachable
offenses, ``we are amending the Constitution of the United States
on the floor of the House of Representatives here today!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake about it,'' he said. ``This is a
constitutional amendment that we are debating, not an impeachment
resolution. The Republicans are crossing out the impeachment
standard of `high crimes and misdemeanors' and they are inserting
the words `any crime or misdemeanor.' We are permitting a
constitutional coup d'etat which will haunt this body and our
country forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., mentioned the impeachment of
President Andrew Johnson more than a century ago and said:
``History accords that his real crime was disagreeing with the
majority party. I fear that history will view this 1998 impeachment
inquiry similarly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A total-control majority urges impeachment, not for treason,
bribery or other high crimes or misdemeanors, but because they
disdain this president for his moral flaws, ranging from military
service evasion to flagrant infidelity,'' Ms. Slaughter said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered that Democrats were trivializing and
distorting the case against the president, including the fact that
his alleged lies were rendered under oath and that some of them
subverted the federal civil rights lawsuit filed by Paula Corbin
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lying under oath is an ancient crime of great weight because
it shields other offenses, because it blocks the light of truth in
human affairs,'' said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla. ``It is a
dagger in the heart of our legal system, and indeed in our
democracy. It cannot, it should not, it must not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   And it compelled impeachment, Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, when the president stands before God, puts his hand
on the Bible and takes an oath to uphold the Constitution and
lawfully carry out the duties of his office, he is promising to put
the people and the nation before his own interests,'' said Rep. Sam
Johnson, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the president violated the laws and beliefs he swore
to uphold,'' Johnson said. ``Instead of following the law,
respecting American people's values and honoring his office, he
chose to lie, cover up and evade the truth. His actions have made a
mockery of the people who fought for this country and are fighting
for this nation today, the Constitution and the laws we live under.
And because of the president's actions, Congress must act as
dictated by the Constitution.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the debate came on the morning after an admission by
the House speaker-elect, Robert Livingston, R-La., that he had
engaged in extra-marital affairs years ago, Democrats did not turn
that revelation into a weapon in defense of the president.
</P>
<P>
   It was alluded to only obliquely, as when Rep. Martin Frost,
D-Texas, said, ``If we make every member of this House rumored to
have been involved in an affair subject to a $40 million special
prosecutor and then hold him accountable for any misstatement of
fact, we may be faced with a number of empty seats in this
chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats resurrected their disagreement over
having the House debate impeachment while the U.S. was engaged in
air strikes against Iraq. They also revisited their starkly
different appraisals of whether the wrongdoing attributed to
Clinton represented private or public matters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as they clarified anew the broad gulf of opinion
between them, they made calls for bridges to be built in the
future, for an end to partisanship and the accusatory, corrosive
politics it has spawned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now at the height of a cycle of the politics of
negative attacks, character assassination, personal smears of good
people, decent people, worthy people,'' the House Minority Leader,
Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, said. ``It's no wonder to me and to
you that the people of our country today are cynical and
indifferent and apathetic about our government, and about our
country. The politics of smear and slash-and-burn must end.''

 &HT;    IOC team: Sweeping corruption unproven
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The head of the International Olympic Committee's team
investigating allegations of bribery said Friday that a colleague's
claims of widespread corruption in the election of host cities are
unsubstantiated.
</P>
<P>
   IOC vice president Richard Pound said Marc Hodler, who rocked
the sports world with his claims that IOC votes for host Olympic
cities can be bought, has supplied no evidence to back his
sensational allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I have no facts; everything I hear is hearsay,' ''
Pound, a Canadian lawyer, said in a telephone interview from his
Montreal office. ``It is very frustrating for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote-buying scandal erupted after evidence emerged last
month that Salt Lake City Olympic officials had set up a $400,000
scholarship fund for 13 people, including six relatives of IOC
members. The IOC quickly set up an internal investigation headed by
Pound.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hodler, an 80-year-old Swiss lawyer who has been a trusted
member of the IOC's inner circle, turned the issue into a maelstrom
when he alleged over the weekend that agents of IOC members seek
cash bribes of as much as $5 million in exchange for votes.
</P>
<P>
   Hodler, second in seniority on the IOC, gave numerous impromptu
interviews to media gathered for what would have been a routine
three-day IOC meeting in Switzerland, repeating accusations of
bribery, blackmail and other misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal took on global proportions when Hodler claimed
corruption abounded in the election campaigns awarding the Games in
Atlanta in 1996, Nagano in 1998 and Sydney in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, while distancing himself
from Hodler's claims, has promised to expel any IOC member found
guilty of misconduct and to consider possible changes in the
selection of the host city.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said the investigation commission asked Hodler to
substantiate his claims, which have escalated since he returned
home to Bern, Switzerland. ``We said, `Marc, you are now
world-famous. Now come and talk to our commission.' We made a
specific point of asking him for the facts. He had no facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Pound's investigation commission is looking into
the Salt Lake City allegations only. It is expected to deliver the
results when the IOC meets again in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to follow through and start where we have some
facts,'' he said. ``If they lead us elsewhere, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound, an IOC member for 20 years who served as chairman of the
IOC Coordination Commission for the Atlanta Games, said he did not
believe the allegations would affect corporate support of the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rumors been around for so long, people either believe
them or don't,'' he said. ``If they did believe them, it didn't
seem to matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look back at the record, you can say there may be
questionable conduct on the part of a small number of IOC members,
but one way or the other the IOC has done a pretty good job picking
host cities. And that is more important than the process.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the process could change, Pound said. Influential IOC
members, including U.S. delegate Anita DeFrantz and gold-medal
skier Jean-Claude Killy of France, say a smaller panel, perhaps the
11-member executive board, should select the host city.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said that is one of the suggestions his commission would
``put on the table,'' although having a select few of the
115-membership making the most IOC's most important decisions could
be equally controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``What causes one to now look at the process with a fresh eye is
the dramatically changed economic impact of the Olympic Games,'' he
said. ``Before, it was find which city is prepared to invest the
most and lose the most. Now the power of the rings is producing
upwards of $2 billion, and it is an entirely different ball game.
Given that _ the prize for the host city _ it increases the
possibility of improper activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Olympic chief Billy Payne, who was dismayed this week to
be included in Hodler's broad-brush indictment, said he supports
changes in the selection process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any steps the IOC would consider implementing which have the
effect of leveling the playing field,'' Payne said Friday, ``is
something I would favor and something I believe they have the
courage to do.

SOMBER HOUSE DEBATES IMPEACHMENT ARTICLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the clerk of the House somberly and slowly read
aloud the articles of impeachment against William Jefferson
Clinton, president of the United States, tears filled David
Schippers's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than a high moment of history for the crusty Chicago
prosecutor, who helped draft the four articles for the House
Judiciary Committee and heard them debated on the House floor
Friday. ``The single emotion I feel is sadness,'' Schippers said
later, stopping briefly below the majestic dome of the Capitol
Rotunda. ``It takes on all the aspects of a Greek tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The House was a tense and joyless place as the weight of history
and a season of sore feelings bore down upon it. The tragedy wasn't
only for Clinton, whose impeachment seemed a foregone conclusion,
but also for the institution, which has been ripped apart by
uncommon anger and raw, rancorous partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of smear and slash-and-burn must end,'' said
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, delivering the only words
in a long day of floor debate that received applause and a standing
ovation from both Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in the House already had been poisoned by the
Republicans' refusal both to delay the impeachment debate until US
military engagement in the Persian Gulf ended and to allow
Democrats to offer a resolution censuring Clinton for his
misconduct. But what also had members simmering _ and whispering _
was the bombshell of the night before, when media reports caused
incoming House Speaker Robert L. Livingston to confess he had had
several extramarital affairs in 33 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to stop this madness; it's tearing this
institution apart and creating an unworkable atmosphere,'' House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay said in an interview. DeLay, nicknamed
``the Hammer,'' has been one of the chief architects of the GOP
impeachment strategy. In January, DeLay began calling for Clinton
to be impeached and in September demanded he resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just horrible that to gain political advantage, people
will destroy a person's private, family life,'' DeLay said. ``It's
horrible that the media does it, too,'' he said, shaking his finger
at a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Ray LaHood, an Illinois Republican who once
worked for the gentlemanly House GOP leader Robert Michel and has a
passion for restoring civility to public life, was tapped to chair
the House impeachment debate. It was a sign of how extraordinarily
harsh the House has become, and how unseemly Friday's subject was,
that LaHood delivered this warning shortly after 9 a.m. as the
debate was about to begin:
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the personal conduct of the president is at issue,
the rules prohibit members from engaging in generally personal
abusive language toward the president and also from engaging in
comparisons to personal conduct of sitting members of either House
of Congress,'' LaHood said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats jeered.
</P>
<P>
   The key congressional players, except for House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, were present as LaHood slammed down the gavel to open
what is the second presidential impeachment debate in US history
and the first in 130 years.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Henry Hyde, the silver-haired chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, took a seat toward the back of the chamber.
Representative Barney Frank, the Newton Democrat, paced the aisles
but didn't seem to have any of his usual parliamentary maneuvers to
offer. Representative Jesse Jackson Jr., an Illinois Democrat,
appeared to be giving Livingston words of comfort as he pumped the
speaker-designate's hand.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber was about two-thirds full _ more Republicans than
Democrats were there _ when Hyde began an emotional 20-minute
speech defending impeachment and citing the Founding Fathers, Ben
Franklin, George Washington, Moses, Abraham Lincoln, and the heroes
of Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill as his inspirations on the
rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``No man or woman _ no matter how highly placed, no matter how
effective a communicator, no matter how gifted a manipulator of
opinion polls or winner of votes _ can be above the law in a
democracy,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the occasional beep of a pager and the catlike cry of
a baby, the big chamber was quiet as Hyde's solemn words sank in.
The usual commotion of members milling around ceased while Gephardt
spoke for 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The press gallery overflowed with reporters on hand for the
start of Friday's 13 hours of debate, but spectators formed
shorter-than-expected lines to enter the House's public galleries.
Extra police were on hand for crowd control that turned out to be
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm indifferent to the whole thing,'' said Tom Lamontanaro, a
17-year-old student from Valley Stream, N.Y., who waited with some
classmates for a seat in the visitor's gallery. ``This is about the
president's personal life, and it's not the public's business.''
</P>
<P>
   For such a historic day, the American public was noticeably
absent. There were only a few demonstrators, including a man with
the inexplicable sign, ``Stella hates war,'' on the Capitol lawn.
There were hardly any tourists in Statuary Hall. And when
Representatives John Lewis of Georgia orated like an evangelist,
Martin Meehan of Lowell fumed at the GOP, and Bob Barr of Georgia
called up the name of President Kennedy to help impeach Clinton,
few of their colleagues were on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has to be done to show we aren't brain dead,''
complained Representative Patrick Kennedy, a Rhode Island Democrat.
``This is as significant as anything we will ever do here, yet it's
turned into just another floor vote. Where is the emotion? Where is
the gravity?''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy showed considerable emotion in blasting Barr, one of the
president's fiercest enemies, for invoking the name of his slain
uncle. ``These Republicans are not profiles in courage,'' Kennedy
said, alleging that Barr was a ``racist'' for appearing recently
before a white supremacy group. ``They are the farthest thing from
it that I can imagine.'' A spokesman for Barr had no comment on
Kennedy's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers, who some think has been overzealous in his pursuit of
the president, said Judiciary Committee Republicans showed both
courage and a sense of duty when they carried the cause of
impeachment beyond the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week I brought my four children and two grandchildren
here, to this awesome room of democracy,'' Schippers said, looking
around the Rotunda. ``I told them, `This is what grandpa has been
in Washington fighting for.' ''

   RICHMOND HEIGHTS, Mo. _ The guys sitting around the dinette
tables at VFW Post 3500 on Big Bend Boulevard, silently swirling
their foam cups of beer, stared up at the eerie green picture on
the television screen behind the bar. ``Here we go again,'' someone
said. There were flashes of white light in the night-vision sky
over Baghdad and a sound like firecracker pops followed by deep
rumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we should have done months ago,'' said Vince
Rankin, 83, who parachuted into France with the 82nd Airborne
Division on D-Day. ``Remember that last time, when Clinton called
it off? We should have done it then. We've got to get this job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight men waiting out the afternoon in the VFW hall, while
divided over the impeachment of President Clinton and deeply
cynical about American politics in general, were united in their
support for the attack on Iraq and convinced that its timing had
nothing whatever to do with the president's political troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they found it a little unseemly to have an impeachment
debate at hand while American bombs were falling on the other side
of the world, but they believed that the country would pull through
it and that in the end the bizarre juxtaposition would have little
effect on the outcome of either the impeachment battle or the Iraq
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been planning this thing for months,'' said Chuck
Bailey, who served with the Air Force in Germany in the mid-1950s.
``It just happened to fall at the time when they were taking up
this impeachment issue.''
</P>
<P>
   William Germo, who worked on Mississippi River boats for 40
years and now tends bar at the post, said he thought the president
should probably resign, adding, ``He should have done it two, three
months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think he planned this attack to put off
impeachment,'' Germo said. ``I don't think anybody can really
believe that. Because look, if it was the plan, it's not working,
is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Richmond Heights is a small, economically and racially diverse
suburb of some 10,000 people along the western edge of St. Louis.
Spread across the second-highest hill in St. Louis County, it
offers a sprawling view of the old river city. The houses, most of
them built of blood-red brick from an old factory that once
dominated the center of the town, run from tiny, $60,000 duplexes
near the St. Louis city line to multimillion-dollar mansions on the
west side, near the fancier suburban communities of Clayton and
Ladue.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 interviews over two days earlier this week at seven
locations around Richmond Heights found hardened attitudes on both
sides of the impeachment question, along with a sense of
powerlessness and inevitability about the partisanship of
Washington. A subsequent trip, after the attacks on Iraq had begun,
and two dozen fresh interviews at some of the same locations and
some new ones, showed little change in attitudes over impeachment
but wide support for the action against Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The great majority of those interviewed said they were willing
to accept the president's assertion that the timing of the attacks
had had nothing to do with the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just simply can't believe that an American president would
do that,'' said Reg Hanson, a truck driver watching workers unload
his tractor-trailer outside a Home Depot. ``Even a liar like Bill
Clinton. It just shows how far we've come that people are even
asking the question.''
</P>
<P>
   But others simply could not swallow the coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the attacks on Iraq should have started a long time
ago,'' said Greg Ward, a 38-year-old courier from south St. Louis
who was filling his car with gasoline at a mini-mart on the edge of
Richmond Heights. ``But I guess I am a little skeptical about the
whole timing and the impeachment thing. It does seem a bit too
coincidental. I think it's all Clinton's way of stalling for time
until he can figure out what to do next.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ward is opposed to impeachment. Those who want to get rid of
the president had even harsher judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not a bit surprised when I heard we were bombing Iraq,''
said Lee Waldbart, owner of Alex Waldbart Florists, founded by his
grandfather in 1872. ``This is a president who would do anything he
can to stay in office. You look at the stuff he's done, all the way
back to Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet just next door, at Greek Athenian Importing Co., a small
shop filled with cheeses and olives and baklava, Rebecca Taysi, the
owner, said she had no doubt that the attacks started on Wednesday
so that they would be finished before Sunday, the start of Ramadan,
the Muslim holy month. Impeachment had nothing to do with it, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the workers I have are refugees from Bosnia, and I
know what Ramadan means to Muslims,'' Ms. Taysi said. ``If you have
any contact with that religious community, you know why they timed
it the way they did.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And she is angry that Republicans are using the timing as yet
another club to batter the president. ``I am extremely upset with
this whole impeachment process,'' she said, ``and I think it's
completely political.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dressel, 41, who was doing some Christmas shopping at a Zany
Brainy toy store just across from Home Depot, also thought it was
political, and it made him sad. Once you start believing that
everything is political, he said, you see improper motives
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've got this new speaker, Bob Livingston, confessing to
extramarital affairs that are none of our business,'' Dressel said.
``I just don't want to think about it at Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the impeachment debate was
beginning to steal air time from the attacks over Baghdad, and the
conversation drifted.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually it hit upon the name given to the attacks, Operation
Desert Fox. No one liked it, especially those who fought in World
War II against the original Desert Fox, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.
Naming for the wily German tank commander an operation in which you
are dropping bombs instead of confronting your enemy in ground
combat is ``an insult to Rommel,'' Bailey said, and there were
murmurs of assent around the room.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone seemed to agree that the attacks on Iraq would
never be decisive if limited to air power alone and that there was
little political or popular will for anything more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through this before with Saddam Hussein, how many
times?'' Rankin said. ``So now we're doing it again. You know what
that means?''
</P>
<P>
   A voice chirped up from the other side of the room: ``It means
we're going to get a lot of new members!''
</P>
<P>
   Rankin grimaced and chomped down on his cigar. ``No,'' he said,
``it means we're going to have to go through this over and over
until we finish it, no matter who's president.''

THEATER OF THE UNREAL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There has probably never been a time when
``surreal'' was such a common word in American parlance. ``This is
so surreal that you couldn't write a movie like this,'' said a
friend, ``where everything is so partisan.'' Or where the scenario
changes so swiftly, from impeachment to war to a House
speaker-designate's ``Oprah''-like confession.
</P>
<P>
   For all the bizarreness of what has been happening here, though,
the atmosphere seems less like a Fellini film than a Tom
Clancy-like thriller in which readers have a hard time believing
that the government could come to such a state of affairs, on both
sides of the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   For a newcomer to the Beltway and its odd customs, the first
gasp is at what a very different city Washington is from Boston. It
almost feels like a different country, or at least a ``pretend''
city -- a Las Vegas feeding on politics instead of gambling, a
Disney World of ideological division where Democrats and
Republicans go at it like cowboys and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is like a giant set,'' said a Massachusetts friend
who used to call Washington home. What she means is, there's
Washington the Movie, as beautiful a city as you could imagine, but
step outside the radius of ``official'' Washington and there's some
of the most unrelenting crime and poverty in the country. It's
something like ``The Truman Show,'' the movie in which the lead
character thinks he's living a life of nonstop comfort only to find
that his life has been designed as a televised entertainment for
the rest of the world and that he can't escape the TV set.
</P>
<P>
   You can escape it here, but it takes some doing. ``Official''
Washington is steeped in historical grandeur, from its architecture
to its amenities. Charming old hotels usher you into a room with a
stereo system preset to the classical music station; a restaurant
menu offers a mouth-watering replica of dinner in the manner of
Thomas Jefferson. Buildings like the Capitol are breathtakingly
beautiful, inside and out.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy in such a world of comfort and privilege to feel
``Truman''-ized. That seems particularly so for politicians, as if
each one is the star of his ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' there
to do the will of the people even as they get further and further
removed from them. And of course the disconnect works both ways, as
people become disillusioned with a man who imagines there won't be
any negative consequences for using the office of the presidency,
literally, as a trysting place or for congressmen who ignore the
country's sense of what the penalty for such behavior should be.
</P>
<P>
   If, as Neil Gabler suggests in his book ``Life the Movie''
everything in the public eye is becoming a movie, nowhere is that
more evident than on Capitol Hill. As a colleague got out of a cab
at the House of Representatives Friday and saw plots of microphone
banks everywhere (with no shortage of politicians to fill them) and
as a camera turned toward him in case he was somebody, he noted,
``Just like the Oscars.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, though, the movie was ``Dull and Duller'' despite the
import of the proceedings. There were flashes of oratory, certainly
-- Henry Hyde's historical perspective, Charles Schumer's
mythological metaphors, John Lewis's thundering intonations
recalling the calls to conscience of the civil rights movement. The
late Lionel Barrymore would have been perfect to play Hyde, and
Harvey Keitel with a voice transplant could be Barney Frank, but
looking out into the gallery didn't provide much inspiration, in
any regard. Mary Bono, Sonny's widow, moved restlessly across the
chamber, from one representative to another, bringing a smile to
the face of Hyde and every other Republican male she approached.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, this could have been a convention of shoe salesmen,
and to judge from Bob Livingston's Thursday-night confession, even
the straightest-looking of straight arrows here is apt to behave
like a conventioneer. But then, in ``Washington the Movie,''
everyone gets to be Harrison Ford. Perhaps the most astute summary
was offered by California Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren: ``I share with
fellow Americans the feeling of unreality.''

STRIKES A NEW TEST FOR RAYTHEON WEAPONS

<P>
   The ongoing airstrikes against Iraq will test the improvements
Raytheon Co. has made to smart weapons like the Tomahawk cruise
missile, which received mixed reviews for its performance during
the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon is perhaps best known as the producer of the Patriot
air-defense missile, made famous by the earlier conflict. But a
round of acquisitions in 1997 now make Raytheon a main supplier of
offensive weapons to the United States military as well.
</P>
<P>
   With munitions like the Tomahawk and the High-Speed
Antiradiation Missile, or HARM, now in use against Iraq, defense
analysts say the US attacks will show whether Raytheon has fixed
the weapons' earlier shortcomings. For example, a new generation of
Tomahawks is being used in the current attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clearly recognized that there was work to be done (on
the weapons), even though it wasn't always admitted,'' by the
military, said Harvey Sapolsky, a professor at MIT's security
studies program. This time, ``Raytheon is out to show they work,''
said Richard Shultz, who teaches at Tufts University's Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the Gulf War, the Pentagon touted its use of
smart weapons, at one point claiming the Tomahawk had a 98 percent
effectiveness rate.
</P>
<P>
   But a 1997 report by the General Accounting Office found the
Pentagon and weaponsbuilders made overstated or misleading claims
about the effectiveness of those attacks. The GAO noted that the
Pentagon itself had concluded the Tomahawks missed their targets as
often as they found them.
</P>
<P>
   The chief builder of Tomahawk at the time of the reports, Hughes
Electronics Corp., did not respond to the findings. Raytheon, which
acquired the Hughes defense business last year, also declines to
respond to the GAO's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ancient history...that has no bearing on the current
performance'' of the Tomahawk, said Dave Shea, a onetime Hughes
spokesman now in Raytheon Systems Co.'s Arlington, Va.
headquarters. Despite the Pentagon audit suggesting a hit rate
around 50 percent, Raytheon cites older figures showing Tomahawks
struck their targets about 85 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Raytheon has been busy updating the Tomahawk, which
it builds in Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to finding its target with a satellite-based Global
Positioning System instead of pre-programmed radar flight path
maps, the newest Tomahawk missiles include better software allowing
them to fly loops in order to coordinate arrival with that of other
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of greater sophistication is considerable,'' says
Chris Hellman, senior analyst at the Center for Defense
Information, a nonprofit group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With about 3,000 Tomahawks in the Navy's arsenal before the
start of the current air strikes, Raytheon's Shea said the company
doesn't expect the military to replace used Tomahawks with a large
order anytime soon. The weapons cost between $500,000 to $750,000
apiece at current prices.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon, based in Lexington, Mass., also supplies a range of
smart bombs to the military, a business it acquired from Texas
Instruments Inc. in 1997 and is in the process of moving to Tucson.
These include the HARM, now in use against Iraqi missile-defense
sites. Raytheon also produces the Joint Standoff Weapon, a glider
bomb that pilots can launch from up to 50 miles away, and the
Paveway smart bomb, whose effectiveness has also been questioned by
the GAO.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The president, some of his aides say, no longer
picks up the phone late at night as frequently as he used to to
reach out to friends. One friend, who once talked to him daily,
hasn't heard from Clinton since Thanksgiving. Another tells members
of Clinton's inner circle that the president is down and urges them
to call him and get his political fires burning again.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, virtually every night until Christmas Eve there is a
party at the White House. On Thursday it was a glittering dinner
for disabled athletes in the Special Olympics. This weekend, there
are two parties for hundreds of friends and supporters. On Monday,
1,500 members of the Washington press corps _not exactly Bill and
Hillary Clinton's favorite crowd _ will swarm through, bringing
along their children for sleigh rides on the South Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of the disjointed nature of Washington this week,
the nightscope pictures from Baghdad that merged seamlessly with
the raucous daylong impeachment debate in the House Friday and the
whispered asides about how the president is holding up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet real life inevitably intrudes. At the National Capital YMCA,
where many of the city's leading lawyers and lobbyists sweat off
their lunch five blocks from the White House, the television sets
on Thursday night were tuned chiefly to the latest episode of
``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in and out of this city for 30 years and it's the
most bizarre atmosphere I've ever seen,'' one of Clinton's Cabinet
members said over lunch the other day. ``We plod along with the
most normal business in the world _ this morning it was the budgets
and the trade deficit _ and yet you have this sense that you're
watching a bus headed over the cliff, an no one has looked down.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was the air of unreality stronger Friday than in the
White House itself. As scenes of House members debating articles of
impeachment seeped out of television sets in every office, and the
Pentagon announced a third wave of bombing in Iraq, the president
was deep into discussions with the leaders of the European
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The hot subject of their long lunch in the Roosevelt Room?
</P>
<P>
   Bananas.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, Europe's refusal, in America's view, to
comply with a ruling from the World Trade Organization that would
end discrimination against bananas imported by two U.S. firms,
Chiquita Brands International and Dole Food Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird, seriously weird,'' one participant in the
meetings said, reflecting on how Clinton, at a moment of military
action and imminent impeachment, seemed completely engrossed in the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the president tried to change the topic. But Sir
Leon Brittan, the European Union's tenacious trade minister, kept
returning to what, in his plummy, nasal accent, sounded like ``the
bo-non-na problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Clinton finally said, ``the only thing that makes
this discussion almost tolerable is listening to you pronounce
`bo-non-nas.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As the cruise missiles began to explode in Baghdad on Wednesday
night and congressional leaders were still arguing over when to
schedule the impeachment vote, Shi Guangsheng, China's trade
minister, was just settling down to an elegant dinner in the main
hall of the Commerce Department, along with 60 or so U.S. business
executives and Chinese bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William Daley stood up before the first toast
to announce that the bombing had begun. ``Our thoughts and prayers
are with our military personnel and with the people of Iraq,''
Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has opposed the action, and Shi sat expressionless. But
at neighboring tables there were gentle questions about whether
Clinton would survive _ and if he did, whether he would be so
weakened the China should not count on striking any big deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand,'' said Deng Zhan, one of Shi's aides. ``He
seems like a very capable president. He wants to understand China.
Why are you doing this?''
</P>
<P>
   If the ghost of Andrew Johnson haunts Washington, it is
doubtless wandering around the third floor of the Treasury
Building, just across from the East Wing of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The suite that Johnson operated out of for weeks after the
Lincoln assassination is now the office of the undersecretary of
Treasury international affairs _ ground zero in the recent
financial crisis. On the walls are the magazine illustrations of
Johnson meeting foreign delegations and congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just went on conducting the business of the country,'' one
Treasury official deadpanned the other day, repeating the White
House mantra about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There is one issue that seems to unify embittered Democrats and
Republicans, embattled aides at the White House, and despairing
members of the Cabinet. It boils down to this: Get me out of here.
</P>
<P>
   A senior member of the National Security Council said he planned
to get in his car as soon as the bombing stops and ``toss my cell
phone into the middle of the Beltway, where with any luck it will
be crushed by an 18-wheeler.''

   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, was not exactly glued to
his television on Friday as the House debated impeaching President
Clinton. The small Sony in DeWine's spacious Capitol Hill office
was not even turned on for most of the afternoon while the senator
presided over a marathon staff meeting.
</P>
<P>
   As for the final impeachment vote scheduled for Saturday, DeWine
expects to be watching his 11-year-old son play basketball instead.
``I'm not going to sit here and spend eight or 12 hours watching,''
he said. ``Life goes on and I've got a big agenda. I just don't
have the luxury of time for that.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 100 senators who would be jurors in the trial of William
Jefferson Clinton if the House impeached him, as seems virtually
certain, Friday's all-day debate was a bit like background music at
an elegant restaurant. A few paid rapt attention, but most seemed
to be listening with barely half an ear as they busied themselves
instead with legislative matters, constituent meetings and holiday
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really not paying that much attention'' to the debate,
said Mary Healy, a spokeswoman for Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore. ``He's
fulfilling his duties as a senator. Once it comes to the Senate,
then he'll have to pay closer attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Smith, most senators spent their days in their home
districts, catching only snippets of the debate on car radios or
office televisions as they rushed between meetings or family
obligations. Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., devoted his day to
visiting with grandchildren, a spokeswoman said. Sen. Jeff
Sessions, R-Ala., was too busy traveling on business and packing up
a house he has just sold to watch the debate, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who split his day
between New York City and Washington, was not expected to see any
of the debate because, as a rule, he rarely watches television.
``He'll probably watch `McNeil-Lehrer' and then read about it in
the newspapers tomorrow,'' said Tony Bullock, Moynihan's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a number of senators said they watched the debate
closely. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said she snapped on the
television set at home the moment she arose Friday morning, and
even took a radio with her when she went for a midmorning walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last act for some of them,'' said Ms. Boxer, a
former House member who showed an alumnus's fascination with the
performances of several former colleagues who are retiring this
year. ``I feel sad that it had to be devoted to this.''
</P>
<P>
   One senator-to-be had a box seat for Friday's debate: Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who will enter the Senate in January.
After delivering a floor speech on Friday morning opposing
impeachment, Schumer marched back to his office and listened to the
debate as he packed files for the move to the Senate side of
Capitol Hill. He was not much impressed by what he heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not the House in its finest hour,'' said Schumer, who
plans to vote against conviction in the Senate. ``It was very
partisan, and going over old ground.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While House members were pounding fists and expressing partisan
outrage across the street, DeWine spent his day ensconced in the
Russell office building, meeting with aides to discuss several
months' worth of legislative work.
</P>
<P>
   While DeWine munched on saltines and sipped homemade
cheese-and-broccoli soup, his aides briefed him about an upcoming
trip to Haiti, anti-drug legislation, and programs to fight hunger
in Africa. ``You want to do the rest of the world now?'' asked his
legislative director, Robert Hoffman, after they finished
discussing Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine said that he had directed aides to watch the entire
impeachment debate and interrupt him if there were significant
developments. But by 2 o'clock, the aide had yet to break into the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., also said an aide was watching the
debate, listening for particularly insightful arguments.
</P>
<P>
   But Chafee, who was in Washington for most of the day, said he
had not had much time to listen to the debate himself. And as for
the vote on Saturday, he sounded an uncertain note about whether he
would be watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the Saturday before Christmas,'' he said. ``Like
everybody else, I'm way behind in my Christmas shopping.''

   MANAMA, Bahrain _ More than half of the U.S. strike aircraft at
ground bases in the Persian Gulf region have been kept out of the
attack on Iraq because of objections from Saudi Arabia, Western
military officers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100 fighters and bombers at bases in the region, only
those in Kuwait and Oman had joined in the campaign by Friday
evening, the Western officers said. They include four B-1 bombers
in Oman, the first time those advanced aircraft have joined in a
combat operation.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the force, about 60 F-16 and F-15 fighters, have
been effectively grounded in Saudi Arabia, which has repeatedly
refused to permit attacks against Baghdad to be launched from its
soil. Saudi Arabia was the main base of U.S. operations against
Iraq during the 1991 war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not asked the Saudis for permission to use aircraft
from their bases,'' Capt. Michael Shavers, an Air Force spokesman,
said by telephone from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. That is because the
answer would have been no, Western officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The episode has underscored the limitations on U.S. military
operations in the region, where anger over the U.S.-led attack was
vented in the verbal bombardment printed in many newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Arab Emirates, the daily al-Khaleef called the air
strikes an act of ``blatant aggression,'' and urged other to follow
the Emirates in demanding an immediate end to the attack. ``Letting
it pass without a stand means that the Arabs have become a whipping
boy for the American empire,'' the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 13 months, U.S. officials including Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen have
paid repeated visits to Saudi Arabia to discuss Iraq and its
refusal to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   But the Saudis have been so clear in their opposition to
permitting Saudi-based planes to attack Iraq that the U.S.
emissaries stopped asking permission months ago. As recently as
last month, the defense minister, Prince Sultan, reiterated the
Saudi view. The Saudis say little publicly to explain their
reasoning, and Saudi officials have made no public comment about
the raids. While the Saudis were determined to oust Iraq from
Kuwait, they apparently are sensitive about punishing a nation when
there is no territory in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have sought to gloss over the dispute, saying
they are confident that Saudi Arabia, a key ally, would provide any
support needed by the United States. In fact, Saudi Arabia has
allowed KC-130 refueling aircraft based in the kingdom to service
other strike aircraft planes on their way to and from Iraq, Western
military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is the purpose of having all that firepower there if it
can't be used?'' once Western military official said, reflecting
military complaining that the United States spends heavily to
protect the Saudis, but it is deprived of full access to that
weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi objections have made the United States rely on
aircraft on the Navy carrier Enterprise that is less-advanced
militarily. It is being used to back up what has been primarily a
cruise-missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy dependence on cruise missiles reflects the advantages
of those weapons, Western officers said. Hundreds of those missiles
were launched in the first two nights of the attack, both from Navy
vessels in the Gulf and from about 15 B-52 bombers based on the
British island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike aircraft, the missiles are unmanned, and so their use
greatly minimizes the risk of U.S. casualties.
</P>
<P>
   But even on the first night of the attack, F-14 and F-18 fighter
aircraft were launched from the Enterprise at the rate of one a
minute, officers on board the Navy vessel have said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that those aircraft-together with some two dozen F-16
and A-10 fighters from Kuwait and that the four B-1s from Oman have
been used to reinforce the cruise missile attacks have made clear
that U.S. military planners believe that unmanned strikes alone are
not sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Citing what they called ``host-nation sensitivities,'' Capt.
Shavers and officers at the U.S. Central Command declined to
provide a precise breakdown of where U.S. warplanes in the region
are based. But other Western officers said they understood that
Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia where the only Gulf countries where
U.S. fighters and bombers are currently based.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia is not the only American ally bordering Iraq whose
reluctance has limited U.S. options. Turkey, to Iraq's immediate
north, has also signaled reservations about attacks on Iraq, and
none of the several dozen U.S. fighter planes has joined in the
current air campaign.

   NEW YORK _ Investors seemed nonchalant Friday as the debate on
the impeachment of President Clinton got under way and the bombing
of Iraq continued. Stocks rose, with the Nasdaq index surging 2
percent to a new high, while the other major indexes rose modestly.
Bond prices inched higher while the dollar slipped.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, even with the surprise attack on Iraq and the
sudden certainty that the House of Representatives would vote to
impeach the president, stocks rose, bond prices inched higher and
the dollar gained against European currencies, although it fell
against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street worries about one thing and that is the outlook
for the economy,'' said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis
at A.G. Edwards Inc. in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country will do just as well if Al Gore is president for
the next several years. But if you told me that chairman Greenspan
had an unhappy home life I would be worried,'' he said, referring
to Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts think that the markets have had time to react to
the prospect of an impeachment vote against Clinton and are not
worried because it is assumed the Senate cannot muster the
two-thirds vote to remove him from office. But that does not mean
there won't be some reaction Monday after the expected vote Friday
_ especially if people begin to doubt Clinton's ability survive a
Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq index jumped to its first new high since Dec. 9,
rising 42.26 points to 2,086.14. It was up 2.8 percent for the
week. New optimism on future earnings for the likes of Intel, up 3
1/8 to 120, and Cisco Systems, up 5 9/16 to 90 7/16, pushed the
index higher. ``You are seeing better than expected earnings and
estimates going up,'' said Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer
at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 27.81 points, or
three-tenths of one percent, to 8,903.63. It has been lagging in
comparison to the Nasdaq and Standard &AMP; Poor's index in recent
performance because it is short on technology stocks and heavy with
industrials like Caterpillar, Boeing, and Minnesota, Mining and
Manufacturing, all of which have issued earnings warnings recently.
For the week, the Dow rose nine-tenths of one percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 8.05 points, or
seven-tenths of one percent, to 1,188.03. It is just three-tenths
of one percent below its all-time high while the Dow is 5 percent
from its peak. For the week, the S&AMP;P is up 1.8 percent. The Russell
index of 2,000 smaller company stocks finished up 3.64 points, or
nine-tenths of one percent, at 397.42. For the week, it was up just
five-tenths of one percent.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly expiration of stock futures, stock index futures
and stock index options added to trading volume but did not lead to
volatile trading Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, prices were little changed. The price of the
30-year bond rose 4/32 to 103 28/32 while the yield, which moves in
the opposite direction, inched down to 5.00 percent from 5.01
percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar fell to 115.61 Japanese yen from 116.13 Thursday
while it ended at 1.6641 German marks, down from 1.6681.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Fand, senior foreign exchange strategist at Bank Boston,
said the dollar's fall came in light trading. He said the declines
were really just a give back of the `knee-jerk'' gains the dollar
made on Wednesday, when an attack on Iraq by the United States and
Britain became a possibility. The actual attack was announced in
the late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Fand said that currency traders are more worried about the
impact of impeachment on the dollar than bond and stock traders.
Some think, he said, that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who has
championed the administration's strong-dollar policy, would resign
if Clinton is seriously weakened by an impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   The main concern for equity investors now appears to be
corporate earnings. Despite the improved outlook for some
technology sectors, more and more forecasts are showing a slowdown
or a decline as American economic growth eases next year. Corporate
earnings declined in the third quarter but the two main compilers
of forecasts, First Call Corp. and IBES International, are split on
the outlook for the current quarter. IBES is showing a 1.4 percent
decline and First Call a 3.4 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   But both numbers have weakened in the last week after new
earnings warnings from several companies. The IBES forecast is down
1 percentage point from last week's three-tenths of one percent
decline and First Call is off nine-tenths of one percent from a 4.3
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Friday, Merck was off 3 7/16 to 44 1/2, and 3M was
down 2 1/2 to to 70 3/4. Both made negative earnings announcements
in the last two weeks. Caterpillar, which warned about earnings
this week, rose 3/4 to 41 7/8.

IRAQI LEADERSHIP DEFIANT AS ATTACKS CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD _ The US and British missile attacks on Iraq intensified
early Saturday after pounding the heart of Saddam Hussein's regime,
leaving a trail of destruction at southern positions of the
Republican Guard, oil refineries in Basra, TV transmitters near
Baghdad, and presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
   An angry and besieged Iraqi leadership responded by sharply
redrawing diplomatic lines, and making it apparent that the UN
weapons inspectors would not return to Iraq unless harsh economic
sanctions were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   A defiant Saddam appeared in a taped statement Friday night
aired on a Qatar-based television network, telling the Iraqi
people, ``You must thank God for your success, and continue
resistance. We are the people of good morality. We are not going to
compromise to the other side of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the words of defiance, Pentagon officials said they have
been struck by the lack of military resistance from Iraqi forces.
The United States denied Iraqi claims that more than 77 US cruise
missiles had been shot down.
</P>
<P>
   The streaking red tracers and rattle of Iraqi anti-aircraft fire
over Baghdad in the predawn hours were noticeably shortlived
compared with the resistance offered in the previous two days of US
missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Following through on President Clinton's promise to step up a
campaign aimed at toppling Saddam, US military jets also dropped
leaflets on Iraqi forces in southern Iraq telling them not to worry
about being targeted unless they are defending what they referred
to as ``the Baghdad regime,'' according to Voice of America
broadcasts heard in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflets also warned the forces not to threaten moderate
states in the region, Defense Secretary William Cohen and Joint
Chiefs of Staff Gen. Henry H. Shelton told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said the raids, which were a response to a U.N. report
this week that Iraq had failed to live up to its promise to
cooperate with arms inspectors, were now gathering steam.
</P>
<P>
   If there were any doubts about Clinton's vow for ``sustained''
attacks, they have been dismissed. Already more US cruise missiles
have been launched in Operation Desert Fox, as the attacks have
been dubbed, than the 289 fired at Iraq in the 1991 Persian Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference in Baghdad, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said that UNSCOM chief Richard Butler weapons ``has
killed his job'' by ``preparing the grounds for this aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz said that the US and British attacks were orchestrated
through Butler via a report to the UN Security Council that, Aziz
claimed, falsely accused Iraq of not cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   In his November speech at the end of the previous standoff with
Iraq, Clinton called off an air strike and gave Iraq a last chance
to comply. At that time he warned that if there were any other
violations, the US would attack without warning. In that speech,
Clinton acknowledged that if sustained US strikes are undertaken
that it would probably be the end of UNSCOM's work in Iraq. That
now seems to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq will not tolerate UNSCOM and sanctions at the same
time,'' said Aziz. ``If they want to keep the sanctions, let them
leave UNSCOM in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz stressed that Iraq fulfilled its responsibility in
accordance with the spirit of the letter it sent to the UN
secretary-general on Nov. 14 and that Unscom has carried out
hundreds of inspections since then. Aziz added that Iraqi
authorities had cooperated with inspectors despite
``provocations.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz also expressed anger that the United States and Britain
have attacked targets that have wounded civilians. He described
sustained missile strikes causing vast damage:
</P>
<P>
   A warehouse belonging to the ministry of trade was hit. Four
warehouses in Baghdad holding 1,000 tons of cotton were destroyed
by a cruise missile. The targets also included an oil refinery in
the southern port city of Basrah and the old ministry of defense
building in downtown Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The targets seem aimed at degrading Saddam's military machinery
as well as his grip on the civilian society.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz said attacks on civilian targets were ``sinister.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The collateral damage on the ministry of defense led to the
nearby destruction of hospitals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters Friday were taken to see the hospital, which had blown
out windows and moderate damage from the nearby attack. But there
were no reports of injuries to patients.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi health ministry announced Thursday that at least 25
people have died during the attacks and 75 have been wounded in
Baghdad, but a complete casualty toll has not been announced. The
bombings in the southern cities of Basrah and Saddam's hometown of
Tikrit were certain to have caused some casualties but Iraqi
officials offered no official accounting of dead or wounded.
</P>
<P>
   At the Al Yarmouk Hospital, among Iraq's largest hospitals and
located in the Western part of the city, officials Friday said they
had received approximately 13 people who arrived at the hospital
dead on arrival during the first two days of attacks. They said
they had treated a total of 34 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital was once a crown jewel in Iraq's formerly advanced
and now crippled medical infrastructure. The hospitals are hard hit
by the crushing economic sanctions imposed in the aftermath of the
1991 Gulf War. At the entrance there are large painted signs that
read, ``Down, Down, USA.''
</P>
<P>
   In the emergency and surgical wards, those wounded lay in
rusting cots amid the bleak conditions of the hospital. Among them
was Muhsin Hadi, 20, who said he was walking home from his job
selling cigarettes on Thursday night when US cruise missiles
pounded a seven-story military industrial building in the heart of
downtown Baghdad. The blast blew him off his feet, he said, and
sent shards of shrapnel into his abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can America do this?'' he asked. ``They say they hit only
military targets, but they hit people, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the surgical ward, Jasem Zubati, 41, was listed in serious,
but stable condition with head wounds and a fractured verterbrae.
With bandages wrapped around his head and in obvious pain, he
described how his home in the Al Adel section of Baghdad was hit by
a missile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It crashed through the back of our house, right into the
kitchen,'' said Zubati, a well-to-do engineer who has profited from
an import business under the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter visited the home, and saw the evidence of the damage.
There was a large crater in the rear of the house, and broken
kitchen appliances were stacked in the front of the house. Zubati
said his injuries came when the roof of his home, where he lived
with his wife and three children, caved in. He has a three-week old
son. None of them were injured, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is my house a secret, military location? Have I done anything
to America?'' he asked, shaking with anger and pain. ``I will
avenge myself if it takes 40 years. I will ask Saddam to take
revenge. I have great hatred for your government.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained difficult Friday for reporters to assess the full
extent of the damage. The Ministry of Information forbids reporters
from traveling without a government ``minder'' accompanying them,
and no reporters have been permitted to travel outside Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Angry that the attacks seemed aimed directly at the heart of the
Iraqi leader's personal power base, Aziz said virtually all of the
sites had been inspected and heavily monitored by UN arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They attack presidential sites, they are guest houses built by
the Iraqis, they are fine buildings, they just want to destroy
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz made repeated references to the impeachment proceedings
engulfing Clinton's presidency and fixating both the American and
Iraqi people. He said that Clinton ``lied to his own people'' and
that he was now ``lying about Iraq to justify this aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can the Americn people believe a man who has lied to his
own people, to the Congress. He lies to his nation and tells the
truth about Iraq? How can that be? How can we swallow that? These
are lies, cheap lies,'' said Aziz.

   WASHINGTON _ The Republican Party's standing with the public has
dropped significantly, matching its lowest rating in the past 14
years, as the House moves toward a vote on impeaching President
Clinton, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   While impeachment by the House now appears all but inevitable,
half the public still expects some other outcome, suggesting at
least the possibility of further erosion in the Republican party's
image when the reality of the second impeachment in American
history sinks in.
</P>
<P>
   Six in 10 Americans said Republicans in Congress were out of
touch with the public's wishes on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The public's opposition to impeachment _ 62 percent said they
wanted their representative to vote against it _ is reflected in
every sector of society: every region, every age group, every
income group, with the exception of self-described Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs that public opinion could prove treacherous for
Clinton in the weeks ahead: About four in 10 Americans believe that
if the House sends articles of impeachment to the Senate for trial,
it would be better for the country for Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in many ways, the poll found remarkable stability in
public opinion across a year of turmoil and scandal. The public
continues to distinguish between the man and the president: as in
January when the Monica Lewinsky scandal was first disclosed,
Americans are critical of his personal character and give him high
marks for his performance in office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's job approval rating stands in sharp contrast to that
of President Richard M. Nixon after the House Judiciary Committee
recomended his impeachment: 65 percent approved of Clinton's job
performance this week, while only 24 percent held that view of
Nixon just before his resignation in 1974, as the House moved
toward an impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was based on telephone interviews conducted
nationwide with 1,666 adults on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, and
another 326 on Thursday, after Clinton ordered the bombing of Iraq.
The margin of sampling error for the entire poll is plus or minus
two percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that, at least in this snapshot of public
opinion, Republicans have paid a heavy price for their aggressive
pursuit of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of Americans who held a favorable view of the
party was at its lowest level in the 14 years that the New York
Times/CBS News Poll has been asking the question, matching the
level recorded in early 1996 after a budget impasse resulted in a
partial shutdown of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The party's image worsened as the week progressed: 42 percent of
respondents had a favorable opinion of the Republicans early in the
week; that dropped to 33 percent among people polled on Thursday,
as the reality of impeachment set in among the public and
Washington grappled with the remarkable confluence of crises at
home and abroad. The margin of sampling error for the one-night
finding was plus or minus 6 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the number of people holding a favorable view of
the Democratic party held steady over the week at 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By a ratio of more than two-to-one, Americans said the
impeachment vote should have been postponed while the United States
is engaged in military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed that, by a ratio of two-to-one, Americans
believe that the timing of the air strikes had more to do with the
need to respond quickly to Saddam Hussein's defiance of U.N.
weapons inspectors than with any effort by Clinton to divert
attention from impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, designed to measure day-to-day shifts in public
opinion during this climactic week, found that the public was only
just beginning to recognize that the House was on the verge of
impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 31 percent of those responding said they expected the
House to impeach the president, with 50 percent predicting that the
matter would be resolved through a compromise such as censure.
</P>
<P>
   By the eve of the expected impeachment, only half of Americans
expected it to actually occur; the rest still foresaw some lesser
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The public did, however, want to see some punishment for the
president. Fifty-four percent said Congress should censure Clinton
for what he has done, an option that the Republican leaders have
consistently refused to permit.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the opposition to impeachment was that even
Republicans were divided over it, with 76 percent of self-described
conservative Republicans favoring, while all other Republicans were
split, with 49 percent in favor and 41 percent opposed.
</P>
<P>
   With much of the public neither expecting nor wanting Clinton to
be impeached, the survey suggested that public opinion could be
particularly volatile in coming days and weeks as the import of the
House's action sinks in.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bob Livingston, the incoming speaker of the House,
took no public role Friday as the debate unfolded on whether to
impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   His previous 24 hours had been his most visible in the month
since his party nominated him as speaker and perhaps the most
excruciating in his public career: He spent most of the day in a
chaotic procedural wrangle over the terms of Friday's debate; he
ended it by telling his Republican colleagues that he had had
extramarital affairs during his 20-year tenure in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   His disclosure followed an investigation by Larry Flynt,
publisher of Hustler, the sex magazine, who said Friday at a news
conference in Beverly Hills, Calif., that his publication had
learned that Livingston had had adulterous affairs during the last
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt said earlier this year that he wanted to expose the
``hypocrisy'' of those in Washington who are investigating Clinton
and in October offered $1 million to anyone who could prove they
had had affairs with members of Congress. He said Friday that this
larger investigation, to be published perhaps as soon as January,
would reveal what he described as indiscretions of several other
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had no connection with the White House but that he
had hired an investigative firm based in Washington and made up of
former employees of the FBI and the CIA. He would not confirm
whether the firm is Terry Lenzner's Investigative Group Inc., which
has done work for the president's private lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston was unavailable to reporters Friday. He spent some
time Friday morning sprawled in a chair in the back of the House
chamber, listening to the debate over whether to impeach Clinton
for lying about his own sexual indiscretions. Several colleagues
knelt at Livingston's knee, whispered to him and patted him on the
back.
</P>
<P>
   He spent most of the day in a private office off the chamber,
avoiding the gauntlet of reporters who lay in wait for him between
the House and his regular office across the street. The only word
out of his aides was that the Navy had awarded contracts worth
millions of dollars for ships to be built in his Louisiana district
at the Avondale Shipyards.
</P>
<P>
   During Friday's debate, a handful of Democrats made only oblique
allusions to human failures. For example, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.,
said: ``Let he that has no sin cast the first stone. Who, who among
us has not sinned?''
</P>
<P>
   But no one said that Livingston's disclosure or the mild
Democratic attempts to exploit it would influence their votes on
impeachment. Rather, on the House floor and in hallway chitchat,
Livingston's conduct seemed to be the last thing that either
Republicans or Democrats wanted to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Livingston is a first-rate human being,'' said Rep. David
Obey, D-Wis., who has worked closely and sparred with Livingston on
the Appropriations Committee, in an interview. ``I will repeat what
the nuns taught me at St. James a long time ago: We would all be a
hell of a lot better off looking after our own souls rather than
trying to evaluate somebody else's. None of us have any business
even having an opinion on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even conservative Republicans seemed ready to overlook the
disclosure. ``We're not going to say, `Bob, you can't be speaker
because you violated your vows with your wife,''' said Rep. Lindsey
Graham, R-S.C. Like many, including Livingston, Graham
distinguished Livingston's conduct from Clinton's by saying that
the president had ``trampled'' on the legal system whereas
Livingston's behavior was strictly private.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Flynt's claims, many Republicans blamed the Clinton
administration for smearing Livingston, although they offered no
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just happening on its own,'' said Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher, R- Calif.

<P>
   A sense of desperation attends the decision to launch the latest
wave of air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The man who took the decision, Bill Clinton, was facing an
imminent vote in the House of Representatives on his impeachment;
what better way to show that he was worthy of the office of
President of the United States than to exercise, in a statesmanlike
way, the authority it gives him as commander-in-chief of his
country's armed forces?
</P>
<P>
   The man against whom the decision was taken, Saddam Hussein, is
desperate too, constrained by sanctions, dogged by arms inspectors,
hated by everyone and, eight years after the end of the Gulf war,
still without hope of shaking off his pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   As for the wider world _ in different degrees frightened of
Hussein, worried about the spread of weapons of mass destruction,
apprehensive about the use of force against a sovereign country _
it too has grown exasperated, ever more conscious that the Iraqi
dictator presents problems that never seem to go away and that have
no straightforward solution.
</P>
<P>
   If all this is unsatisfactory, so too perhaps was the trigger
for Operation Desert Fox, a report by Richard Butler, the head of
the team of U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   This showed that Hussein had not fully cooperated with the
UNSCOM inspectors, as he had promised to, but it was not
unambiguously clear that his lack of cooperation had in fact been
designed to prevent UNSCOM from doing its job.
</P>
<P>
   Another, awkwardly plausible interpretation is that Hussein's
obstructiveness may have been designed to stop the inspectors, and
the Israelis to whom he assumes they pass all the information they
gather, from learning about all sorts of secrets not directly
related to weapons-making.
</P>
<P>
   Still, America _ and Britain, which has also joined the
operation _ had always said that any failure by Hussein to keep his
word would bring an attack, without further ado, and the Iraqi
therefore commands little real sympathy, whatever the public
denunciations of the decision to launch the air strikes by China,
Russia, some Arabs and, to a lesser extent, France.
</P>
<P>
   Even Arab sympathizers lost patience with Hussein on the last
occasion, in November, when he stopped cooperating with the U.N.,
and most people, whether friend or foe of Iraq, must have felt that
there was an inevitability about these strikes.
</P>
<P>
   That they should have come now, at Clinton's hour of need _ just
as an earlier strike, in August, against an apparently innocent
factory in Sudan came at another hour of need for the American
president _ is unfortunate, to say the least. Yet they should be
judged, in the end, on their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   If they succeed in achieving their stated aim, that will be
welcome. But merely to ``degrade Saddam's capacity to develop and
deliver weapons of mass destruction and to degrade his ability to
threaten his neighbors,'' is not ambitious, and will not solve the
long-run problem.
</P>
<P>
   This, as Clinton and other American officials have been making
ever more explicitly clear, is Hussein himself.
</P>
<P>
   No one can be sure how, or when, Hussein will leave office. He
could be thrown out tomorrow, or hang on, as Fidel Castro has in
Cuba, to infuriate American presidents for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   But if this round of air strikes should prove to be the lever
that prises him from power, the world will surely judge them a
success. It may even swallow some of its cynicism about the man who
ordered them at such a fortuitous time. &QL;

By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Just as moviemakers know the holidays are
the best time to roll out blockbuster films, publishers realize
Christmas is the season to peddle books.
</P>
<P>
   How else do you explain another, um, literary effort from a TV
comedian like Ray Romano.
</P>
<P>
   Sports books, naturally, are front and center on bookstore
shelves. What else do you get a fan who already owns a pair of
officially licensed team boxer shorts and a big-screen TV?
</P>
<P>
   Why, a book.
</P>
<P>
   But there are so many out there, and every shopper has a budget.
To that end, here are some of the top titles, with a brief synopsis
on each, to aid that last-minute shopping:
</P>
<P>
   ``King of the World''
</P>
<P>
   A book about Muhammad Ali, but not just another book about Ali.
David Remnick, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994 for ``Lenin's
Tomb'', offers the best sports read of the season, placing the rise
of the young Cassius Clay in the context of his times _ both in the
boxing world and in society at large. The event at the center of
the book is the Clay-Sonny Liston fight in 1964 in Miami, a
watershed moment that had a profound impact on race relations and
American culture. Remnick was granted an extensive interview with
Ali at his West Michigan home, and the result is a unique insight
into the champ. Remnick writes like a dream and the pages just fly.
A worthy gift for non-sports fans, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reflections of the Game (Lives in Baseball)''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran sports photographer Ron Modra uses his camera and,
occasionally his pen, to reflect on great and not-so-great baseball
players and moments of the past two decades. Modra's keen eye
captures scenes far beyond the standard headfirst-slide shots. His
keen ear senses special situations.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, a photo of a long-retired Mickey Mantle,
sitting alone in the stands of a baseball park in Florida one hot
summer morning. Muses Mantle: ``God, I wish I could still play.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny shots abound, like one of St. Louis Cardinals' mascot Fred
Bird, in full costume, fast-food cartons lying at his feet, sitting
in a locker room and sipping a soft drink as he reads a paper
spread out on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Bonus for Rangers fans: The cover photo of Pudge Rodriguez is
arresting.
</P>
<P>
   Former ballplayer-turned-writer Pat Jordan contributes an essay
on his time in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Love of the Game''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's life story in pix and text, in his own words.
Most of this ground has been plowed before, not surprising given
the media glare Jordan has been under his entire career. But it's
still kind of fun to read his views on Jerry Reinsdorf and Jerry
Krause, whom he dismisses as ``businessmen, not sportsmen.''
</P>
<P>
   The photos are keepers, though, particularly the ones of the
young Jordan, back when he had hair and shorter shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aikman: Mind, Body and Soul''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys quarterback's version of ``For the Love of the
Game''. Lots of original photos of Aikman in and out of games, some
working out, some just sitting on a lawn relaxing. The first-person
story, however, is even less personally revealing than Jordan's
book. You know you're not going to get much inside information when
the first sentence of the book is Troy telling you the date and
place he was born.
</P>
<P>
   There are also lines like this one: ``We \Rthe Cowboys\S feel we
are at our best when we are running and throwing the ball
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   And, ``I've always felt that for me to be at my best, I needed
to keep in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The most telling passage might be the one where Aikman talks
about his coaches, saying every one, from Terry Donahue on down,
``influenced my career in different ways.'' He skips right over
Barry Switzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pros and Cons (The Criminals Who Play in the NFL)''
</P>
<P>
   The work of investigative reporters Jeff Benedict and Don
Yaeger, ``Pros and Cons'' isn't exactly the kind of book to get you
in the Yule mood. Meticulously researched, it quantifies the extent
of criminal behavior among pro football players. Using police
reports and court records, Yaeger and Benedict spell out in graphic
detail the various beatings and assaults perpetrated by some NFL
players on their victims.
</P>
<P>
   The authors write that these accounts ``will shock and frighten
you.'' The sad thing is that many readers won't be shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Total Hockey (The Official Encyclopedia of The National Hockey
League)''
</P>
<P>
   Now, why didn't somebody think to do this before? Records of
every one of nearly 5,000 NHL players, but lots more, including
origins and history of the game, explanations of hockey strategy
and biographies. In sum, everything you'd want to know about the
game _ in an 1,878-page package. So, don't send this one in the
mail.

THIS TIME IT'S FOR CROWN AND GLORY

 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. _ It's the dream match everyone in women's
volleyball circles has been waiting for since, well, late in the
summer when the season started and both teams were laying claim to
being No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach State vs. Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Finally.
</P>
<P>
   These two undefeated, unmarked, unfazed 35-0 powerhouses will
resolve their differences here this afternoon and decide, once and
for all, which one deserves to be the national champion.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed to be the first time in NCAA tournament history
that teams with perfect records will meet in a title match.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's hard to envision Brian Gimmillaro's high-leaping,
high-energy, high-scoring assassins losing to anyone, especially
after their latest exclamation point masterpiece here Thursday
evening when they swept past the Florida Gators, 15-2, 15-8 and
15-10, before the largest crowd ever to watch an NCAA women's
volleyball match, 12,327, at the Kohl Center.
</P>
<P>
   But who knows for sure?
</P>
<P>
   After all, this will be a long-awaited confrontation between the
two teams who thoroughly have dominated their sport throughout the
season, a classic Ali-Frazier, Lakers-Celtics matchup between foes
brimming with talent, pride, confidence and momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting all season to play Penn State, and I think
a lot of other people also have been waiting for the match,'' said
Gimmillaro.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we've been waiting for,'' said Misty May, summing
up her team's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Misty May would want to cap her dazzling career with
her first NCAA title, as much as she and her teammates want to
atone for the disappointment they suffered a year ago in this
tournament in their semifinal loss to Stanford, there is no one on
this Long Beach team who wants to win this title more than Brian
Gimmillaro.
</P>
<P>
   He's been pulling out all the motivational ploys to make sure
his players are at an emotional peak for this one, from driving
them relentlessly at practices to reminding them constantly of the
NCAA's alleged bias against them to even showing them a video in
the dressing room before Thursday's semifinal of the final minutes
and post-game celebration of last Friday's match against the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As if Long Beach needed any added help against the beleaguered
Gators, the 49er associate athletic director, Cindy Masner, hired
the University of Wisconsin band to perform for the 49ers during
their execution of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Adorned in 49er garb, the Badger musicians started off playing
``On Wisconsin,'' but also played the 49ers' fight song on an
evening when the 49ers once again dazzled an audience with their
spikes, digs, blocks and teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Misty May was brilliant and this is a recording. She
recorded her sixth triple double of the season 32 assists, 11 kills
and 15 digs.
</P>
<P>
   And imagine how well she would have played had she actually been
at peak health!
</P>
<P>
   According to Gimmillaro afterward, May and several other 49er
players were hampered by colds and wore down as the late-starting
match it didn't begin here until 10:15 didn't conclude until 15
minutes before midnight, Central Standard Time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started off well, but we got tired in the last couple of
games because a lot of our players aren't feeling well,'' said
Gimmillaro, who did not hide his displeasure at having to play such
a late-night affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little ridiculous that college students have to start a
match this late in the evening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it made any difference.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers ran their game-winning streak to 67. They haven't lost
one since a setback on Oct. 2 to USC.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it won't be easy for the 49ers against a resilient Penn
State team that isn't as flashy or as explosive as Long Beach is
there any team in college volleyball that is? but might be superior
defensively and might be just as disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, for the first time since Oct. 10, the Nittany Lions actually
lost a game Thursday night against Nebraska a 15-8 setback in the
third game but in between they beat the `Huskers by scores of
15-11, 15-8 and 15-11.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State's All American setter, Bonnie Bremer, might not be
Misty May, but she does many of the same impressive things for a
team that has three powerful hitters in Lauren Cicciamani, Christy
Cochran and Carrie Schonveld.
</P>
<P>
   It's a team that doesn't beat itself, and seems able to come up
with one deft dig after another, which it will have to do against a
49er team that never stopped attacking.
</P>
<P>
   But this 49ers are special.
</P>
<P>
   They might have been ailing Thursday night, and they might have
got sleep-eyed as the night went on.
</P>
<P>
   But the end result was the same another one-sided victory.
</P>
<P>
   And now they need one more to secure their legacy.

 &HT;    Economic history provides few clues on impeachment's mark on
markets
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Richard Nixon's era doesn't provide Wall Street with a
clear picture of what to expect in case of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The market fell 27.6 percent in 1974, the year Nixon resigned
before the full House could vote on the issue. But the state of the
economy gets more blame for the market's decline than political
turmoil. The Arab oil embargo had triggered a recession _ and
inflation. Wholesale prices in July 1974 jumped by what was the
equivalent of a 44 percent annual increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad economic environment,'' said Donald Ratajczak,
director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you compare the two periods, we didn't know what to
do then. This time around, we think we are driving the (economy)
ship. It's not the same kind of negative time, when we were asking,
`What in the world can we do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices were behind the economic problems, but Nixon's
troubles may have contributed to what happened, Ratajczak said,
because people were leaving his administration. ``Nixon had an
incredibly competent Treasury, and they (top officials) all started
to run.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment process didn't go entirely unnoticed on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, July 27, the House Judiciary Committee voted to
impeach Nixon. On Monday, the Dow fell 13.68 points, or 1.7
percent, to 770.89. Inflation worries and ``uneasiness over
impeachment'' were cited in a Associated Press stock market story.
</P>
<P>
   The uneasiness would continue into early August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every move the market made seemed once again to be dictated by
unfolding events surrounding the question of impeachment and
President Nixon's future in office,'' the Associated Press said of
trading on Tuesday, Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Aug. 9, Nixon resigned. The next day, the stock
market slipped, but by less than 1 percent, and the volume was
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood is one of apathy,'' said one London stockbroker
describring trading to the Associated Press. Brokers in the United
States concluded that investors had already absorbed Nixon's
resignation, and were waiting on the sidelines to see what his
successor, Gerald Ford, would do.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's resignation, said Ratajczak, ``cleared the air.'' The
same thing would be accomplished if President Clinton resigned, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, Ratajczak said, would be ``down on the day of his
resignation, and then up.

NO DAVIS CUP FOR No. 1 SAMPRAS 
 (bl) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pete Sampras does not consider himself a political animal, but
after bypassing 1998 Davis Cup duty as part of his successful quest
to finish the year at No. 1 for a record-breaking sixth straight
season, he has confirmed that his 1999 Davis Cup policy will again
be hard-line: he will not play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the slams and staying No. 1, that's my priority,''
Sampras said Thursday night from Los Angeles, ``and I feel if I try
to play Davis Cup, those other things will be in jeopardy. I'm in a
special situation here with these records, and I hope people can
understand that, though I know some won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' services for the first round of Davis Cup in
Birmingham, England, on April 2-4 had been sought by Tom Gullikson,
the U.S. captain. Not only does the United States face a daunting
assignment against two top 10 players, Tim Henman and Greg
Rusedski, but the U.S. Tennis Association had also already made
arrangements to commemorate Davis Cup's centennial by holding the
second round at the historic Longwood Cricket Club in Boston.
Without Sampras to anchor Round 1, a Round 2 seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a number of things the heads of tennis can do to make
Davis Cup more accessible for the top guys,'' said Sampras, who
feels the four-round format is a drain on his Grand Slam
preparation. ``To have a week off before and after Davis Cup, and
not be penalized with your ranking, would be a step in the right
direction, but I don't see much of that happening. I know one guy
can't change Davis Cup, but unless they change the format, I don't
see myself playing.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sampras said he would not play the first round merely to
help the Americans reach the second. ``I can't commit to something
unless I'm going to finish what I start; but I have to be honest,
the slams and the ranking come first,'' said Sampras, who gave
Gullikson the bad news earlier this week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sampras managed to win his 11th Grand Slam event at Wimbledon
and finished the year at No. 1, and Lindsay Davenport used her U.S.
Open victory to land atop the women's tour, but the rule of thumb
for tennis in 1998 was that there wasn't one.
</P>
<P>
   The four Grand Slam events produced four different men's and
women's champions. Sampras twice slipped behind Marcelo Rios of
Chile, who led the men's tour with seven titles but none in Grand
Slam events. Martina Hingis, relentless at 16 but regressing at 17,
won only one of the three slams that she had grabbed in 1997.
``It's easier to be the hunter than the hunted one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Things were helter-skelter on tennis' golden oldies front as
well. No sooner had Jimmy Connors been inducted into the Hall of
Fame than he found himself toppled as the head of the senior class.
He was supplanted by John McEnroe, who is poised to follow Connors
into the hall in 1999 and also proclaimed himself ready to take on
Sampras and the youngsters, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these guys should get their facts straight before they
pop off,'' Sampras snapped by way of response to McEnroe's
suggestion that the U.S. Davis Cup team might be better off tapping
a solid soldier like him instead of begging for the services of a
current star like Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for McEnroe to criticize; back when he was doing
this, he played just 13, 14 events,'' said Sampras, who has a
22-event schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't win majors, be No. 1, and be in Davis Cup; I
physically can't do it or mentally can't do it,'' said Sampras, who
won only four titles in 1998, his fewest since 1991. ``You can't
have everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But by finishing this season at the top of the pecking order,
Sampras broke the blockbuster sixth-straight-year record he had
shared with Connors. And by winning Wimbledon, Sampras put himself
in position to tie Roy Emerson's career record of a dozen Grand
Slam titles if he gets off to a perfect start next month at the
Australian Open. Sampras also has a chance to surpass Ivan Lendl's
career record of 270 weeks at No. 1 if he can hold his spot for 18
more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These records out there are the reason I'm going to continue
to work hard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport made a double breakthrough in 1998: first, she
persevered to her first Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open; a month
later, she replaced Hingis at No. 1. But that sharing of the top
spot by two low-key Californians was a coincidence that went
virtually uncelebrated on home turf.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to plans and predictions about the best pre-millennium
tactic for keeping the sport globally competitive, men's and
women's tennis did not get married in 1998, nor are they likely to
hitch their famous and their fortunes in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The men's game, painfully aware that the retirement of Boris
Becker has been accompanied by a disappearance of the
German-sponsorship marks that had helped finance the ATP Tour in
the past decade, had pushed for the merger.
</P>
<P>
   But the women's circuit, pleasantly aware that its bumper crop
of teen-age heroines is a marketing novelty worth its weight in
magazine covers if not gold, has resolved to run a gender-specific
business. Hingis became the first female athlete to land the cover
of GQ, Anna Kournikova made People magazine's ``Sexiest People of
1998,'' and Venus Williams was touted by George magazine as one of
its ``20 Women of Influence.''
</P>
<P>
   All this extracurricular attention gilding a year in which
attendance hit a record of more than 3.6 million spectators and the
3.1 rating of the Davenport-Hingis U.S. Open final was the highest
for any televised women's sports event. But the women will
apparently not exit 1998 on the high note of having landed a title
sponsor willing to shell out an estimated $15 million a year for
1999 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that sponsors were looking for some indication that we
would still be around rather than in some way agglomerated with the
men's tour,'' said Bart McGuire, chief executive officer of the WTA
Tour. ``I think we have satisfied them on that, but that said, I am
a little chagrined that the process is taking so long.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Can anything, after the turbulence of 1998, still be considered
unthinkable? Ostriches everywhere have had to pull their heads from
the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, many people would have counted an East Asian
economic collapse as unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, before the sudden fame of a woman called Monica, so
too would have been a vote to impeach President Bill Clinton, or,
indeed, widespread calls for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Oil at $10 a barrel? Bill Gates on the defensive? The overthrow
of President Suharto of Indonesia? The fall and then private-sector
rescue of Long-Term Capital Management? George Soros arguing that
speculators should be restrained?
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion seems inescapable: if you are taking something
for granted, don't.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of things are, nevertheless, still taken for granted. Is
it really right to assume, as many do, that nuclear weapons will
never be used by states, that democracy will continue to spread,
that China will not break up, that shares are always the best
long-term investment?
</P>
<P>
   Those unthinkables are likely to be challenged over a period of
years or even decades. As soon as 1999, however, a different but
just as widespread assumption will face its stiffest challenge yet:
the idea that globalization is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   That ugly, 13-letter word has become a mantra of business, of
politics, even of culture.
</P>
<P>
   This decade has seen a remarkable increase in the openness to
trade and investment flows of country after country: partly because
of the demise of Soviet communism and of old ideas of socialist
self-sufficiency; partly because of liberalizations agreed upon
during the Uruguay round of what was then the GATT and is now the
World Trade Organization; and partly because of the rapid,
world-shrinking spread of new information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, foreign businesses, foreign investors and
foreign (especially American) culture have penetrated deeply into
most countries' domestic lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries have tried to slow this penetration down. But few
have resisted it altogether. The mix of unstoppable technological
change with the apparently unanswerable intellectual defeat of
central planning has made globalization appear inevitable: only its
speed and its consequences seem open to debate.
</P>
<P>
   Would that it were so. The effort to reverse this movement has
already begun. Next year, most probably, that effort will move into
a higher gear.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, at least, is plain to all, save possibly investors
in American shares: world recession. No one can be sure about the
future course of the world economy, even a few months ahead let
alone a year.
</P>
<P>
   But it does look likely that next year, economic growth for the
world as a whole is going to be even slower than for 1998, perhaps
a lot slower.
</P>
<P>
   For a Japanese, a South Korean, an Indonesian or even,
increasingly, a Brazilian, that will be no surprise. Those parts of
the world are already in a real recession, and there is little
reason to expect much of a recovery before 1999's second half, at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's financial troubles continue to mount, despite government
package after government package. The pace of economic shrinkage
seems to have been slowed in Korea and Thailand, but neither there
nor in Indonesia or Malaysia has much progress been made on
structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, recently rescued by a $41 billion IMF-led consortium,
looks shaky: with public-spending cuts blocked by Congress, capital
flight has resumed and the real again looks a candidate for
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   China, too, long East Asia's gravity-defying hero, looks likely
to slow and quite possibly to devalue.
</P>
<P>
   That is all bad, but there is nothing unthinkable there. Nor
does this yet threaten globalization. A cause for optimism during
the past two years has been the fact that, so far, none of the
recession-hit emerging markets has raised its formal trade
barriers, and (excepting small, maverick Malaysia and large,
lunatic Russia) none has revived barriers to capital flows.
</P>
<P>
   Governments may really believe that globalization is inevitable.
Or they may be so desperate for capital, from the IMF, from western
governments or from private investors, that they think they have no
short-term alternative to openness.
</P>
<P>
   So and far are two important words. The most important test will
come not in the vulnerable economies of the developing world, nor
in Japan, but in the rich, developed world that provides most of
that capital and sets the tone on trade and investment rules.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1 the European Union will launch its single currency to
much acclaim but not, alas, amid the strengthening economic
recovery that looked likely earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment may well start to rise again in the euro countries,
posing immediately a clash between national politics and the
collective, EU interest.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the risk is either of a political dust-up between the
main euro countries, most notably France and Germany, or of a
deflection of that pressure on to the outside world, through an
increase in the EU's already strong protectionist tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will offer the biggest test of all. This year,
buoyed by consumers, its economy has been remarkably strong. A
modest slowdown in 1999 is widely expected.
</P>
<P>
   A nastier time looks possible, however, as companies cut their
capital investment and as (or if) Wall Street's stock market bubble
bursts, making consumers feel poorer and companies more worried.
</P>
<P>
   Further interest-rate cuts might limit the damage; an
expansionary fiscal policy might also help; but neither is likely
to avert a slowdown altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Already, even with American unemployment at record postwar lows
and the economy steaming ahead, industries such as steel and memory
chips have resorted to anti-dumping suits to protect themselves
against imports.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has berated Europeans for not importing more
goods from Asia and thus taking the heat out of America's growing
current-account deficit. Slower growth or a full recession can only
boost the protectionist voice.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is how strong it will get. With a wounded
presidency and the 2000 election-campaign getting under way, the
defenses against it will be weakened.
</P>
<P>
   And if protectionism breaks through in the United States? Then,
the likelihood is that other, smaller, more genuinely vulnerable
countries would turn protectionist too, partly in retaliation but
partly also out of opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   Such a verdict is, in truth, a rather gloomy thing to write at
Christmas. But it offers a realistic way to think about 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first proper test of globalization. If the test
is passed, this slowdown could prove short, the subsequent recovery
strong and fruitful. If it is failed, and markets are closed, the
recession could prove long and painful.
</P>
<P>
   That is the choice. It would take an ostrich to pretend
otherwise. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Can anything, after the turbulence of 1998, still be considered
unthinkable? Ostriches everywhere have had to pull their heads from
the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, many people would have counted an East Asian
economic collapse as unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, before the sudden fame of a woman called Monica, so
too would have been a vote to impeach President Bill Clinton, or,
indeed, widespread calls for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Oil at $10 a barrel? Bill Gates on the defensive? The overthrow
of President Suharto of Indonesia? The fall and then private-sector
rescue of Long-Term Capital Management? George Soros arguing that
speculators should be restrained?
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion seems inescapable: if you are taking something
for granted, don't.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of things are, nevertheless, still taken for granted. Is
it really right to assume, as many do, that nuclear weapons will
never be used by states, that democracy will continue to spread,
that China will not break up, that shares are always the best
long-term investment?
</P>
<P>
   Those unthinkables are likely to be challenged over a period of
years or even decades. As soon as 1999, however, a different but
just as widespread assumption will face its stiffest challenge yet:
the idea that globalization is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   That ugly, 13-letter word has become a mantra of business, of
politics, even of culture.
</P>
<P>
   This decade has seen a remarkable increase in the openness to
trade and investment flows of country after country: partly because
of the demise of Soviet communism and of old ideas of socialist
self-sufficiency; partly because of liberalizations agreed upon
during the Uruguay round of what was then the GATT and is now the
World Trade Organization; and partly because of the rapid,
world-shrinking spread of new information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, foreign businesses, foreign investors and
foreign (especially American) culture have penetrated deeply into
most countries' domestic lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries have tried to slow this penetration down. But few
have resisted it altogether. The mix of unstoppable technological
change with the apparently unanswerable intellectual defeat of
central planning has made globalization appear inevitable: only its
speed and its consequences seem open to debate.
</P>
<P>
   Would that it were so. The effort to reverse this movement has
already begun. Next year, most probably, that effort will move into
a higher gear.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, at least, is plain to all, save possibly investors
in American shares: world recession. No one can be sure about the
future course of the world economy, even a few months ahead let
alone a year.
</P>
<P>
   But it does look likely that next year, economic growth for the
world as a whole is going to be even slower than for 1998, perhaps
a lot slower.
</P>
<P>
   For a Japanese, a South Korean, an Indonesian or even,
increasingly, a Brazilian, that will be no surprise. Those parts of
the world are already in a real recession, and there is little
reason to expect much of a recovery before 1999's second half, at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's financial troubles continue to mount, despite government
package after government package. The pace of economic shrinkage
seems to have been slowed in Korea and Thailand, but neither there
nor in Indonesia or Malaysia has much progress been made on
structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, recently rescued by a $41 billion IMF-led consortium,
looks shaky: with public-spending cuts blocked by Congress, capital
flight has resumed and the real again looks a candidate for
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   China, too, long East Asia's gravity-defying hero, looks likely
to slow and quite possibly to devalue.
</P>
<P>
   That is all bad, but there is nothing unthinkable there. Nor
does this yet threaten globalization. A cause for optimism during
the past two years has been the fact that, so far, none of the
recession-hit emerging markets has raised its formal trade
barriers, and (excepting small, maverick Malaysia and large,
lunatic Russia) none has revived barriers to capital flows.
</P>
<P>
   Governments may really believe that globalization is inevitable.
Or they may be so desperate for capital, from the IMF, from western
governments or from private investors, that they think they have no
short-term alternative to openness.
</P>
<P>
   So and far are two important words. The most important test will
come not in the vulnerable economies of the developing world, nor
in Japan, but in the rich, developed world that provides most of
that capital and sets the tone on trade and investment rules.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1 the European Union will launch its single currency to
much acclaim but not, alas, amid the strengthening economic
recovery that looked likely earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment may well start to rise again in the euro countries,
posing immediately a clash between national politics and the
collective, EU interest.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the risk is either of a political dust-up between the
main euro countries, most notably France and Germany, or of a
deflection of that pressure on to the outside world, through an
increase in the EU's already strong protectionist tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will offer the biggest test of all. This year,
buoyed by consumers, its economy has been remarkably strong. A
modest slowdown in 1999 is widely expected.
</P>
<P>
   A nastier time looks possible, however, as companies cut their
capital investment and as (or if) Wall Street's stock market bubble
bursts, making consumers feel poorer and companies more worried.
</P>
<P>
   Further interest-rate cuts might limit the damage; an
expansionary fiscal policy might also help; but neither is likely
to avert a slowdown altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Already, even with American unemployment at record postwar lows
and the economy steaming ahead, industries such as steel and memory
chips have resorted to anti-dumping suits to protect themselves
against imports.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has berated Europeans for not importing more
goods from Asia and thus taking the heat out of America's growing
current-account deficit. Slower growth or a full recession can only
boost the protectionist voice.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is how strong it will get. With a wounded
presidency and the 2000 election-campaign getting under way, the
defenses against it will be weakened.
</P>
<P>
   And if protectionism breaks through in the United States? Then,
the likelihood is that other, smaller, more genuinely vulnerable
countries would turn protectionist too, partly in retaliation but
partly also out of opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   Such a verdict is, in truth, a rather gloomy thing to write at
Christmas. But it offers a realistic way to think about 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first proper test of globalization. If the test
is passed, this slowdown could prove short, the subsequent recovery
strong and fruitful. If it is failed, and markets are closed, the
recession could prove long and painful.

BRITISH IRKED BY COOL FRENCH REACTION TO RAIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON -- Two weeks ago British Prime Minister Tony Blair
strolled with French president Jacques Chirac through St. Malo, a
port in Brittany from which French pirates once launched attacks on
English ships.
</P>
<P>
   It was an appropriate place for two nations whose wars once
defined European hostilities to launch a joint venture that could
redefine European cooperation. The St. Malo Declaration, signed
earlier this month, calls for the creation of a common European
Union defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair's separation from parts of Europe over Britain's
participation in the American bombing of Iraq shows that the
creation of a single European defense policy could prove more
difficult than the single European currency to be launched in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Gulf War, when European countries fell squarely
behind the American-led coalition, there is no European consensus
on the wisdom of bombing Iraq to force Saddam Hussein to cooperate
with UN weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   After the bombing began Wednesday night, the Spanish offered to
help, the Germans were cautiously supportive, the French were cool
and the Italians dismissed the military action as useless. By
Friday, support for the Anglo-American effort of the new German
government of Gerhard Schroeder had grown stronger.
</P>
<P>
   One British diplomat foresaw Wednesday night the fragmented
European reaction to the bombing that surfaced the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We and the Americans see and accept the threat that Saddam
poses, not just to his neighbors, but to the international
community,'' the diplomat said. ``Unfortunately, not everyone else
agrees on what to do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The British are not surprised by the Italian government's
reaction, given that its new prime minister is a former communist.
But they are pleasantly surprised by the German reaction. Speaking
privately, however, British diplomats express frustration over the
reaction of the French, whom they criticize for lack of support.
</P>
<P>
   The split between London and Paris over Iraq is notable given
the significance both governments attached to the St. Malo
Declaration when it was announced Dec. 4 at an Anglo-French summit.
It marked the first time the French and British had united to
sponsor a new European Union policy.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the declaration calls for Europeans to intervene
militarily in regional conflicts such as Bosnia when the Americans
cannot or will not. The pact is part of Europe's determination to
assume more responsibility for its own region, half a century after
America helped rebuild it after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But as the situation in Iraq illustrates, while Britain
reflexively sides with American military analysis, the French
continue their legendary independent streak.
</P>
<P>
   Some caution against overstating the rift between London and
Paris in particular, and the rest of Europe in general. Gywn Prins,
senior research fellow at The Royal Institute of International
Affairs, said there is disagreement with the French over tactics,
and perhaps timing, but that talk of a serious rift between the
Anglo-American axis and Paris and the rest of the western allies is
greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday someone daubed the Cenotaph, the London monument
that honors Britain's war dead, with graffiti protesting the
bombing of Iraq. Alfred Downing, a 72-year-old World War II
veteran, paused as he walked by to decry the defacement as
disgraceful. He said he found it repulsive that China and Russia
were ``sanctimoniously'' denouncing the Americans and British.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese and Russians stick up for dictatorships because
they would prefer to have dictatorships themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that the French agree with the Chinese and Russians
that the use of force was premature, Downing furrowed his brow and
said, ``Yes, well, the French would, now wouldn't they?''

FRIGID NOVEMBER FOR COLLEGE FOOTBALL RATINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   College football's Bowl Championship Series (BCS) may leave
everyone cold in regards to rankings, national titles and the
priorities of bowl officials. But it did one thing: The whole month
of November was one long BCS-inspired debate.
</P>
<P>
   That did not, however, translate into success at the TV box
office. The 1998 regular season closed without a single network
package improving on its 1997 ratings.
</P>
<P>
   In 26 regionalized telecasts this year, ABC earned a 4.7 Nielsen
average, which equates into about 4.6 million homes. CBS' package
of games featuring the Southeastern Conference and Big East did a
3.2, down from a 3.5 in 1997. NBC's six-game package of Notre Dame
home games earned a 2.9, down from a 3.1.
</P>
<P>
   Cable-wise, ESPN did a 2.2 for 38 telecats, down from a 2.4, and
ESPN2's 37 telecasts did a .8, equal with its numbers from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This is bad news in two respects: With the BCS bowls leaving
more people frustrated than sated, the chance exists that all bowl
Nielsens will decline this holiday season. And these aren't the
kind of numbers which inspire, say, a Rupert Murdoch to make a
pre-emptive bid to launch a real 16- or 8-team playoff.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, last year's Rose Bowl match between Washington
State and Michigan had a strong viewer profile, with WSU new to the
game and Michigan ranked No. 1. The Nielsen rating was 17.6, which
was good, but lower than the Nielsens in two other years, 1996
(19.2) when USC met Cinderfella (Northwestern) and 1995 when No. 2
ranked Penn State met Oregon (18.2).
</P>
<P>
   Also last year, the Jan. 2 Orange Bowl match between another
unbeaten team, Nebraska, and Tennessee earned a modest 13.3, much
lower than the Nielsen the Orange earned in 1995 (Nebraska-Miami,
18.9) and 1994 (Florida State-Nebraska, 17.8).
</P>
<P>
   There's little precedent that any bowl game, title or not,
outside the usual Dec. 31-Jan. 2 parameters can attract an
audience. ABC pushed the 1997 Sugar Bowl between Florida and
Florida State back to Jan. 2 so it would be unopposed in prime
time, but it did a 17.9. That's not bad, but it's not the kind of
number which inspires network wallets to open.
</P>
<P>
   If the general public looks at Florida State-Tennessee as just a
southern intrasectional, or worse, then the BCS may have to analyze
its basic premise. That might not be a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if the BCS did not exist and bowl bids and decisions
had been made the old-fashioned way, UCLA and Wisconsin would still
meet in the Rose Bowl, and Tennessee-Florida State would butt
heads, but in the Sugar Bowl, not the Fiesta Bowl. And since the
Big East had no automatic berth to any of the four major Jan. 1
bowls, Kansas State likely would have gotten a better bowl.
</P>
<P>
   (subhd) New, not improved
</P>
<P>
   The post-Nasty era at KXTA (1150 AM) is a few weeks old, and I
regret to report that the worst fears of L.A sports talk fans are
already being realized.
</P>
<P>
   Since Joe McDonnell was escorted out, there has been a lack of
anything along the lines of sports news or cogent,
</P>
<P>
   interesting talk on the station. And the vibe one gets is that
management likes it this way.
</P>
<P>
   The most prevalent topics we're heard beyond full endorsement of
the Kevin Brown deal this is the Dodgers' flagship, after all have
a Tony Robbins-like seminar next month, featuring name athletes and
coaches, that the station is directly involved; where Dean Denholm,
half of the duo replacing Big Joe, should live (I suggest Fresno);
and more testimonials to the greatness of Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mason, half of the morning team, has already departed for
New York, where he will host his own general talk show. It has yet
to be decided where John Ireland fits now, especially with
management reportedly considering a general talk show, sprinkled
with sports, for the morning slot. Ben Maller and Dave Smith have
been doing fill-in work where needed.
</P>
<P>
   Denholm and Newy Scruggs did a ``Help a Hoopa'' skit last week
that raised a small smile, but it was way too long, and I can't
imagine sports fans wanting a steady diet of it. One caller this
week got on the air and asked ``Hey, are you guys ever going to
talk about sports?''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!And now the news: &UR; !off! &LR;  Not all of the college football
news was bad. The UCLA-Miami game on ESPN posted a season-high 4.5
rating for the cable net ... Check out the CBS SportsLine web site,
where the Internet company is conducting a virtual playoff for
college football based on a 16-team field ... Larry Kahn's bowl
radio package includes the Las Vegas Bowl Saturday on KLSX-FM, plus
the Gator Bowl ... Fox Sports West 2 will air the NAIA title game
between Azusa Pacific and Oliviet Nazarene Saturday at 10 a.m. ...
CBS is thumping its chest over its rapidly increasing Nielsen prime
time demographics in the lusty men 18-49 category, all due, the
network says, to the testosterone boost of the NFL package ...
ESPN's numbers for Sunday Night football are at 7.9, a six-percent
bump over the comparable cable rating in 1997. The Fish-Jet game
did a 10.8, a season high and the best since a 49ers game in
Decemver, 1995. ... CBS has benched George Seifert
</P>
<P>
   from the ``NFL Today'' pregame show for the balance of the
regular season, and industry whispers say there could be a major
overhaul next season. Look for more Mike Lombardi, the switching of
Craig Jamesfrom the college studio to the NFL studio, a goodbye to
Seifert and the reassignment of Brent Jones and/or Marcus Allento
games ...
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hill's ``Sports Central'' show on KCBS is earning better
Nielsens than the pregame show despite hitting the air an hour
earlier ... Hey NBA! Check this out. ESPN's college basketball
package, 34 games into the season, is averaging a 1.3, a 24 percent
increase over last year's Nielsens at the same time. ESPN2's
package is up 43 percent ...
</P>
<P>
   For those who still care about the NBA, Showtime airs an
all-star charity game Saturday at 6 p.m. from Atlantic City. You'd
think player advisors would suggest that putting a game on a
premium movie channel isn't exactly reaching out to the common fan
... ESPN Saturday (9 a.m.) carries the Tennessee-South Florida
college basketball game. Who cares, you say? Ex-49er coach Seth
Greenberg is South Florida's coach ... Consider this advice or an
alert: KCTD (1540 am) is carrying Tim McCarver's talk show on
Saturdays ... Showtime airs the premiere of Bud Greenspan's latest
Olympic documentary Sunday at 8 p.m.

looks shaky: with public-spending cuts blocked by Congress, capital
flight has resumed and the real again looks a candidate for
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   China, too, long East Asia's gravity-defying hero, looks likely
to slow and quite possibly to devalue.
</P>
<P>
   That is all bad, but there is nothing unthinkable there. Nor
does this yet threaten globalization. A cause for optimism during
the past two years has been the fact that, so far, none of the
recession-hit emerging markets has raised its formal trade
barriers, and (excepting small, maverick Malaysia and large,
lunatic Russia) none has revived barriers to capital flows.
</P>
<P>
   Governments may really believe that globalization is inevitable.
Or they may be so desperate for capital, from the IMF, from western
governments or from private investors, that they think they have no
short-term alternative to openness.
</P>
<P>
   So and far are two important words. The most important test will
come not in the vulnerable economies of the developing world, nor
in Japan, but in the rich, developed world that provides most of
that capital and sets the tone on trade and investment rules.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1 the European Union will launch its single currency to
much acclaim but not, alas, amid the strengthening economic
recovery that looked likely earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment may well start to rise again in the euro countries,
posing immediately a clash between national politics and the
collective, EU interest.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the risk is either of a political dust-up between the
main euro countries, most notably France and Germany, or of a
deflection of that pressure on to the outside world, through an
increase in the EU's already strong protectionist tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will offer the biggest test of all. This year,
buoyed by consumers, its economy has been remarkably strong. A
modest slowdown in 1999 is widely expected.
</P>
<P>
   A nastier time looks possible, however, as companies cut their
capital investment and as (or if) Wall Street's stock market bubble
bursts, making consumers feel poorer and companies more worried.
</P>
<P>
   Further interest-rate cuts might limit the damage; an
expansionary fiscal policy might also help; but neither is likely
to avert a slowdown altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Already, even with American unemployment at record postwar lows
and the economy steaming ahead, industries such as steel and memory
chips have resorted to anti-dumping suits to protect themselves
against imports.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has berated Europeans for not importing more
goods from Asia and thus taking the heat out of America's growing
current-account deficit. Slower growth or a full recession can only
boost the protectionist voice.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is how strong it will get. With a wounded
presidency and the 2000 election-campaign getting under way, the
defenses against it will be weakened.
</P>
<P>
   And if protectionism breaks through in the United States? Then,
the likelihood is that other, smaller, more genuinely vulnerable
countries would turn protectionist too, partly in retaliation but
partly also out of opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   Such a verdict is, in truth, a rather gloomy thing to write at
Christmas. But it offers a realistic way to think about 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first proper test of globalization. If the test
is passed, this slowdown could prove short, the subsequent recovery
strong and fruitful. If it is failed, and markets are closed, the
recession could prove long and painful.
</P>
<P>
   That is the choice. It would take an ostrich to pretend
otherwise. &QL;

COMMENTARY: LET IT BE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surreal, unreal, mind-blowing: these are words of the '60s, and
it's no wonder they returned to vogue this week. Not since a
tottering presidency, a divisive war, assassinations, civic unrest
and bitter partisanship overloaded the American psyche in 1968 has
there been a spectacle to match this moment. ``Split-screen
America'' we call it now. It's not happenstance that split-screen
technology also became a Hollywood fad in movies like ``The Thomas
Crown Affair'' in 1968. When society cracks, the mind follows, and
artists must concoct new forms to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we're replaying the tragic late '60s as farce _ so far. We
have character assassinations instead of real ones, a weeklong war
instead of a quagmire, presidential lying about touching body parts
instead of presidential lying about Vietcong body counts. But we
can't be complacent, yet. The cultural fault lines of the moment
are those of 30 years ago, and potentially just as explosive. The
right-wing rage once aimed at long-haired, draft-dodging, sexually
wanton hippies (a caricature of the left even then) is now aimed at
Bill Clinton, whose opportunistic, split-the-difference politics is
closer to the old mainstream GOP than to the '60s left, but who
nonetheless has become the right's pinata for all it hates about
the Vietnam era's social and sexual revolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has another major fault line of the '60s _ race _
disappeared since then. Though Bill Clinton has done little more
for African-Americans than O.J. Simpson did, his support remains
near-unanimous in black America. If nothing else, this is a measure
of how deeply blacks still fear that our legal machinery can be
stacked in favor of a lynch mob. It's hardly a mindless argument.
The most rabid Clinton-haters in Congress are white Southerners,
led by Bob Barr, who has spoken before the racist Council of
Conservative Citizens. An impeachment trial's jury of 100 senators
will be whites only.
</P>
<P>
   The latest agenda of the media gasbags _ now that they're bored
drumming up fake suspense about ``wavering Republican moderates'' _
is to head off this trial. If a last-minute deal can't save the
day, we're told, then surely the impeached president will resign to
spare us ``the ordeal.'' But if we really believe in ``the
constitutional process'' and the ``rule of law'' they love to
lecture us about, we cannot short-circuit that process now. For
Clinton simply to exit after a partisan House impeachment vote
defiant of majority opinion will smell like a coup.
</P>
<P>
   There are too many festering questions on all sides to end this
crisis with such an abrupt anti-democratic abdication, even if
followed by a speech by President Gore declaring our long national
soap opera over. What are the other unspecified illegal
``incidents'' that the House Judiciary Committee counsel, David
Schippers, painted with a McCarthyesque brush during the
impeachment hearings?
</P>
<P>
   Did Kenneth Starr, Paula Jones' lawyers and Linda Tripp conspire
to catch the president in a perjury trap? Are we really certain
that Clinton did not bomb Afghanistan, Sudan and Iraq to deflect
his political woes? (We must be; if he did wag the dog, it's not
only a high crime but a potentially apocalyptic flaw in our
system.)
</P>
<P>
   The price we'll pay for a slow, deliberate trial to resolve such
issues won't be cheap. We will learn still more about politicians'
sex lives, which will prompt long sermons in which the party in
hock to the religious right rationalizes why lying to one's God and
spouse in a marriage oath does not constitute ``lying under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Network stocks will plummet as the lucrative Jerry Springer and
Oprah are displaced by commercial-free Senate sessions. It's even
possible, if unlikely, that Congress will accomplish less
non-impeachment business than it did this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the alternative is worse. ``It's the Civil War all over
again,'' said Barr, the congressman, of our current national
polarization _ and surely his ideological opposites would agree.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way to call off this war by fiat now _ any more than
the clash over Vietnam was silenced by the Gulf of Tonkin
resolution _ because the poisons loose in the body politic are
rising and raging too bitterly in every camp.
</P>
<P>
   A real trial is the only way out, for if we learned anything
from the '60s it is this: Should our civic institutions fail to
adjudicate and purge deep national divisions in a fair, legal and
completely open manner, Americans may be tempted instead to fight
them out in the streets.

 WASHINGTON: news cycles. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a New York Republican who came out for
impeachment this week, even sadly suggested that the reason Clinton
had lied under oath, and thus taken the step towards impeachment,
was because like Nixon he came to hate his political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blinded by his contempt for people he thought were out to get
him,'' Boehlert said, ``the president forgot his larger obligations
to his office, to the Constitution and to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   So on Friday the House prepared to impeach another president.
But anyone who thought this would end the cycle of political
destruction that began with Watergate had only to look at Rep.
Robert Livingston, the incoming speaker. On the eve of the
impeachment debate, he had to acknowledge to Republicans that ``on
occasion I strayed from my marriage,'' because of a story being
prepared by Hustler magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the fear of what has now been unleashed that led
to the day's one fleeting, early moment of bipartisanship. When
Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House Minority leader, thundered the
politics of ``slash and burn must end,'' he received a standing
ovation from both sides of the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Then the attacks began.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when Japan's economy first slowed, there was
a popular explanation for its refusal to speed up again. Japanese
consumers, this theory went, had bought so many gadgets during the
go-go years that they now declined to spend a single yen on new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Late-1990s America presents a gleaming contrast. Despite the
long boom, Americans are pursuing material happiness during this
holiday season with unwavering zeal.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the notion that they may run out of things to
buy seems laughable _ especially when you visit the mother of 1990s
consumer temples, just off a freeway in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The temple in question is the flagship store of REI, a
camping/sporting/outdoor retailer. You can buy kayaks and snowshoes
and anti-sting kits, indeed everything you might require to master
nature's various elements.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy clips and ropes and ingenious spring-loaded clamps,
all essential for turning sheer rocks into climbing frames for
adults. Upstairs, you may test a hundred types of shoe on a
convenient indoor hiking path. You may choose a waterproof jacket,
and check to see if it really keeps the moisture out by stepping
into a rain room.
</P>
<P>
   The choosing is no simple matter. The clothing at REI features a
bewildering variety of fabrics, lightweight or heavy-duty,
odor-eating or moisture-wicking, Gore-Tex, Spandex and Cordura.
</P>
<P>
   Over in the camping section, even the humble water filter
assumes an intimidating mien. Should you choose the ceramic
micro-strainer or the carbon-core membrane, the iodine resin or the
pleated glass fiber?
</P>
<P>
   To grapple with these issues, you must read a pamphlet, prepared
by REI's thoughtful staff. This describes which microorganisms are
caught by which filtration technology; no single device can be
relied upon to trap all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The prudent course, it seems, is to buy 11 filters and drain
water through each one. But what if a key filter cracks? ``Always
carry spare elements, parts and backup water treatment method,''
intones the pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   Across America, there are now 51 REI stores, up from 26 in 1990;
and each year 1.5 million visitors flock to the mother temple in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Some no doubt come to gawp: at the world's highest artificial
climbing spire, laid on for shoppers to test climbing shoes; or at
the cafeteria's bewildering variety of ethnic foods (which come
with another set of instructions, naturally).
</P>
<P>
   But other visitors go to REI with more serious intent. They know
that ambling through the countryside on a weekend afternoon carries
an intolerable opportunity cost: the time could be so much better
spent on greater things, such as whitewater canoeing or off-road
biking.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you choose deliberately not to live life to the full, you
will want to try these sports. Therefore, you realize, you will
need REI's equipment.
</P>
<P>
   And so, for opportunity maximizers at least, shopping at REI
becomes an existential duty.
</P>
<P>
   You must read the medical notes printed on REI's walls,
explaining the risks of exercising without a hydration pack
strapped on to your back, so that you can sip water regularly.
</P>
<P>
   You must master REI's high-tech gadgets, using one computer to
track your whereabouts and another to keep tabs on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   You must feed yourself with intensively nutritious vacuum-packed
objects. After all, with 11 water filters in your bag, there won't
be room for sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Some people fret over this ingenious fuelling of materialism.
They see it as evidence of America's darker sides. Americans fret
that, for all their prosperity, life is increasingly stressful; if
buying a water filter has come to involve a chemistry lesson,
perhaps this is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Americans worry about a growing class divide; and the
REI attitude to life is spreading mainly among a select group of
richly-compensated high achievers. One in two Americans, after all,
is nowadays classified as overweight; and one in four admits to
being wholly sedentary.
</P>
<P>
   You feel this class divide most sharply in the West, where the
REI way bumps up against a more traditional outdoorsiness.
</P>
<P>
   In the old mining towns of southern Utah, the locals load the
gun racks on their pickups, and rumble off into the wilderness to
hunt; but the taste for shooting at wildlife is being rapidly
displaced by the tourist taste for photographing it.
</P>
<P>
   The locals' pickups are rusting and gnarled; but the tourists
haul themselves up rocks with clips and clamps made out of
aerospace-grade metal.
</P>
<P>
   The locals see no virtue in unnecessary strain. But the tourists
bike up mountains undeterred by desert sun, trusting in health
insurance and helmets to save them from the consequences of their
bravado.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the rich have always sought out nature in ways that
others found bizarre. On a trip out West a century ago, Theodore
Roosevelt was bitten by a snake and pitched from a wagon on to his
head; he declared, in a rehearsal of today's mountain-bike
machismo, that this was ``very good fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, REI does represent a change. For one thing, Roosevelt
did not care what he wore. ``We are dressed about as badly as
mortals could be,'' he wrote of one youthful adventure: ``unshaven
faces, dirty gray shirts, still dirtier yellow trousers.''
</P>
<P>
   And, despite some interest in conservation, Roosevelt was an
environmental lout by modern standards. On a trip to Africa, he
killed nine lions, eight elephants and 13 rhinoceroses.
</P>
<P>
   The patricians of yesteryear resembled, in their approach to
nature at least, today's rougher members of the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The new masters of the information age are different. They want
to preserve the wilderness, but also to look smart in it; they have
taken the fastidious dressing and equipment fetishism of suburban
sports such as golf, and transported them to the great open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this makes for new social divisions, and occasionally
for stress; but it is fun, and it fuels the economy.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the boom lasts, America's mild economic anxieties
will pale next to Japan's. As it happens, REI aims to open its
first overseas store in Tokyo, in 2000. &QL;

PLAN TO BURY NUCLEAR WASTE IN NEVADA MOVES FORWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department reported Friday that it had
found ``no show stoppers'' so far to block its plan to bury much of
the United States' nuclear waste in the Nevada desert near Las
Vegas and that it was on schedule to make a formal recommendation
to the president by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In what it called its ``viability assessment'' released Friday,
however, the department did identify major gaps in its knowledge of
the geology of the site, Yucca Mountain. But officials promised to
answer questions raised by scientists outside the department about
water in the mountain, the most probable means by which radioactive
contamination could escape beyond the site.
</P>
<P>
   The energy secretary, Bill Richardson, said in a telephone
interview, ``The fact that no show stoppers have been identified is
a step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are admitting additional work is needed,'' Richardson
added, ``but it's in the national interest to proceed forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the plan, however, say that enough problems with
Yucca Mountain are known to disqualify it as a nuclear-waste
repository. A coalition of 219 environmental organizations
submitted a petition to the agency last month saying that even in
the Nevada desert, rain will percolate through the mountain in a
few decades, picking up radioactive material on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Then, environmentalists argue, the water will travel
horizontally to wells beyond the site over hundreds of years, yet
quickly enough to deliver the materials while they are still
dangerously radioactive.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Public Citizen, the organization founded by
Ralph Nader that helped organize the 219 groups, said, ``We object
to the content of the report for its optimistic conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ernest Moniz, the energy undersecretary, said one of the
gaps in knowledge was how fast water would move underground, and
how much it would dilute any radioactive contaminants. The
estimates in the report might be ``too conservative'' or too
pessimistic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, an independent federal
agency, is supposed to decide whether to grant a license for
construction of the repository, based on criteria set by the
Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA, however, has not yet set
rules, one of the reasons the process is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The report included, for the first time, a preliminary design
for the proposed repository on the edge of the Nevada Test Site
where the Energy Department used to explode nuclear bombs. The
department, under tremendous pressure because it missed a deadline
of February 1998 to begin accepting waste from nuclear-powered
reactors, hopes to open a repository in 2010, with waste being
loaded until 2033.
</P>
<P>
   The documents released Friday anticipated sealing the repository
in 2116, but raised the possibility of keeping the tunnels through
the mountain open for 300 years, until 2316, to ensure that the
radioactive material was not leaking.
</P>
<P>
   The department said it would cost $18.7 billion to license and
build the repository and to load it with more than 70,000 tons of
waste from power plants and bomb factories. The costs in 1998
dollars, including expenses since 1983 and 100 years of monitoring,
would be $43 billion, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   The money would come from a tenth-of-a-cent-per-kilowatt-hour
charge that the department collects from nuclear utilities, which
should be enough to pay for the whole program, officials said
Friday. But in exchange for the fee, the department was supposed to
have begun accepting wastes last February; now it faces penalties
for being late, under contracts it signed with utility companies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The period of maximum exposure, said the report, is after
300,000 years. At that point, the report estimated, doses to people
drinking from wells 12 miles away would be about 300 millirem a
year, which would be about equal to present-day radiation from
natural sources.
</P>
<P>
   That would be 10 to 20 times higher than the limits now being
discussed, but no one has decided yet whether radiation-protection
standards should have to extend so far into the future. The debate
over Yucca Mountain may focus on a more immediate future, of a few
thousand years.
</P>
<P>

adults. Upstairs, you may test a hundred types of shoe on a
convenient indoor hiking path. You may choose a waterproof jacket,
and check to see if it really keeps the moisture out by stepping
into a rain room.
</P>
<P>
   The choosing is no simple matter. The clothing at REI features a
bewildering variety of fabrics, lightweight or heavy-duty,
odor-eating or moisture-wicking, Gore-Tex, Spandex and Cordura.
</P>
<P>
   Over in the camping section, even the humble water filter
assumes an intimidating mien. Should you choose the ceramic
micro-strainer or the carbon-core membrane, the iodine resin or the
pleated glass fiber?
</P>
<P>
   To grapple with these issues, you must read a pamphlet, prepared
by REI's thoughtful staff. This describes which microorganisms are
caught by which filtration technology; no single device can be
relied upon to trap all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The prudent course, it seems, is to buy 11 filters and drain
water through each one. But what if a key filter cracks? ``Always
carry spare elements, parts and backup water treatment method,''
intones the pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   Across America, there are now 51 REI stores, up from 26 in 1990;
and each year 1.5 million visitors flock to the mother temple in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Some no doubt come to gawp: at the world's highest artificial
climbing spire, laid on for shoppers to test climbing shoes; or at
the cafeteria's bewildering variety of ethnic foods (which come
with another set of instructions, naturally).
</P>
<P>
   But other visitors go to REI with more serious intent. They know
that ambling through the countryside on a weekend afternoon carries
an intolerable opportunity cost: the time could be so much better
spent on greater things, such as whitewater canoeing or off-road
biking.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you choose deliberately not to live life to the full, you
will want to try these sports. Therefore, you realize, you will
need REI's equipment.
</P>
<P>
   And so, for opportunity maximizers at least, shopping at REI
becomes an existential duty.
</P>
<P>
   You must read the medical notes printed on REI's walls,
explaining the risks of exercising without a hydration pack
strapped on to your back, so that you can sip water regularly.
</P>
<P>
   You must master REI's high-tech gadgets, using one computer to
track your whereabouts and another to keep tabs on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   You must feed yourself with intensively nutritious vacuum-packed
objects. After all, with 11 water filters in your bag, there won't
be room for sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Some people fret over this ingenious fuelling of materialism.
They see it as evidence of America's darker sides. Americans fret
that, for all their prosperity, life is increasingly stressful; if
buying a water filter has come to involve a chemistry lesson,
perhaps this is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Americans worry about a growing class divide; and the
REI attitude to life is spreading mainly among a select group of
richly-compensated high achievers. One in two Americans, after all,
is nowadays classified as overweight; and one in four admits to
being wholly sedentary.
</P>
<P>
   You feel this class divide most sharply in the West, where the
REI way bumps up against a more traditional outdoorsiness.
</P>
<P>
   In the old mining towns of southern Utah, the locals load the
gun racks on their pickups, and rumble off into the wilderness to
hunt; but the taste for shooting at wildlife is being rapidly
displaced by the tourist taste for photographing it.
</P>
<P>
   The locals' pickups are rusting and gnarled; but the tourists
haul themselves up rocks with clips and clamps made out of
aerospace-grade metal.
</P>
<P>
   The locals see no virtue in unnecessary strain. But the tourists
bike up mountains undeterred by desert sun, trusting in health
insurance and helmets to save them from the consequences of their
bravado.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the rich have always sought out nature in ways that
others found bizarre. On a trip out West a century ago, Theodore
Roosevelt was bitten by a snake and pitched from a wagon on to his
head; he declared, in a rehearsal of today's mountain-bike
machismo, that this was ``very good fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, REI does represent a change. For one thing, Roosevelt
did not care what he wore. ``We are dressed about as badly as
mortals could be,'' he wrote of one youthful adventure: ``unshaven
faces, dirty gray shirts, still dirtier yellow trousers.''
</P>
<P>
   And, despite some interest in conservation, Roosevelt was an
environmental lout by modern standards. On a trip to Africa, he
killed nine lions, eight elephants and 13 rhinoceroses.
</P>
<P>
   The patricians of yesteryear resembled, in their approach to
nature at least, today's rougher members of the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The new masters of the information age are different. They want
to preserve the wilderness, but also to look smart in it; they have
taken the fastidious dressing and equipment fetishism of suburban
sports such as golf, and transported them to the great open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this makes for new social divisions, and occasionally
for stress; but it is fun, and it fuels the economy.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the boom lasts, America's mild economic anxieties
will pale next to Japan's. As it happens, REI aims to open its
first overseas store in Tokyo, in 2000. &QL;

CLINTON PLUMBS DEMOCRATIC SENATORS FOR ADVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Though the White House has portrayed him as mostly
disengaged from the business of impeachment, President Clinton has
been calling various Senate Democrats to gauge their attitude on
the subject, while complaining bitterly that ``right-wing''
Republicans are out to get him.
</P>
<P>
   While bombs were falling on Iraq Wednesday and Thursday, Clinton
telephoned several Democratic senators, most of them liberal and
considered friendly to the White House, seeking advice and sounding
them out about impeachment, several Democratic Senate aides and
others close to the administration said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials acknowledge they have turned their focus
to the Senate, considering the prospect that Clinton will be
impeached by the House a foregone conclusion. But those officials
have been circumspect when asked about Clinton's direct efforts to
avoid becoming only the second president in 130 years to face an
impeachment trial by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Hillary Rodham Clinton broke her recent silence on
impeachment as she walked to the White House South Lawn, where she
tied a red ribbon to a Ford Explorer to discourage drunk driving
during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   With the Capitol Dome, site of the impeachment debate, visible
behind her, Mrs. Clinton said: ``I think the vast majority of
Americans share my approval and pride in the job that the
president's been doing for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``We ought to end divisiveness because we can do so
much more together.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reportedly is seeking to recruit two former Senate
stalwarts _ Robert Dole, a Republican and his 1996 presidential
opponent, and George Mitchell, the Maine Democrat who helped
Clinton broker the Northern Island peace agreement _ to offer
advice on dealing with the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Though stopping short of direct lobbying, a Democratic operative
close to the White House said, Clinton is beginning to talk to
senators with whom ``the president has a relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Senate aides described the president as ``angry'' about the
House impeachment vote. ``He's calling it a political process,''
one aide said about those conversations. He was ``complaining about
the right wing trying to railroad him,'' said another aide.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton's aides publicly deny it, those Democratic
aides and others with ties to the adminstration say officials are
nervous about public opinion polls showing a high percentage of
Americans favoring Clinton's resignation to avoid a lengthy
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't look at one poll, one question and hang your hat on
it,'' said Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House special
counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, asked Friday in an interview with
American Urban Radio Networks whether Clinton would consider
resigning to avoid a prolonged Senate trial, said: ``He's certainly
not preparing to resign or even to consider resigning. People can
forget about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House Friday blamed Republicans for starting the talk
about resignation, accusing the GOP of being so determined to oust
Clinton they would do almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you're seeing, especially in the last few days,
is a shift in what has been a very cynical, political strategy by
the Republican leadership in the House from impeachment to a
building drumbeat to try to force the president to leave office,''
said White House press secretary Joseph Lockhart. He said Clinton
would ``absolutely not'' consider resigning, even if impeached.
</P>
<P>
   But two Democrats _ Representatives William Lipinski of Ilinois
and Louise Slaughter of New York _ who both oppose impeachment said
it should not be out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that resigning is something that he should consider
because his effectiveness would be reduced,'' Slaughter said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts
Democrat, said in an interview, ``If the president resigned when
this whole matter broke, it would be one thing. But at this point,
if he were to give in to the right wing of the Republican Party
that would set a very dangerous precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   During the House debate Friday, Democratic Representative Sheila
Jackson Lee of Texas said emphatically: ``Mr. President, if you can
hear me, do not resign. This is not a parliamentary form of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the impeachment battle in the Senate could shape up much
as it has in the House, falling along bitter partisan lines, Senate
Minority Leader Thomas Daschle has let word circulate on Capitol
Hill that he's interested in working on a bipartisan compromise.
</P>
<P>
   But the conventional wisdom in the Senate is that such a middle
ground may be difficult to find, Democratic aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers say the Senate is duty-bound to hold a trial, as
required in the Constitution. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
says it may be hard not to hold a trial if the House votes for one
or more articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, has said
the Senate has ``no choice'' other than to start a trial, but he
has suggested that the articles could be dimissed shortly
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   One senator who has not been contacted by Clinton is Robert
Bryd, a Democrat from West Virgina, who is considred the most
learned and most impassioned defender of prerogatives in the
Senate. Months ago, while the House was debating the release of the
independent counsel's impeachment referral, Byrd warned Clinton:
``Don't tamper with the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Said one Senate Democratic aide: ``If you look at it on paper,
then you say to yourself, `no, it's impossible to get the 67 votes
necessary to convict'' the president in the Senate and remove him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a concern among people here that if and when the
House votes that things could spin out of control in the Senate.
The president has never had a lot of strong allies on the Hill,''
the aide said.

LAWRENCE TAYLOR TURNS HIMSELF IN ON DRUG CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.J., S.C.)  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawrence Taylor, the former Giants linebacker, turned himself in
to the police in Teaneck, N.J., on Thursday to face charges of drug
possession and possession of drug paraphernalia, authorities said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor surrendered at police headquarters without incident and
was released on his own recognizance after posting a $2,500 bond,
said Capt. Paul Tiernan of the Teaneck Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Taylor, 39, stem from an incident on Sept.
29 when the Teaneck police, acting on a tip, searched a room rented
in Taylor's name at the Glenpointe Marriott Hotel and discovered
crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia, Tiernan said. Taylor was not
in the room at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Bergen County Prosecutor's office will now consider whether
to indict Taylor on the charges, said James Addis, an assistant
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Taylor checked into a drug rehabilitation clinic, a
week after he was arrested in St. Petersburg, Fla., on charges of
buying crack cocaine. At the time of that arrest, he was waiting to
be sentenced on a tax-evasion conviction that arose from his
failure to pay taxes on $48,000 in income from a defunct restaurant
in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Taylor was arrested in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on
charges that he had tried to buy $100 of fake crack cocaine from an
undercover police officer. His record in that case was wiped clean
after he undertook 60 hours of community service and submitted to
drug counseling and random drug testing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Test-drive an electric car, and at first the
sensation of quiet overwhelms all else _ except, perhaps, the
anxiety about how much energy remains in the batteries.
</P>
<P>
   But drive an electric for a few days and subtle characteristics
start to become obvious, such as the way the door over the fueling
port locks (so no one can siphon your electricity?) or the
realization that roads have sounds other than cars _ bird songs,
for instance. And electric cars are great for sneaking up on
pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   I was driving a Toyota RAV4-EV, a small sport utility with a
body designed for a gasoline engine but retrofitted as an electric.
Toyota made 350 of them last year and rented them to fleet
operators like utility companies for $457 a month; the company has
not said how many it will build this year. My test car came from
the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of
investor-owned utilities.
</P>
<P>
   With a body already high off the ground, the RAV4 is a good
candidate for conversion to electricity, because there is space for
the batteries underneath. But it is a conversion, not designed from
the ground up for electricity _ thus the locking fuel door borrowed
from the gasoline version.
</P>
<P>
   The designers were presumably not concerned that somebody would
come along and steal the electricity. (On the RAV4, that's about $2
worth. But it would take you several hours to get it, and you'd
need another electric car to dump it into.)
</P>
<P>
   The charging system, including the door, also has a
psychological function; open it and you plug the car in with a
cable that resembles a gasoline hose.
</P>
<P>
   The illusion is continued with the ignition key, which must be
twisted against a spring just like the switch in a gasoline car,
but in this case there is no starter motor. The RAV4 also has
``creep'' programmed into its drivetrain, so if the driver's foot
is taken off the brake, the car inches ahead as if it were a
gasoline model with an automatic transmission. Electric motors
don't idle, of course, they just stop. But it's easier to change
the software than the expectations of the driver.
</P>
<P>
   It makes you think of fuel economy differently; the RAV4 got 3.5
miles a kilowatt-hour. A power plant can turn oil into electricity
at the rate of about 13 kilowatt-hours a gallon; that means the
RAV4 was getting the equivalent of about 45 miles a gallon, about
double the mileage of the gasoline version. At about 8 cents a
kilowatt-hour, that's about 2.3 cents a mile, compared with 4 cents
a mile for gasoline at $1 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The first question most people ask _ how far the car will go
between charges _ becomes less important after a few days. The
brochure for the RAV4 said 125 miles, but Richard Temchin, the
manager of electric vehicles at the Edison Electric Institute, said
to expect 90.
</P>
<P>
   A driver could obsess over this. At times you think you can see
the charging gauge go down the way you can see a minute hand move
on a clock, if you stare at it intently. But after a week you may
start thinking of 90 miles as a long way to go in a typical day. I
drove it from my home in Rockville, Md., over the Beltway to
Arlington, Va., for a meeting, then to Washington, then home, and
used only half the charge; that was my longest trip. True, my 1985
Toyota Camry could have gone a lot farther and refueled in five
minutes instead of four hours. But since the Camry is a second car
and does not go on longer trips, the electric could easily fill its
role in my household.
</P>
<P>
   There are other oddities. When I pull over to the curb in my old
Camry to mail a letter, I wonder whether to shut it off. With an
electric, it makes no difference, because the car doesn't idle.
</P>
<P>
   And an electric car is a great way to impress your mechanic.
``It's a work of art,'' said mine, who works at Dave's Tune-Up Shop
in Rockville, peering at the electronics under the hood. If I
bought one, of course, he'd see a lot less of me.
</P>
<P>
   You also find hidden advantages, such as being able to back into
the garage without pointing the tailpipe at the kitchen door. The
RAV4 was so clean that I began to feel bad about parking it over
the oil spot that my old Ford station wagon has left in the middle
of the garage floor.

<P>
   So Iraq is now under western bombardment. On Dec. 16, a month
after a previous raid was aborted at the last minute, Bill Clinton,
with Britain's Tony Blair in faithful tow, decided to punish Iraq
with missiles and bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The prompt for the current attack is a report by Richard Butler,
the chief of the U.N. inspection team (UNSCOM), that showed Saddam
Hussein had not complied with his pledge on Nov. 14 to allow UNSCOM
full access to all suspect sites.
</P>
<P>
   The response, in the Middle East and beyond, and the
consequences within Iraq itself, can only be guessed at.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been more straightforward if the attack had taken
place in November, when Hussein's behavior, in ending all
cooperation with UNSCOM's inspectors, was unequivocally condemned.
Few voices, at that time, were raised in the Iraqi dictator's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the issues are cloudier, and feelings more
ambivalent: Russia, China and France, the three other permanent
members of the Security Council, are strongly against the attack;
the Arab world's first response was to express sorrow, cynicism and
outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Butler was reporting on Iraqi compliance in the four weeks since
Iraq averted air strikes by promising to cooperate fully with
UNSCOM's demands. The report said the promise had been broken: Iraq
was helpful in many routine ways but unhelpful in other ways and
those are the ways that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's main transgression was to refuse to allow the inspectors,
who were testing Iraqi compliance with a series of unannounced
visits to sensitive sites, access to the ruling Baath Party's
offices unless they first said what they were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq had supposedly been hoping that Butler's report would open
the way for a comprehensive review by the Security Council of the
whole policy of sanctions and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   But it plainly has things _ not necessarily of the
weapons-making kind _ that it would like to conceal from inspectors
it has come to regard as spies of America and/or Israel.
</P>
<P>
   From a military viewpoint, the American attack will test the
claim of military planners that missiles have become ``smarter''
and more accurate since the 1991 Gulf war: at least half the
explosives now being dropped on Iraq are supposed to be
precision-guided, compared with about 10 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles have been fitted with satellite-based guidance
systems making it possible to readjust their course in mid-flight
and, in theory, to achieve pinpoint accuracy. But even the planners
agree that they cannot avoid civilian casualties _ or hope, by air
power alone, to destroy Iraq's capacity to make lethal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The political consequences are even more twisted. The response
of cynics, who include many Arabs, is to question the timing. The
House of Representatives' decision to delay Clinton's impeachment
debate, which had been due to start on Dec. 17, will add force to
the widely held view that attacking Iraq was a classic diversionary
tactic.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Butler's report surely cannot have been under
Clinton's control. But Clinton's explanation that the bombing had
to start immediately because it would have been ``profoundly
offensive'' to strike Iraq during the holy month of Ramadan, which
begins on Dec. 20, is unlikely to win him Muslim friends.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech explaining why the action had to be taken, Clinton
said that ``we will pursue a long-term strategy to contain
Iraq...and work toward the day when Iraq has a government worthy of
its people.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that looks like two aims. America's public aim, until now,
has been to contain Hussein _ with sanctions, inspections and arms
control. But a campaign of sustained bombing could move matters to
a different plane. Forget inspection and arms control, the aim then
would be to rid Iraq of its dictator and his entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Few, including few Iraqis, would object to that _ if it could be
done, and done without causing chaos. But could it?
</P>
<P>
   The great fear among Iraq's neighbors is that America may be
militarily successful in destroying much of Iraq, but that the
eventual political success will still be Saddam's. &QL;

   BAGHDAD _ High above a house that has been gutted by one of the
most feared weapons known to modern warfare, four figures gestured
towards the pink sunset Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   In a tower of the neighborhood mosque, Al Adel of Baghdad, they
looked for a crescent moon to deliver salvation an vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   After all, air war or not, this is the custom as the Muslim holy
period of Ramadan approaches. According to tradition, when a
follower finds the first sliver of the new moon, the month of
fasting and piety begins.
</P>
<P>
   So, in addition to the distant rumble of missile explosions and
the popping of anti-aircraft guns that occasionally sounded over
Baghdad Friday, there was a series of cannon blasts to officially
announce the beginning of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   In most years, that would mean that following morning would
start the month of daytime fasting to mark when the prophet
Mohammed received the Koran from God. This year, it could mean
relief from nightly missile attacks from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton has said he resorted to air strikes
to set back Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's ability to build
weapons of mass destruction, but he wanted to avoid attacking
during Ramadan for fear of offending the world's more than 1
billion Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Friday, Pentagon officials would not say whether
the start of Ramadan will indeed bring an end to the air strikes by
U.S. and British forces.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqis, anyway, do not believe that the holy period figures into
American decision making. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
called such claims ``an insult to Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   Any Muslim can report the sighting of the new moon, which must
be done in the minutes after sundown and witnessed. The sighting is
then certified by religious authorities here and in Saudi Arabia.
The men in Baghdad's Al Adel did not see the moon Friday, perhaps
obscured by clouds. But other Iraqis did, as did Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the appearance of the new moon served to emphasize
the religious filter through which any action in the Middle East is
viewed, especially war. For centuries, even the most bitter enemies
have ceased fire for Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   There is an irony in that Iraq is a highly secular nation
compared to most other Arab countries. Alcohol is sold openly, and
women can wear Western styles of clothing. Saddam has a history of
especially tough repression of religious Muslims, though several
years ago he added the words, ``Allah is Great,'' to the Iraqi
flag.
</P>
<P>
   Many Muslims opposed Saddam in his past aggressions, including
attacks on fellow Muslims in Kuwait and Iran. But to many Iraqis,
encouraged by officials seeking to drive a wedge between the United
States and Arab countries, the missiles falling on Iraq have
nothing to do with United Nations weapons inspections. They are an
attempt by the Americans to wipe out the Arabs and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Ramadan will come and God will pour his anger on these
aggressors,'' said 30-year-old auto parts salesman Abdel Hakeem,
after descending the dark spiral staircase in the minaret at the
Taqwa'a mosque -- roughly translated as ``the mosque of those who
fear God.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his friends say Clinton is a modern crusader bent on
conquering and persecuting Muslims as European crusaders did in the
11th Century.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam, on the other hand, they say, leads the Arab effort to
destroy Jews and that is why Clinton opposes him.
</P>
<P>
   It was a theme also sounded by Deputy Prime Minister Aziz in a
press conference Friday, repeatedly saying Clinton is backed by a
``Zionist clique'' out to make war on Muslims.

   NEW YORK _ Viewers of Saturday's crucial Jets-Bills game at
12:30 p.m. ET on Channel 2 in New York could experience
interruptions from CBS News' coverage of the impeachment vote in
the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   After debate Friday, the House session was expected to reconvene
at 9 a.m. Saturday. Further debate is expected to take an hour,
followed by votes on each of the four articles of impeachment. Each
vote is expected to take 15 to 20 minutes, said Sandy Genelius, a
CBS News spokeswoman. If the schedule holds, the votes will be over
around 11:30, and the game will not be interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   If the debate and votes stretch beyond 12:30, Genelius said,
``we will cover the votes.'' She declined to say whether CBS would
leave the game, or carry it simultaneously on a split screen with
the House votes. ``There are a variety of options, and we'll decide
when the situation arises,'' Genelius said.

<P>
   So Iraq is now under western bombardment. On Dec. 16, a month
after a previous raid was aborted at the last minute, Bill Clinton,
with Britain's Tony Blair in faithful tow, decided to punish Iraq
with missiles and bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The prompt for the current attack is a report by Richard Butler,
the chief of the U.N. inspection team (UNSCOM), that showed Saddam
Hussein had not complied with his pledge on Nov. 14 to allow UNSCOM
full access to all suspect sites.
</P>
<P>
   The response, in the Middle East and beyond, and the
consequences within Iraq itself, can only be guessed at.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been more straightforward if the attack had taken
place in November, when Hussein's behavior, in ending all
cooperation with UNSCOM's inspectors, was unequivocally condemned.
Few voices, at that time, were raised in the Iraqi dictator's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the issues are cloudier, and feelings more
ambivalent: Russia, China and France, the three other permanent
members of the Security Council, are strongly against the attack;
the Arab world's first response was to express sorrow, cynicism and
outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Butler was reporting on Iraqi compliance in the four weeks since
Iraq averted air strikes by promising to cooperate fully with
UNSCOM's demands. The report said the promise had been broken: Iraq
was helpful in many routine ways but unhelpful in other ways and
those are the ways that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's main transgression was to refuse to allow the inspectors,
who were testing Iraqi compliance with a series of unannounced
visits to sensitive sites, access to the ruling Baath Party's
offices unless they first said what they were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq had supposedly been hoping that Butler's report would open
the way for a comprehensive review by the Security Council of the
whole policy of sanctions and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   But it plainly has things _ not necessarily of the
weapons-making kind _ that it would like to conceal from inspectors
it has come to regard as spies of America and/or Israel.
</P>
<P>
   From a military viewpoint, the American attack will test the
claim of military planners that missiles have become ``smarter''
and more accurate since the 1991 Gulf war: at least half the
explosives now being dropped on Iraq are supposed to be
precision-guided, compared with about 10 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles have been fitted with satellite-based guidance
systems making it possible to readjust their course in mid-flight
and, in theory, to achieve pinpoint accuracy. But even the planners
agree that they cannot avoid civilian casualties _ or hope, by air
power alone, to destroy Iraq's capacity to make lethal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The political consequences are even more twisted. The response
of cynics, who include many Arabs, is to question the timing. The
House of Representatives' decision to delay Clinton's impeachment
debate, which had been due to start on Dec. 17, will add force to
the widely held view that attacking Iraq was a classic diversionary
tactic.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Butler's report surely cannot have been under
Clinton's control. But Clinton's explanation that the bombing had
to start immediately because it would have been ``profoundly
offensive'' to strike Iraq during the holy month of Ramadan, which
begins on Dec. 20, is unlikely to win him Muslim friends.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech explaining why the action had to be taken, Clinton
said that ``we will pursue a long-term strategy to contain
Iraq...and work toward the day when Iraq has a government worthy of
its people.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that looks like two aims. America's public aim, until now,
has been to contain Hussein _ with sanctions, inspections and arms
control. But a campaign of sustained bombing could move matters to
a different plane. Forget inspection and arms control, the aim then
would be to rid Iraq of its dictator and his entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Few, including few Iraqis, would object to that _ if it could be
done, and done without causing chaos. But could it?
</P>
<P>
   The great fear among Iraq's neighbors is that America may be
militarily successful in destroying much of Iraq, but that the
eventual political success will still be Saddam's. &QL;

G.M. TRIES TO INCREASE APPEAL OF ELECTRIC CAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ariz.)  (EDS: See also ELECTRIC-CARS-TEST) 
(mk) 
 By ANDREA ADELSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ General Motors Corp. sent a top technology
executive here recently to promote the latest version of its EV1
electric car, which has new batteries that are supposed to double
the driving range to 140 miles between charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still going after the innovator who wants the latest,''
said Frank Pereira, the GM brand manager for advanced technology
vehicles. ``This will reach a greater circle of people. It will
have utility for more of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to dispel consumer reservations over the costs
associated with the aerodynamic two-seater, GM also lowered by
$1,000, to $500, the cost of installing a home recharger _ a
requirement of ownership, since the charging process takes several
hours. There are just 300 public charging sites in Southern
California and the San Francisco Bay area. There are 43 charging
sites in Arizona; GM also leases its electric car in Phoenix and
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Also this month, Ford cut the cost of its home recharging
equipment to $295 and lowered the lease price of its electric
Ranger pickup to $349 or $450 a month, depending on the batteries.
</P>
<P>
   GM will produce just 500 of the 1999-model EV1s, including the
new version equipped with a pack of 26 nickel-metal-hydride
batteries that cost $35,000 a car. The nickel-metal EV1 will lease
for $499 a month for three years, including the cost of the
charger. GM will also offer a so-called high-capacity version, with
improved lead-acid batteries that are supposed to increase the
range by 20 percent and will lease for $424 a month. Last year's
EV1, with conventional lead-acid batteries, cost $399 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The new model looks just like its predecessor, whose range
turned out to be generally less than the predicted 90 miles between
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the EV1 has been tepid since its introduction in
December 1996, with only about 540 being leased. Sales did not even
budge after a local utility company offered employees a
$100-a-month subsidy last summer, said Robert Randall, an EV1
salesman in the Orange County city of Irvine. ``That proved to us
price was not the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   California is the nation's proving ground for electric vehicles,
sparked by state regulations requiring that 10 percent of all
vehicles sold in the state be emission-free starting in 2003. About
1,700 electric vehicles have been sold in the last two years,
including models from Toyota, Honda and Ford. Chrysler plans to
start selling an electric minivan here next year.
</P>
<P>
   The state is also a battleground over the best method for
recharging electric cars. The EV1 uses an inductive system that
transmits energy through a paddle, in the form of alternating
magnetic fields. Ford's electric Ranger, Honda's EV Plus and
Chrysler's Epic van use conductive charging, drawn from a copper
plug similar to those used for clothes dryers and electric ranges.
Toyota is switching its 1999 RAV4-EV to inductive charging, from
conductive.
</P>
<P>
   The charging dispute is akin to the Beta vs. VHS battle in
videocassette recorders, or the Apple vs. Microsoft split in
personal computers. The two methods' technical merits and cost
differences were hotly debated at the industry conference in
Phoenix this month where Ford and General Motors made their
announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Left unresolved, the squabble over a single charging standard
will hurt the industry, said Tom Gage, business manager of AC
Propulsion Inc. in San Dimas, Calif., which makes electric vehicle
motors powered by lead-acid batteries.
</P>
<P>
   For electric cars to become more than niche vehicles, charging
sites must be ubiquitous and batteries must cost less, Gage said.
The true economic costs of the batteries and the charging
infrastructure are being masked by subsidies from utilities,
governments and the automakers. ``At some point, it has to become a
real business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Sterner, an EV1 owner from Riverside, Calif., said he
expected nickel-metal-hydride batteries to assuage fears of running
out of charge, as happened to him one cold day when he was driving
into headwinds between mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of calling a tow truck, he settled into a motel in
Banning, an isolated desert town on the way to Palm Springs, to use
a portable 110-volt emergency recharger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at you funny when you say you only want a place for
three hours,'' he said. He plans to get one of the new,
longer-range EV1s soon. ``No more nights in Banning,'' he said.

 &HT;    CLINTON TO ADDRESS NATION AFTER IMPEACHMENT VOTE
 &HT;    Eds: Retops with speech plans by Clintons.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans to address the nation
Saturday after a scheduled series of House votes targeting his
presidency, the White House said late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And jumping into the political fray after months of absence,
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to journey to Capitol Hill
early Saturday to speak to House Democrats before members take up
four articles of impeachment against her husband.
</P>
<P>
   The president also planned to meet at the White House with House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and other members of the
House Democratic leadership immediately after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made no public remarks since Thursday morning about
impeachment, now widely seen as unavoidable. But White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart suggested that Clinton would want Americans
to know his side of the story as they absorbed news reports about
Saturday's scheduled vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect that at some point you will probably see him,'' said
Lockhart, who declined to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials declined to characterize the purpose or
the substance of Mrs. Clinton's intended remarks Saturday. But on
Friday, she urged the country to embrace reconciliation during a
season celebrated by Christians, Jews and Moslems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in our country ought to practice reconciliation and we
ought to bring our country together and we ought to end
divisiveness because we can do so much more together,'' Mrs.
Clinton told reporters after leaving a holiday awareness event
sponsored by Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that we as a nation would turn our attention to
what we could do together, what we could do positively and how we
could build each other up,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   While the first lady spoke of national healing, Lockhart accused
Clinton's foes of ''partisanship and cynicism'' in an effort to
hound the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said House Republicans have played a duplicitous game.
He noted that after first insisting that impeachment was little
more than a green light for a more comprehensive and meaningful
Senate inquiry, Republicans have begun making the case that Clinton
should resign if impeached on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''A conscious effort was made to, in effect, dumb down
impeachment ... and say that this process wasn't important, that
the real action was someplace else, and then, having gone through
it, turn 180 degrees in the other direction and say, 'It's so
important, it's so important to this country and it's so damaging
that the president should resign,'' Lockhart said at a White House
briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a political strategy at work here that is
cynical and is not in the best interests of the American public,''
Lockhart said. ''You don't make something right by compounding it
with another wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Since House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois
and House Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas suggested in Sunday
talk show appearances that Clinton resign, many other Republicans
have joined in. Even a scattering of Democrats have agreed that
Clinton should resign, or consider doing so, in order to save the
nation the trauma of a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton himself said this week, ``I have no intention of
resigning. It's never crossed my mind.'' And several people close
to the president told reporters Friday that he would never leave
office voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can forget about that,'' said Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As 13 hours of bitterly partisan impeachment debate unfolded
Friday on Capitol Hill, Clinton stayed out of sight, hunkered down
at the White House working on subjects ranging from the continuing
U.S. air strikes in Iraq to the battle against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   He did ``very little'' to help the battle against impeachment,
Lockhart said, other than spend an hour meeting with Rep.
Christopher Shays of Connecticut, an undecided Republican, in the
presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Shays said later he knew no details of the
conversation and that Shays had no plans to announce his decision
until the vote. Lockhart also declined comment about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore conducted a series of radio interviews arguing against
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has admitted wrongdoing in engaging in an intimate
relationship with Lewinsky, a former White House intern, and then
later misleading prosecutors and the nation about the nature of
that relationship.
</P>
<P>
   He has maintained, however, that his conduct does not rise to
the level of an impeachable offense. Instead, Clinton has suggested
that the House vote to censure him in a stern rebuke that would
leave a permanent record of Congressional condemnation of his
activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV _ In the shabby turn-of-the-century synagogue in Kiev's
Shchekavitska Street, a service is in rumbustious progress. Little
boys somersault on the pews and old men, leather phylacteries
strapped to their foreheads and fringed shawls over their
shoulders, debate vociferously as prayers are read from a
velvet-wrapped Torah scroll.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where KGB men once stood outside the few working
synagogues on Sabbath mornings, this scene should lift hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is poignant: every year, about one in ten of Ukraine's
300,000 Jews leaves to go to Israel, Germany or America. At the
current rate of emigration, in a decade's time Kiev's synagogues
will be empty.
</P>
<P>
   Ukrainian Jewry dates back to the ancient Greek colonies of the
Black Sea coast, predating the rise of the Slav principality out of
which ancient Rus grew.
</P>
<P>
   And Ukrainian Jewry later produced a host of famous names, from
Golda Meir and Leon Trotsky to the writers Isaac Babel and Sholem
Aleichem, whose bittersweet stories inspired ``Fiddler on the
Roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, that grand tradition is coming to an end. Since the late
1980s, when Soviet Jews started to get exit visas in large numbers,
Ukraine's Jewish population has fallen by half, reckons Leonid
Finberg, head of Kiev's Institute of Jewish Studies.
</P>
<P>
   And most of the emigrants are young, including all Finberg's
best researchers, while those who stay behind are dying off fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every child born of a Jewish mother,'' he says, ``there
are nine deaths. If the over-50s make up 25 percent of the general
population, in the Jewish community it's over 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The more people leave, the less likely it is that the remainder
will stay: ``Most of us now have close relations abroad. So
emigration isn't seen as such a tragedy as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiefly to blame for the exodus is Ukraine's dreadful economy,
which has shrunk every year since independence. Another cause is a
lack of help for those who want to rebuild Judaism at home.
</P>
<P>
   None of the five big foreign-financed Jewish businesses working
in Ukraine specifically encourages people to stay, while the
country's 16 newly opened Jewish schools teach Hebrew, to prepare
for life in Israel, rather than Yiddish, the historic
Jewish-Ukrainian tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ukraine's two dozen or so rabbis are American Hasidim:
none admits regret that the congregations, choirs and youth groups,
painstakingly rebuilt after years of oppression, are being lost to
emigration.
</P>
<P>
   As Yaakov Bleich, an Orthodox rabbi from Brooklyn, puts it:
``Our goal is neither to rebuild the community, nor to get them to

   KIEV _ In the shabby turn-of-the-century synagogue in Kiev's
Shchekavitska Street, a service is in rumbustious progress. Little
boys somersault on the pews and old men, leather phylacteries
strapped to their foreheads and fringed shawls over their
shoulders, debate vociferously as prayers are read from a
velvet-wrapped Torah scroll.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where KGB men once stood outside the few working
synagogues on Sabbath mornings, this scene should lift hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is poignant: every year, about one in ten of Ukraine's
300,000 Jews leaves to go to Israel, Germany or America. At the
current rate of emigration, in a decade's time Kiev's synagogues
will be empty.
</P>
<P>
   Ukrainian Jewry dates back to the ancient Greek colonies of the
Black Sea coast, predating the rise of the Slav principality out of
which ancient Rus grew.
</P>
<P>
   And Ukrainian Jewry later produced a host of famous names, from
Golda Meir and Leon Trotsky to the writers Isaac Babel and Sholem
Aleichem, whose bittersweet stories inspired ``Fiddler on the
Roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, that grand tradition is coming to an end. Since the late
1980s, when Soviet Jews started to get exit visas in large numbers,
Ukraine's Jewish population has fallen by half, reckons Leonid
Finberg, head of Kiev's Institute of Jewish Studies.
</P>
<P>
   And most of the emigrants are young, including all Finberg's
best researchers, while those who stay behind are dying off fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every child born of a Jewish mother,'' he says, ``there
are nine deaths. If the over-50s make up 25 percent of the general
population, in the Jewish community it's over 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The more people leave, the less likely it is that the remainder
will stay: ``Most of us now have close relations abroad. So
emigration isn't seen as such a tragedy as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiefly to blame for the exodus is Ukraine's dreadful economy,
which has shrunk every year since independence. Another cause is a
lack of help for those who want to rebuild Judaism at home.
</P>
<P>
   None of the five big foreign-financed Jewish businesses working
in Ukraine specifically encourages people to stay, while the
country's 16 newly opened Jewish schools teach Hebrew, to prepare
for life in Israel, rather than Yiddish, the historic
Jewish-Ukrainian tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ukraine's two dozen or so rabbis are American Hasidim:
none admits regret that the congregations, choirs and youth groups,
painstakingly rebuilt after years of oppression, are being lost to
emigration.
</P>
<P>
   As Yaakov Bleich, an Orthodox rabbi from Brooklyn, puts it:
``Our goal is neither to rebuild the community, nor to get them to
leave. It's to educate them, to give them as much Jewish life as
possible while they're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiev's Reform rabbi, David Wilfond, is as unsentimental. His job
is not, he says, ``to keep one last fiddler on the roof while the
house burns.'' &QL;

AT LEAST 8 KILLED IN CAPSIZING OF SUSPECTED SMUGGLING BOAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk) 
 By PAMELA MERCER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ At least eight people were killed late Thursday night
when a pleasure boat carrying 26 Cubans capsized off one of the
keys that make up Biscayne National Park, Coast Guard officials
said Friday. The officials described the incident as a probable
case of immigrant smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard and immigration officials could not recall a recent
incident in which a boat taking refugees across the Straits of
Florida had caused so many deaths. Nine people were also reported
missing.
</P>
<P>
   The vessel, about 30 feet long, capsized about 11 p.m. on
Thursday, Coast Guard spokesmen said, some 20 miles south of Miami
near Elliott Key. A passing freighter noticed the capsizing Friday
morning and rescued seven passengers, including two children, who
had been clinging to the boat for about 10 hours, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The dead passengers were discovered later in the vicinity by a
Coast Guard rescue team. Using two cutters and three helicopters,
the Coast Guard members searched for the remaining passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is a case of smuggling,'' said Jibran Soto, a
Coast Guard spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The boat was registered with Florida plates and was likely used
to bring Cubans to the country illegally, Soto added.
</P>
<P>
   The incident comes as law-enforcement officials have encountered
a growing number of cases involving smugglers trying to bring Cuban
and Haitian refugees into the United States. But it was not
immediately clear whether the group whose boat capsized Friday had
been organized by a smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   The site of Friday's capsizing, the shallow flats south of Key
Biscayne, an island neighborhood of greater Miami, holds normally
tranquil waters where recreational boats are a common sight. Though
more illegal immigrants try to reach Florida during the summer
months than in December, the weather has been warm with mild winds.
</P>
<P>
   But navigating the waters from Cuba has often been a deadly trip
for immigrants trying to leave the island, said Jose Basulto, who
heads Brothers to the Rescue, a group that seeks to rescue Cubans
and other refugees stranded along the Florida straits. ``We try to
tell our brothers in Cuba not to do this because it's costing too
many lives,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar incident in March, three people died when a boat
believed to carry 16 refugees capsized off Biscayne Bay. Two people
were later charged with smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton began ordering the deportation of Cuban boat
people in May 1995 after a huge influx of Cubans by sea. This
represented a radical change from a 35-year policy of welcoming all
those leaving Cuba. Since the new policy has been in place, those
spotted in the water are more likely to be deported than those who
make it to shore.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, almost 1,000 Cubans trying to enter the United
States have been picked up by Coast Guard patrols.

<P>
   Other polls have shown higher support for the president to
resign, if, in fact, he is impeached by the House. But because a
minority of the public still confuses impeachment by the House with
removal by the Senate, the Times/CBS News Poll pointed out the
difference as part of the resignation question: ``If the full House
votes to send impeachment articles to the Senate for a trial, then
do you think it would be better for the country if Bill Clinton
resigned from office, or not?'' Forty-three percent said better, 53
percent disagreed.

<P>
   Once revolutionary, the steam engine is now the epitome of
old-fashioned technology. But the motors of the industrial
revolution have not run out of steam just yet.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in Winterthur, Switzerland, the most advanced large
steam locomotive ever built is being tested at the Swiss Locomotive
and Machine Works (SLM) _ a division of a conglomerate called
Sulzer.
</P>
<P>
   Although it looks like a conventional steam locomotive, SLM's
engine incorporates a host of technological improvements that make
it cleaner and more efficient than the Puffing Billies of old. As a
result, it could give diesel engines a run for their money.
</P>
<P>
   The godfather of the modern steam-engine movement is Livio Dante
Porta, an Argentine engineer who realized, when steam engines
started to be replaced by diesels in the 1950s, that there was
still plenty of room for improvement in steam-engine design.
</P>
<P>
   He spent his career finding new ways to refine the performance
of steam engines. He and his followers, who include Roger Waller,
chief designer of the SLM locomotive, have travelled the world,
restoring and modernizing old engines, and trying to rekindle
support for steam power.
</P>
<P>
   The engine now being tested by SLM was originally built in
Germany in 1942. It has been upgraded according to Porta's
principles, which improve performance in a number of ways.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, unlike conventional coal-fired steam engines, the
new engine burns light oil. It also has an improved draft mechanism
to supply the air for combustion. With coal-fired engines as much
as half the coal is carried away by the air as it passes over the
fuel, so the new engine is far more fuel-efficient.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is no need for a stoker to shovel the coal,
and no danger of burning embers causing track-side fires.
</P>
<P>
   Another improvement is the use of modern materials to insulate
the boiler and the steam pipes. One result of this is that the
boiler stays warm overnight and the engine can be brought to its
operating temperature within 15 minutes in the morning, compared
with three hours for a conventional steam engine.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with other improvements, including weight reductions
made possible by the use of welded rather than cast-iron
components, and the replacement of oil-lubricated bearings by
modern roller bearings, the result is an engine 25 percent lighter,
36 percent more powerful, and consuming 41 percent less fuel than
old-fashioned coal-fired engines.
</P>
<P>
   But as well as outperforming conventional steam engines, the new
one compares favorably with diesels, both economically and
environmentally.
</P>
<P>
   According to SLM, modern steam locomotives cost around SFr2
million ($1.5 million) each to build from scratch _ about the same
as a diesel locomotive. Although they consume slightly more fuel,
they are simpler to maintain and repair, making them especially
suitable for use in poor countries. They last longer, too.
</P>
<P>
   And they are also less smelly. Because they rely on external
combustion (the burning of fuel at a constant rate outside the
engine's cylinders, rather than explosively inside them), they
produce only a fifth of the noxious emissions of diesels of
comparable power.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially desirable in such applications as shunting,
when locomotives spend 70 percent of their time idling, often in
built-up areas in which pollution is particularly unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   The current tests involve measuring the power of a modernized
locomotive by pitting it against two electric engines in a
tug-of-war. Once testing is complete the engine, which belongs to a
German railway company, will be used on the Orient Express.
</P>
<P>
   But according to SLM, tourism is by no means the only market for
new steam locomotives. The company also has its eye on developing
countries with extensive railway networks, such as India and China.
Once the figures from this week's tests are in to prove its case,
SLM hopes it will be full steam ahead. &QL;

STATE PROBES INSEMINATION MISTAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ State public health officials Friday launched an
investigation of a Stoneham fertility center's mistake in using the
wrong sperm for a patient undergoing an artificial insemination
procedure earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   It also appears Boston Regional Medical Center did not report
the incident within the time required by state regulation, seven
days by letter or 24 hours by phone, said Nancy Ridley, assistant
public health commissioner in charge of the bureau of health
quality management.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would probably get cited for that'' as a deficiency in
reporting, she said, adding that she does not yet know what, if
any, other citations might be issued.
</P>
<P>
   The center formally notified the state Department of Public
Health Friday, after media reports of the incident first surfaced,
leading to the opening of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the center said the patient was immediately told
she did not receive her husband's sperm and was given the option
``to take a contraceptive medication after the procedure,'' which
she did. ``The hospital regrets the error and has apologized to the
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The error occurred in the Stoneham hospital's outpatient Center
for Reproductive Medicine, located in a medical office building,
according to hospital spokeswoman Christine Hawrylak. A nurse
involved in the incident, which occurred the first week of
December, was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Hawrylak said the hospital didn't report the mistake to the
state sooner ``because after consulting with our legal counsel, it
was concluded that this incident did not meet the regulatory
description of `other serious incidents. . .which seriously affect
the healthy and safety of. . .patients.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we run an excellent program and we welcome the visit
of the Department of Public Health to the center,'' as part of its
investigation, Hawrylak said.
</P>
<P>
   The patient was undergoing what's called intrauterine
insemination. The center does nearly 400 such procedures a year.
</P>
<P>
   No special regulations govern fertility centers here or
nationwide, although the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention have proposed a ``model certification program'' for
embryo laboratories and is seeking public comment on it through
January 5. Legislation has also been filed in Massachusetts to
establish specific state standards, without success.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society for Reproductive Medicine does have
voluntary standards for embryo laboratories, however.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that the wrong sperm has been
injected during infertility treatments at facilities around the
country and the world. From Utah to Florida, New York to the
Netherlands, such mistakes have led to the wrong race child being
born to a couple in some cases.

 &HT;    Debate sways few House members as vote forges ahead
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For only the second time in America's 222-year
history, the House is poised today to vote articles of impeachment
against President Clinton. Clinton plans an address to the nation
from the Rose Garden following the momentous vote.
</P>
<P>
   Today's scheduled vote follows hours of impassioned debate on
the House floor Friday during which Republicans argued the
president had shattered the rule of law and Democrats pleaded for
the lesser sanction of censure.
</P>
<P>
   Tempers flared throughout the long day as members brandished
copies of the Constitution and debated the significance of lying
under oath, while a half a world away U.S. and allied forces
continued to bomb Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The four counts of impeachment against Clinton all stem from his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and his
efforts to conceal the relationship before the courts, the Congress
and the public.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has insisted throughout the crisis that he sinned
but did not break the law, appeared resigned to today's vote. He
met briefly Friday with one Republican moderate, who then slipped
out a side entrance to avoid the media, but Clinton devoted nearly
all the day to monitoring the Iraqi conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Clinton maintained a stoic appearance of
doing the nation's business even as he was poised to enter history
as only the second president impeached since President Andrew
Johnson in 1868. The Senate failed to convict Johnson by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   As she has so many times during the couples' 23-year marriage,
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton gave the Clinton's only public
comment about her husband's fate. Speaking to reporters after a
meeting with Mothers Against Drunk Driving, she said ``the vast
majority of Americans share my approval and pride in the job that
the president's been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to end divisiveness because we can do so much more
together,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders predicted that at least two of the four
articles of impeachment against Clinton will prevail. Still they
left nothing to chance. In an effort to steel the resolve among
wavering members to impeach on all four counts, Republican members
shepherded some members over to the locked room where the evidence
against Clinton is kept to show them the more salacious materials
first hand.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the materials shown to Republicans included
unsubstantiated claims that the president made unwanted sexual
advances toward other women while he was in Arkansas, dating back
to the 1970s when he was state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   With the only doubt now being which articles of impeachment will
pass, the debate about what should happen next developed Friday
with gathering force.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans stepped up their demands that Clinton resign. Two
Democrats, Reps. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.) and Bill Lipinski
(D-Ill.), also said Clinton should consider resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to resign,'' said Rep. Charlie Norwood (R-Ga.).
``That's what's right for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart repeated Friday that Clinton has
no intention of resigning, saying the president was in a ``good
mood'' and focused on ``the important work he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd welcome a solution that's bipartisan and that puts this
matter behind us, that is short of impeachment,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Clinton's studied indifference to the historic
House debate and Mrs. Clinton's plea for reconciliation, the House
on Friday engaged in heated, sometimes angry, partisan debate over
Clinton's conduct, the meaning of the Constitution how best to
bring the Clinton-Lewinsky saga to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The historic debate was carefully scripted by both parties.
Mindful that the networks planned early coverage before deciding
whether to resume regular programing, both sides loaded their
heaviest hitting speakers for the early morning.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the gavel was brought down late Friday night, more
than 200 members, from the well-known to the lesser known, had
spoken their mind about Clinton's fate. Some members thundered.
Others spoke barely above a whisper. A few even appeared to be on
the verge of tears.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the public filled the public galleries above the
House floor, at times demonstrating more interest in the
proceedings than the members themselves. Throughout the day, the
House floor was no more than half full.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) tried to set
the tone for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The matter before the House is a question of lying under
oath,'' Hyde said. ``This is a public act, not a private act. This
is called perjury. The matter before the House is a question of the
willful, premeditated, deliberate corruption of the nation's system
of justice. Perjury and obstruction of justice cannot be reconciled
with the office of the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two impeachment articles charge Clinton with lying
under oath before the grand jury and lying in his deposition in
Paula Jones's civil harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Article three charges Clinton with obstructing justice by
attempting to influence the testimony of Lewinsky in the Jones case
and his personal secretary, Betty Currie. Article four charges
Clinton with lying to Congress in answers he submitted to the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, Democrats took up Clinton's defense and hammered
away at the Republican argument that Clinton's conduct, however
shameful, did not rise to the level of ``high crimes and
misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While the president's conduct was reprehensible, it did not
threaten the nation,'' said Rep. Dick Boucher (D-Va.). ``It did not
undermine the constitutional form and principles of our government.
It did not disable the proper functioning of the constitutional
duties of the presidential office.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats angrily accused Republicans of seeking to force
Clinton's impeachment by denying a vote on censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only conclude that you don't want our members to have
this choice,'' said minority leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.). ``I can
only conclude that this may be about winning a vote, not about
high-minded ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats went so far as to accuse Republicans of seeking
to undermine the commander in chief while the country was at war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting this proceeding today may wind up costing American
lives,'' charged Rep. Martin Frost (D-Texas). ``The majority may
well have blood on its hands.''
</P>
<P>
   With history looking over their shoulder, members from both
parties quoted freely from the canons of American democracy:
Lincoln, Hamilton, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   They also quoted Lewinsky and Clinton. Rep. Bill McCollom
(R-Fla.) quoted Clinton's question to Curry after his Jones'
deposition, ``I was never alone with her, right?'' Clinton told
Currie. Rep. Bill Delahunt (D-Mass.) followed later with Lewinsky's
unsolicited remark to the grand jury, ``No one asked me to lie and
no one offered me a job for my silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Some quoted the Constitution and the Magna Carta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should look not simply to ourselves but to the past and to
the future,'' said Hyde. ``Let's look back to Bunker Hill, Concord,
Lexington, let's look across the river to Arlington Cemetery, where
American heroes who gave their lives for the sake of the rule of
law lie buried.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chet Edwards (D-Texas) countered that ``the hindsight of
history will be harsh on this Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the name of the rule of law, this process ignored the
fundamental principles of due process and fairness that form the
foundation of that rule of law,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Some members dispensed with the legal and constitutional
intricacies altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot trust him again,'' said Rep. Sam Johnson (R-Texas), a
former prisoner of war, of Clinton. ``If it is in his interest not
to tell the truth, he will not tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   There were even veiled references to the Capitol's newest
scandal _ disclosures Thursday that House speaker-elect Bob
Livingston (R-La.) had sexual affairs during his 33-year marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinsky is not Watergate,'' said Rep. Rosa DeLauro
(D-Conn.). ``Let he who has no sin in this chamber cast the first
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most poignant remarks came from the 40 members of
Congress retiring this year and for whom today's vote will be their
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me about the venom and the hatred, and the
camaraderie that is nonexistent in this House any more,'' said Rep.
Bill Hefner (D-N.C.). ``Hate is a cancer that eats at us. It shows
in our face, it shows in our walk. And it's something you can't
treat with chemotherapy, you can't treat it with any drugs. You
have to treat it with compassion and love.''

GRETZKY'S HOME AWAY FROM HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his 20 seasons of accomplishment in the National Hockey
League, Wayne Gretzky has performed in many arenas that have either
been vacated by their teams or demolished altogether. They include
the Montreal Forum, the Boston Garden, Chicago Stadium, the Detroit
Olympia, the Auditorium in Buffalo, the Arena in St. Louis and the
Spectrum in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   He said he remembers the national anthem in Chicago and how the
building seemed to shake; the balcony in Boston and how the fans
seemed to be right on top of the players; and the hard, fast ice in
Detroit where Gordie Howe, his boyhood idol, skated before him.
</P>
<P>
   These memories, Gretzky said, evoke feelings that are difficult
to express. As much as he is a star of the sport, Gretzky, more
than many athletes, remains a fan, with a fan's sense of nostalgia
and tradition.
</P>
<P>
   But no rink is as special to him to visit as Maple Leaf Gardens
in Toronto, where Gretzky and the Rangers will play for the final
time Saturday night. The Leafs are moving into a new building, the
Air Canada Centre, in February, the month after Gretzky's 38th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky grew up in Brantford, in southern Ontario, where Maple
Leaf Gardens was known as ``the church of hockey.'' It was ``one of
the first arenas that we used to help establish an NHL,'' Gretzky
said, ``and it is the foundation of making the Toronto Maple Leaf
franchise what it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also the closest NHL rink to his home. He first visited
it with his grandmother when he was 6 years old, to see a game
between the Leafs and the Oakland Seals.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad dropped us off,'' Gretzky said Friday. ``We sat in the
very last row. I got there an hour early. I don't think I moved the
whole time. I think the first time I got out of my seat was after
they announced the three stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky has been one of those three stars many times in visits
to the big old barn on Carlton Street. In 29 regular-season games
there, Gretzky has 30 goals and 45 assists. In eight playoff games,
he has three goals and eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his best-remembered performances, when he was with the
Los Angeles Kings in 1993, Gretzky scored three goals, and his hat
trick led the Kings to a 5-4 victory in Game 7 of the Campbell
Conference finals. ``Maybe the best game I ever played,'' Gretzky
said Friday. It sent the Kings to their only berth in the Stanley
Cup finals, where they lost to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to get excited for a game at Maple Leaf
Gardens,'' Gretzky said. Unlike some players from the
hockey-intense region, he said he is not bothered by the demands of
family and friends before the game. ``They leave me alone until
after the game,'' Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, wife and children are expected to be among the
capacity crowd Saturday night. They will see two rested teams, both
having last played on Wednesday, when the Rangers lost to the
Devils and the Leafs defeated Phoenix. Toronto is 17-11-2 and
challenging for the lead in the Eastern Conference. The Rangers are
11-12-7, but they are 1-0-1 against the Leafs this season.
</P>
<P>
   With 33 points, on six goals and 27 assists, Gretzky is tied for
sixth in NHL scoring. In regular-season play for his career, he has
891 goals and 1,937 assists.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked what makes the Toronto building unique in a
hockey sense, Gretzky replied: ``The bottom part of the boards were
so lively compared to any other arena in hockey. In Maple Leaf
Gardens, you could shoot a puck from the left point, hit the
backboards and it could come out in front to the guy on the other
side of the net and _ bang, bang! _ quicker than any other
building. It's not quite the same now because the net has been
moved out two feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a game, Gretzky recalled, he and other players would
practice the carom, just to get the angle right and possibly catch
opponents off guard.
</P>
<P>
   He first played there on Nov. 21, 1979, when he was an NHL
rookie with the Edmonton Oilers. In a 4-4 tie, Gretzky had two
goals and two assists. In his most recent trip, on Nov. 7, he
scored a goal and saved the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very special place, something I think is sacred,'' he
said. ``You don't replace Maple Leaf Gardens. But I understand the
position of the owners and the situation they are in. We have to
grow with the times and change with the times. Sometimes in life,
we don't like changes. But we have to make them. We will never
recapture the atmosphere.''

U.S., BRITAIN POUND IRAQ FOR A THIRD DAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and Britain pounded Iraq for a
third day Friday as military forces continued a furious missile
bombardment of weapons sites and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The military operation, called Operation Desert Fox, continued
as the House opened debate on impeachment charges against President
Clinton. The third round also came despite a growing rift between
the United States and Russia over the attacks and increasing
protests in Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said publicly they could not say when the
bombings might end, although some reports quoted unnamed defense
officials as saying the attacks could be halted Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to report that the United States and British forces
are continuing to attack a wide range of military targets in order
to decrease Iraq's ability to threaten its neighbors,'' said
Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to be satisfied by the results, although the
strikes are not yet complete. There have been no American or
British casualties,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Iraq dead or injured was not known. Baghdad
officials last provided an estimate of 25 dead and 75 wounded
following the first attack Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon reported nearly 300 sea-launched and air-launched
cruise missiles were fired during the first two waves of attacks
against Iraq, more than in the entire 1991 Persian Gulf War. The B1
bomber, the controversial replacement for the aging Vietnam era
B-52, also saw combat action for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton made no comment about the military operation,
but British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in London that ``I
believe we are on course to achieve our military objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain launched their retaliatory attack
against Saddam Hussein after arms inspectors of the United Nations
Special Commission were denied access to records and facilities.
The allies accused Saddam of attempting to hide chemical and
biological weapons that he agreed to dispose of after the 1991
Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, Saddam called on Arabs to resist the agents of Satan,
as he called U.S. and British forces. ``By God, we will not
compromise,'' Saddam said via a taped televised address to Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   The monthlong Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which requires
Muslims to fast during the day, begins this weekend, but National
Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger said it ``is not an
automatic deadline'' for ending the military assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an operation that was planned by the military ...
without regard to dates,'' Berger said. ``It has a duration and a
particular target set and I don't think we're likely to alter that.
We will continue to proceed until we believe we have done what we
can with the targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
there were 75 targets in the first two attack waves and more than
200 strike and strike-support sorties flown by U.S. and British
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said initial damage assessments indicated a small number
of the targets had been destroyed. ``Not all have gone as
planned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Tom Wilson, the Pentagon's intelligence director, said
the targets have included 18 command and control centers, which
includes radio and television transmitters, 19 weapons security
facilities, 11 weapons production facilities, eight Republican
Guard facilities and five airfields. The lone economic target, he
said, was Iraqi's Basra oil refinery, which serves as a
distribution point for Saddam's illegal oil exports.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also said there had been varying degrees of success. ``We
realize you can't destroy it all,'' Shelton said. ``You can't
destroy it, but you can bring it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Military forces also dropped two million leaflets in Southern
Iraq to warn regular army units based there to stay in their
barracks and they would not be attacked. The army units were warned
not to move south to threaten Kuwait or to threaten allied forces.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British forces have attacked the Republican Guard, the
30,000-strong elite force that Saddam uses to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz maintained that the
allied forces attacked civilian targets such as warehouses, radio
and television facilities, and the oil refinery. ``The same liars,
the same criminals, are repeating their lies and crimes,'' Aziz
said, suggesting that Clinton and Blair were kowtowing to Zionists.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are witnessing now is not a military conflict. It's a
criminal aggression by the United States and Britain against Iraq,
the Arab nation, the Muslims and against the whole international
community,'' Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-American protests broke out in a half-dozen Arab capitals,
with many saying the attacks were motivated by the president's
problems with the impeachment vote in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia has insisted that U.S. aircraft not stage from
bases within its borders, the New York Times reported. The report
said more than half of the U.S. strike aircraft at ground bases in
the region have been kept out of the attack because of the Saudi
objections.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz did not rule out allowing inspectors to return to Iraq
after the attacks but only when economic sanctions, in place since
1991 after Baghdad invaded Kuwait, are lifted and only without
Richard Butler, the UNSCOM director whose critical report fueled
the decision to attack.
</P>
<P>
   The United States said the conditions were unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A really functional UNSCOM, a strong UNSCOM with
professionals, could go in after this, and Saddam Hussein can
comply and then we can go to the comprehensive review,'' said
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also sought to downplay the growing rift between the
United States and Russia. There were conflicting reports that
Russia placed its military on alert status but Pentagon officials
said that was unconfirmed. Russia also recalled its ambassadors to
the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that clearly the Russians disagree with us about the
use of force in Iraq. They, however, have no good ideas about how
to solve the problem,'' Albright said during an appearance on
NBC-TV's ``Today Show.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton twice tried to call Russian leader Boris
Yeltsin and finally sent him a letter through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have developed a relationship with Russia that
can sustain controversy, differences and difficulties, however
sharp they may become,'' said Thomas Pickering, the undersecretary
of state and former Russian ambassador.

SWEETENER IS SAFE, GOVERNMENT PANEL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Neb.)  (rl) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A government advisory group has voted to give a clean bill of
health to the artificial sweetener saccharin, which, despite its
pink-packeted presence on restaurant tables everywhere, has been
classified since 1981 as a suspected cause of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the executive committee of the National Toxicology
Program, voted 6 to 3 at a meeting Wednesday to recommend that
saccharin be removed from the government's list of suspected
carcinogens, said a scientist who attended the meeting and who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The toxicology program is part of the Department of Health and
Human Services, and its role is to coordinate government programs
that evaluate the safety of chemicals to which people are exposed,
including substances like saccharin that are added to foods. The
program is based in Research Triangle Park, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's vote is not the final word on saccharin, but it
carries weight with policymakers. The vote will be considered by
the toxicology agency director, Dr. Kenneth Olden, who is to make a
recommendation about saccharin in a Report on Carcinogens that will
be presented next summer to Donna Shalala, secretary of Health and
Human Services, and later to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the toxicology agency declined to comment on the
vote, said a spokeswoman, Sandra Lange. The reason for secrecy was
not clear, and several scientists who attended the meeting said
they were puzzled by it. Ms. Lange said meeting participants had
been instructed not to disclose the vote because executive
committee meetings are not public and it is the executive
committee's policy to keep its proceedings confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The committee action followed votes by three other advisory
groups that had been asked to evaluate saccharin studies in people
and animals. Two of the other groups, comprising government
scientists, had also recommended that saccharin be taken off the
official list of suspected carcinogens. But a panel of
non-government experts on carcinogens that met in October 1997
voted 4 to 3 to keep saccharin on the list. The toxicology agency's
executive committee was asked to take all the earlier results into
account when voting.
</P>
<P>
   The votes were part of a review process that began in September
1996 when the Calorie Control Council, an Atlanta-based trade group
for the diet-food industry, petitioned the toxicology program to
have saccharin removed from the list of ``anticipated,'' or likely,
carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the toxicology program has removed seven
substances from the list, either because the evidence of danger was
judged insufficient, or because people in the United States were
not exposed to the chemicals, said Dr. William Jameson, head of the
Report on Carcinogens Group of the toxicology program. About 200
chemicals are now on the list. Jameson said that if saccharin is
taken off, it will be the first compound to be removed by means of
a review process as rigorous as the one required to put a substance
on the list in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Saccharin was first singled out as a possible carcinogen in 1977
by a Canadian researcher. The Food and Drug Administration sought
to ban it, but consumers, who would have been left without any
artificial sweeteners, protested. Cyclamates, another sweetener,
had been banned as carcinogenic. Ultimately, Congress refused to
ban on saccharin, but required warning labels.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the four recent votes on saccharin, none of which
was unanimous, reflect the fact that, despite years of research,
scientists still disagree about how to interpret the data. Most
studies in people have not found a link between saccharin and
cancer, but a few did suggest a connection to an increased risk of
bladder cancer. But researchers say that even those studies
indicate that if saccharin is carcinogenic, it is only weakly so.
</P>
<P>
   In rats, high doses of saccharin do cause bladder cancer, but
Dr. Samuel Cohen, a pathologist at the University of Nebraska, says
he has found that the saccharin is interacting with a component in
rat urine that is not found in human urine. Therefore, Cohen says,
the rat studies have no bearing on people. Other scientists have
questioned that assertion, and countered that tumors might still
form in people by some other mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Saccharin accounts for about one-third of the artificial
sweetener sold in the United States. (Most of the rest is
aspartame, sold as Nutrasweet and Equal.) The main ingredient in
the popular sugar substitute Sweet 'N Low, saccharin is also added
to diet pastries, candies, chewing gum, toothpaste, mouthwash,
salad dressing and other products. But foods containing it must
carry warning labels that state: ``Use of this product may be
hazardous to your health. This product contains saccharin, which
has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Striking saccharin from the carcinogen list does not mean that
the warnings would be dropped immediately: They are required by
law. But taking saccharin off the list might open the door to
getting rid of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer health
group based in Washington, strongly criticized the move to remove
saccharin from the list. Dr. Michael Jacobson, director of the
center, said the government had been unduly influenced by the
diet-food industry.

   WASHINGTON _ While the impeachment debate unfolded Friday with
all the solemnity associated with an effort to remove the president
from office, discussions off the House floor focused on ferocious
rumors that there would be a full-scale outing of Republicans who
had broken their marriage vows.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston's confession
that he had been unfaithful to his wife in the past, House members
debated impeachment under rules that specifically forbade them from
comparing President Clinton's sexual indiscretions to any sitting
member's ``personal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the speaker's lobby, a plush sideroom where members talk
to the press, Livingston's confession was never far from the minds
of House members who were swept up in the rumor and inuendo.
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on, support for the speaker-elect among some
Republicans began to waver, according to the Associated Press,
which quoted Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama saying
Livingston's status should be reexamined.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't criticize the president's behavior as being
unacceptable and then ... just ignore this and brush it aside,''
Bachus was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Republicans, however, appeared to stand solidly
behind Livingston. And in Livingston's congressional district in
Louisiana, there are no signs that he is in any political trouble.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the speaker-elect's infidelities became fodder for
LWWL radio's ``The Andre Show,'' broadcast live Friday from
Livingston's hometown of Metairie, La., callers rallied to his
defense and railed instead at Clinton and the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``If every congressman who had an affair turned to dust, then
Washington would look like a desert,'' said Tommy from Kenner. ``On
personal matters, the media should lose freedom of the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the partisan division in Washington, everyone was agreed on
one point: what is happening tarnishes the reputation of the House
and diminishes the grandeur of its proceedings, and marks an
unprecedented period of scandal and incivility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is greatly disturbing,'' said Representative Tim Roemer,
a Colorado Democrat. ``It degrades the institution ... and
seriously erodes people's respect for this hallowed insitution. I
hope we can stop going into members' closets and throwing their
skeletons into the House.''
</P>
<P>
   The bar has been lowered, lawmakers fear, not just for
constitutional rules of impeachment, but for what is considered
political fair play.
</P>
<P>
   Congresswoman Mary Bono, a California Republican who said she is
being hounded by reporters snooping for dirt on her, called the
state of affairs ``a festival of cannibals.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats also agreed on another point: the
invasion of personal life for political purposes is inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a completely private matter,'' commented
Representative Patrick Kennedy, a Rhode Island Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, agreed.
``Many members have said that this issue isn't about sex, but a lot
of the push from the outside has been from people who think this is
exactly about sex,'' he said. The Livingston confession
``diminishes the moral superiority and indignation factor
significantly, and it reinforces the perception that there is an
ulterior motive here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut Represenative Nancy Johnson, like many
Republicans, said Livingston's admission of an indiscretion had no
bearing on his ability to lead the House _ or on the impeachment
debate. ``This is not about sex,'' said Johnson. ``It's about
perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans also pointed to the Livingston confession as
evidence of a ``scorched earth policy '' by the White House
designed to discredit Republicans _ and highlight a double standard
_ by revealing their sexual indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows the president's personal defenders are engaged
in a pattern of intimidation and blackmail,'' said California
Representative Dana Rohrabacher, blaming all recent revelations of
Republican sexual infidelities on a ``ruthless'' White House.
</P>
<P>
   Rohrbacher did not say whether Republicans had evidence for such
a policy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, press reports have forced Republican
Representatives Helen Chenoweth of Idaho, Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, and Dan Burton of Indiana to
admit to sexual affairs.

SPORTS COLUMN: STILL SPECIAL AFTER 30 YEARS OF PURE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.)  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ricardo and Donna Thornton stood proudly in the
East Room of the White House on Thursday evening. They snapped
photos, renewed acquaintances, accepted congratulations. Ricardo
teased his son about the fit of his first tuxedo. He said Ricardo
Jr. was playing basketball and eagerly looking forward to beginning
a football career next year in the eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   In his role as an ambassador for the Special Olympics, Thornton
has traveled round the United States; last year he visited South
Africa. But this was an amazing night capping a remarkable journey:
from an institution in which he had been committed as a child with
mental retardation _ and where he met his future wife _ to the
White House, where he and 11 others were being honored on the 30th
anniversary of the Special Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   This was a powerful evening on a day when the confluence of
domestic and international tensions had thrust the nation into
turmoil. Under a pavilion on the South Lawn, supporters of the
Special Olympics gathered to celebrate with music and tributes; on
Capitol Hill, members of the House were deciding to begin debate
the following day on the impeachment of President Clinton;
thousands of miles away a military assault had been carried out at
the president's orders, against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for three hours, this Special Olympics gala brought together
a contingent of adversaries. There were Republicans like Orrin
Hatch, the senator from Utah, mingling with Democrats. He stood in
line and waited to greet the president and Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There was David Stern, the National Basketball Association
commissioner. There were two NBA players _ Grant Hill and Rick Fox.
Although players and league are involved in a bitter lockout, the
NBA, Hill and Fox all play active roles in the Special Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   One of those at my table was Gene Stallings, the former Alabama
football coach. He was an assistant there when his third child was
born. Mental retardation was diagnosed. ``I drew back to hit the
doctor and passed out,'' Stallings said. ``I thought that was the
absolute worst thing that ever happened to me. But the thing I
thought was the worst thing turned out to be one of the best
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Stallings said his greatest moment was not in a Super Bowl or a
national championship but at a Special Olympics race he once saw in
Dallas. ``One of the guys fell down and the others stopped,''
Stallings said. ``They didn't want to run off and leave him. They
stopped and they waited until he got up. And dusted him off. And
then all three went running. Of all the big games I've been in, all
the great arenas, when you ask me the contests I really remember, I
remember that Special Olympics, when they started off running and
waited for the one who fell.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of the turbulent political tensions outside the
pavilion, the theme of the evening was the notion of determination
and overcoming obstacles. The embodiment of such determination was
Eunice Shriver, who organized the first Special Olympics on July
28, 1968, one month after her brother Robert was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   Shriver, whose own child was mentally retarded, told the
athletes and parents at Soldier's Field that day that they would no
longer accept having experts discard children in warehouses and
institutions. She told the audience that children with mental
retardation can be exceptional athletes, that through sports they
can realize their potential for growth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 a thousand athletes participated in the inaugural event;
30 years later more than a million athletes round the world
participate.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing that happened Thursday night will change the rapid flow
of presidential history. The celebration ended shortly after 11
p.m. The president, the first lady and their guests walked out of
the pavilion, into the cold night air and the reality of the hour:
The impeachment process was relentlessly moving forward; the
military was maintaining its assault on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   On a night like this, at a time when mistrust, suspicion and
anger abound, one might be tempted to wonder if White House guests
were simply so many pieces on a chessboard. But for those who have
been involved in the Special Olympics, who have spoken with parents
and heard stories of how athletic competition had enriched lives,
cynicism gave way to higher ideals.
</P>
<P>
   The movement survived seven presidential administrations because
it embodies ideals we desperately cherish, even when they are
temporarily blurred from view, even when they seem just beyond our
reach: courage, faith and a profound respect for the honest effort.

   ATLANTA: we want.''
</P>
<P>
   The black difference
</P>
<P>
   One thing that Scarlett was not was black. And African-American
culture in Atlanta doesn't seem to suffer as badly under the
North-is-better myth that haunts white artists. ``Even during
segregation, Atlanta was known as a black oasis,'' says Michael
Lomax, former chairman of the Fulton County Commission and founder
of Atlanta's National Black Arts Festival. ``With the opening up of
the city in the '70s, the resources that came from black political
power were made available to the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is one of the capitals of the hip-hop recording
industry. Atlanta is the home of 20-year-old Jomandi Productions,
which has a sheaf of Washington Post rave reviews from its many
visits to D.C. Atlanta is also where _ in the racially balanced
Alliance repertoire of Kenny Leon _ the whole notion of ``black''
and ``white'' culture as separate monoliths is being challenged,
without undermining the integrity of either tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Poetic justice, then, that CNN, the network that Atlanta
Journal-Constitution TV critic Phil Kloer says has been
tremendously influential in spreading an image of Atlanta as
sophisticated _ at least in the technological sense _ recently
produced a national feature on Leon.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, national media may even pay more attention to local
black culture than white, apparently finding it more socially
relevant. Southern black folk art does not lack for Northern
praise. The New York Times recently ran rave reviews of Ballethnic
Dance Company and Soweto Street Beat, two Atlanta-based
African-American dance troupes, and it would be hard to find small
local white groups so anointed.
</P>
<P>
   Thicker hides, more pride
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs that outside opinion is losing its distorted
magic as well as its sting. Atlanta arts leaders have developed
more confidence, thicker hides. High Museum director Ned Rifkin
doesn't sound rattled about Wolfe's mean depiction of ``Jonathan
Myrer,'' his alter ego in the book, who praises a piece of gay
pornography in the silliest kind of academic artsbabble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolfe's always had a jaded and simplistic eye for contemporary
art _ that's what he's attacking, not Atlanta,'' says Rifkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in Atlanta we do have Charlie Crokers (the art-hating Wolfe
hero who says Myrer's speech is hogwash) then, great: I love the
opportunity to win them over,'' Rifkin continues. ``Atlanta is an
important point on the American cultural compass, and attracting
criticism is the clearest signal that we're a player. Our ambitions
are mocked because they are envied.''
</P>
<P>
   Lomax: ``Atlanta should not try to imitate some city that it
isn't; if you've got lemons, make lemonade.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Shelton Stanfill, president of the Woodruff
Arts Center(Ga.), says that the desire for outside praise is
universal _ ``Even New Yorkers want a rave in `Le Monde' '' _ and
out-of-town reviews encourage locals to see their artists in a
fresh light and contribute more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta is so young, culturally speaking _ like Denver and Los
Angeles and even Washington, it built its first major arts facility
in the 1960s or '70s,'' Stanfill observes. ``We're not like older
industrial cities where waves of immigrants brought accomplished
artists with them. No one's saying Atlanta is a New York or Chicago
or San Francisco. But I'll debate anybody that it's the
Southeastern cultural center and not Miami or New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   Lomax, now president of Dillard University in New Orleans,
echoes the idea that cities' cultural reputations take centuries,
not decades, to develop and may continue long after the reality has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Atlanta doesn't have the cultural cachet of New Orleans,
it's because of long traditions in literature and music and
individual arts patronage on the Old World model. . . . The truth
is that New Orleans today is rather poor, and in the end it's
Atlanta's money that will win.'' Lomax laughs. ``Just look at the
incredible guest artists that Emory can bring in.'' (Playwright
Wole Soyinka and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, both Nobel laureates from
Africa, recently debated on the campus.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta's reputation has changed enough,'' Lomax adds, ``so
that there shouldn't be any inferiority complex just because Tom
Wolfe sees a few yahoos there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rightful places
</P>
<P>
   The recognition of Atlanta, and the South generally, is bound to
grow because of a quiet recent shift, what might be called the
Dixie-ization of arts leadership. In the words of the Coca-Cola
Foundation's Adrian King: ``Many Southerners are taking their
rightful places, sprinkled into the national arts structures.''
Examples include William Ivey and William Ferris, confirmed this
year as chairmen of the National Endowment for the Arts and the
National Endowment for the Humanities, respectively. Robert Ivy,
formerly based in Mississippi, is already showing his knowledge of
the South as editor of Architectural Record. The Alabama
Shakespeare Festival _ which used to be a punch line to Northern
ears _ sent its artistic director, Kent Thompson, to be the
chairman of a Theatre Communications Group board in New York that
also includes Leon and Chris Coleman of Actor's Ex-
</P>
<P>
   press.
</P>
<P>
   And at Americans for the Arts, the Washington-based advocacy
group, ``Atlanta is the among the two or three most important
cities in terms of the number of delegates, their energy and
ideas,'' says president Robert Lynch, citing King and Stanfill;
Harriet Sanford, director of the Fulton County Arts Council; Fulton
County Commissioner Michael Hightower; and Coca-Cola Foundation
presiden Donald Greene.
</P>
<P>
   The group will have its annual convention in Atlanta in June,
partly, Sanford says, ``because people are so intrigued by the
city. Many haven't seen enough of it to understand it, but they
want to figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bravura spirit, secret heart
</P>
<P>
   If Atlanta's strongest suit is bravura spirit, Sanford warns
against its excess.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of boosterism when we were bidding for the
Olympics _ Atlanta may have have oversold itself, culturally,''
says the arts leader. ``We lost the Arts Festival of Atlanta partly
because it tried to make that costly jump to the national stage.
We're not teenagers anymore culturally, but we're not established
senior citizens either. We must be wary of getting too confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Bynum, the Atlanta actress and teacher who can assume
many accents, has enjoyed Wolfe's work since the 1960s, but ``I
don't expect to learn anymore about the real Atlanta from (``A Man
in Full'') than I learned about ancient Egypt from that Disney
show. Wolfe writes for what the market wants to read and Atlanta
understands that _ this is one big fat market town!''
</P>
<P>
   The key, Bynum says, is for Southerners to hold fast to their
appreciation of their culture without turning to a so-called higher
authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South is a subtle, secret, layered thing, and you approach
it through, say, a Eudora Welty book or a Tennessee Williams play
or an independent film like `Sling Blade.' That's how you get to
the true, deep, beating heart of the South.''

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL DECEMBER 20
 &HT;    Despite its growing national prestige, the city is still seen by
some bicoastal elites as a gangly, unrefined stepchild
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Have you noticed that at art shows, Atlantans guzzle
champagne and ``cackle, shout, bawl and shriek'' at each other?
That they ignore the art because they secretly hate it? A lot of
American readers may think it's true. Says so in this book by the
famous Tom Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   Have you noticed that gangs of anti-Semitic rubes roam the
streets? No, of course not, and playwright Alfred Uhry claims that
in ``Parade'' _ his current Broadway musical about Leo Frank, a
Brooklyn-bred Jew lynched by a Marietta(Ga.) mob _ he makes it
clear that the Frank haters were themselves victims, not rednecks,
and the episode was a shocking aberration even for 1915. But will
everyone in the Lincoln Center audience hear that message?
</P>
<P>
   Have you noticed that Atlanta audiences are pushovers, ready to
stand up and cheer for just about anything that isn't terrible?
Well, it could appear that the Disney Co. thinks so. After its
musical world premiere, ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida,''
set an Alliance Theatre record with 47,000 tickets, Disney execs
felt the show was still so un-Broadway-worthy that they fired five
of the show's creative chiefs and brought in a new director from
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: The bottom line about these three events is
that they enhance Atlanta's national presence and prestige. Even
Wolfe's ``A Man in Full,'' for all its devilish debunkery of the
city, ``is the ultimate compliment to Atlanta,'' in the words of
actor-director Tom Key. The three events are just a few instances
where Atlanta stepped out on the stage of America's arts and
letters in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as Wolfe's book shows, America sometimes recognizes
Atlanta down its nose, so to speak, with a touch of condescension.
In subtle ways Atlanta's taste still is second-guessed by the
bicoastal elite: producers, writers, editors, publishers who live
in New York and Los Angeles, whose only direct experience with the
city is, say, an annoying flight connection at Hartsfield
International Airport(Ga.). As recently as 1996, New York Times
critic at large Paul Goldberger dismissed Atlanta as a cultural
center, citing not one example of an arts event that he had
witnessed.Variety, which reviews regional theater from Detroit to
Sacramento, ignored 1990s Alliance premieres of three plays
(``Flyin' West,'' ``Blues for an Alabama Sky,'' ``The Last Night of
Ballyhoo''), which in spite of that promotional disadvantage went
on to join the ranks of the most-produced works in America. The
weekly's theater editor, Charles Isherwood, says the oversight was
due to his inability to find a local stringer to review the shows,
not regional bias. But it adds to the impression that national
taste-makers are not abreast of Atlanta's swift change.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Oliverio, Woodruff Arts Center's vice president for
communications, says her primary task is to meet with national
journalists, arts leaders and travel industry executives and
``re-brand Atlanta as a cultural destination'' _ exactly the kind
of corporate jargon such journalists are inclined to ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta's reputation is moving in the right direction,''
Oliverio says, ``but reaction around the country is mixed. Business
travelers want Atlanta to be a cultural center where they can bring
a spouse and stay extra nights, but they're not getting the message
that it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe's satirical scene of good-old-boy businessmen at the High
Museum of Art _ comparing the building to an insecticide refinery,
mocking an overrated gay artist _ could be adapted to any city with
some truth, but it perpetuates the stigma of Atlanta as the
Johnny-come-lately of cultural capitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cultural target is more like it,'' says Dana White, professor
of urban studies at Emory University(Ga.). ``Atlanta can be a
convenient prop for Northerners trying to hold onto a sense of
superiority. When I go home to Brooklyn, someone will ask me if
they still go barefoot and chew tobacco down there.''
</P>
<P>
   A gallery of stereotypes
</P>
<P>
   That's an extreme example, of course, a blurring of Atlanta's
image with hoary rural cliches. From ``Tobacco Road'' to ``In the
Heat of the Night'' to ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,''
America loves to project its lustier, steamier self onto Georgia
settings (``Heat'' producer-star Carroll O'Connor once asked the
Alabama-born Key to make his accent ``more Southern'' for a guest
shot on the TV show). The old Georgia images are so vivid that they
may overshadow the subtler cultural reality of the state's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta has always been a special case in the South,'' says
Adrian King, head of arts and education programs for the Coca-Cola
Foundation and a former staffer for the Old South at odds the Arts.
``When I was growing up in the cornfields of eastern North
Carolina, and even in Charlotte, Atlanta was the cultural beacon.''
</P>
<P>
   A more common cliche of Atlanta today might be called the
Eternally Designing Woman, after the late 1980s-early '90s TV show
in which Delta Burke played the catty belle descended from Scarlett
O'Hara. The image drags on, aerobically toned, in the Buckhead
women of Wolfe's novel: genteel but shallow, sartorially smart but
culturally semiliterate. In ``Hysteria,'' WB's hip new cartoon show
about history, the dumbest character, Miss Information, is a perky
blond tour guide with _ you guessed it _ a Southern-fried drawl.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Bergstrom is struggling to kill the ``dumb'' reputation as
director of cultural tourism for the Atlanta Convention and
Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country harbors _ loves to harbor _ the Southern
stereotype, and I know because I'm a Southern girl,'' Bergstrom
declares. ``We cling to these stereotypes ourselves. Look at
Southern Living (magazine), where you see such a yearning for the
old agrarian life. Atlanta is where that dream bumps up against the
new, sophisticated reality. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``And how ironic,'' Bergstrom adds, ``that Alfred Uhry's piece
(which opened Thursday) is about a Yankee who becomes the scapegoat
for bringing in the factories, pulling Southerners off the farm. We
Atlantans can never quite figure out which way of life we want.''

 &HT;    `Gods' willing, director to stay in best picture heaven
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You won't see George of the Jungle without his loincloth in
``Gods and Monsters,'' though that was the original plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I've never talked about this,'' writer-director Bill
Condon says carefully, pausing during a recent Atlanta interview.
He's talking about a climactic moment in the movie between
``George'' actor Brendan Fraser, who plays a Hollywood yard boy,
and Ian McKellen as gay film director James Whale.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of filming, Fraser was making his mark at the
cineplex with his vine-swinging role in Disney's kid comedy. It's a
far cry from ``Gods,'' which opened Friday, Condon's complex,
sorrowful meditation about the final days in the life of
``Frankenstein'' director Whale, found drowned in his pool in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people who manage Brendan got a little nervous
about the nudity,'' Condon says. So the actor chose not to go
full-frontal. ``It's painful to say, but I think he was right,''
the director admits. ``It's such an important moment in the movie,
and there's no way you wouldn't be distracted, looking at this
movie star's genitals.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without that flash of Fraser, ``Gods and Monsters'' was
named best picture of 1998 a few weeks ago by the National Board of
Review, beating Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   That's quite a feat for somebody who says, ``I was in movie jail
for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Condon means cable flicks, such as a 1991 one starring Gregory
Hines, called ``White Lie,'' shot in Atlanta. Condon's films on the
big screen, ``Sister, Sister'' and ``Candyman: Farewell to the
Flesh,'' both bombed.
</P>
<P>
   The last title, though, led to ``Gods and Monsters.'' While
shooting the ``Candyman'' sequel, Condon got to know horror-meister
Clive Barker, who became executive producer for ``Gods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Clive's first services was to let me meet with Ian in
(Barker's) big estate in Beverly Hills, and not my little house in
Silverlake (a hip, transitional neighborhood in Los Angeles),''
Condon says. And his connections helped in funding the movie's $3
million budget.
</P>
<P>
   After all, ``Gods'' is a hard movie to pitch to backers. ``You
start by saying the word `gay,' '' Condon says with a sardonic
laugh. ``You see people's eyes glaze over. Then you mention
`suicide,' and they go, `Ooh, yeah, we really want to make that our
big summer movie next year.''
</P>
<P>
   McKellen, named best actor by the National Board of Review and
the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, shared a common interest
in the script with Condon and Barker: Like the late Whale, all
three are openly gay men working in Hollywood.

<P>
   Still, McKellen was worried about playing a man some 10 years
his senior, having already played a 77-year-old Nazi in ``Apt
Pupil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't help wondering which character middle America would
find more repellent: the unrepentant Nazi or the homosexual film
director,'' Condon says, sardonic once more. ``He can play such a
convincing villain, but he's the sweetest guy in reality.''

 &HT;    Gifts that catch us unawares
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I wasn't all that poor at age 6 when Christmas didn't
come to Holley, Fla. I was staying with Aunt Liza and Uncle Will
Stevens, some of my blood father's relatives or friends. (My mother
and I had not succeeded in marrying my wonderful stepfather, Wesley
R. Sibley, by that time.) Aunt Liza and Uncle Will, always known to
me as ``folks to stay with,'' lived in a battered, paintless old
house in the country with a log cabin as its detached kitchen. They
had a garden, and that meant vegetables, sugar cane and a big
kettle where they made cane syrup. They had a hog or two and meat
in the smokehouse and a cow that provided milk and butter.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't think they knew about Christmas, although at some
point that winter, a crate of oranges and apples arrived from
Pensacola.
</P>
<P>
   Their boys and I were home from school so we knew it was a time
of holidays. And then one day a box arrived for me. My mother,
working in a store in Pensacola, had sent me two dresses, a little
pocketbook with two dimes in it and a celluloid doll! I was
overjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   The dresses she had made. I recognized her touch _ embroidery on
the collars. And she had pinned to one a little enameled butterfly
pin. For the days left of the school vacation, I walked about
importantly carrying my pocketbook with real money in it _ two
dimes. I played with my doll, and I even wore one of my new
dresses, although Aunt Liza didn't like for me to ``make washing.''
It was no sin, she pointed out, to ``go dirty'' between washdays.
</P>
<P>
   The day I went back to school I walked along with my friends,
Aggie and Jewel, from down the road, and I said, ``I think we have
had us a Christmas.'' They weren't sure either.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe my experience is that you catch up on Christmas afterward
if you are lucky.
</P>
<P>
   They let me out of the hospital in time to take the new baby, my
firstborn son, home for Christmas. War was threatening in Europe.
The Depression still had a grasp on our country. Some people were
worried about the state of the world. We weren't. We were young and
we had a new baby _ and could there be anything more magical at
Christmastime?
</P>
<P>
   I thought that then, pulling a rocking chair close to the
Christmas tree so the baby could see the lights. And I still think
so. There have been what my country neighbors called ``a power of
young'uns'' since that Christmas _ children, grandchildren and now
great-grandchildren. And in every case they have brought meaning
and wonderment to the year's most sacred day.
</P>
<P>
   You worry a lot about money for Christmas when you have
children. Will there be enough for a tricycle? A go-to-sleep doll?
A real teddy bear?
</P>
<P>
   You sit up late aching a little over their letters to Santa
Claus. And then because it is part of the lore, you throw the
scrubby little notes in the fireplace so the wind can take their
messages in ashes to the North Pole. They might not remember what
they asked for, but you will and instead of the tricycle for one it
was three little red-painted rocking chairs I bought on Whitehall
Street and took home on the bus on Christmas Eve. I remember the
Christmas cheer _ and charity _ of those bus passengers who stood
in the aisle and fended off death by being stabbed in the belly by
a pointed wooden rocker. They called after me as I stumbled up to
the curb with my purchases, ``Merry Christmas _ and hug those
babies for us!''
</P>
<P>
   The teddy bear that Christmas was dressed in a khaki soldier
suit, and a favorite game of the little boys in the neighborhood
was sitting in the crape myrtle tree that shaded the sandbox and
dropping oatmeal boxes of sand on the little girls and their dolls
below. The cry ``Bombs awa-ay!'' almost took precedence over
``Merry Christmas!''
</P>
<P>
   And when you protest and are about to give in to thoughts on the
sadness and turmoil of the world, you have to load the youngest in
a stroller and walk the others to the school to see the Christmas
program.
</P>
<P>
   Is that your little boy in the old dining room curtain
portraying a wise man? And suddenly you see your little girl
dressed in a borrowed blue robe portraying Mary, the mother of
Jesus! She sings in a singularly sweet treble, ``De little Lord
Jesus, no crib for he bed!''
</P>
<P>
   The custom of sharing your Christmas dinner with somebody
needier than yourself was a smaller gesture in those days. You
simply brought the old street newspaper peddler or the retired
snake charmer home with you and put another plate on the table.
</P>
<P>
   I asked the children recently if they had learned anything from
our street friends. One mentioned sharing, one mentioned continuing
and undiluted gratitude. But one remembered the safecracker's
mother who told them a line from Emerson: ``To the wise, life is a
festival.''

 &HT;    New two-pill-a-day AIDS drug is approved by FDA
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A new AIDS drug approved Friday by the Food and Drug
Administration is a welcome option for people with the AIDS virus
who have exhausted other treatment options.
</P>
<P>
   But the drug, Ziagen, has a serious side effect that has caused
at least one death and possibly a second.
</P>
<P>
   Ziagen, a twice-daily tablet, was developed by the
pharmaceutical company GlaxoWellcome of Research Triangle Park,
N.C. Its wholesale price is $3,540 per year.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is a needed addition to the steadily but slowly growing
arsenal of AIDS drugs, which now numbers 14. HIV swiftly develops
resistance to drugs, forcing many people to change medications
frequently. Also, AIDS drugs tend to have debilitating side effects
comparable to those associated with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Ziagen has convenience going for it _ AIDS drug regimens
involving dozens of pills are common. But it can cause a rare but
potentially fatal allergic reaction. From 3 percent to 5 percent of
those taking Ziagen experience fever, skin rashes, nausea and
diarrhea. Those who experience it must immediately stop taking the
drug and cannot resume it.
</P>
<P>
   Because many of the initial symptoms of the reaction are shared
by other AIDS drugs as well as the flu, people on Ziagen and their
physicians may have a tough time determining that Ziagen is the
culprit, doctors warn. Physicians also say they need more
information on Ziagen's effectiveness before they begin widescale
prescription. The FDA granted Ziagen accelerated approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the blessing of a new drug: It gives us new options,''
said Dr. Jeffrey Lennox, who heads Grady Memorial Hospital's(Ga.)
infectious diseases program. ``But the curse of a new drug is that
we're trying to get these things out as fast as possible, and we're
not always sure how to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ziagen belongs to a class of drugs called nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors. Glaxo-Wellcome makes two other drugs in
this class, including AZT, the oldest AIDS drug, approved in 1987.

 &HT;    Balsam Mountain Inn elevates body and spirit
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALSAM, N.C. _ Nestled on 26 acres and surrounded by peaks
rising higher than 6,000 feet, the Balsam Mountain Inn is a place
of comfort and joy throughout the year. But at Christmastime, a
special cheer enfolds the 42,000-square-foot inn, less than a mile
from the Blue Ridge Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   Built 1905-1908, it's the sort of place where magic happens _
like the shooting star I witnessed from the front porch one frosty
autumn eve.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks sought warmth near the crackling back-to-back
fireplaces in the sprawling yet cozy lobby. Some were enticed by
the cushioned wicker furniture to sit a spell with a magazine.
Others played Scrabble or worked on a giant jigsaw puzzle. Later
that evening there would be traditional mountain music performed in
the lobby by Anne and John Lough on guitar and dulcimer.
</P>
<P>
   But until then, I could not resist bundling against the chill,
stirring up a steaming cup of hot chocolate and planting myself in
one of the big green-painted oak rockers on the 100-foot-long,
two-tiered porch. Moravian star lights dangling from the ceiling
cast a soft glow.
</P>
<P>
   I sat alone, silently exhaling frosty breath into the crisp
night air and taking in the fragrance of evergreens and the aroma
of wood smoke curling over the inn. As I gazed out on the Great
Balsam Mountains to the east and the clear, inky sky above, I saw a
lone star make a quick but graceful exit. Its fire was gone in the
blink of an eye, but the enchantment of the moment lingered.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the holidays are here, energetic innkeeper Merrily
Teasley _ who hops around the premises, cell phone in hand, making
sure her guests are comfortable _ is working even more magic on the
grand old inn.
</P>
<P>
   She and her staff decorate every nook and cranny with nine
Christmas trees bedecked with handmade ornaments, red-ribboned
evergreen wreaths and garlands, bright red poinsettias, red candles
in brass candlesticks, stockings hung on the hearth, carved wooden
Santas and a whimsical clay creche with jolly shepherds and wise
men. The red walls of the well-stocked library are the perfect
backdrop for Teasley's miniature Christmas village and tiny balsam
trees atop the bookcases.
</P>
<P>
   If perchance it's a white Christmas, Teasley will haul out inner
tubes for some impromptu sledding down the hill in front of the
inn. (The offer stands all winter, and Teasley even maintains a
list of guests who want to be contacted when snow's in the
forecast.)
</P>
<P>
   Teasley's daughter, Noell, the inn's chef, is busing planning
holiday menus for Christmas and New Year's. The inn's dining room
features such creative dishes as apple-smoked pork with caramelized
leek sauce and apple stuffing and pecan-encrusted catfish with red
pepper sauce. Breakfasts are bountiful repasts featuring herbed
scrambled eggs and cheese grits or stuffed French toast, served
with bacon, fruit and fresh-baked breads and muffins.
</P>
<P>
   The main dining room is darkly romantic at night with flickering
candles. The sun room addition, with a purple, green and white tile
floor designed by Teasley to suggest a mountainscape and accented
with purple and green floral fabrics, is filled with light in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The night of the shooting star, Ethan and Robbie Shapiro of
Raleigh were sipping wine by the fireplace before dinner, chatting
with other guests and looking so at home you'd find it hard to
believe they checked in only a couple of hours before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people you meet are friendly here,'' says Robbie Shapiro.
``You can just sit down and strike up a conversation. That just
doesn't happen when you stay at Holiday Inn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shapiros, although first-time visitors, are typical of the
inn's guests, many of whom make frequent returns in search of
relaxation and good company. In fact, so many are repeat visitors
that Teasley has instituted a ``Twelfth Night'' promotion. Stay 12
nights, get one free.
</P>
<P>
   Had Teasley not come across the three-story inn while hiking in
the area in 1989, the lodge might not have been given a second
lease on life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sign that said it was closed for the season,''
said Teasley, ``but in fact, it had been condemned. I saw a For
Sale sign and stopped to pick up a brochure.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, she could see its potential despite its dilapidated
state: 125 broken windows, a sagging front porch, a leaky tin roof
and burst pipes. Meticulous restoration began in 1990, and the
buttercream-and white-hued inn reopened in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The inn _ now listed on the National Register of Historic Places
_ was built by Walter Scott Christy and Joseph Key Kenney,
brothers-in-law from Athens. Guests arrived at the old rail depot,
which, at 3,314 feet above sea level, once was at the highest
elevation of any station east of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same furnishings and most of the architectural
details those early guests enjoyed are still in place.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the inn's 50 guest rooms has its own character. Beds are
either white-painted antique iron, wicker or bent-twig made by
local craftspeople. Victorian trim, beaded board walls and heart
yellow pine floors are found throughout, including the 10-foot-wide
hallways (built wide enough to accommodate steamer trunks).
</P>
<P>
   When day is done, the simply decorated bedrooms are havens of
rest: beds are stacked with pale blue and white cloud-like duvets
and plump pillows. Heat comes from radiators Teasley salvaged from
a remodeled Western Carolina University dorm. Old claw foot tubs _
a few with showers _ invite long soaks.
</P>
<P>
   If a holiday vacation is not in the stars, don't worry. Long
after the decorations are boxed for another year, the inn will
continue to extend its welcoming warmth.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there:
</P>
<P>
   Take I-85 north to U.S. 365 and continue as highway changes to
U.S. 441/23, then take U.S. 23/74 toward Waynesville and look for
signs. The turn-off will be on the right hand side of the highway.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rates:
</P>
<P>
   $85-$145 Sundays-Thursdays, $90-$150 weekends and holidays. All
rooms have private baths. Full breakfast included. Dinner with
dessert and a glass of wine runs about $25.
</P>

 &HT;    Livingston's confession no biggie in his district _ men `all
have affairs,' locals say
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   METAIRIE, La ._ There's one thing everyone seems to agree on in
Speaker-elect Bob Livingston's congressional district: All men
cheat on their wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have affairs,'' said Joe Ruffino, who was having coffee
Friday at his ``second home,'' the Morning Call, a legendary coffee
shop once in the French Quarter and now in Metairie.
</P>
<P>
   It came as no surprise here in suburban New Orleans when
Livingston, the fabled ``boy scout'' of the Republican party,
admitted Thursday to extramarital affairs. His confession had
little effect on his constituents' opinions of him. He is a popular
congressman who usually runs unopposed, and, hey, everyone cheats,
right?
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone forgives apparently. A bomb squad rushed to
Livingston's district office in Metairie on Friday to inspect a
suspicious package that turned out to contain a rock and a note
referring to his adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Marcello, who was having coffee with Ruffino, said
Livingston was stupid for admitting the affair. And he drew a
distinction between Livingston and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex is not bad, I'm not against sex, but it's sex in the wrong
places,'' he said. ``Clinton fooled around with an intern in the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the marble counter where Tennessee Williams is
said to have written his steamy play, ``A Streetcar Named Desire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone started having sex on that counter, that would be
wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even at a bridal shop, cynicism ran high when it came to men and
faithfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men have been doing this for centuries, since the beginning of
time,'' said Sue Kandoul, a bridal consultant at Pearl's Place in
Metairie. ``They say Livingston is better than Clinton because he
admitted it, but he's just as bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing between racks of wedding dresses, Alicia Lissard, who
will be a June bride in 1999, said that, sadly, she believes most
men cheat on their wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching television with my fiance when we heard about
Livingston, and I immediately said something derogatory about
men,'' she said. ``He said, `Not all men are like that.' But the
majority of men at one time or another stray on their wives. I hope
my husband won't cheat, but they have that tendency.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this talk of unfaithfulness, marriage is serious
business here. Adultery is a crime in Louisiana, although the law
no longer is enforced, and this was the first state in the nation
to adopt covenant marriages, a much stricter marriage license that
couples can choose when they tie the knot. It makes it more
difficult to get divorced.
</P>
<P>
   If feelings about men were uniform, feelings on impeachment were
more varied. Ruffino was against impeachment, as were Kandoul and
Lissard, but Pearl's Place owner Elaine Schulman thinks Clinton
deserves the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't care about his personal life if he hadn't lied to
me and to the world,'' she said as she pulled out a beaded satin
dress for a customer. ``He should be impeached not for sex, but for
lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people felt the White House put the spotlight on
Livingston's affairs to derail the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is a sociopath and he'll do anything to get out of the
heat,'' said John Distelhorst, who was visiting from Florida but
used to live in Metairie. ``I don't see any correlation between
what Clinton did and what Livingston did. Livingston didn't abuse
his power. He didn't lie under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Iole Messina, a government worker from Metairie, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an underhanded way to forestall the proceedings,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Antoinette Cotter, who works with Messina, said Clinton should
resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the man had any honor whatsoever he'd resign,'' she said.
``It scares me that he thinks he's smarter than the rest of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   But for every person who was for impeachment, there was someone
who was against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Livingston will encourage his party to extend the same
courtesy of forgiveness to Bill Clinton that they are offering
him,'' said Aly Roberts, who was grocery shopping Friday in
Metairie. When Republicans heard Livingston's confession Thursday,
they applauded his honesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have gotten too self-righteous,'' Kandoul said. ``It's
easy to point your finger but you better sweep your own doorstep
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Kandoul said this week's confluence of historic events makes her
feel uneasy, and she blames the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people realize what jeaopardy they're putting
the United States in,'' she said. ``We're bombing Iraq, the
Democrats and Republicans are ready to tear each other's throats
out, and we are impeaching the president. We're leaving the country
wide open for anarchy or terrorism.''

 &HT;    Can't bear to part with your pooch? Then take him along, even to
castles and six-course dinners in France

   Gatsby never had it so great.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old Jack Russell terrier from Atlanta vacationed in
the south of France for a week in October, sleeping in castles,
sampling foie gras in the 13th-century walled city of Domme,
exploring honey-colored stone villages, and sniffing and strolling
through fields and forests in the countryside.
</P>

   Ouaf-ouaf! A dog's life, indeed.

<P>
   His owner, Atlanta real estate agent Natalie Spalding, booked
them on the Dordogne Doggie Walk, offered by Europeds, a tour
operator in Monterey, Calif. Europeds, which has organized walking
and cycling tours in Europe for 17 years, became an industry
pioneer when it inaugurated doggie walks in Dordogne and Provence
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone like myself who runs and can't bear to be parted
from her dog, this is the ideal trip,'' says Spalding, 53.
</P>
<P>
   She and Gatsby were joined by Spalding's friend Kathy Standard
of Sarasota, Fla., and her year-old Jack Russell, named Deacon.
</P>
<P>
   The two women flew to Paris with their four-footed friends in
coach, the dogs curled up in cozy Sherpa pet carriers under the
seat, sleeping off a mild tranquilizer. Once on foreign soil,
Spalding says she exclaimed to her pooch, ``You're here, Gatsby!
You're really in France!''
</P>
<P>
   Then they traveled by train to Les Eyzies-de-Tayac to begin the
six-night tour of the Dordogne River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The tour group was made up of eight people and six canines.
After a get-acquainted session and a short walk, it was time for
dinner at the chateau.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the dogs went into the dining room,'' says Spalding, ``and
with all the dogs lying at our feet, we had a six-course dinner.
The dogs behaved like little angels.'' (Although the dogs were fed
their usual rations, they did get kibbles such as bites of French
bread and cheese as after-meal treats.)
</P>
<P>
   The tour included overnight stays in Les Eyzies-de-Tayac, Vitac
and Montignac-Lascaux, with daily four-to-five-mile treks along
marked walking trails. A van accompanied the walkers, carrying
luggage, picnics and water and providing lifts for the weary.
</P>
<P>
   No one in canine-loving France thought it odd that dogs were
traveling with their owners, Spalding says. The pooches were able
to go almost everywhere the humans did, including restaurants, the
bustling market at Sarlat and the Romanesque abbey church of St.
Cyprien. But the Font-de-Gaume cave, with 15,000-year-old drawings
on its walls, was off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   Spalding says the dogs got along famously. ``They were like a
pack. They formed a bond. One day we were in a restaurant and
another dog came in and they all howled until he left.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, they behaved themselves. Only once did Gatsby
attempt a side trip. ``He took off down a deer trail,'' Spalding
says, ``and he was gone, gone, gone. But we got him back. Let me
tell you, it was a frightening moment.''
</P>
<P>
   And Deacon caused a farmyard flap when he chased a chicken _ and
caught it. The tour guide came to the hapless fowl's rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact that the dogs got along is unusual,
especially for Jack Russells,'' Spalding says. ``All the people got
along because we had a strong common bond: We are all dog lovers.
This trip is custom-made for people like us. Like the woman from
California said, `Where else can you spend 24 hours a day with your
dog?' ''
</P>
<P>
   While Gatsby didn't exactly become bilingual, Spalding says he
knows exactly what to do when she commands, ``Asseyez-vous.''
</P>
<P>
   He sits.
</P>
<P>
   Bon chien! (Good dog!)
</P>

EDITORIAL: THE HOUSE COMES TO ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Saturday, Dec. 19:
</P>
<P>
   No minds were changed, no impulse to substitute censure for
impeachment suddenly seized the Republicans, but at least the
bitterly partisan debate that rang through the House chamber Friday
was relatively dignified. Having backed the country into this grim
corner, the Republicans did their best to cloak their partisan
enmity in constitutional trappings. Some of the speeches, including
Henry Hyde's impassioned defense of the rule of law, were stirring.
But even moments of soaring language could not alter the granite
fact that the misconduct at issue does not warrant the impeachment
and removal of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It was by any measure one of the most mesmerizing days the
nation has witnessed in recent decades. As House members debated
the impeachment of the commander in chief, American forces
continued their aerial bombardment of Iraq. Television coverage
jumped from the House floor to the ghostly night sky over Baghdad.
Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared briefly outside the White House to
call for an end to divisiveness in America. Saddam Hussein showed
up on Iraqi television to tell his countrymen he was alive and
well. Bill Clinton, the man at the vortex, remained largely out of
sight.
</P>
<P>
   The mismatch between Clinton's offenses and the punishment
weighed by the House was never clearer than when the debate
commenced. Here was the House called into session to exercise
perhaps the greatest power vested in it by the Constitution, the
impeachment of a president. Only once before in the nation's
history _ in 1868 _ had such a question reached the House floor.
But as the day unfolded it was obvious that this mighty
constitutional firepower was being directed at conduct that calls
for stern and lasting condemnation, but not by a formal
recommendation for removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat, most eloquently captured
the sentiment shared by many Americans Friday. America's ``soul is
aching, and her spirit is low,'' he told his colleagues.
Reconciliation seems beyond the grasp of the House, which barring
some last-minute miracle will Saturday set Clinton's place in
history. But it need not be beyond the reach of the Senate or the
nation. The wounds inflicted on the country by Clinton and his
vengeful opponents can be healed only if the matter is quickly
brought to an end with the censure of the president.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After three days of the air assault on Iraq, the
Pentagon indicated Friday that it had fired some 300 cruise
missiles at Iraqi targets but had severely damaged or destroyed
only 18 of the 88 sites they hit.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein showed defiance toward the United
States in his first televised address since the attacks began,
calling his attackers ``the agents of Satan.'' U.S. military planes
rained thousands of leaflets on Iraq warning ground troops that if
they mobilized they would face bombing raids from the forces
assembled on aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf and at bases
scattered around the region.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was scheduled to meet Saturday with his
national security advisers to talk about how long the air campaign
would continue, but the Pentagon suggested the bombing would go on
into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, at about 4 a.m. Saturday (8 p.m. Friday Eastern time),
another air raid was reported under way in Baghdad, according to
news services dispatches from the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing Friday afternoon, the military released the first
detailed assessment of the damage inflicted on Iraq in the largest
military strike ever ordered by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to say exactly how many laser-guided cruise
missiles and conventional bombs were hurled against Iraq this week,
Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
more cruise missiles were launched in the first two days of the air
campaign than the 290 or so missiles that were showered on Iraq in
1991. Each of the flying, computer-guided bombs costs about $1
million. Cruise missiles were not the main weapon of the 1991 air
war against Iraq, which relied much more heavily on bombs dropped
from B-52 airplanes. But Pentagon planners are anxious to keep the
risk of casualties to an absolute minimum in this operation, and
cruise missiles do not require human pilots or crews. Cruise
missiles also present a lower risk of civilian casualties in Iraq,
since they are far more accurate than bombs dropped from overhead,
even laser-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, seeming anxious not to offer the sort of inflated
damage assessments that embarrassed the Pentagon during the gulf
war, acknowledged that the results of the U.S. and British air
campaign had been mixed so far.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports from the first two nights of air strikes on Iraq
showed that the Pentagon was able to confirm that only 18 of the 88
targets had been severely damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The targets included military command centers, missile
factories, television and radio transmitters and an oil refinery in
the southern Iraq city of Basra, which the United States said was
being used for oil exports in violation of United Nations economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had some very good success with our strikes, but not
all of them have gone exactly as planned,'' Shelton said at a news
conference in the Pentagon, where he released videotape of
laser-guided bombs slamming into a variety of targets.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials continued to insist that
the goal of its military campaign was not to to destabilize the
Iraqi government or encourage a coup against Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon confirmed reports by the Iraqi government that
U.S. warplanes had dropped tens of thousands of leaflets on Iraqi
troops in the southern part of the country, informing them that
``only those units that support the Baghdad regime'' are being
targeted for attack by U.S. missiles and bombers.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflets, which were printed in Arabic, bore photographs of
the charred hulks of Iraqi tanks destroyed during the 1991 gulf
war. ``Your unit has not been targeted but it is being watched,''
the leaflets said, warning the soldiers not to mobilize.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Radio Free Iraq, the seven-week-old
U.S.-sponsored radio network beamed into Iraq and described by the
Iraqi government as an anti-Saddam propaganda machine, said that it
had expanded its programming to Iraq to four hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Arabic-language radio network insisted that
the programs were straightforward news broadcasts but acknowledged
that they also reported on the activities of Iraqi opposition
groups.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing its bombing reports Friday, the United States said
that it had targeted television and radio transmission towers in
hopes of cutting off communication from the central government in
Baghdad to Iraqi troops and the public, and it was unclear how many
Iraqis may have seen Saddam's defiant television address.
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, the Iraqi leader, dressed in a military uniform
and seated beside an Iraqi flag, with an enormous bouquet of red
flowers on the table in front of him, offered fierce words that
contrasted sharply what U.S. military officials have described as
the feeble response of his military to the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``By God, we will not compromise,'' he thundered in the taped
address, which was broadcast shortly before air-raid sirens sounded
in Baghdad to mark the start of the third night of air strikes.
``We stand against the barbaric way of those that have used our
airspace to launch an aggression against our people. A curse on the
agents of Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked Iraqis to ``continue resistance and attack in the name
of God and may the criminals lose.'' He added, ``We will fear
nothing but God and we will not kneel except to the face of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders at the Pentagon said Friday night they were
closely studying new bombing reports from the third day of air
strikes to determine when they they could halt the air campaign,
which they hope to do this weekend given the imminent start of
Ramadan, the month of religious reflection that begins Saturday and
is the holiest time in the Islamic calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sensitive to the issue of Ramadan and will take that
into account,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said in an
interview Friday night on CNN. ``But there is no fixed end time. We
have to keep some flexibility''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the air strikes would continue until the United
States and Britain determined that the bombing had accomplished
done significant damage to Iraq's ability to make chemical and
biological weapons. ``Once those missions are completed, the
mission will end,'' he said.

LEGAL VICTORY OVER ANTI-ANEMIA DRUG MAY BOOST AMGEN STOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- Stock of biotechnology giant Amgen Inc.
could surge Monday in the wake of a stunning arbitration victory
over rights to a new version of its flagship anti-anemia drug.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen announced after the markets closed Friday that a Chicago
arbitration panel has decided the company based in surburban
Thousand Oaks, in California's Ventura County, will keep all rights
to its yet-to-be-approved version of Epogen, NESP. Shares of the
company gained $2.0625 to hit an all-time high of $88.125.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge win for Amgen,'' said James McCament, editor of
the Medical Technology Stock Letter. ``Assuming the news has not
leaked out to investors this week, the ruling is worth a 10 percent
gain in the stock price.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling cleared a dispute Amgen had with drug maker giant
Johnson &AMP; Johnson. Amgen claimed it had invented the new drug but
Johnson &AMP; Johnson contended its 1985 licensing agreement with Amgen
gave it the right to sell NESP, which can be used once a week
rather than the three-times-a-week dosing currently needed for
Epogen.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1985 agreement, which gave Amgen a badly needed cash
infusion, Johnson &AMP; Johnson obtained the rights to sell Epogen for
all uses in the United States except kidney dialysis, along with
all uses in every overseas market except China and Japan. Sales of
the red-cell booster started in 1989; worldwide 1997 sales of
Epogen amounted to $3.3 billion with about half that for dialysis
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the introduction of NESP will have two effects --
expand the market for the anti-anemia compound and shift market
share away from Johnson &AMP; Johnson to Amgen. ``They have a
ready-made blockbuster,'' said analyst Franklin Berger of J.P.
Morgan Securities, noting that most of the growth for Epogen and
NESP should come in more profitable non-dialysis uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had to inject yourself three times a week, wouldn't you
prefer doing it once a week?'' asked analyst Mairev Chovav of
Salomon Smith Barney, who rates Amgen a ``strong buy.'' ``This
ruling will give Amgen access to markets that they had been
contractually precluded from entering.''
</P>
<P>
   Chovav, who predicted Amgen shares will rise Monday by more than
$3, said Amgen may be able to get NESP to market in the year 2000.
``I'd say it will be available in 2001, to be on the safe side,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   McCament said Johnson &AMP; Johnson's prospects are dim for
overturning the decision, adding, ``Periodically, companies take
these to court, but they win very seldom.''
</P>
<P>
   Amgen announced in October that research showed NESP was safe
and effective for dialysis patients. The drug is currently in
final, or Phase III, human trials for that use, along with early
trials for predialysis patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased with the arbitrators' decision and now
look forward to focusing our efforts on the continued development
of this promising new drug to treat patients suffering from the
debilitating effects of anemia associated with chronic renal
failure, cancer and other diseases,'' Gordon Binder, Amgen's
chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.

   In a Pocketbook Poll, Optimism About '99 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Financial turmoil continues to roil markets from Japan to Russia
to Brazil, corporate earnings are shaky and analysts are decidedly
mixed in assessing how the U.S. economy will play out in 1999. But
most Americans continue to be optimistic about their financial
situation, and many expect no change in the economy next year.
</P>
<P>
   Those were findings of a national survey by Yankelovich Partners
for the Lutheran Brotherhood, a group in Minneapolis that offers
financial products and services to church members. Phone interviews
with 1,047 adults found that more than half _ 52 percent _ saw
their families as being better off next year than in the current
year; the same percentage gave that response in last year's survey
about 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significant, only 20 percent said they expected
their families to be worse off _ about half the 39 percent that
thought so in the survey just three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   People are less optimistic, though, about the overall economy.
Almost a third _ 32 percent _ expect some sort of downturn in 1999;
last year, only about one-fifth expected the economy to worsen in
1998. Twenty-one percent said the economy would improve next year,
and 41 percent said it would stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   The more money, the more concern: Only 16 percent of those
earning more than $50,000 a year predicted an improved economy, vs.
26 percent of those earning $20,000 or less.
</P>

   A Time for Giving &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before getting to 1999, more than six of every 10 Americans plan
to make charitable contributions this holiday season, according to
a survey commissioned by Intuit, which makes the Turbotax
tax-preparation software.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey of 1,011 American adults last month, Bruskin
Goldring Research found that of those contributing, nearly 60
percent said they would give the same amount as last holiday season
and 21 percent said they would give more. Only 13 percent planned
to give less than they did last year.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of donors _ 57 percent _ said they would direct
their giving to help the poor and homeless. Asked why they give to
charity during the holidays, 70 percent of the donors agreed that
``it's the right thing to do.'' Just 6 percent mentioned tax
purposes as a reason.

BUSIEST HOLIDAY SHOPPING WEEKEND IS HERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Today marks the start of what is traditionally
the busiest weekend of the holiday shopping season, when
procrastinating consumers realize that time is running out and
descend on local malls in mind-boggling numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds are expected to be particularly big this weekend,
given that this holiday season is expected to be one of the best in
recent years for merchants. And given recent trends, shopping
centers likely will be madhouses today.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last three years, the Saturday before Christmas was
the top shopping day for the holiday season,'' said Marjorie
Fowler, a spokeswoman for Houston-based check authorization service
TeleCheck.
</P>
<P>
   Or as retail analyst Richard Giss puts it: ``(Today) I would
expect to just be huge. Pity the poor people like myself who waited
till the very end.''
</P>
<P>
   With holiday sales at the Burbank Media City Center mall in
Burbank, Calif., already up 5 percent to 7 percent over last year,
general manager Daniel Millman expects things to be especially
hectic this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be very busy, with lots of customer
traffic,'' Millman said. ``And I would expect we'll ring up some
very good sales this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep things moving smoothly, the mall has beefed up traffic
direction along exterior roadways and in its parking garages, and
added more custodial staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``And certainly the merchants have staffed up with seasonal
sales help,'' Millman said.
</P>
<P>
   Giss, a partner with the trade retail services group at the
accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche LLP, said the season has
maintained its muscle after getting off to a strong start the day
after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the anecdotal evidence he's received, Giss said holiday
sales among Los Angeles retailers should be 4.5 percent to 5
percent higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sales) continue to be very, very good, and we continue to
kind of get positive reports that sales are strong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers will extend their hours this weekend, especially
the large retailers like Macy's and Robinsons-May. Among them is
Dutton's Books in suburban Valley Village in Los Angeles' San
Fernando Valley, which owner Dave Dutton said has seen an 8 percent
to 10 percent sales increase compared with last year's holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
   He suspects this is partly due to the closure earlier this year
of a Super Crown bookstore up the street on Ventura and Laurel
Canyon boulevards.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton said he has added hours to some of his part-timers'
schedules to carry the store through the weekend. He also expects
Christmas Eve to be just as busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, in our business the season builds to a climax at
the end, we build toward our crescendo toward Christmas Eve,''
Dutton said. ``We seem to be a destination for a lot of last-minute
shoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend will likely be busy, but it won't be the end of the
frenzy. Last year, three of the top-five busiest days were within
five days of Christmas Day, Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives you a sense that not only is it the big Saturday,
but a number of those days in the last week, that are crucial
shopping days,'' she said.

&HT;        FOX DECIDES TO IMPEACH, SAYS HE WASN'T LOBBIED
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;  &QC;  WASHINGTON, Dec. 18 -- Outgoing Congressman Jon Fox announced
Friday his last vote in Congress will be to impeach President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery County Republican said he believes the president
perjured himself and broke the law -- meriting impeachment by the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the way I expected it to end when I began this
Congress with a popular re-elected president,'' Fox told reporters
as the impeachment debate forged ahead in the background. ``The
last thing I thought I would have to do is vote on impeachment. I
never thought I'd do that in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he hadn't finalized his decision until the eve of the
vote. He was among the last members of Congress to make up his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me this has been a painful solemn and difficult
assignment,'' Fox said. ``The President has signed my legislation
into law and has invited me to participate in the final adoption of
the Wye Peace Accords.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he accompanied Clinton on his recent trip to Israel, Fox
said he and the president did not discuss how Fox would vote on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we talked about in Israel was Israel -- and Iraq,'' Fox
said. ``I wasn't lobbied by either side, not the White House and
not by congressional leaders.'' Fox said he read the records of
Clinton's grand jury testimony, talked with colleagues from both
political parties and consulted the Federalist Papers before
reaching a decision. His professional work in the legal system also
influenced his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't swayed by one thing in particular. It was an
amalgamation of everything,'' Fox said. ``As a former Montgomery
County assistant district attorney, I cannot imagine a system of
justice where those who bear witness and swear to an oath can
select when they tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Responses from constituents who contacted Fox's office indicated
their feelings were split on whether Clinton should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Fox realized his vote may not be popular with some constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a popularity contest,'' Fox said. ``People elect
us to enact the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's seat will be taken by Democrat Joe Hoeffel next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such an important vote,'' Fox said. ``Many people in
Congress will only be remembered by how they vote on this.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Will President Clinton's constitutional travails
derail the stock market's freight train in the weeks ahead?
</P>
<P>
   It is more than a passing question, given that America's most
recent experience with the presidential impeachment process
coincided with a blistering bear market in stocks. In 1974, the
year Richard M. Nixon resigned, the Dow Jones industrial average
lost 28 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, market strategists say. Stocks are unlikely to
plunge this time around, whatever the outcome of the impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   For the markets, ``impeachment is a wholly non-event,'' said
James Paulsen, chief investment officer of Norwest Investment
Management in Minneapolis. Even if Clinton were ultimately to leave
office, the markets know that Vice President Al Gore would be a
virtual clone on policy. So the uncertainty that the market loves
to hate is not an issue today.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the dark moods of the market and the economy at the
time of Nixon's departure are missing now. In 1974, the nation
faced rising interest rates and inflation, surging oil prices and a
decline in the money supply. Today's situation is the opposite on
every score.
</P>
<P>
   A better comparison might be to the economy and markets during
the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson in 1868, says Richard
Sylla, a professor of financial history at New York University's
Stern School of Business. The economy was strong, thanks to
efficiencies created by the railroad boom. Interest rates were
falling, wages were rising and deflation was everywhere _ trends
just like today's.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's woes began in earnest in late December 1867, but
radical Republicans were unable to muster an impeachment vote in
the House then. On their next try, on Feb. 24, 1868, they
succeeded, by a vote of 126-47. Johnson's trial began in the Senate
on March 13; it ended in late May, when he retained the presidency
by a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market watched it all with equanimity. From the
beginning of January 1868 until the beginning of June, stocks rose
almost 14 percent. They ended the year up 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not that constitutional crises are good for stocks. They aren't.
But what is bad about them is something of an intangible, Paulsen
argued. It is the lost opportunity to govern _ these days, for
example, to tackle the question of what to do with a federal budget
surplus of almost $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't take a long trial in the Senate to sap the White
House of initiative, said Charles A. Gabriel Jr., senior Washington
analyst for Prudential Securities in Arlington, Va. Still, he said,
the risks are ``hardly on the scale that should impact investors'
collective psyche on a sustained basis.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is unable to shape the debate, prospects for certain
industries may brighten, Gabriel said. For example, shares of
tobacco companies and health maintenance organizations, two
industries on Clinton's hit list, could benefit if he is
distracted. Retailers and fast-food concerns could be helped if
Clinton's plan to raise the minimum wage is undone by scandal.
</P>
<P>
   It's proof again that in Wall Street's eyes, there's a silver
lining in even the most ominous cloud. &QL;

SENATORS, RELUCTANTLY, PREPARE FOR NEXT STEP IN IMPEACHMENT
PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the impeachment process all but certain to move to the next
phase, the Senate is reluctantly preparing to take up the task of
serving as President Clinton's jury, hoping it can rise above the
bare-knuckles partisanship of the House, according to Northwest
senators.
</P>
<P>
   They worry, however, that a lengthy impeachment trial will
submerge national issues like reforming Social Security as well as
regional matters from salmon to the Hanford Reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every issue will be colored by impeachment process until it is
over,'' Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., a member of the Senate leadership,
said at a Portland conference this week that the impeachment train
rolling out of the House caught the Senate somewhat by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most Americans, we hoped we'd never have to deal with
it,'' said Gorton, who advises Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott on
legal matters. ``I don't really have any idea of how it will be
handled.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same conference, Oregon's freshman GOP Sen. Gordon Smith
reflected on a possible impeachment trial, saying: ``I wasn't
elected to do this. I take no pleasure in doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton predicted that impeachment will likely be ``greatly
consuming of time'' at a time when Congress has a narrow window of
opportunity to enact needed, long-term reform of the Social
Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, too, warned that a trial of Clinton will put all other
business on the back burner. ``Senate rules do allow us to proceed
on legislative business, but it would be extremely difficult for
anybody to bring up another issue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Murray was disturbed at the raw anger of Friday's House debate
and the rigid rules governing what could be considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this whole thing has been handled with a lot of
partisanship and rancor, and has created a tremendous divisiveness
in the country,'' Murray added. ``I hope the Senate can take this
up in a fair and just manner, bring reason back to the process and
do it quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Often dubbed the world's greatest deliberative body, the Senate
was crafted by America's founders to withstand passions of the
moment. Its members serve six-year terms, compared to two years in
the House. Senators represent entire states, meaning multiple
constituencies and diverse viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, said Smith, the Senate is a more collegial place,
and likely willing to ponder options _ like censuring and fining
the president _ that GOP leaders blocked the House from
considering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate's comity is genuine,'' Smith said. ``Elbows are
sharper in the House. The issue is much closer over here.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, censure has been proposed by such Republican
elder statesmen as former President Gerald Ford and former Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should exclude that,'' Smith said. ``It
should be on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Murray agreed. ``A number of national leaders,
respected on both sides of the aisle, have made sound proposals. We
should consider them.''
</P>
<P>
   No rule requires that the Senate carry an impeachment trial
through to a verdict. The trial can be adjourned at any time. The
Senate could substitute a censure resolution and send it back to
the House for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has seemed to shut the door on a quick compromise, telling
reporters earlier this week that the Senate would go ahead with a
trial. Some on both sides of the aisle speculate that Lott may draw
out the process in hopes of swinging public opinion and pressuring
Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton is keeping his opinion on the Dole proposal to himself,
for the time being. ``Any idea from outside the Senate or House
will be given the weight that the idea deserves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans may have a self-interest incentive to take the path
recommended by Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment ``makes no political sense,'' said Smith. If Clinton
is convicted or resigns, added the conservative Oregon senator,
``we would simply be giving Al Gore a two-year start on the 2000
election.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is not known for moving quickly, however. ``Almost
any member can stop anything at any time,'' Gorton noted.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, although Republicans hold only a narrow majority,
leaders were able to dictate rules that precluded a censure vote
and forced members to vote up or down on four articles of
impeachment. A simple majority was required for passage.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Senate will work to adopt rules for the
impeachment trial that ``will meet the approval of members of both
parties,'' Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   A two-thirds vote in the Senate would be needed to convict
Clinton and remove him from office. Republicans will hold a 55-45
advantage when the 106th Congress convenes in January. The majority
caucus includes four moderate-to-liberal GOP senators from New
England states where Clinton's public support runs strongest.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is now feeling its way down a path not traveled since
1868. It has been 130 years since the Senate held its first and
only impeachment trial, in which President Andrew Johnson was
acquitted by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that when senators met two or three weeks ago
to elect our leaders, this was not even a subject that we
discussed,'' Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal year, the Senate would officially convene Jan. 6,
then recess immediately until the president's State-of-the-Union
address on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton predicted, however, that the Senate will stay in session
and immediately take up impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Lott earlier said the Senate would take the first ``preliminary
steps'' toward a trial either the day it convenes or the following
day. He said there would then be a pause of several days for the
White House to submit its pleadings, a formal response to
allegations in articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate would seek to conduct a trial ``with reasonable
dispatch in a way that does not eliminate discussion of nationally
important issues,'' Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1868 trial of Andrew Johnson lasted for more than a month,
with sessions running up to five hours a day. The Senate was kept
in session six days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist would preside at a
Senate trial. Senators would sit in silence during the proceedings.
They would get to speak only at the hour of judgment, standing
beside their desks to say ``Guilty!'' or ``Not Guilty!'' to the
impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sobering job, one that Murray said she is approaching
``with a lot of trepidation. It is a tremendous responsibility. It
will be incredibly difficult. It is a tremendous weight to have to
make a judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Gorton: ``An oath to administer impartial justice is one
that every member will take very seriously.''

PENTAGON OUTLINES ITS OBJECTIVES FOR IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While the politicians talk about the long-range
strategies for Iraq, and even the overthrow of President Saddam
Hussein, the Pentagon has depicted the air assault on Iraq in far
more modest terms: keeping to a timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first missiles fell in Iraq, the Pentagon had limited
its attack to a sharp, swift assault lasting no more than a handful
of days with no intention of even seriously crippling Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   As American and British forces struck Iraq for a third day,
senior defense officials said the attack was simply working its way
through a ``tightly drawn'' list of military and industrial
targets. The strikes would end, they said, when the cruise missiles
and jets reached the end of the list.
</P>
<P>
   That finite list of targets was drawn up with an eye toward
avoiding American casualties and creating such a vague and limited
benchmark of success _ ``degrading'' the enemy's capabilities _
that it would be fairly easy to declare the mission achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no fixed end time,'' Secretary of Defense William
Cohen said in an interview on CNN Friday night as the attack passed
the 48-hour mark. ``We have very specific targets we intend to
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Having encountered little resistance from Iraqi air defenses or
foul weather, the strikes have gone largely according to plan. And
while the Pentagon indicated Friday that the success so far has
been mixed, officials said the strikes would more than likely end
after a fourth day on Saturday, exactly as commanders planned.
</P>
<P>
   When the Persian Gulf war ended, the Pentagon was criticized for
failing to achieve larger goals. With the much more limited
objectives of this air assault, the Pentagon is also protecting
itself from what it believes was misdirected blame in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and other senior administration officials have repeatedly
used the term ``degrade'' in reference to Saddam's ability to
threaten his neighbors with chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Degrade means that we want to, in whatever period of time we
intend to use to carry out this operation, to bring down his
capabilities as much as we possibly can,'' the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton of the Army, said
during a news conference at the Pentagon on Friday. ``We realize
that you can't destroy it in all cases.''
</P>
<P>
   The strikes are far from pinpricks. Although the Pentagon said
after two days that 88 targets had been hit, only a small portion
were severely damaged or destroyed. Ever since the attack began,
defense and administration officials have sought to tamp down
unrealistic expectations that force alone could do what seven years
of sanctions and diplomatic isolation have not.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that since the latest round of confrontations
with Iraq began in November, the Pentagon has had to convince the
White House and State Department that it was simply not possible,
as officials publicly vowed, to compel Saddam to comply with U.N.
weapons inspections or to destroy with force his ability to make
chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done yeoman's work to convince those in the
administration who don't really understand, what kind of military
objectives you can hope to achieve,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, for the first time, Cohen, Shelton and senior
officers on the Joint Staff outlined the objectives of the strikes,
which began on Wednesday night with a barrage of cruise missiles
fired from Navy warships and submarines.
</P>
<P>
   They included air defenses, command centers and military
headquarters and the barracks and equipment of the Republican
Guard, the special units that Cohen said help Iraq build, protect
and use weapons of mass destruction. The missiles and bombers have
also struck airfields and an oil refinery that officials said
provided illicit funds to Saddam's government that are not allowed
under U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ultimate objective is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes at the refinery, near Basra, and against the
Republican Guards, suggested an effort to erode Saddam's grip on
power. American A-10 jets also dropped leaflets informing Iraq's
regular army units in the south that ``only those units that
support the Baghdad regime'' would be targeted, suggesting that
they would be better off breaking with Saddam. Cohen said, however,
that the leaflets were intended simply to keep those forces out of
the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not seeking to destabilize his regime,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials did not rule out the unexpected. ``You might get _ I
don't want to say lucky _ some of the things that could hasten the
end of the regime,'' one senior Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the scope and duration of the strikes are being narrowed by
international and domestic political pressures.
</P>
<P>
   While some Republicans in Congress have called on the
administration to do more to punish Iraq and oust Saddam, very few
support what that would take: a prolonged commitment of American
forces, including ground troops. Senior defense officials said they
had to shape a plan that was tough enough, but not too tough.
</P>
<P>
   The advances in technology also shaped the objectives. More
cruise missile were launched in the first two days of this strike
than the 289 that were used during the entire Persian Gulf war,
allowing planners to strike targets with more precision and, of
course, less risk to pilots and to innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and other senior officials left open the possibility that
the strikes could continue even longer and that the United States
could stop the attack and then resume it in the future if Saddam
moves to threaten his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials also said they could not envision more than a
few days of bombing against Iraq for another reason: sentiment in
already wary Arab states, some of them providing bases to American
air and ground forces, would not tolerate any more. And to be sure,
anti-American protests have grown in intensity with each passing
day.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has also underlined their sensitivity to
Ramadan, the Muslim holy period of fasting. While a senior military
officer said Friday that the calendar was not an absolute barrier,
the American and British forces were racing against their own
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, officials declared the start of Ramadan Friday with the
sighting of the crescent moon.

FOR THE FIRST TIME, WOMEN ARE FLYING IN COMBAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time, U.S. female military aviators are flying
combat missions as Operation Desert Fox continues against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen female naval aviators are flying from the aircraft
carriers USS Enterprise and USS Carl Vinson, and others are
operating with Air Force units stationed in the Persian Gulf
region, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy fliers include four EA-6B crew members from Whidbey
Island Naval Air Station assigned to squadrons aboard the two
carriers, said Capt. John Cryer, commander of the Pacific Fleet
Electronic Combat Wing at the Oak Harbor, Wash., base. They include
one pilot and three electronic countermeasures officers who operate
the Prowler aircraft's powerful jamming gear, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time where women launched and fired
weapons,'' said one Pentagon Navy official, who asked that his name
not be used. Female naval aviators, who first were allowed into
warplane cockpits in late 1993, have flown thousands of hours in
patrol missions such as Bosnia and the ``no fly'' enforcement over
southern Iraq that preceded the combat operations this week, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth female Prowler aviator from Electronic Attack Squadron
130 aboard the Enterprise was killed with three male shipmates when
their EA-6B crashed on the carrier flight deck last month as the
ship was leaving the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force spokesman in Washington said the number of women in
the service's bomber and fighter units now in the Persian Gulf was
not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon in 1993 terminated a decades-old combat exclusion
rule that prohibited female aircrew from flying in combat aircraft,
but the first female pilots and crew personnel did not enter the
fleet until the following year, the Navy official said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, their ranks have steadily grown. As of June there
were 326 women aviators _ 229 pilots and 97 naval flight officers _
with another 163 student aviators in the training pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, 68 warships and 57 noncombatant vessels have become
open to female crew members, and there are now 11,204 women serving
at sea, the Navy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the 51,251 female personnel on active duty comprise
about 13 percent of the Navy's total force of 393,481 personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole integration of women has been so transparent up here
we don't even think of it,'' said Cryer, the EA-6B wing commander.
He said each training class of about 18 EA-6B students has two or
three women, a level that has remained constant in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Serving in the Gulf, in addition to the four female Prowler
aircrew, are five F/A-18 Hornet fighter pilots; one pilot and three
naval flight officers in F-14 Tomcats; three naval flight officers
in the S-3 Viking patrol plane; and six SH-60 Seahawk helicopter
pilots for the search and rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
   The female aviators serving in the conflict have declined
requests by news media for interviews, the Pentagon official said.
``They don't want to stand apart (from male squadron mates) because
they consider themselves Navy aviators first and foremost,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, to us it doesn't matter that they are male or
female,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is not naming the women, or other personnel
involved in combat missions, for security reasons.

day traders in their 20s and 30s, jumping in and out of the market
to make quick profits, it is now being invaded by millions of
people like Woodland and Van Lear _ seasoned investors who bring
much larger accounts and more stability to this fast-growing corner
of the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. says more than 20 percent of the people who use
its popular Microsoft Investor software are older than 50. And
E(ASTERISK)Trade, the fast-growing online brokerage firm, says a
quarter of its customers are over 55, up from 19 percent in June
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big, big part of the market,'' said Joe Ricketts,
chairman of Ameritrade Holdings, another large online brokerage
firm. ``I thought it would take a generation for online investing
to permeate society, but it is happening much faster than we ever
dreamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   Older Americans' new interest in online investing has been felt
on Wall Street; after all, no other group of Americans has so much
money tied up in the stock market, and no other group has so much
time to devote to finances. So traditional brokerage firms are
scrambling to hold an important pool of customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our average client's age is in the upper 50s, so that is a
large part of our client base,'' said Ellen Breslow, director of
individual retirement planning services at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, online investors 55 and older are typically
well-educated and wealthy, according to At Plan, a market research
firm that tracks consumer behavior on the Web. About 66 percent
have college degrees; 35 percent have postgraduate degrees; about
23 percent have incomes of $100,000 or more (compared with 18
percent for the broader adult population), and 28 percent manage an
investment portfolio worth more than $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 18 months, we've seen a real surge in the older
generation,'' said Blake Darcey, chief executive pf DLJ Direct, the
fast-growing online brokerage unit of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,
based in Jersey City, N.J. ``We had people putting in $30,000, but
now there are people bringing in $1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The low cost of doing business online _ now as little as $7 a
trade _ and the excitement of riding a bull market are the lures
for many older investors _ just as they are for the young. Plus,
older investors are taking up the cyberspace totem of
``empowerment.'' They are dismissing their full-service brokers,
who offer research and investment advice but often charge more than
$100 a trade, and instead are picking their own stocks, after
downloading companies' annual reports and other research basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are incredible tools, now in the hands of an
individual investor,'' said Carol Potts, 56, a retired crafts
designer in Santa Barbara, Calif. ``There's no reason for me to
have a financial adviser. I'm very analytical, and I like to get
involved in research.''
</P>
<P>
   For many such investors, the Internet is making them bolder.
According to a survey this fall of 630 people over 50 by Charles
Schwab &AMP; Co., many older investors say the Internet has made them
more confident about their investments and more willing to trust
their own judgment.
</P>
<P>
   But such confidence may also cause some to gamble away their
retirement nest eggs, financial experts warn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, for many this is like online gambling,'' said Jeremy
Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of the
University of Pennsylvania. ``It's almost like being at the
blackjack table. People can get in and out immediately, and with a
profit. And they can reverse their bet at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such a warning holds for investors of any age. But if
stocks enter a bear market, Siegel said, it could prove
particularly disastrous for retirees, who are so dependent on their
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Other financial experts warn that older investors online could
be vulnerable to stock fraud. The Securities and Exchange
Commission in late October accused 44 stock promoters of
fraudulently recommending stocks on the Internet, and regulators
are concerned that older Americans are particularly vulnerable to
such schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older Americans have long been a favorite target of con
artists _ and the Internet is the newest high-tech way for crooks
to pick investors' pockets,'' said Denise Voigt Crawford, former
president of the North American Securities Administration
Association, a band of state regulatory agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The rush of seniors to online investing begins, of course, with
desktops and Internet access. The Schwab survey found that 40
percent of people over 50 had a home computer, up from 29 percent
three years ago, and that 70 percent of those had Internet access
at home, up from 17 percent in 1995. Jupiter Communications, which
tracks new media, says more than 7 million people 55 or older were
online this year, up from 3.8 million just two years ago. By 2002,
the number is expected to grow to nearly 11 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stereotypes really don't fit,'' said Fran Middleton, 70, a
founder of Senior Net, a San Francisco group devoted to bringing
technology to people over 50. ``If a large senior center opens and
they say, `We're going to have classes on computers,' they're
swamped. I see this time and time again. They'd say, `We have
chairs for 25,' and 200 people would turn up.''

MAKING A CASE FOR FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Joseph R. Yandle is one of the most prominent success
stories in the recent history of the Massachusetts prison system.
Now he has become a pawn for politicians trying to out-tough one
another on the issue of crime.
</P>
<P>
   After three years on parole, Yandle was returned to MCI-Concord
in August, after disclosures that he fabricated a history as a
Vietnam veteran who developed the drug habit that led him to a life
of crime, including a 1972 murder. He was sent back to prison for
violating parole, and may spend the rest of his life there.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Yandle was wrong to use the Vietnam tale to
win his release. But sending him to prison for the rest of his life
_ as Acting Governor Paul Cellucci and incoming Attorney General
Thomas F. Reilly want to do _ would be ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, it would make a mockery of the notion that the state
should rehabilitate prisoners so they can become contributing
members of society. Few prisoners have ever been more successfully
rehabilitated than Yandle. If that counts for nothing, the whole
system is built on a falsehood.
</P>
<P>
   Yandle went to prison for being the getaway driver in the 1972
Medford package store holdup in which Joseph R. Reppucci was
murdered. He began mounting a crusade for release in the 1980s,
pointing to his two college degrees earned in prison, and aided by
bogus military records.
</P>
<P>
   The Governor's Council commuted his sentence in 1995, and he was
paroled. But though his phony image as a Vietnam hero helped boost
his cause, it was his rehabilitation and the fact he was the
getaway driver that won him his freedom. Yandle moved to Vermont to
live with the wife he had married while in prison and their young
son.
</P>
<P>
   At Cellucci's insistence, he was returned to prison in August.
But now the council and the Parole Board, which actually released
him, must decide whether he remains in MCI-Concord or goes free.
</P>
<P>
   The Governor's Council held a nine-hour hearing on Yandle's case
last Wednesday, and is scheduled to vote on whether to take back
its commutation of his sentence this Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yandle's hoax embarrassed Cellucci. But the state plainly had
not done its homework on Yandle _ allowing him to submit fraudulent
military records to the Parole Board in the late 1980s rather than
obtaining official documents.
</P>
<P>
   When Yandle's hoax unraveled, Cellucci was in the midst of a
fierce Republican primary battle with Treasurer Joseph D. Malone.
So the acting governor did what politicians often do under
pressure: He postured. His earlier support for Yandle evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Reilly also made the case for Yandle's continued
incarceration, maintaining that he had been sentenced to life in
prison and had won his freedom through fraud. Yandle, he said, was
and is a con man.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of support, dozens of Yandle's Vermont neighbors
attended the hearing, with many of them testifying about his
extensive community service.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone would have to sympathize with the Reppucci family, who
sat in silent dignity at the hearing Wednesday. But it's hard to
see what good it does anyone to put Joe Yandle back in prison. This
is hardly someone who's evaded responsibility: He served 23 years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   He clearly has changed. Yes, he lied. But he also grew into a
good citizen, husband, and father. Not even the most zealous
advocate of returning him to prison claims to consider him a threat
to public safety.
</P>
<P>
   If a major goal of our prison system is to reform criminals so
they can lead productive lives among us _ a task at which it most
often fails, miserably _ then the governor and the attorney general
should applaud someone like Yandle, who counsels kids and drug
addicts, coaches Little League baseball and has been a role model
for his community in three years of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Governor's Council votes in Yandle's favor on
Wednesday, as they probably will, Yandle may still not be freed.
</P>
<P>
   Because Yandle is technically free on parole, the final decision
on his fate rests with the Parole Board, which will consider his
case on Jan. 21. That gubernatorially appointed board will probably
vote to keep Yandle in prison, at Cellucci's direction.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a shame. What Yandle did to win his freedom seems
less important than what he has done with that freedom. Not many
convicts ever go straight. Joe Yandle has. That should count for
something.

UNDATED: turn up.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many older Americans were initially drawn to the Internet
because of e-mail, and it remains the single most popular
application among seniors. Now, though, they are also surfing the
Net to research travel, health care, family history _ and finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're at home, you get calls all times of the day: `Do I
have a stock for you,''' said Len Bovarnick, a retired entrepreneur
who now divides his time between Norwood, Mass., and West Palm
Beach, Fla. ``Well, I don't want these people to call. I can do it
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has certainly noticed the graying of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   DLJ Direct has created a special category for wealthy investors,
most of whom are older. These customers have special privileges
like access to initial public offerings and proprietary Wall Street
research.
</P>
<P>
   Discover Brokerage, a unit of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, is now
offering Treasury securities online because of demand from its
older customers. ``We have definitely seen an aging of our client
base,'' said Tom O'Connell, executive vice president of Discover.
</P>
<P>
   While Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage firm, has no
plans to offer discount online trading, it is preparing to allow
customers who pay an annual management fee to make a set number of
trades over the Internet. And Schwab, the giant discount broker and
one of the Web's earliest and most ardent advocates, has teamed up
with Seniornet to train older investors how to invest online.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of online investing, of course, coincides with one of
the greatest bull markets in history, the explosion of mutual funds
and investing clubs, and a mania for hot Internet stocks like Yahoo
and Amazon.com. In a time of golden returns, everyone is a pro, and
as a result, people of all ages are dismissing their brokers,
managing their own money and doing their own research.
</P>
<P>
   Online trading has nearly doubled in each of the last two years
and now accounts for about 10 percent of all stock trades, retail
and institutional, according to Bill Burnham, an online analyst at
Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Don Gimpel, 69, and Orvis Adams, 73, are two such investors, and
they are basking in the glow of a great market, casting about the
Net for information about stocks. Gimpel, a retired engineer, likes
to hand out a 40-page document filled with his favorite investment
sites on the Web, more than 500 of them.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he logs onto the personal Web site of Edward
Yardeni, the chief economist of Deutsche Bank Securities; he also
tracks monthly economic trends and pulls Federal Reserve data off
the Web. ``There's no excuse for flying blind anymore,'' Gimpel
said. ``The data are here.''
</P>
<P>
   While Adams trades through National Discount Brokers, which
offers online trading, Gimpel, like a number of older investors,
uses the Web to do research and then telephones a full-service
broker. Some older investors say they like the comfort of having a
broker available in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Bale, 69, a retired Boeing aircraft inspector in Auburn,
Wash., is another who keeps a foothold in both investing worlds.
``If something goes wrong, I can go pound my fist on a desk and
say, `I want my money back,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the danger, said Siegel of the Wharton School, is that
investors who use the Web can imagine that they have a great
advantage over others even though millions of individuals and
institutions also have access to up-to-the-minute data, on and off
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get this herd mentality,'' Siegel said. ``But don't
forget, everyone knows more. You may have an edge over the past,
but you may not have an edge over everyone else. And if everyone
knows more, it means it's already computed in the price.''
</P>
<P>
   That is part of the argument of full-service brokers, who say
their business is not in jeopardy. People value knowledge and sound
advice, they say, even if it comes at a premium _ and that is not
about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Advisory services include estate planning, management of
personal trusts and information on other complex topics, said Ms.
Breslow of Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of advice we give you're not going to find on a Web
site somewhere,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   John Steffens, vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, said: ``We think
advice is our business. And the transaction is the least important
part of the business. There's nothing inherently wrong with trading
on the Internet, but the concept of trading all you want is how
it's being positioned.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads for online trading services, Steffens said, ``are `Let's
get a hunch and bet a bunch' or `More trading is better' _ they're
positioning it as entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Many of us know it's not so simple. It's very hard
to beat the S&AMP;P; very few pros beat the S&AMP;P.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are also watching online trading carefully. Mary
Schapiro, president of the regulatory arm of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq
market, shares a growing concern about suggestions that fast money
can be made by pointing and clicking. ``It's easy to push the
button, but it's not easy to invest,'' she said. ``The risk with a
senior citizen is if they lose a significant part of their money,
they may not be able to earn it back.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the association, while in favor of the growth
of online investing, is thinking about questions of ``suitability''
_ whether online investors are making trades that are suitable for
their personal financial situations. At a full-service broker, such
trades, in theory at least, would be reviewed for their
appropriateness. Online, they may go unchecked _ and, in fact, may
be fueled by chat rooms, some of which are supported by online
brokerage firms that say they offer no advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suitability is not an issue,'' said Christos Cotsakos, chief
executive of E(ASTERISK)Trade. ``The brokerage model is predicated
on the notion that the customer is dumb. But the advice you get is
not necessarily right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take our responsibility very seriously, and we believe
people want to make their own decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors like Woodland, the retired insurance salesman _ who
also balances his checkbook with Quicken personal finance software
_ are not worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's the freedom to walk into my little office here and
take charge of my business,'' he said. ``I'm not in the insurance
business anymore; I'm in the investing business.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodland logged again onto his computer. ``A good half the
people I know out here in this community are on the Internet,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And what about his children? Did they get him started? He
laughed. ``I think I introduced them to the Internet,'' he said.

GOLFER NORMAN PULLS OUT OF BUSINESS JET SET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He was the high-profile first customer for Boeing's
new Business Jet line.
</P>
<P>
   But golf pro Greg Norman has canceled his order for one of the
new 737 business models, The Boeing Co. confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Norman's order for the $35 million Business Jet, which has been
on the market for more than two years, was highly publicized by
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The company centered an advertising campaign around the
golfer-businessman even before the jets began rolling of the
assembly line this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Norman could not be reached for comment, but a Boeing executive
blamed Asia's economic woes for yet another jet cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   Norman ordered his jet in June 1997, the month before the plunge
of the Thai baht set off the economic crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was doing a lot of golf course design in Asia,'' said Lee
Monson, Boeing Business Jet's vice president of sales. ``Like the
rest of the world, he faced some real downturn in that part of his
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Though based on the new generation 737, the Business Jet
typically has extra fuel tanks for long flights. It can fly
non-stop from New York to Tokyo, carrying more payload than smaller
corporate jets. But it weighs 171,000 pounds compared with under
100,000 for the heaviest corporate jet. Its weight keeps it out of
small airports with thinly paved taxiways _ just the sort of
airports Norman has been flying to recently to work on golf courses
in rural America.
</P>
<P>
   Monson said Norman has been flying in a Gulfstream IV.
</P>
<P>
   Norman canceled his order for the Business Jet in the second
week of November. Boeing declined to discuss the financial terms of
the cancellation. ``We never discuss those,'' Monson said, ``and
they're all a little bit different.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman's plane was nearly out the door, and ``just getting ready
for flight test,'' Monson said. The custom interior hadn't been
installed, because that work isn't done by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The company has sold the plane to another customer.
</P>
<P>
   This is the program's first cancellation. ``We don't anticipate
it significantly affecting our business,'' Monson said. ``You don't
see multimillion-dollar decisions made because Greg Norman owns one
of these airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes not. Forty-seven Business Jets have been
ordered, with eight scheduled to be delivered by the end of this
month. Of the eight, one is going to General Electric, one will be
a Boeing demo, and six are to undisclosed buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Customers, who include corporations and heads of state, mostly
don't want their names made public. Norman didn't mind, and Boeing
paid him to appear in its ads.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no more Greg Norman ads. And Monson added, ``I
think you won't see another high-profile type advertisement.''

YES, EVEN A BILL COLLECTOR CAN FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)   (af)  
 By CAROL MARIE CROPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. _ The irony of it had to smart a bit: Here was a
Tulsa start-up that had rocketed to stardom on its prowess at
collecting delinquent credit-card accounts asking a judge to
protect it from its own creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial Financial Services had been a dream come true for
Tulsa. Just three years ago, the company moved into a nearly vacant
60-story structure originally built to house Oral Roberts' failed
777-bed hospital and began hiring at a rate of 40 people a week.
</P>
<P>
   In a year, the state's business community was honoring the
company's founder, William R. Bartmann, with the Oklahoma Venture
of the Year Award. Commercial Financial was on its way to becoming
No. 1 in its industry, the fourth-largest private employer in Tulsa
and a big source of jobs. Tulsans looked on with civic pride when
Bartmann was on the cover of Inc. magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the city is watching in confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble at the closely held company started last September,
when an anonymous letter to credit-rating agencies accused the
company of puffing up its apparent collection-success rate by
quietly selling large numbers of uncollected accounts to a shell
company tied to a major shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   After first dismissing the accusations, Bartmann told the
ratings services that there seemed to be some basis for them,
according to Moody's Investors Service. In October, Moody's,
Standard &AMP; Poor's and other services downgraded or suspended their
ratings of the company and its securities.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Bartmann, his wife, Kathryn, and the company's other
co-founder, Jay Jones, have all resigned from management, at least
temporarily. Outside lawyers and PricewaterhouseCoopers auditors
have been called in to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   And on Dec. 11, after a bank that had invested in securities
issued by Commercial Financial filed suit, the company filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, claiming $415 million in total
assets and $208 million in debts, excluding potential liability
from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Tulsa business leaders expressed confidence that the
company would solve its problems and survive. Privately, some said
they feared that its success might have been too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kinds of companies always worry me,'' said Wayne
Swearingen, an oil industry consultant based in Tulsa. ``I don't
know of much besides cancer that grows 50 percent a year,'' he
said, referring to Commercial Financial's leap from fewer than 200
employees in 1995 to about 3,700 today _ 3,000 in Tulsa and the
rest in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   The company grew into the nation's largest collector of
charged-off credit-card debt by training employees in Bartmann's
persistent but polite collection strategy, which appeared to be
coaxing a surprising amount of money from debtors whom banks
considered deadbeats.
</P>
<P>
   Having gone bust in the oil-industry slump in the 1980s,
Bartmann had himself once been a delinquent debtor but won a new
start by persuading his lender to trust him with another $13,000
while he started Commercial Financial.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the company's rapid expansion was Bartmann's novel
approach to financing. He raised money to buy pools of bad
credit-card accounts by linking them to securitized debt
certificates, which are akin to mortgage-backed bonds like Ginnie
Mae's. When investors bought the certificates, they were
effectively lending the company the money to buy bad debts in
exchange for a cut of whatever could be collected on them. About
$1.6 billion in such certificates was outstanding at last count.
</P>
<P>
   The company made money _ $187 million in 1997 _ two ways: by
selling the certificates for more than it cost to buy the
underlying pool of credit-card debt, and by taking a 20 percent to
25 percent share of collections off the top as a servicing fee,
said Stephen C. Macy, a senior analyst at Moody's.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will buy the certificates only if they believe enough
will eventually be collected to give them an attractive yield, so
sustaining a high collection rate _ and a good rating from the
credit rating services _ was crucial to the company's success.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's was the first service to question Commercial Financial's
methods. When it could not reach agreement with the company on
several issues in early 1997, it stopped rating new issues at the
company's request, Macy said.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, Moody's did not suspect that a large percentage
of the company's ``collections'' might actually be sales of
accounts to a Shawnee, Okla., company called Dimat Corp. Bartmann
has told investors that Dimat, unbeknownst to him, was linked to
Jones; Jones could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the securitized pools, more than 60 percent of the
proceeds turned out to be from such sales, according to Fitch IBCA,
another ratings service. Without a tip-off like the anonymous
letter, such a situation ``can be almost impossible to detect,''
Macy said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is seeking a white knight to buy or merge with
it, shore up its sagging credibility and let it borrow again. Tulsa
business leaders are rooting for it to succeed, though from a
distance, figuratively and literally. (Its skyscraper headquarters
is miles from downtown.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Bartmann is not an old-time Tulsan,'' Swearingen said.
``Nobody quite understood what he was doing out there anyway.''
Since the company's troubles surfaced, ``there has been a lot of
20-20 hindsight,'' he said. ``I didn't hear anything much negative
about Bartmann until he got into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   But with layoffs under way in the oil industry _ a big employer
in Oklahoma _ Tulsa would like Commercial Financial to right
itself. Hundreds of employees, who tend to speak glowingly of their
high pay and the company's habit of sending groups of workers on
company-paid trips to resorts, have signed banners at headquarters
expressing support.
</P>
<P>
   George Kaiser, who owns Kaiser-Francis Oil Co. and is chairman
and majority shareholder of Bank of Oklahoma, said the local wisdom
is that any new owner would continue the operation with minimal job
losses, at least initially, though the rapid-growth days may be
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have a solid business and a good business
strategy,'' said Edward F. Keller, chairman and chief executive of
Bank One in Tulsa and chairman of the Metropolitan Tulsa Chamber of
Commerce. ``I'd prefer to believe that it's going to work out.''

EDITORIAL: RESTITUTION AND THE PROBLEM OF STOLEN ART 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Dec. 19:
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to escape the questions _ ``Why so late?'' and ``Why
only now?'' _ that Elie Wiesel asked in a speech at the opening of
the recent Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets, held at the
Holocaust Museum in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   His questions reflect the vigorous effort to sort out the
assets, including missing or stolen artworks, that once belonged to
Jews who died in the Holocaust. But the pungent implication in
Wiesel's words is this: What has kept the world, until the past few
years, from committing itself to the burden of disentangling the
global effects of Hitler's spoliation?
</P>
<P>
   One answer is that an extraordinary contamination has attached
to works of art stolen during the Holocaust. Hard as it may be for
cultural institutions to address the matter of stolen art in their
collections, it is vastly harder when the art was stolen during a
regime that defines the horrific extremes of state-sponsored evil.
The difficulty of coming to terms with Holocaust-era assets has
been the difficulty of coming to terms with history itself.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the marketplace, however, has had little
interest in history. The sale of a stolen work of art has often,
falsely, seemed to legitimize the theft itself, leading now, more
than half a century after Hitler took power, to tangled claims of
ownership in which two forms of legitimacy, one legal, the other
moral, come into conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In New York we have had the case of two Egon Schiele paintings _
lent to the Museum of Modern Art, claimed by their pre-Nazi owners,
impounded by the city and still held pending appeal. Similar claims
have been pressed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Valery Kulishov, Russia's restitution director, pledged his
country's assistance in obtaining restitution for individual
victims, and turned over three secret documents bearing on stolen
or missing artworks. Kulishov's gesture is welcome because the
success of restitution depends on the quality of information, and
the candor, that is brought to the table.
</P>
<P>
   The conference has also produced a set of guidelines for
restitution of stolen art. The guidelines are nonbinding, but they
carry, says Stuart Eizenstat, the conference's organizer, a ``moral
commitment.'' Those words should serve as a stern reminder. It was
precisely the abeyance of moral commitment, in ways large and
small, that made restitution necessary in the first place.

INVESTING WITH TWEEDY BROWNE &AMP; CO.

Global Value is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers

(af) 
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bookshelves in the conference room of Tweedy, Browne &UR;  &LR; &AMP; Co.
are lined with financial history. Dry securities references, some
of them filigreed and bound in cracked brown leather, date back to
1939.
</P>
<P>
   These were the books that Howard Browne, a co-founder, consulted
when he bought and sold stocks for the likes of Benjamin Graham,
the father of value investing and the firm's biggest customer in
the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the 1960s, Tweedy Browne brokered for Warren E.
Buffett, the sage of Omaha, and sold him his original shares of
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which he now runs.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it, Tweedy Browne's value roots stretch deep.
Today, two of Harold Browne's sons, William H., 54, and Christopher
H., 52, are among the five managing partners of the firm. There
have been some changes: 70 percent of the firm was sold in October
1997 to Affilliated Managers Group, for $300 million, though the
deal had to do with estate planning purposes, not market concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Tweedy, Browne now has $1.5 billion in accounts managed for
individual clients; those accounts have returned an annual average
of 19.1 percent, net of fees, from 1975, when the company
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an
investment advisor, through Sept. 30 of this year, according to
company reports. That compares with an annual average return of
16.4 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index over the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's mutual funds, which are relatively new, have also
outperformed. Since its inception in December 1993, the $1.12
billion Tweedy, Browne American Value fund has returned an annual
average of 18.6 percent, through Dec. 11, versus 13.4 percent for
the average mid-cap value fund tracked by Morningstar Inc., the
Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.5 billion Tweedy, Browne Global Value fund, started in
June 1993, has returned an annual average of 14.3 percent, versus
11.2 percent for the average world stock fund.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the firm's investing style comes down to buying a
stock for less than its so-called intrinsic value _ just plain
``value'' to these veterans _ a relatively simple concept
introduced by Graham.
</P>
<P>
   As John D. Spears, 50, a third managing partner, described it,
``Value is what a business, its assets or its earning power would
be worth if you or I own it and we were to sell it to a competitor
down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple. But if figuring value is easy, why do so many value
investors fall flat? ``To buy deep value takes a lot of courage,
because it looks really ugly,'' Christopher Browne said. ``The
companies are cheap because there are a lot of bad stories out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   William Browne added, ``It's like looking for the ugliest spouse
because she will love you the most.''
</P>
<P>
   The five Tweedy, Browne managers _ the other two are Thomas H.
Shrager and Robert Q. Wyckoff Jr. _ attack value from a variety of
angles. They use fundamental balance-sheet and income-statement
analysis, looking for stocks that sell for 50 percent to 60 percent
of their estimate of intrinsic value.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a stock requires the approval of two of the funds' three
top dogs _ Spears and the two Browne brothers. Disputes rarely, if
ever, break out among this conservatively suited crowd. ``We use
the same analytical tools and the same valuation benchmarks,''
Christopher Browne said. When a stock's price reflects its
intrinsic value, they sell.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, the managers receive a tip sheet of sorts, in the
form of SEC Form 4 filings, required of insiders who buy shares in
their company. Such insider buying often flags a likely candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of the company visits favored by many tire-kicking fund
managers, the Tweedy, Browne crew uses marathon telephone
interviews, which are taped. Transcripts from some of the
interviews can run 50 or 60 pages long. ``We call them
depositions,'' Christopher Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   They cross-examine management, using a checklist of 17 standard
earnings outlook and value questions, known inside the firm by the
acronym ``Pucci,'' for pricing, unit sales, costs, competition and
insider buying. The questions cover two single-spaced typed pages.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The macro picture isn't important to them. ``John Kenneth
Galbraith once said that there are two types of economic
forecasters: those that don't know, and those that don't know that
they don't know,'' William Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   In specific stocks, the American Value fund is adding to its
position in Household International Inc., the largest consumer
finance company and small-loan company since it acquired the
Beneficial Corp. in June. ``The CEO, who has a large number of
shares under options, has begun spending a lot of his money buying
stock, and the CFO is buying stock,'' Wyckoff said, referring to
William F. Aldinger and David A. Schoenholz.
</P>
<P>
   Its share price dropped from the low $50s in July to $23 in
October; it now is at $34.875.
</P>
<P>
   Household sells for just 10.5 times Tweedy Browne's estimate for
1999 earnings, including goodwill amortization after taxes, which
makes the earnings higher than reported, Wyckoff said. He figures
that Household is probably in the bottom 10 percent of companies
its size, based on its price-to-earnings multiple, and puts its
intrinsic value at $60 a share. Its purchase of Beneficial should
make it more profitable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   American Value began buying Rayonier Inc., a timber company, in
March. ``It came up in our radar,'' Spears said, when a directors,
Rand Araskog, the former chief executive of ITT, ``bought more than
a hundred thousand shares.'' Spears estimated Rayonier's intrinsic
value at $85 a share, more than twice its current price of $41.625.
</P>
<P>
   The fund began buying shares of MBIA Inc., a municipal bond
insurer, at $55 a share in November. ``We notice that a director, a
former CEO of Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, which was one of
the founders of MBIA, bought 40,000 shares recently at prices up to
$70,'' Christopher Browne said, referring to Joseph W. Brown. MBIA
closed on Friday at $62.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnings are locked in, because they write insurance and take
the premium into income over the life of the bonds,'' he said. The
company sells for 12 times projected 1999 earnings, putting it in
the bottom 10 percent of companies its size. Tweedy, Browne
estimates its intrinsic value at $100.
</P>
<P>
   Though the firm invests abroad, it doesn't look for insider
buying there. ``It's not part of the culture of most companies
outside the U.S.,'' William Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   The Global fund recently bought shares in Fraser &AMP; Neave, a
Singapore brewer, which is also the anchor bottler of Coca-Cola in
Vietnam, Malaysia, and Singapore and an owner of real estate in
Singapore. In Singapore dollars, its book value is more than $8 a
share, but it trades at less than $5, said William Browne, who puts
its intrinsic value as high as $9. Earnings have fallen from more
than 50 cents a share last year to 20 cents a share now. The stock
sells for less than eight times its normal earnings power of 65
cents per share, which is what he expects the company to make in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has also acquired shares in Crown Van Gelder, a Dutch
paper company. It bought shares for 28 guilders in October and
November, down from 37 guilders last spring, and puts its intrinsic
value at 43 guilders. It now trades at 29 guilders. Crown is a
cyclical stock, yields 6.9 percent and shows no debt on its balance
sheet. &QL;

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Dec. 20,
1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category)
</P>
<P>
   FEATURE story &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TAYMOR-TITUS-FILM (Rome) _ The vast white marble piazza before
the Palazzo della Civilta del Lavoro, is a solemn building of
marble arches that looms over EUR, the grandiose exhibition park
Mussolini ordered built in the 1930s to fuse Roman Empire and
Fascist might. And that was what drew the theater director Julie
Taymor to select it as a site for ``Titus,'' her film adaptation of
Shakespeare's tragedy ``Titus Andronicus.'' Whatever its quality is
eventually judged to be, this is no ordinary venture. It is Ms.
Taymor's first feature film, with a starry cast headed by Anthony
Hopkins in the title role, Jessica Lange and Alan Cumming. This is
Ms. Taymor's first major venture since her extraordinary success
last year with Disney's ``Lion King'' _ a show that she transformed
with her direction, design and musical choices from a potentially
potted theatricalization of a cartoon movie into Broadway's biggest
hit. By Alessandra Stanley. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-UNDERSTANDING (Undated) _ Present an unfamiliar piece of
music to a randomly chosen audience member, ask an opinion, and I
challenge you to get a simple expository sentence in response. The
body language will be one of retreat; the words will be quick to
equivocate. ``That was interesting,'' or ``I didn't understand it,
but maybe I will next time,'' or ``I should know more about it
before I tell you what I think.'' One longs to hear, ``That was
beautiful,'' or ``I hated it,'' or ``It bored me to death,'' for
this is what those answers really mean. The crucial word here is
``understand,'' for the fear of not understanding is great. Failing
to understand marks the unhappy listener as dense, out of the loop,
ill educated. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   GEENA-DAVIS-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ The Academy Award-winning
actress Geena Davis is back, or at least working at a comeback
after a two-year hiatus and a divorce. And she has made it clear
that she is willing to play just about anything _ except a
weakling. Her new movie ``Stuart Little,'' based on E.B. White's
classic 1945 children's book about a family whose new son turns out
to be a mouse, symbolizes the critical juncture where Ms. Davis,
who is 41, stands. By James Sterngold. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH-FILMS (Undated) _ This week, five films that can
legitimately be described as British will be showing in American
theaters. Given the anxiety of holiday marketers, that number is in
itself an eye-popper. What's more surprising, though, is that not
one of these British films is about expendable laborers trying to
salvage self-regard in a renovated upland city, or about young
professionals contemplating themselves in the sleek surfaces of the
new London. These films _ ``Elizabeth,'' ``Little Voice,''
``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``The General'' and ``The Theory of
Flight'' _ don't represent anything as grand as the renaissance of
a national industry that looked so healthy in the 1960s and then
again in the 1980s. By Will Joyner. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GLEESON-GENERAL-FILM (Dublin, Ireland) _ Brendan Gleeson bears
an uncanny resemblance to Martin Cahill, the maverick Dublin
gangland boss whom he plays in John Boorman's new movie, ``The
General,'' which opened Friday in New York. Yet there was another,
more subtle, reason for casting the burly Irish actor as the
mobster. In order to convey why Dubliners came to admire this
hardened criminal, murdered by the IRA in 1994, Boorman needed a
likable Cahill. And Gleeson is very likable. But he also has what
the veteran director calls ``essential goodness,'' which is why he
almost turned down his biggest movie role to date. By Alan Riding.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   ISADORA-DUNCAN-BOOK (Undated) _ Earlier this year, a conference
of dance scholars retired from a long day's meeting to an oyster
house, where the oyster lovers set out to seduce the skeptics into
sampling the delicacy. A quotation from the modern dancer Isadora
Duncan's autobiography, ``My Life,'' persuaded the final holdout.
``You know what Isadora wrote, don't you?'' said a clever
historian. ``That she began to dance in her mother's womb, in
response to her mother's diet of oysters and champagne, the food of
Aphrodite.'' ``My Life'' turns 71 this month, a lifetime much
longer than that of its author. By Ann Daly. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIAN-SINGERS (Undated) _ Not since the czarist era have
Russian singers attained the unfettered mainstream exposure they
currently enjoy, once more regularly appearing in Western opera
houses and signing contracts with major record labels. Perhaps the
most conspicuous example of their resurgence can be found on the
Philips label, on which the indefatigable conductor Valery Gergiev
spearheads a seemingly endless series of Russian operas, including
many obscure works. Largely as a result of his efforts, several
soloists have emerged as stars in their own right, including the
soprano Galina Gorchakova, the mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina and, to
a lesser extent, the baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky. By David
Mermelstein. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MAHLER-MUSIC (Undated) _ The Philharmonic, the answer came back,
was holding the big gun in reserve, hoping to follow with a set
consisting entirely of Mahler's music. Now that release has
impressively materialized on 12 CDs as ``The Mahler Broadcasts,
1948-82'' (NYP 9801/12), and the obvious question becomes: Among
the 10 conductors represented, why no Bernstein? Leonard Bernstein,
after all, though he did not single-handedly revive the
Philharmonic's Mahler tradition, as is often supposed, certainly
took it to its loftiest heights in a series of performances
throughout his tenure as music director, from 1958 to 1969, and
beyond. Again, the Philharmonic is quick to reply. Bernstein's
omission, it turns out, is not for lack of trying. Sedgwick Clark,
the set's producer, explains in booklet notes that of all the
Mahler works the maestro performed with the Philharmonic, all but
two are represented among Bernstein's commercial recordings with
the orchestra, which remain in more or less continual circulation.
By James R. Oestreich. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DVORAK-MUSIC (Undated) _ Big and powerful are adjectives that
spring to mind when listening to the Eroica Trio, but a more pithy
description might be intelligent. The group's second recording,
``Dvorak: Piano Trio Dumky'' (EMI 7243 5 56673 2), represents
thoughtful music making of a high caliber. By Anne Midgette.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   SUBWAY-ART (Los Angeles) _ When the Red Line subway station on
the corner of Beverly Boulevard and Vermont Avenue opens here next
year, the first thing commuters will see is a giant escarpment of
sandy-colored rock that straddles the entrance tunnel. The
sculpture, by George Stone, was commissioned by the Metropolitan
Transit Authority to enliven this station. What Stone calls his
``art rocks'' _ three more hang from the roof of the pristine,
marble-floored station below _ are part of one of the most
imaginative public art programs in the country. By David Hay.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BODY-XRAYS-ART (Undated) _ The Julie Saul Gallery in Manhattan
has had the piquant idea of displaying together early medical
X-rays and more recent works of art that borrow from X-rays and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The exhibition, ``Skin/Deep: A
Survey of Interior Imaging From X-Ray to MRI'' (through Jan. 16),
assembles approximately 40 images from 1896 to the 1990s _ not
exactly a survey but proof once more of how eager art has been to
pilfer from the treasury of science and how readily scientific
images seen in an art context assume some of the characteristics of
art. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   FEMINISM-TV (Undated) _ Is feminism dead? In shows like ``Ally
McBeal'' and ``Sex and the City'' it may just be. By Karen Durbin.
(moved).
</P>
<P>
   DAVID-KELLEY-TV (Undated) _ Jerry Seinfeld put it as well as
anybody. ``I mean,'' he said of David E. Kelley, ``this guy has
done actual things.'' Kelley may be this decade's dean of the
quality series, but when the Museum of Television and Radio in Los
Angeles honored him and Seinfeld on the same night two months ago,
the speakers seemed to have trouble describing the essence of the
Kelley greatness. Dylan McDermott, of Kelley's ABC law series,
``The Practice,'' used the words ``quirky, idiosyncratic,'' because
somebody had to. Calista Flockhart, of Kelley's Fox law series,
``Ally McBeal,'' went for the sentimental, describing Kelley as one
who ``tells us what it's like to be people.'' By Anita Gates.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-CHU-ART (Paris) _ In the fifth century B.C., Confucius
questioned the practice of burying people alive alongside the dead
in funerary rituals, calling it a waste of human life. But it was
not until 100 years later that the Chu people of Southern China
abandoned human sacrifice, replacing the living in such rituals
with carved and lacquered wooden figures. Chu artists produced
haunting effigies of concubines, slaves, deer and tigers, all
common in the retinues of Chinese rulers during the late Warring
States period (fourth century to third century B.C.) and the Han
Dynasty (206 B.C. to 220 A.D.). A large number of Chu works have
been excavated over the past 20 years, and recently such works have
become more visible in the market. The Chu figures are now both the
subject of scholarly study and are being actively collected by
museums. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

   WASHINGTON _ Mindful as ever of his standing in history,
President Clinton is said by associates to feel devastated about a
scar he now regards as inevitable: impeachment on Saturday by the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, aides and friends of Clinton say,
America's most tested political fighter has steeled himself for the
battle of his life, believing that his opponents are acting out of
partisan hatred, not Constitutional duty.
</P>
<P>
   Friay, his enduring ally, Hillary Rodham Clinton, once more
rallied to his side. Breaking weeks of silence about her husband's
predicament, she issued an appeal ``to end divisiveness'' and
planned a last-minute speech Saturday morning to summon House
Democrats against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to calling upon Mrs. Clinton, the president is
trying to enlist George Mitchell, the former Senate majority
leader, to bolster his defense before the Senate, aides said. At
the White House on Friday, Clinton once again bore down on the
budget priorities and other goals that he believes will sustain his
public support.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goodness, how do you think he is?'' expostulated one
adviser to Clinton on Friday. ``This guy reads history books on
every President. He can cite you details about every president. So
on the one hand he's devastated about what this will do and has
done for his legacy. But on the other hand, he looks at how it's
being done as pure politics.''
</P>
<P>
   And politics is something that the Clintons understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vast majority of Americans share my approval and
pride in the job that the president's been doing for our country,''
Mrs. Clinton said, in an extremely rare response Friday morning to
a reporter's question.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, said that the first
lady was invited by Minority Leader Dick Gephardt to speak on
Saturday because the Democrats ``just want to show their support
for her and the president.''
</P>
<P>
   In her comments Friday morning, Mrs. Clinton made a plea to turn
attention to ``people who need help and support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still, you know, abused and neglected and foster
children that are not getting well taken care of,'' she said.
``There are still people with health care problems who need tending
to.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Mrs. Clinton appealed for unity, elsewhere at the
White House aides took up their cudgels. Anticipating calls for
Clinton's resignation, Joseph Lockhart, the press secretary,
accused Republicans of a ``cynical, political strategy,'' to
downplay impeachment for weeks, and then argue now that it should
prompt Clinton's resignation. He accused the Republicans of ``not
being straight with the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, a more pugnacious and sharper-tongued spokesman than
his predecessor, Mike McCurry, came to his daily briefing Friday
armed with a stack of quotations from Republican congressmen to
illustrate his point.
</P>
<P>
   At his right, Lockhart's deputies sat beneath an advertisement
torn from the newspaper and stuck with silver duct tape to the
wall: ``Forgive or Condemn?'' it read. ``Let him who is without sin
cast the first vote.''
</P>
<P>
   On a crisp, clear wintry day, a sense less of history than of
historic wrong, and of grievance, settled over the White House.
Furious aides ridiculed congressional Republicans as bent on
Clinton's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrong for 11 months,'' said Paul Begala, Clinton's
counselor. ``For 11 months I said this was all about sex, and I was
wrong. It is all about power, and politics, and partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton feels the same way, his associates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He bolsters himself that it's a political war being waged,
that it has nothing to do with the morality of this, that it's the
politics of trying to get rid of Bill Clinton,'' one adviser said.
But, he added, ``He doesn't sit around and wring his hands. He's
more in the position of, `Here's what we have to do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is hoping to bring in a lawyer respected in the Senate,
aides said, declining to name any possible hires. The White House
is negotiating with Mitchell of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Clinton began his day with a briefing about the attack
on Iraq from Sandy Berger, the national security adviser. He also
met one-on-one in his private study in the White House residence
with Rep. Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican who has said
he is wavering on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   For two hours, he then presided over grueling talks _ not about
impeachment, but about trade in bananas and pens _ at a meeting
with European Union representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton held a meeting with aides to discuss a couple of
dozen narrowly targeted tax cuts he might include in his next
budget.
</P>
<P>
   And Friday evening he sat down with his Advisory Council on
HIV/AIDS. Clinton looked tired, though he told aides he had gotten
seven hours of sleep Thursday night. But he joked about how hard it
can be to get legislation passed.
</P>
<P>
   People around Clinton no longer avoid mention of his troubles.
When Bob Hattoy, a longtime aide, arrived late for the meeting, the
president glanced at him and said, ``I'm glad you're here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad you're here,'' Hattoy replied.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Echaveste, the deputy chief of staff, said her colleagues
were rallying around the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people recognize that this is extraordinarily
difficult,'' she said. But that spurred them to work harder, she
said. ``People have a lot of loyalty here,'' she said. ``And they
have a lot of faith in him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Vice President Al Gore's ceremonial office Friday evening,
aides threw a surprise birthday party for Gene Sperling, the
director of the National Economic Council. Gore, Mrs. Clinton,
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and other high-ranking officials
came for what turned into a roast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of you are probably here not so much for Gene's birthday
party as to hit him up for special budget projects,'' needled Mrs.
Clinton, according to one aide who was present. She added, perhaps
for the benefit of another guest, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, ``I have a simple answer to that: What's wrong with
printing more money?''

OLYMPIC COMMITTEE ETHICS PANEL TO BEGIN A BRIBE INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The organizing committee for the 2002 Winter
Olympics on Friday empowered its ethics panel to begin
investigating whether bribes were offered to secure the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking an independent investigation, the organizing committee
said it would allow the five-member ethics panel to bring in
outside attorneys and accounting firms as it determines whether
improper payments, gifts and services were made in an effort to
sway votes of members of the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics panel is to make its report by Feb. 11. The
organizing committee said the report would be made public but did
not say whether the report would contain a detailed explanation of
payments made and the names of people who were paid.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is also conducting an investigation after one of its
senior members, Marc Hodler of Switzerland, charged last weekend
that Salt Lake City and other Olympic cities participated in
vote-buying schemes. Salt Lake City officials have acknowledged
spending $400,000 on scholarships and athletic training for 13
people, including six relatives of IOC members, but have denied
that there was bribery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We acknowledge the seriousness of the matter, and we regret
any and all embarrassment this has caused the city and state of
Utah,'' Robert Garff, chairman of the organizing committee's board
of trustees, said at a news conference. He said that organizers
would do everything possible to ``ensure the Games go forward with
the highest level of integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I can say these kind of incidents should not have
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said it was premature to say whether any Salt Lake
City Olympic official would be fired. One city councilwoman, Deeda
Seed, has called for the resignation of Frank Joklik, the chairman
of the Olympic organizing committee, and of Dave Johnson, senior
vice president of the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   Seed has also characterized the ethics panel investigation as a
``toothless tiger'' because it lacks subpoena power, sufficient
independence and the ability to enforce its own recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers sought to counter such charges Friday by saying that
the ethics panel would be allowed to operate on an unlimited budget
and to employ the necessary outside firms to conduct the bribery
investigation. Organizers said they planned to follow the ethics
panel's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics panel is headed by Gordon Hall, a former chief
justice of the Utah Supreme Court; Patricia Hanna, dean of
humanities at the University of Utah; David Jordan, a former U.S.
attorney; Merrill Norman, an accountant, and Barbara Lockhart, a
former Olympic athlete.

WITH TWO RECEIVERS OUT, GIANTS THINK CREATIVELY FOR KANSAS CITY
GAME 
CHIEFS' MORRIS STAYS INBOUNDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ There has been a clamor for Giants Coach
Jim Fassel to open up the offense and take some unconventional
risks as the season winds down. Giants fans may soon be getting
their wish.
</P>
<P>
   Does a 275-pound split end sound unconventional enough?
</P>
<P>
   Should the 275-pound Howard Cross, the team's starting tight
end, end up split wide as a receiver on Sunday, it will not be an
attempt by Fassel to be unorthodox, however. It will be a move of
desperation brought on by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several days the Giants have lost the wide receivers
David Patten and Joe Jurevicius to knee injuries, and a third
receiver, Chris Calloway, is also hobbled by a knee injury, though
he is expected to play against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel has elevated the rookie Brian Alford, who has not been in
uniform all season, to the fourth receiver sport. Alford also has
practiced this week as the team's third receiver since Calloway has
been resting his knee. But if Calloway suffers a setback or another
wide receiver gets hurt Sunday, the Giants will turn to Cross or
running back Tiki Barber if they want to run their four-receiver
formations.
</P>
<P>
   There is quite a disparity between the two since Cross, who is 6
feet 5 inches, is big for a tight end and built more like an
offensive tackle. Barber is 5 feet 10 inches and 205 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be an important choice since the Giants have used
four receivers more often since Kent Graham took over at
quarterback. Graham, who will start his fourth game this season on
Sunday, likes to throw the ball deep, spreading more receivers in
various parts of the field. The Giants entire two-minute offense _
which yielded the winning touchdown against Denver last weekend _
requires four wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   So Alford will most likely be on the spot. So might Cross if any
of the other receivers falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an emergency plan,'' Fassel said Friday after
practice. ``I don't know that I want to see it under any other
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   In 14 games this season, Cross has caught 13 passes.
</P>
<P>
   The blessing for Giants fans is that they should see Alford in
action for the first time. Alford, a former Big Ten track star who
ranks fourth in the conference in career receiving yards and
touchdowns, has looked impressive in practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   CHIEFS' MORRIS STAYS INBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   When the Chiefs considered signing running back Bam Morris
earlier this season, they passed because his weight had ballooned
to 264 pounds. In October, the Chiefs acquired the former
Pittsburgh Steelers star, who had since lost 16 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Schottenheimer, the Kansas City Coach, said he was not
worried about Morris' previous off-the-field problems, which
included a 90-day jail term on a drug offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met with Bam, I had planned to tell him that if
he crossed the line again he was out of here,'' Schottenheimer
said. ``But I never had to mention it because it was obvious to me
he knew the consequences of his actions and was accountable for
them. If he was to err in his ways, he is being held accountable to
a far more important court than the Kansas City Chiefs, and that's
the judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris said: ``I've made a lot of dumb mistakes in my life, and
it may have taken me a long time to learn from, but I did and I'm
still here. Marty Schottenheimer can count on me because I'm going
to be there.''

16 LOCKED-OUT PLAYERS TAKE TO THE COURT SATURDAY NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ They have been portrayed as self-centered,
greedy and completely out of touch with their once-fawning public.
And that is just the minimum-salary guys.
</P>
<P>
   So Saturday night at the Atlantic City Convention Center, 16
locked-out National Basketball Association players will not only
get to put on shorts and sneakers and dunk again, but they will to
try to quell the backlash and recapture the interest of their
apathetic followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a lesson in this, it's that players are going to
definitely have to relate with the fans again,'' said Dominique
Wilkins, one of 14 current or former NBA all-stars who will play in
the game. ``You look at baseball. Four years after the strike, it
took Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa to generate that kind of interest.
The NBA is also going to have to make a conscious effort to win
back support. You have to be sympathetic to what the average fan is
about.''
</P>
<P>
   When plans for the game were announced earlier this month,
organizers planned to use 90 percent of the proceeds to help
cash-poor players. They later reversed course amid an avalanche of
public criticism. Now they are calling the exhibition at the
Atlantic City Convention Center ``a gift to the fans for the
holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, the game may be a referendum on how the public
perceives the players in their economic fight with the owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially we had other plans, but we came to see that all of
the proceeds should go straight to charity,'' Alonzo Mourning said
at a news conference Friday. ``That would be best for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hardaway added: ``Tomorrow night I'm hopeful that the fans
will come out and give us a standing ovation. It'll be hard to win
the fans back, but people are starving out there to see basketball.
They're going to welcome us back.''
</P>
<P>
   Billed as ``The Game on Showtime,'' the event will be televised
on the cable network at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The game's organizer, Curtis Polk, said more than 8,000 tickets
had already been sold for the game, including blocks of tickets
bought by corporations. If more than 10,000 of the 12,500 seats at
the Convention Center are filled, the game _ announced only 12 days
ago _ would exceed live gate expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one ticket agent was quoted in The Press of Atlantic City
as saying only 574 tickets _ priced at $25, $50, $100, $200, $300
and $500 _ had been sold through his agency as of Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The agent Arn Tellem, who is co-promoting the game with David
Falk, said about $700,000 from the game will be donated to
Philadelphia-based charities. UNICEF and Save the Children have
been designated as the two national charities that will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the first nationally televised game featuring NBA
players since June 16, when Michael Jordan stole Game 6 of the
finals from the Utah Jazz and led the Bulls to their sixth title of
the decade. Jordan, scheduled to play golf with Hale Irwin in the
Lexus Challenge in La Quinta, Calif., Saturday, is not expected to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, the union president, will lead the red team,
along with Tim Hardaway, Shawn Kemp, Dan Majerle, Karl Malone,
Reggie Miller, Mitch Richmond and Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning heads the white team, which includes Tom Gugliotta,
Anfernee Hardaway, Allan Houston, Gary Payton, Glen Rice and Chris
Webber.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As for risk of injury, the promoters have arranged for $20
million in disability insurance for each player.
</P>
<P>
   The game features members of the last four teams selected to
represent the United States in international competition. Charles
Barkley will coach the red team and Oscar Roberston will coach the
white team. It is Showtime's first basketball telecast since the
depressing sight of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar eating up Julius Erving in
a one-on-one game featuring two Hall of Famers several years past
their primes. That game, Feb. 28, 1992, was also in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Though NBA players are competing, a league logo will be hard to
find. Because of copyright infringements, the announcers for the
game cannot use the term ``NBA'' or refer to the players as being
from the ``Knicks'' or the ``Heat,'' also league trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   But it is professionals playing basketball. And until the two
sides can agree on a deal and salvage what is left of the season _
no meetings between the NBA commissioner David Stern and the union
chief Billy Hunter are scheduled for the weekend _ that is
apparently enough for the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miss each other,'' Mourning said. ``Our body clocks are
going off. At this time of year, you need to play basketball
again.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican Party's standing with the public has
dropped significantly, matching its lowest rating in the past 14
years, as the House moves toward a vote on impeaching President
Clinton, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   While impeachment by the House now appears all but inevitable,
half the public still expects some other outcome, suggesting at
least the possibility of further erosion in the Republican party's
image when the reality of the second impeachment in American
history sinks in.
</P>
<P>
   Six in 10 Americans said Republicans in Congress were out of
touch with the public's wishes on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The public's opposition to impeachment _ 62 percent said they
wanted their representative to vote against it _ is reflected in
every sector of society: every region, every age group, every
income group, with the exception of self-described Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs that public opinion could prove treacherous for
Clinton in the weeks ahead: About four in 10 Americans believe that
if the House sends articles of impeachment to the Senate for trial,
it would be better for the country for Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in many ways, the poll found remarkable stability in
public opinion across a year of turmoil and scandal. The public
continues to distinguish between the man and the president: as in
January when the Monica Lewinsky scandal was first disclosed,
Americans are critical of his personal character and give him high
marks for his performance in office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's job approval rating stands in sharp contrast to that
of President Richard M. Nixon after the House Judiciary Committee
recomended his impeachment: 65 percent approved of Clinton's job
performance this week, while only 24 percent held that view of
Nixon just before his resignation in 1974, as the House moved
toward an impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was based on telephone interviews conducted
nationwide with 1,666 adults on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, and
another 326 on Thursday, after Clinton ordered the bombing of Iraq.
The margin of sampling error for the entire poll is plus or minus
two percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that, at least in this snapshot of public
opinion, Republicans have paid a heavy price for their aggressive
pursuit of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of Americans who held a favorable view of the
party _ 40 percent _ was at its lowest level in the 14 years that
the New York Times/CBS News Poll has been asking the question,
statistically matching the level of 43 percent recorded in early
1996 after a budget impasse resulted in a partial shutdown of the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In October, before the 1998 midterm elections, public opinion of
the Republican Party was evenly split, 45 percent favorable and 46
percent unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
   The party's image worsened as the week progressed: 42 percent of
respondents had a favorable opinion of the Republicans early in the
week; that dropped to 33 percent among people polled on Thursday,
as the reality of impeachment set in among the public and
Washington grappled with the remarkable confluence of crises at
home and abroad. The margin of sampling error for the one-night
finding was plus or minus 6 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the number of people holding a favorable view of
the Democratic party held steady over the week at 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By a ratio of more than two-to-one, Americans said the
impeachment vote should have been postponed while the United States
is engaged in military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed that, by a ratio of two-to-one, Americans
believe that the timing of the airstrikes against Iraq had more to
do with the need to respond quickly to Saddam Hussein's defiance of
U.N. weapons inspectors than with any effort by Clinton to divert
attention from impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, designed to measure day-to-day shifts in public
opinion during this climactic week, found that the public was only
just beginning to recognize that the House was on the verge of
impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 31 percent of those responding said they expected the
House to impeach the president, with 50 percent predicting that the
matter would be resolved through a compromise such as censure.
</P>
<P>
   By the eve of the expected impeachment, only half of Americans
expected it to actually occur; the rest still foresaw some lesser
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The public did, however, want to see some punishment for the
president. Fifty-four percent said Congress should censure Clinton
for what he has done, an option that the Republican leaders have
consistently refused to permit.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the opposition to impeachment was that even
Republicans were divided over it, with 76 percent of self-described
conservative Republicans favoring, while all other Republicans were
split, with 49 percent in favor and 41 percent opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Other polls have shown higher support for the president to
resign, if, in fact, he is impeached by the House. But because a
minority of the public still confuses impeachment by the House with
removal by the Senate, the Times/CBS News Poll pointed out the
difference as part of the resignation question: ``If the full House
votes to send impeachment articles to the Senate for a trial, then
do you think it would be better for the country if Bill Clinton
resigned from office, or not?'' Forty-three percent said better, 53
percent disagreed.

UNDECIDED LAWMAKERS GRAPPLE WITH IMPEACHMENT DECISION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as the historic debate on whether to impeach
President Clinton began Friday, a handful of undeclared lawmakers
were agonizing over what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Some were still reviewing reams of documents on the Monica
Lewinsky affair and looking to both the criminal code and the Bible
for guidance as their colleagues began framing the issue of whether
Clinton should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   But by the close of the 12 hours of debate, most had made up
their minds even if they chose not to take the floor to announce
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, who issued a
statement saying that he would vote for articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is one of the most somber days I have known since coming
to Congress 20 years ago,'' Stenholm said, adding that ``it doesn't
get much worse'' than voting to impeach the president at the same
time U.S. forces are engaged in conflict in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Stenholm said Clinton had lied ``to protect himself
at the expense of others,'' leaving ``an indelible mark on the
presidency of the United States,'' and he must be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who have the honor of holding public office should
hold ourselves to a higher standard,'' Stenholm said.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to support articles of impeachment was not
unexpected. But Democratic leaders had held out hope that he might
stand with them against what they view as highly partisan movement
to drive the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   The Abilene congressman acknowledged that he was ``troubled'' by
some Republicans, whom he described as uninterested in ``fairness
and objectivity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been motivated by political blood lust,'' he
observed. But in the end, he said the facts of the case were clear:
``Our president has admitted to wrongdoing. ... Lying under oath
and repeated disregard for decency by our nation's top elected
official is a serious offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Those facts were not as clear to other undecided or undeclared
members who looked to the Constitution to justify their opposition
to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Rep. Solomon P. Ortiz, D-Texas, acknowledged that
Clinton's ``behavior and the lie'' about it ``was immoral.'' But he
cautioned members not to set a ``dangerous constitutional precedent
in a partisan setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Grand jurors in our judicial system today have to exercise
good judgment about stopping a bad case when the evidence is not
there to fortify it legally,'' he said. ``In our role today we have
the added weight of exercising good constitutional, democratic and
political common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton certainly injured the national trust ... but
he has not injured the Constitution, our democracy, our government,
or any political movement in our country,'' Ortiz added.
</P>
<P>
   At least four moderate Republicans, including Amo Houghton and
Peter King of New York, who came out against impeachment echoed
that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe that that for a president of the United
States ... to be impeached, for an election to be undone, there
must be a direct abuse of presidential power,'' King said during
the debate.
</P>
<P>
   He admonished his Republican colleagues for their partisan
attacks on Clinton and setting a standard that he said would make
the government ``subject to the whims of independent counsels'' and
``the frenzied politics of the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   For two other Republicans who had been undecided the decision to
vote for impeachment came down to whether Clinton had violated the
``the rule of law'' that governs all Americans. Reps. Frank Riggs
of California and Heather Wilson of New Mexico said that to let
Clinton off the hook would show contempt for average citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice is blind so that every citizen will be treated equally
under the law,'' said Wilson, who announced that she would vote to
impeach because she could not ``turn from the truth and the
evidence that supports it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stenholm and other undecideds spent most of the day holed up in
their offices reviewing the House Judiciary Committee's
recommendation that Clinton be impeached or seeking the advice of
friends and constituents.
</P>
<P>
   A few members sought refuge on the crowded streets of the
nation's capital where they mingled for a time with government
workers and Christmas shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Some members ordered up historical information from the Library
of Congress on the 1868 impeachment of President Andrew Johnson and
parts of the criminal code dealing with perjury and obstruction of
justice. Others looked to the Bible for help.
</P>
<P>
   Stenholm chose ``all of the above'' to help him decide, said
spokeswoman Julie Turner. ``And one other thing ... He listened to
his constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other members of Congress, Stenholm's office had been
inundated with phone calls. Turner said the calls, emails and
letters _ hundreds each day _ from the predominantly Republican
17th District were running about 50/50 for and against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He considered everything. He went over every aspect of the
case. ... That's why his decision was so slow in coming,'' Turner
said.
</P>
<P>
   A few members took even longer.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., who called himself ``one of the last
few holdouts,'' still had not revealed how he planned to vote by
late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood was spotted earlier in the day pausing for a moment
near a small nativity scene set up on the steps of the Capitol by
Rita Warren, whose business card identifies her as a ``prayer
specialist.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Greenwood sought out Warren's advice.

PANICS ALWAYS START IN LEFT FIELD  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)  (af) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think back to late summer and early fall. Financial panic seemed
the order of the day. On top of the Asian troubles came the Russian
meltdown, and as investors fled these and other developing regions,
lending dried up or pulled back everywhere. Even the United States
seemed in danger of tumbling into recession.
</P>
<P>
   All that is history now. Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   The American economy is perking along energetically, shrugging
off the Iraqi bombing and the impeachment proceedings. The year-end
forecasts from many quarters are for continued good times, or at
least not frightening times. East Asia and Russia are unlikely to
produce new episodes of financial panic. How can they? The big
investors there have either yanked their money or lost it.
</P>
<P>
   There is no longer the wherewithal in these regions for another
round of capital flight, another round of plunging currencies and
another round of economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But the financial system that gave rise to the East Asian and
Russian crises is still in place, and trouble could erupt elsewhere
_ suddenly, unexpectedly _ setting off a fresh round of financial
panic, with its aftermath of painful recessions. ``Potential
trouble is not easily calculable,'' said Paul Volcker, the former
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. ``When it happens, it tends
to be off the charts.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over what lies ahead has settled into two channels _
one traditional, the other haunting. The attention these days is
focused mainly on the traditionalists, who concern themselves with
standard economic forces.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus view, or at least the most common view among them,
is that the American economy will slow next year as consumers pull
back on both their extraordinary spending and their extraordinary
borrowing to finance their spending. But almost no forecaster
foresees a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Falling prices for many goods and a very low inflation rate are
squeezing corporate profits, they note. That can hurt the stock
market. But with the economy holding up so well, nervousness that
stock prices might really plunge has faded along with alarm about
the Asian and Russian crises.
</P>
<P>
   True, stocks may not go higher, said James Glassman, a senior
economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. They may even fall some. But
``we don't think there is a bubble propping up the stock market,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, there is faith that the Federal Reserve has the
leverage to give the economy enough stimulus, through lower
interest rates, to counteract any blow from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst may well be over for a battered and bruised global
economy,'' wrote Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, in his latest forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Roach anticipates rising economic growth around the globe by
2000 _ even in East Asia, now mired in recession. One stimulus, he
says, is the $160 billion in loans and loan commitments that the
International Monetary Fund has disbursed in rescue packages.
</P>
<P>
   All this is rather traditional forecasting. At a less audible
level, there are some haunting caveats from the less sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   The worriers acknowledge that Asia, Russia, Brazil and Japan are
not likely to prompt the next financial panic: Those countries'
problems, while acute, are known and are being dealt with, more or
less. And investors here and abroad, scared by Asia and Russia,
have been paying down debt.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how much debt has been reduced, but it is
likely that when the next panic comes, there will be fewer
borrowers in danger of default or forced into hasty actions that
make matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   Panics, though, are responses not to known dangers but to events
no one thought would happen. No one is, for example, anticipating
that Argentina will default on foreign debts or devalue a currency
that is pegged by law to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is anyone expecting a rude shock to come from right here
in the United States, said Albert Wojnilower, an economist at the
Clipper Group, a Wall Street firm.
</P>
<P>
   But it could. Business debt in the United States, rising for
several years, jumped sharply in the third quarter, to $522
billion, the Federal Reserve reported recently. That is equivalent
to about 6.5 percent of the gross domestic product, a very high
level of business debt.
</P>
<P>
   What if an indebted multinational, its profits squeezed by
falling prices, found itself unable to keep up the payments on its
loans? Wojnilower wondered. That picture is conceivable, but in
today's rosy economic climate, it is certainly unanticipated. Of
such surprises are financial panics made.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous lenders would pull back again. In a global market where
money flows freely everywhere, the blow to America would spread.
Short-term loans might be called in from potentially shaky emerging
markets. And a debate that has faded in recent months _ how to
regulate capital flows and how to make the IMF a more effective
agency _ would once again take center stage.

   Brenda J. Gondron didn't want to go. Neither did her husband.
And her employer wishes desperately that she were still at her
desk. But federal rules said there was no choice: She had to take a
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gondron is a vice president at Texas First Bank. A
little-known anti-embezzlement rule requires bank employees in
sensitive positions to be away from their desks and duties for two
consecutive weeks every year. The idea is to give any hanky-panky
they might be up to a chance to come to light while they are away.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gondron has been working overtime for months on the bank's
new computer system, and having her absent now is a real hardship,
said Matthew T. Doyle, the bank's chief executive, but no matter:
Off she had to go. And banks across the country are in the same
situation, chasing some of their most diligent workers out the door
to comply before the year ends.
</P>
<P>
   The decades-old vacation rule _ embodied in a supervisory
guidance letter from the Federal Reserve and echoed in many state
regulations _ had fallen into disuse, but was revived after several
blockbuster scandals in recent years, most notably the case of
Toshihide Iguchi, a workaholic bond trader at Daiwa Bank who
embezzled (and lost) $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The classic profile of bank defalcators is that they don't
break for lunch, much less take vacations,'' said Ellen C. Lamb of
the Conference of State Banking Supervisors.

</P>
<P>
   Out of La Crosse, Wis., comes a new product with truly dangerous
implications: The executive napping kit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give the gift of sleeping on the job,'' says the announcement
from the Company Store, a division of Hanover Direct, a
specialty-catalog marketer, about an item it hopes will be ``most
welcome and practical'' in ``a sleep-deprived America.''
</P>
<P>
   The $89.99 kit consists of a foldable goose down-filled
``productivity pillow'' with pillow case and a copy of a book
called ``The Art of Napping,'' packaged in a monogrammable fabric
tote bag with shoulder strap that looks vaguely like a briefcase,
``for discreet carrying.''
</P>
<P>
   But the company seems to hope you won't need the camouflage. The
product announcement is full of quotations from academic sleep
experts and business trend watchers about the wondrous benefits of
a workday snooze and ``progressive nap policies'' at corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying book, written by a Boston University professor,
calls for mass protests in favor of sanctioned napping at work. The
battle cry: ``It's time for nappers to lie down and be counted.'' &QL;

SHAREHOLDER MAKES OFFER ON WHITTAKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- A shareholder of Whittaker Corp. on
Friday said he has made an unsolicited bid to buy the aerospace
parts company.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles investment banker Michael Tennenbaum, who holds
about 5 percent of Whittaker's stock, is offering to buy the
company for a reported $18.50 a share -- a $208 million total
value. Tennenbaum would not confirm the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   If successful in his bid, Tennenbaum said he expects to take
Whittaker private. He said he wants to keep Whittaker's management
in place, as partners.
</P>
<P>
   On news of the bid, Whittaker opened higher in trading Friday.
It touched a 52-week high of $16.625 during trading hours and
closed at $16.50, up $3.4375. Trading volume was 247,100 shares,
eight times the six-month daily average.
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker, which has rebounded from two fiscal years of losses,
had mentioned that it would entertain merger or acquisition offers.
</P>
<P>
   But company Chief Executive Officer Joseph Alibrandi said
Tennenbaum's offer was too low and it included a host of other
conditions such as an exclusivity period and breakup fees that
Whittaker didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   Alibrandi said offers for the company should start at more than
$20 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the company put together a ``poison pill''
shareholder rights plan to discourage hostile takeovers. The plan
would dilute severely the shares once an investor acquires 25
percent or more of the company, forcing him or her to negotiate
with the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make sure the shareholders get the best possible
price,'' Alibrandi said. ``It in no way precludes the company being
acquired.''
</P>
<P>
   Key ingredients to a successful bid are a good price and a buyer
that would help Whittaker thrive, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker is exploring a merger or acquisition -- whether it's
the seller or the buyer -- to achieve greater business muscle to
better grow the company.
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker has been on a rebound since Alibrandi came back. He
was called out of retirement in 1996 to rescue Whittaker from an
unprofitable attempt to diversify, said Brett Hendrickson, an
analyst at B. Riley &AMP; Co. in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After Alibrandi left Whittaker in 1994 to retire, his successor
diversified into network communications by first buying Hughes' LAN
Systems and afterward Xyplex, a network access company.
</P>
<P>
   Straying away from its core business of selling aerospace parts,
Whittaker piled on debt and bled red ink. In 1996, total debt stood
at $168 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company's directors called back Alibrandi, who was building
his house in Malibu and getting involved in improving education in
California.
</P>
<P>
   He shut down the Hughes unit, except for a small operation that
served existing contracts, which was later sold when contract
obligations were met. Alibrandi sold Xyplex to Chatsworth,
Calif.-based MRV Communications and disposed of Whittaker's defense
electronics business.
</P>
<P>
   The gain from the sales: $53 million. By improving business,
Whittaker was able to pay down debt, which now stands at $60
million.
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year ended October 1998, Whittaker made money for
the first time in two years: Profits were $48.5 million (or $3.98 a
share) on revenues of $131.5 million, compared with a loss of
$163.6 million ($14.68) on sales of $89.8 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the company back on track, Alibrandi will stay to guide it
for now. But once a merger or acquisition occurs, he said he might
reconsider his options. Beckoning to the 70-year-old is
California's schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a strong interest in education,'' he said.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Dec. 19:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's gray smoke _ actually it's gray tilting toward
white,'' Gov. George Pataki quipped during a break in negotiations
over New York state's charter-school legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Likening his backroom talks with legislative leaders to the
secretive manner used by the College of Cardinals to select a new
pope was distressingly apt. The governor pushed through legislation
empowering nonprofit groups to open taxpayer-financed charter
schools without a single round of hearings or the debate it
deserved.
</P>
<P>
   New York will now join more than 30 states with charter-school
statutes, and Pataki will have a policy that appeals to
conservatives should he choose to run in Republican presidential
primaries in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the Legislature's hasty approval of the
charter-school measure on Friday, the governor will sign a bill
giving legislators a 38 percent pay raise, their first since 1989.
Salaries of the governor, his cabinet and most judges will also
rise.
</P>
<P>
   The school measure embraced by the governor, Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver and Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader,
authorizes the creation of up to 100 charter schools. As many as 50
of those charters would be issued by the State University of New
York and the rest would be awarded by the State Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cap on the number of public schools that could
convert into charter schools. But such conversions would require
the approval of the regents, parents and the local school board.
That lever would give superintendents like New York City Schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew a role in shaping some charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and Silver each made a major concession. Pataki
dropped his call for a charter school commission and recognized the
oversight responsibilities of the regents, a safeguard sought by
the speaker. Silver agreed that 10 charter schools regardless of
size and those with fewer than 250 students will fall outside the
jurisdiction of the teachers unions in the first year of operation,
a plank sought by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative package also allows New York's dairy farmers to
join the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, a longstanding item on
Pataki's wish list. Environmentalists and natural-food advocates
support the compact as a way to help save small farmers. But
consumer groups, rightly in our view, see it as a hidden milk tax
on consumers that would hit poor families the hardest.

WASHINGTON PARK RANGERS WILL GET GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By THOMAS SHAPLEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. _ Washington park rangers will soon be armed for
the first time in the park system's 85-year history, the state
Parks and Recreation Commission decided Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the unanimous vote, commissioner Robert Petersen said he
had at first strongly opposed issuing sidearms to park rangers as a
response to growing crime and safety concerns, ``but I have had to
face the fact that the world has changed. We have to change, too. I
can see problems but I don't think there's any half-way ground
here. We have to bite the bullet and say `let's do it and let's do
it all the way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Going all the way meant arming all rangers, rather than arming
rangers in selected areas or increased staffing with unarmed
rangers.
</P>
<P>
   While the commission vote was ultimately unanimous, support for
the proposal is apparently less than unanimous among park users,
the general public and even park rangers.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Washington State University survey of park users
and the general public, there was a nearly equal split between
those favoring and opposing armed park rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The park rangers themselves are divided, according to a survey
by the Washington State Center for Information Services. When asked
what was ``the best option for your safety,'' 62 percent of those
responding chose the option of arming them all. Sixty-nine percent
said they'd had at least one incident in the past two years in
which they feared for their safety because they didn't have a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the state Parks and Recreation Department
recommended the action. They said many of the state's 250 park
rangers work alone at night in remote areas, where backup from
police or sheriff's deputies is 30 minutes away. In 1995, 27
rangers were involved in physical tussles with park visitors. Only
one ranger was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Park rangers in Washington and 34 other states have full law
enforcement authority, but only Washington and Michigan don't
authorize rangers to carry firearms. Washington rangers now carry
handcuffs, pepper spray and batons. They also are issued body
armor.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal calls for firearms to be issued only to rangers who
``meet established law enforcement standards ... psychological and
enhanced background checks, and agency fitness standards and who
choose to go through firarms trasition training.'' For those who
are unable to meet those standards or who choose not to carry a
firearm, ``staff will redefine work activities.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time since Feb. 24, 1868, three years
after the United States emerged from an awful Civil War, the House
of Representatives debated the impeachment of a president Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It scheduled for Saturday votes on four articles of impeachment
``for high crimes and misdemeanors'' against William Jefferson
Clinton. Although Democrats protested bitterly and ardently, they
acknowledged that passage of at least one of them, and a Senate
trial next year that could result in the president's removal from
office, had become inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a Democrat who was badly beaten
during the civil-rights demonstrations in the South during the
1960s, stilled the sometimes fractious House when he advised his
colleagues, ``The spirit of history is upon us and the fate of the
Republic before us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a grave and momentous day. For many, it was a grim day,
without joy or satisfaction. Some of the participants said they
were troubled that Congress seemed out of sync with the American
people. Others ``hated to get out of bed this morning,'' as Rep.
Tom Davis of Virginia put it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the 74-year-old chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee, sounded the Republican theme in his
opening statement, asserting that ``no man or woman, no matter how
highly placed, no matter how effective a communicator, no matter
how gifted a manipulator of opinion or winner of votes, can be
above the law in a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip in the House,
called impeachment ``a runaway train headed for a cliff.'' Rep.
Robert Wexler of Florida, another Democrat, raised the ugly specter
of McCarthyism and demanded of the Republican majority, in a
distinct echo of the Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954, ``Have we no
sense of decency?''
</P>
<P>
   The debate, sharply partisan like all the others in recent
months, lasted through the day and into the evening. It took place
as British and American warplanes rained bombs upon Iraq for the
third day running, and as Hillary Rodham Clinton offered a rare
public defense of her husband time since he admitted to having had
a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It came, too, in a coincidental conjunction that would have
delighted Kafka, at the very height of the holiday season, with
festive parties scheduled every night at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of Americans share my approval and pride in
the job the president has been doing for our country,'' Mrs.
Clinton said on the White House lawn, with the dome of the Capitol,
where the impeachment debate was under way, looming behind her.
</P>
<P>
   She planned to go up to the Hill to speak to the Democratic
caucus Saturday morning. White House aides said Clinton would
address the nation after the impeachment votes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Louise Slaughter, a Democrat from upstate New York, urged
Clinton to think about resignation if he is impeached. She said
that ``his usefulness would be lost in dealing with other
nations.'' Rep. William Lipinski of Illinois, another Democrat,
spoke in the same vein.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, replied that the
president would ``absolutely not'' consider resigning, and he
launched a fresh attack on the Republicans on Capitol Hill,
accusing them of scheming to drive Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself spent the day focused on Iraq and the
international economy and in meetings with several foreign leaders,
including Chancellor Viktor Klima of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that the president had committed
``reprehensible'' acts and made ``deceitful'' statements to cover
them up, Democratic members of the House argued that his actions
did not come close to warranting impeachment, that they should be
given an opportunity to vote on censure as an alternative to
impeachment _ an option the majority has denied them _ and that the
debate should not be taking place in any case during military
action in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president did was wrong,'' said Rep. John Dingell of
Michigan, the dean of the House, who has represented a district
near Detroit since 1955, in direct succession to his father, also
John Dingell, who had represented it since 1932. ``What we are
doing is equally wrong _ an exercise in the abuse of power by the
majority over the minority.''
</P>
<P>
   The House's only independent member, Rep. Bernard Sanders of
Vermont, decried the prospect of a vote ``perhaps to paralyze our
government as the Senate explores Bill Clinton's extramarital
relations.'' He said that he had realized as never before ``just
how out of touch this institution is with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans pressed resolutely forward with their accusations
that Clinton had committed perjury, had obstructed justice and had
abused his powers as president, all to conceal the truth about the
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dramatic and possibly telling interventions came
from Rep. Tom Campbell of California, a moderate Republican often
criticized in his district for being insufficiently conservative.
He said in a soft voice that he could never trust Clinton again _
indeed that he had been persuaded that the bombing campaign was
legitimate only when Pentagon officials said it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is in his interest not to tell the truth,'' the
Californian said in a blunt indictment of Clinton, ``he will not
tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's flawless legal pedigree _ son of a federal judge,
star student at the Harvard Law School, clerk to a Supreme Court
justice, former professor at Stanford Law School _ lent weight to
his words.
</P>
<P>
   Another California Republican, Rep. Frank Riggs, one of 41
departing members who will cast the last votes of their
congressional careers Saturday, said he had talked on Wednesday to
two prominent Republicans, former President Gerald Ford and former
Sen. Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee. Both, he
reported, said that they would have voted to impeach.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ray LaHood, who comes from the quintessentially Middle
American city of Peoria, Ill., presided over the protracted debate,
in which dozens of members participated. He urged decorum as
speeches began at 9:29 a.m., Eastern time, but he had difficulty
maintaining it, repeatedly pounding his gavel for order.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde made a not entirely successful attempt to lend a sense of
patriotic majesty to the occasion. He cited not only Roman law, the
Magna Carta and the Constitutional Congress but also the Civil War,
and the battles of Bunker Hill and Lexington and Concord.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the debate was more a series of political set
pieces rather than a clash of oratorical titans in the mold of Clay
or Webster.
</P>
<P>
   A low buzz hovered over the House chamber for most of the day,
fed by whispered chats among members, ad hoc conferences, the
rustle of turning newspaper pages and speeches practiced in stage
whispers. A few times, hissing and hooting was heard.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats bemoaned the lack of civility characterizing the
entire process that has brought the president and the nation to the
current moment of crisis. Applause greeted a demand by Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, for an end to ``the
politics of slash and burn.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning, the public galleries were packed and almost
all the House's 435 members were in their brown leather seats. But
by midday, the chamber itself was half empty, as if all the drama
had been wrung out of the debate as soon as it started. By late
afternoon, only 38 members were there, though there were still
lines of people waiting for gallery seats.
</P>
<P>
   In backstairs conferences Friday morning, the two sides reached
an agreement on the length and of the debate and other rules,
avoiding a series of noisy public procedural squabbles that both
decided they did not want.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans moderated their rhetoric a bit, softening the
prosecutorial tone they adopted in the Judiciary Committee's
proceedings. But the Democrats' fury showed through.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers of Michigan said that he was witnessing ``a
Republican coup d'etat,'' and the same phrase was used by his party
colleagues, Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York and Rep. Maxine Waters
of California. At another point, in a more analytical mood, Conyers
stated one of the central Democratic contentions: ``Impeachment was
designed to rid this nation of traitors and tyrants, not attempts
to cover up an extramarital affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rep. Ike Skelton, D.-Mo., said the Republicans wanted to
``decapitate their commander in chief.'' Rep. Steven Rothman,
D.-N.J., complained of a ``Republican juggernaut, driven by the
right wing.'' Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D.-R.I., a nephew of the late
John F. Kennedy, spoke of ``a political lynching,'' and Rep. Danny
K. Davis of Illinois denounced what he described as ``a lynching.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D.-Ill., son of the civil rights leader,
said impeachment constituted an attack not only on Clinton but also
on the accomplishments of the New Deal, the Fair Deal and the Great
Society. African-Americans, who benefited hugely from all of those
programs, have been among the president's staunchest backers from
the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1868,'' Jackson said, referring to the impeachment of
President Andrew Johnson, ``it was about Reconstruction. In 1998,
it's still about Reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   There were repeated references to the Johnson impeachment, which
was voted upon in the same House chamber where the debate took
place Friday, and to the Watergate case in 1974. Articles of
impeachment never reached the full House on that occasion, because
Richard M. Nixon concluded that his conviction in the Senate was
certain and resigned the presidency to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my colleagues,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio of California, a
Democrat who is retiring, ``obsess about Slick Willie in the same
way that those on my side of aisle used to about Tricky Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   But the continuing air assault on Iraq came up even more often.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggested that the Democrats saw a political opening in the
Republicans' decision to stage the debate while the bombs were
still falling. But some seemed genuinely offended; their views were
crystallized on Thursday night by Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y.,
who served in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't separate the president from the
commander-in-chief,'' he said. ``You can't salute him in the
morning and impeach him in the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, Rep. Sam Johnson of Texas, a former pilot
who languished for seven years in a North Vietnamese
prisoner-of-war camp, made this retort: ``Our military fighting men
want the Congress to carry on our responsibilities every day.''
</P>
<P>
   A potentially volatile ingredient was injected into the
political equation by the confession of marital infidelity Rep. Bob
Livingston of Louisiana, the Speaker-elect, made on Thursday
evening. But there were only a few heavily veiled allusions to his
difficulties during the debate, all from the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the item under debate Friday was called House
Resolution 611.
</P>
<P>
   As read out Friday morning in a somber voice by the House
reading clerk, Paul Hays, it began, ``Resolved, that William
Jefferson Clinton, president of the United States, is impeached for
high crimes and misdemeanors,'' and went on to accuse Clinton of
perjury before a grand jury and in the Paula Jones lawsuit, of
obstructing justice in a variety of ways, and of abusing his power
by lying to and misleading Congress in his answers to 81 questions
posed by the House Judiciary Committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD _ High above a house that has been gutted by one of the
most feared weapons known to modern warfare, four figures gestured
towards the pink sunset Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   In a tower of the neighborhood mosque, in the Al Adel section of
Baghdad, they looked for a crescent moon to deliver salvation an
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   After all, air war or not, this is the custom as the Muslim holy
period of Ramadan approaches. According to tradition, when a
follower finds the first sliver of the new moon, the month of
fasting and piety begins.
</P>
<P>
   So, in addition to the distant rumble of missile explosions and
the popping of anti-aircraft guns that occasionally sounded over
Baghdad Friday, there was a series of cannon blasts to officially
announce the beginning of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   In most years, that would mean that following morning would
start the month of daytime fasting to mark when the prophet
Mohammed received the Koran from God. This year, it could mean
relief from nightly missile attacks from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton has said he resorted to air strikes
to set back Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's ability to build
weapons of mass destruction, but he wanted to avoid attacking
during Ramadan for fear of offending the world's more than 1
billion Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Friday, Pentagon officials would not say whether
the start of Ramadan will indeed bring an end to the air strikes by
U.S. and British forces.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqis, anyway, do not believe that the holy period figures into
American decision making. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
called such claims ``an insult to Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   Any Muslim can report the sighting of the new moon, which must
be done in the minutes after sundown and witnessed. The sighting is
then certified by religious authorities here and in Saudi Arabia.
The men in Baghdad's Al Adel mosque did not see the moon Friday,
perhaps obscured by clouds. But other Iraqis did, as did Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the appearance of the new moon served to emphasize
the religious filter through which any action in the Middle East is
viewed, especially war. For centuries, even the most bitter enemies
have ceased fire for Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   There is an irony in that Iraq is a highly secular nation
compared to most other Arab countries. Alcohol is sold openly, and
women can wear Western styles of clothing. Saddam has a history of
especially tough repression of religious Muslims, though several
years ago he added the words, ``Allah is Great,'' to the Iraqi
flag.
</P>
<P>
   Many Muslims opposed Saddam in his past aggressions, including
attacks on fellow Muslims in Kuwait and Iran. But to many Iraqis,
encouraged by officials seeking to drive a wedge between the United
States and Arab countries, the missiles falling on Iraq have
nothing to do with United Nations weapons inspections. They are an
attempt by the Americans to wipe out the Arabs and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Ramadan will come and God will pour his anger on these
aggressors,'' said 30-year-old auto parts salesman Abdel Hakeem,
after descending the dark spiral staircase in the minaret at the
Taqwa'a mosque -- roughly translated as ``the mosque of those who
fear God.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his friends say Clinton is a modern crusader bent on
conquering and persecuting Muslims as European crusaders did in the
11th Century.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam, on the other hand, they say, leads the Arab effort to
destroy Jews and that is why Clinton opposes him.
</P>
<P>
   It was a theme also sounded by Deputy Prime Minister Aziz in a
press conference Friday, repeatedly saying Clinton is backed by a
``Zionist clique'' out to make war on Muslims.

BILLS' MOULDS SYMBOLIZES HIS TEAM'S SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ In sneakers, sweats, jackets and caps, the
Buffalo Bills offensive players flowed in slow, choreographed
motion in their day-before-the-game walk-through of plays. It is
normal to walk before you run. The Bills were inside their indoor
practice facility next to Rich Stadium on this cold day outside and
chilly one inside the building, where heaters were set _ if at all
_ at the minimum.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Buffalo offensive walk-through before a hoped-for
run-through of the Jets defense. The battle for first place in the
American Football Conference East here on Saturday was near, and
these players could sense it. Feel it.
</P>
<P>
   When the walk-through was over, the offensive players huddled
around coach Wade Phillips. Something not audible, but full of
spirit, was chanted before the players broke for the doors. It was
more like a sprint. And emerging from the wad of players to head
the pack was receiver Eric Moulds.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting, really.
</P>
<P>
   Moulds has blindsided the league this season, just as the Bills
have. Three seasons ago he was a first-round pick, the 24th
selection overall in the draft, and for the last two seasons in
Buffalo he remained obscure while returning kickoffs. In the last
two seasons, the Bills were 10-6 and 6-10. After those Super Bowl
runs from 1990 through 1993, they looked awfully obscure. Buffalo
started this season by going 0-3, and Moulds began this year
looking like any other receiver.
</P>
<P>
   But then Moulds emerged. And so have the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, for Buffalo, Doug Flutie arrived at quarterback and
presented magical moments. The Buffalo offensive line coalesced and
the defense, led by Bruce Smith, began smashing offenses. Phillips
and his coaching staff maintained a steady hand through tough
times, and now Buffalo (9-5) faces the Jets on Saturday and New
Orleans next Sunday. The Bills can clinch a playoff berth if they
beat the Jets; in fact, they would move a step closer to wining the
AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie and the offensive line, the Smith-led defense and the
coaching are all factors in the Bills' success. But there is no
missing Moulds and his contribution. His teammates say he is a
strong leader. They say he is the best athlete on a team full of
splendid ones _ old and new _ who have aged and matured into the
essence of team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob Johnson and Doug Flutie told me that way back in training
camp and others have, too,'' Moulds said, shying from the anointed
title of best anything. ``I know I'm more confident now. I know we
all are. We see this game against the Jets as big as far as where
we want to go. We think the Jets can't beat us. We are taking the
approach that we can only beat ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say there is no `I' in team, but this is the way I see
it,'' he added. ``An offensive lineman can't run a pass route and
catch the ball for me. I can't line up at center and block the
defensive line. I think you have to do your thing. You have to take
care of the `I.' And then, when everyone does that, it works
together to form the team. That's the way we'll have to play to
beat the Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the way Moulds leaped from obscurity to the Pro Bowl. The
25-year-old from Lucedale, Miss., and Mississippi State has a
team-best 61 catches this season. He has 1,171 receiving yards,
already the fourth-best in Bills history, with two games remaining.
Another 141 receiving yards and he will surpass Andre Reed (1,312
in 1989) for the most receiving yards in a season for Buffalo.
Moulds averages 19.2 yards per catch, and he has eight touchdown
catches. He averages nearly 47 yards per score.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A deep threat. A big, physical receiver who catches the ball
underneath and crosses the middle without fear. He blocks well and
causes big problems for defenses.
</P>
<P>
   He is 6 feet 2 inches and weighed 215 pounds last year. Now he
weighs 200. That weight loss has made him both quicker and faster,
but he said he remains strong. He is tougher mentally.
</P>
<P>
   His first two Bills offensive coordinators were comfortable with
him sitting and watching _ in two seasons, Moulds caught 49 passes
for 573 yards and two touchdowns. Joe Pendry took over as the Bills
offensive coordinator this season and told Moulds he could start.
The Bills receivers coach, Charlie Joiner, a Hall of Fame receiver,
told Moulds the same thing and showed him how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw others drafted with me _ Keyshawn Johnson, Terry Glenn,
Marvin Harrison and some others _ all performing right away, and I
wanted that to be me,'' Moulds said. ``I trained hard in the
off-season. I ate right and trained on the track and lost the extra
weight. I put in some long hours. Now I can run by people as well
as run over them. I have more endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   He and the Bills have more of almost everything. More attention.
More respect. More anticipation on what they will show against the
Jets on Saturday. Their fans now enjoy the fanciful idea that their
team can stride from 0-3 to divisional champs. And reach further.
</P>
<P>
   Beating the Jets on Saturday is a critical step in that process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big change for me, what's happening now, the fact that
people now are beginning to know my name,'' Moulds said. ``I don't
think I'm a great player. Great players are made when you win the
Super Bowl. Andre Reed and Thurman Thomas and Bruce, they talk
about that sometimes, about how close they have been on four tries
and how they want to finish it by winning it all. Being Super Bowl
champions would define me and our team best of all.''

HACKETT GETS TROJANS REFOCUSED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As USC's football team returned to practice Friday
for the first time in six days, coach Paul Hackett admitted that
the Trojans' conditioning is his biggest concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in horrible shape,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as bad as it sounds, however, because Hackett said
there is more than ample time to fix that after USC took most of
this week off because of final exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 10 days to get ready,'' Hackett said. ``It's enough.
I don't think the preparation of what we do is going to be a
problem. I think the priority was clear-cut this week. The
classroom, academic side of it were most important. Monday, the
priority shifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 players missed Friday's practice taking finals. USC's
last day of finals is Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like a spring practice,'' linebacker David Gibson
said. ``We're worrying about getting into shape.''
</P>
<P>
   One player who didn't practice Friday was offensive lineman
Travis Claridge, who's been suffering from the flu.
</P>
<P>
   __ Iacenda released: Hackett said that former Hart High School
running back Ted Iacenda has been formally given his release from
the university and is free to transfer to another school.
</P>
<P>
   Iacenda, who left the team two weeks ago, would like to transfer
to a Division I-A school.
</P>
<P>
   __ Claiborne's unanimous: USC linebacker Chris Claiborne was
named to The Sporting News All-American team, which made him a
unanimous All-American. Claiborne is the first Trojans linebacker
to be a unanimous selection, and USC's first overall since wide
receiver Keyshawn Johnson in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   __ Big weekend: USC has about 12 recruits on campus this
weekend, the Trojans' biggest recruiting weekend to date.
</P>
<P>
   __ Number change: The Sun Bowl should be quarterback Carson
Palmer's last game wearing No. 15. He will switch to No. 3 next
season, the same number he wore in high school.
</P>
<P>
   __ No news: Although offensive coordinator Hue Jackson's name
has popped up for a similar position at California, Jackson said he
has not talked to Cal coach Tom Holmoe about the position.
</P>
<P>
   Cal offensive coordinator Doug Cosbie resigned last month, and
Jackson was the Bears' offensive coordinator in 1996.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the third day of the air assault on Iraq, the
Pentagon said Friday that it was able to confirm that only 18 of
its 89 targets had been severely damaged or destroyed, despite
waves of bombers and more laser-guided cruise missiles than were
hurled at Iraq during the gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq, showed defiance toward
the United States in his first televised address since the attacks
began, calling his attackers ``the agents of Satan.'' U.S. military
planes rained thousands of leaflets on Iraq warning ground troops
that if they mobilized they would face bombing raids from the
forces assembled on aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf and at
bases scattered around the region.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was scheduled to meet Saturday with his
national security advisers to talk about how long the air campaign
would continue, but the Pentagon suggested the bombing would go on
into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, at about 4 a.m. Saturday (8 p.m. Friday Eastern time),
another air raid was reported under way in Baghdad, according to
news services dispatches from the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing Friday afternoon, the military released the first
detailed assessment of the damage inflicted on Iraq in the largest
military strike ever ordered by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to say exactly how many laser-guided cruise
missiles and conventional bombs were hurled against Iraq this week,
Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
more cruise missiles were launched in the first two days of the air
campaign than the 290 or so missiles that were showered on Iraq in
1991. Each of the flying, computer-guided bombs costs about $1
million. Cruise missiles were not the main weapon of the 1991 air
war against Iraq, which relied much more heavily on bombs dropped
from B-52 airplanes. But Pentagon planners are anxious to keep the
risk of casualties to an absolute minimum in this operation, and
cruise missiles do not require human pilots or crews. Cruise
missiles also present a lower risk of civilian casualties in Iraq,
since they are far more accurate than bombs dropped from overhead,
even laser-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, seeming anxious not to offer the sort of inflated
damage assessments that embarrassed the Pentagon during the gulf
war, acknowledged that the results of the U.S. and British air
campaign had been mixed so far.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports from the first two nights of air strikes on Iraq
showed that the Pentagon was able to confirm that only 18 of the 88
targets had been severely damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The targets included military command centers, missile
factories, television and radio transmitters and an oil refinery in
the southern Iraq city of Basra, which the United States said was
being used for oil exports in violation of United Nations economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had some very good success with our strikes, but not
all of them have gone exactly as planned,'' Shelton said at a news
conference in the Pentagon, where he released videotape of
laser-guided bombs slamming into a variety of targets.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials continued to insist that
the goal of its military campaign was not to to destabilize the
Iraqi government or encourage a coup against Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon confirmed reports by the Iraqi government that
U.S. warplanes had dropped tens of thousands of leaflets on Iraqi
troops in the southern part of the country, informing them that
``only those units that support the Baghdad regime'' are being
targeted for attack by U.S. missiles and bombers.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflets, which were printed in Arabic, bore photographs of
the charred hulks of Iraqi tanks destroyed during the 1991 gulf
war. ``Your unit has not been targeted but it is being watched,''
the leaflets said, warning the soldiers not to mobilize.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Radio Free Iraq, the seven-week-old
U.S.-sponsored radio network beamed into Iraq and described by the
Iraqi government as an anti-Saddam propaganda machine, said that it
had expanded its programming to Iraq to four hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Arabic-language radio network insisted that
the programs were straightforward news broadcasts but acknowledged
that they also reported on the activities of Iraqi opposition
groups.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing its bombing reports Friday, the United States said
that it had targeted television and radio transmission towers in
hopes of cutting off communication from the central government in
Baghdad to Iraqi troops and the public, and it was unclear how many
Iraqis may have seen Saddam's defiant television address.
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, the Iraqi leader, dressed in a military uniform
and seated beside an Iraqi flag, with an enormous bouquet of red
flowers on the table in front of him, offered fierce words that
contrasted sharply what U.S. military officials have described as
the feeble response of his military to the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``By God, we will not compromise,'' he thundered in the taped
address, which was broadcast shortly before air-raid sirens sounded
in Baghdad to mark the start of the third night of air strikes.
``We stand against the barbaric way of those that have used our
airspace to launch an aggression against our people. A curse on the
agents of Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked Iraqis to ``continue resistance and attack in the name
of God and may the criminals lose.'' He added, ``We will fear
nothing but God and we will not kneel except to the face of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders at the Pentagon said Friday night they were
closely studying new bombing reports from the third day of air
strikes to determine when they they could halt the air campaign,
which they hope to do this weekend given the imminent start of
Ramadan, the month of religious reflection that begins Saturday and
is the holiest time in the Islamic calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sensitive to the issue of Ramadan and will take that
into account,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said in an
interview Friday night on CNN. ``But there is no fixed end time. We
have to keep some flexibility''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the air strikes would continue until the United
States and Britain determined that the bombing had accomplished
done significant damage to Iraq's ability to make chemical and
biological weapons. ``Once those missions are completed, the
mission will end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the United States might halt the air strikes this
weekend but make clear that bombing would resume after Ramadan
unless Iraq allows United Nations weapons inspectors to resume
their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not over by a long shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and other diplomats sought Friday to heal a rift in relations with
Russia, which has harshly criticized the air strikes on Iraq and
withdrew its ambassador to Washington in protest.
</P>
<P>
   And violent anti-American protests were reported in several Arab
capitals, with many demonstrators claiming that Clinton had
launched the attacks to divert attention from the impeachment
debate in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen insisted at a news conference that the political crisis
here was having no effect on the ability of U.S. forces to carry
out the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to speculate at this point that those people
involved in this operation are focused on one thing, and that's
carrying out the mission,'' he said. ``Whatever else is going on at
this particular moment is probably of little concern to them until
they carry out their mission.''

<P>
   The House impeachment debate commanded the full attention of the
big broadcast networks and the all-news cable networks for most of
Friday morning, but eventually gave way to occasional reports from
Iraq and ultimately, for most network stations, to the attraction
of soap operas.
</P>
<P>
   The news departments of ABC, CBS and NBC all continued their
network coverage of the impeachment debate throughout the day, but
between 11 a.m. and 12:45 p.m. all three offered their stations the
opportunity to switch off to the regular line-up of daytime
programs, mostly soap operas. The vast majority of stations opted
for the likes of ``Days of Our Lives'' and ``The Young and the
Restless.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Falco, the president of the NBC network said, ``It was a
day of multiple feeds: impeachment, Baghdad and soap operas.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC, for example, covered the impeachment debate on its full
network only until 11 a.m., when the anchor, Tom Brokaw, said some
stations would leave for their own programming. NBC's coverage
continued for the stations that wanted to take it.
</P>
<P>
   Even NBC's flagship station, WNBC in New York, switched from the
impeachment coverage to join an episode of ``Sunset Beach'' in
progress. WNBC rejoined NBC's impeachment coverage at 3 p.m., after
``Days of our Lives'' and ``Another World.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC also programs its own all-news channel MSNBC, which
continued its impeachment coverage throughout the day, along with
some coverage from Iraq such as a news conference with foreign
minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS, the network covered the debate in full from 9 a.m. until
12:30, when it adopted the same policy, keeping the network's
coverage going with its anchorman, Dan Rather, in place, while
offering stations the opportunity to switch to ``The Young and the
Restless.'' The majority did, including WCBS, the network's
flagship station in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But several CBS stations, including those in Boston, Baltimore,
San Francisco, Houston and St. Louis, stayed with the impeachment
coverage for at least some time beyond the start of the soap
operas.
</P>
<P>
   In ABC's case, the network maintained full coverage until 12:45,
when it allowed its stations to join the show ``Port Charles'' in
progress. ABC also continued to offer stations the events happening
in the House though without any commentary from its anchor, Peter
Jennings. Most ABC stations opted for the entertainment shows,
including ABC's flagship station, WABC.
</P>
<P>
   Such an arrangement, with networks offering different broadcast
feeds, is not unusual and has been offered in the past _ for
example, during White House briefings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is the advent of the the 24-hour news channel,
because some of our stations feel they have to be competitive with
news channels, so we have committed to providing that service for
them,'' said Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   All three all-news cable channels focused all day on the
impeachment events, though they all occasionally interrupted for
developments from Baghdad including the news conference by Aziz and
a taped statement by Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The cable channels kept up their full coverage until the end of
the debate Friday night. The networks were to stay with their
prime-time lineups, but each of them devoted at least an hour to
special news coverage of the day's events.
</P>
<P>
   Each network announced it would cover the actual votes on
articles of impeachment live on Saturday. If they take place later
than the expected time of between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m., CBS will
face the biggest problem because of its commitment to cover the New
York Jets-Buffalo Bills football game at 12:30. But the network
said it would interrupt the game to show any vote live.

 &HT;    AIR STRIKES CONTINUE AS SADDAM REMAINS DEFIANT
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS and LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Pressing their high-tech air strikes against Iraq
into the first hours of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan on
Saturday, U.S. and British forces pounded Iraqi defense,
communications and oil facilities in a campaign to shatter the
spine of Baghdad's military regime.
</P>
<P>
   As dawn broke, operation Desert Fox continued after more than 75
targets had been destroyed or badly damaged during the night by
cruise missiles and guided bombs fired from warships and an aerial
armada that has flown more than 200 sorties since Wednesday, the
Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's attacks included the first-ever combat mission of the
$200 million B-1 strategic bomber, built during the Cold War to fly
high-speed, low-level missions deep into the heart of the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Friday, U.S. and British forces had suffered no
casualties, according to the Pentagon, though Iraq claimed that at
least 30 people had been killed in Baghdad alone.
</P>
<P>
   In his first direct address since the bombing began Wednesday
night, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein went on television Friday
night to urge his countrymen to stand strong in the face of an
onslaught they've thus far been powerless to defend against.
</P>
<P>
   ``By God's will, you will be victorious,'' Saddam, dressed in an
olive-drab military uniform, said in a ten-minute taped address. He
vowed not to ''compromise or kneel'' to his adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't know where Saddam was during the continuing strikes.
He owns some 80 palaces around the country and keeps his movements
secretive for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   But his Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, told reporters in
Baghdad that Saddam was ``in good shape, thank God,'' despite air
strikes targeting a number of his residences.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are witnessing is not a military conflict,'' said
Aziz. ''It's a criminal aggression by the United States and Britain
against Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters
that Saddam was not the target of the continuing air strikes. By
diminishing his military and intelligence strength, however, the
air campaign was clearly striking at the heart of Saddam's grip on
power.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not seeking to destabilize his regime,'' said Cohen.
''We are seeking to prevent him from in any way
</P>
<P>
   compromising this operation and from communicating under these
circumstances with his other forces (which)
</P>
<P>
   could pose a threat to our pilots who continue to conduct
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, U.S. and British forces continued pummeling Iraq's
surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites and related radar and
communications gear needed to effectively operate them.
</P>
<P>
   As of midday Friday, some 27 such sites had been attacked and
either seriously damaged or completely destroyed, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The southern Iraq air defense system has been degraded,''
Cohen said, reducing the risk of U.S. pilots being targeted by
Iraq's Soviet-era SAMs. ''We have not had SAMs fired at the
aircraft to our knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said raids have also targeted:
</P>
<P>
   Headquarters buildings and barracks of the Republican Guard, an
elite military group central to Saddam's control of the country and
active in trying to conceal Iraq's efforts to manufacture weapons
of mass destruction;
</P>
<P>
   Missile production, repair, research and development sites
integral to Iraq's ability to launch weapons of mass destruction
against its neighbors, and;
</P>
<P>
   An oil refinery in the southern port of Basra that Cohen said
had been used by Saddam to circumvent United Nations restrictions
on Iraqi oil exports.
</P>
<P>
   When he launched the attacks earlier this week, President
Clinton said he was sensitive to the start of Ramadan, an annual
month of daytime fasting and prayer recognized by Muslims around
the world. But neither he nor Cohen pledged to end the air strikes
before the religious period began early Saturday in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has said that the attacks would end after the U.S. and
British forces work their way through a pre-set list of targets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't comment on the length of the operation,'' Cohen said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to pin down Iraqi troops near the Kuwaiti border south of
Baghdad, U.S. forces dropped thousands of leaflets warning the
soldiers _ in their native Arabic _ to stay put or face the threat
of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It basically said 'Stay where you are, stay put, do not
threaten anyone and you will not be hit,''' U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff Chairman Gen. Hugh Shelton told reporters during a Pentagon
briefing. Pentagon officials have expressed concern that Saddam
might send his tank forces toward Kuwait or Saudi Arabia in an
attempt to draw the United States into a land battle.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad during Saturday's pre-dawn darkness, an intense
volley of missile attacks and anti-aircraft fire sent plumes of
flames and streaks of light across the skies. A cruise missile was
seen streaking above a downtown avenue and slamming into a
building.
</P>
<P>
   By 4:45 a.m. Saturday, the pounding had subsided. Roosters and
the call to prayer over a mosque amplifier echoed through the city.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi authorities continued to restrict the movements of foreign
journalists. Reporters were taken on guided tours where Iraqi
officials showed them selected examples of damage from the air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad itself seemed largely untouched by the attacks. Some
government buildings were heavily damaged, but there did not appear
to be much to civilian structures. Electricity and phones appeared
to work throughout the city, and television and radio stations
continued to broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the attacks on Iraq, President Clinton spent Friday
girding for a series of impeachment votes Saturday in the House of
Representatives. But Cohen said the political troubles of the
commander in chief would have no bearing on the tasks of the troops
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those people involved in this operation are focused on one
thing, and that's carrying out the mission,'' Cohen told reporters.
''Whatever else is going on at this particular moment is probably
of little concern to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered the air campaign on Wednesday after months of
frustration with Iraq's obstruction of United Nations inspection
teams charged with verifying the destruction of Iraq's chemical and
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   While Saddam claims he has no such weapons, U.N. inspectors have
never been able to verify that and evidence continues to surface
suggesting that Iraq continues to build and stockpile arms that can
kill indiscriminately with lethal chemicals and deadly germs.

JETS HOPE TO CLINCH FIRST DIVISION TITLE SINCE 1969 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has never happened quite this way for the Jets, to be
standing just 60 minutes away from a division crown. But a victory
Saturday afternoon in Buffalo against the Bills can propel them to
a division title for the first time since their last year in the
American Football League, back in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their history, dating to 1960, no Jets team has been
able to say: win today, and win the division. Then again, only two
Jets teams did finish first _ the 1968 and 1969 editions, when Joe
Namath was at the helm, and each of these clubs went into the final
weeks with a comfortable edge.
</P>
<P>
   For this once-troubled franchise, already assured of going into
the playoffs for only the eighth time, a victory Saturday would
also enable it to join the other pioneers who merged the two
leagues back in 1970. Of all the clubs from both leagues that year
_ 26 in all _ the Jets are the only one in the National Football
League that has never finished first since.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a division title is not all the 10-4 Jets are
seeking. If they win and then win again next weekend against New
England, they guarantee themselves a first-round bye in the
playoffs and a second-round home game. And they will accomplish the
same thing if they win today and Jacksonville loses either of its
last two games.
</P>
<P>
   So there's plenty at stake in this game for a team that won a
tough game in Miami just six days ago and now has to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A victory would help,'' said Bill Parcells, the Jets'
ever-practical, ever-wary coach. ``The more advantages you have in
the playoffs helps. Last Sunday was a big step and if we can win
this on the road, then people will say, `You deserve this.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets crunched the Bills, 34-12, in their first confrontation
Nov. 8 at Giants Stadium. But victory might not come so easily
Saturday. For one thing, the Bills (9-5) can clinch a playoff spot
by winning, not a bad achievement for a team that started the
season at 0-3. And for another, Doug Flutie is 5-0 at home since
becoming the Bills' starting quarterback, and he no doubt feels he
has something to prove against the Jets, the only team to shut him
down in his remarkable return to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   And just how important is the playoff bye week, the rainbow at
the end of the regular season that seems within the Jets' reach?
Well, since 1970, only four teams have made it to the Super Bowl
without first-round byes _ the 1980 Oakland Raiders, the 1985 New
England Patriots, the 1992 Buffalo Bills and the 1997 Denver
Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells describes the bye as being able to play ``one-third
fewer games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a bye and you win one, you're playing to go to the
Super Bowl,'' he said. ``I'm not saying you can't do it without a
bye, but the percentages are against you. You have a chance to rest
up.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the division title, only three members of the Jets'
family remain connected to the last one the Jets won, in 1969. They
are Leon Hess, the owner; Bill Hampton, the equipment manager, and
Frank Ramos, the public relations director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' said Hampton, as he reflected on what life is
like now. He joined the Jets 35 years ago, the year the team moved
into Shea Stadium from the Polo Grounds. Hampton, who had been
working with the New York Rangers, was told that Weeb Ewbank, who
had taken over as the Jets' coach, was looking for an equipment
manger. ``The job was only for six months a year. But I took it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton and Ramos were among the last Jets to see Ewbank alive.
The coach from their Super Bowl III victory died last month, days
after he visited the Jets when they played in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton recalled his last sighting of Ewbank, who molded the
Jets in his dual role as general manager and coach. ``He was
sitting in a wheelchair at the end zone at the end of game,''
Hampton said, ``and someone wheeled him out and he left.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first-place Jets of 1968 and 1969, practice was at
Rikers Island, the prison. Ewbank had spotted a football field down
there from an airplane on one of the Jets' trips. He didn't realize
it was on prison grounds, but the city let him use it _ as long as
prisoners could watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were forbidden by the Mets to use Shea Stadium while
the baseball season was under way. Thus, the Jets never played a
preseason game at Shea in their 20 seasons there. In 1969, with the
Mets going to the World Series, the Jets played their first five
games on the road. They wandered.
</P>
<P>
   There was a moment when Ewbank stopped the bus near Flushing
Meadow Park and said, ``Here's a place.'' They practiced.
Place-kicker Jim Turner had a favorite spot he aimed for between
two trees. And Ewbank once had to beg a youngster to move his
bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' replied the boy. ``It's as much my park as yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton recalled: ``Every time we practiced somewhere, I had to
ship the dummies and the blocking sleds.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the current crop of Jets, Hampton said, ``This group of
guys is very similar. The chemistry, the leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   And these days Hampton hears a little more often from the old
crew _ Larry Grantham, Rocky Rochester, Ralph Baker, John Schmitt,
all of them key members of the Super Bowl team. Later-edition Jets
such as Marty Lyons and Bruce Harper keep in touch, too.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, as he always does before game day, Hampton could
finally concentrate on the game. He knew he would be packing
additional clothing for Buffalo, because there was snow in the
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells, Hampton said, ``is liable to go out there with a
light jacket on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so involved in the game,'' Hampton added. ``No hat.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hampton had one more observation. ``It's easy to unpack when
you win,'' he said, ``but when you lose it's a tough job.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ramos was thinking back to 1970, when the Jets tried
to keep their first-place streak intact for a third season.
Instead, that season began a decade of failure. ``Namath fractured
his wrist in the fifth game of the season, and then in 1971 he hurt
his good knee,'' Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, when the Jets arrived in Buffalo, Ramos set up a news
conference just for Namath. ``And 50 or 60 people attended,'' Ramos
said. ``The impact of a Joe Namath was this: One particular player
who transcended football. Here was a guy, a player, and he was
hosting the Johnny Carson show.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS: KEYSHAWN JOHNSON needs 10 more yards for the Jets
to have a pair of 1,000-yard receivers for the first time since
1988. WAYNE CHREBET already has 1,009. The last tandem were AL TOON
and WESLEY WALKER. &QL;

 &HT;    CLINTON TO ADDRESS NATION AFTER IMPEACHMENT VOTE
 &HT;    EDS: Adds Gephardt quotes near top
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans to address the nation
Saturday after a scheduled series of House votes targeting his
presidency, the White House said late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And jumping into the political fray after months of absence,
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to journey to Capitol Hill
early Saturday to speak to House Democrats before members take up
four articles of impeachment against her husband.
</P>
<P>
   The president also planned to meet at the White House with House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and other members of the
House Democratic leadership immediately after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, who asked for the post-vote meeting, said Democrats
would carry to Clinton the message that the party stands behind
him, whatever the outcome of Saturday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure a lot of Republicans will be saying he ought to
resign,'' Gephardt said in an interview Friday night on the Cable
News Network. ''He should not, he cannot resign, even if this vote
goes against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made no public remarks since Thursday morning about
impeachment, now widely seen as unavoidable. But White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart suggested that Clinton would want Americans
to know his side of the story as they absorbed news reports about
Saturday's scheduled vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect that at some point you will probably see him,'' said
Lockhart, who declined to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials declined to characterize the purpose or
the substance of Mrs. Clinton's intended remarks Saturday. But on
Friday, she urged the country to embrace reconciliation during a
season celebrated by Christians, Jews and Moslems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in our country ought to practice reconciliation and we
ought to bring our country together and we ought to end
divisiveness because we can do so much more together,'' Mrs.
Clinton told reporters after leaving a holiday awareness event
sponsored by Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that we as a nation would turn our attention to
what we could do together, what we could do positively and how we
could build each other up,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   While the first lady spoke of national healing, Lockhart accused
Clinton's foes of ''partisanship and cynicism'' in an effort to
hound the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said House Republicans have played a duplicitous game.
He noted that after first insisting that impeachment was little
more than a green light for a more comprehensive and meaningful
Senate inquiry, Republicans have begun making the case that Clinton
should resign if impeached on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''A conscious effort was made to, in effect, dumb down
impeachment ... and say that this process wasn't important, that
the real action was someplace else, and then, having gone through
it, turn 180 degrees in the other direction and say, 'It's so
important, it's so important to this country and it's so damaging
that the president should resign,'' Lockhart said at a White House
briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a political strategy at work here that is
cynical and is not in the best interests of the American public,''
Lockhart said. ''You don't make something right by compounding it
with another wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Since House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois
and House Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas suggested in Sunday
talk show appearances that Clinton resign, many other Republicans
have joined in. Even a scattering of Democrats have agreed that
Clinton should resign, or consider doing so, in order to save the
nation the trauma of a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton himself said this week, ``I have no intention of
resigning. It's never crossed my mind.'' And several people close
to the president told reporters Friday that he would never leave
office voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can forget about that,'' said Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As 13 hours of bitterly partisan impeachment debate unfolded
Friday on Capitol Hill, Clinton stayed out of sight, hunkered down
at the White House working on subjects ranging from the continuing
U.S. air strikes in Iraq to the battle against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   He did ``very little'' to help the battle against impeachment,
Lockhart said, other than spend an hour meeting with Rep.
Christopher Shays of Connecticut, an undecided Republican, in the
presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Shays said later he knew no details of the
conversation and that Shays had no plans to announce his decision
until the vote. Lockhart also declined comment about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore conducted a series of radio interviews arguing against
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has admitted wrongdoing in engaging in an intimate
relationship with Lewinsky, a former White House intern, and then
later misleading prosecutors and the nation about the nature of
that relationship.
</P>
<P>
   He has maintained, however, that his conduct does not rise to
the level of an impeachable offense. Instead, Clinton has suggested
that the House vote to censure him in a stern rebuke that would
leave a permanent record of Congressional condemnation of his
activities.

GOVERNMENT SAYS IMPORTER SMUGGLED MILLIONS IN CAVIAR  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MOLLY O'NEILL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Uncovering what it called a caviar smuggling scheme
worth millions of dollars, the federal government Friday indicted
three men, two of whom run a distributing company that supplies
caviar to retail shops and restaurants in New York City, as well as
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   The distributors, based in Stamford, Conn., were charged in U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn with illegally smuggling thousands of
pounds of Russian sturgeon roe into the United States from Poland.
The indictment accuses the company, Gino International, of
transporting some of the supply by hiding it in luggage on many
commercial flights from Poland to Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   None of the caviar was refrigerated, the authorities said, nor
could proper papers for the caviar be produced. The government
would not disclose the names of retailers or restaurants that buy
caviar from the company, only that it was one of the largest
distributors in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The government seized some of the caviar at Kennedy, where
federal agents and inspectors have been enforcing tough new
international caviar regulations intended to stop the flow of
illegally harvested caviar.
</P>
<P>
   The operation at the airport has intensified over the holiday
season _ the peak time to indulge in caviar _ and has roiled the
lucrative caviar industry. Until recently, it was not difficult to
import mislabeled, old, previously frozen or black-market caviar
into the United States. The government says such caviar amounts to
50 percent of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   But now, agents from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service
who are enforcing the regulations can easily test the DNA of a
single egg, revealing whether caviar is, in fact, the grade,
provenance and variety promised on its label.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, retailers and chefs are scrambling to destroy
questionable caviar and replenish their holiday stocks. Industry
sources say that more than nine tons of caviar is sold in the city
between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve, and up to $10 million is
spent on the delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's indictment, Zachary Carter, the U.S. attorney for
the Eastern District of New York, brought charges against Eugeniusz
Koczuk, the owner of Gino International; his business associate,
Wieslaw Rozbicki, and Andrezej Lepkowski, of Warsaw, Poland, a man
the government said recruited couriers to smuggle the caviar. Each
man was charged with seven counts related to smuggling endangered
wildlife into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, each could face a fine of as much as $250,000 and
a maximum of five years in prison on each count. In addition to
destroying the 2,000 pounds of unlawfully imported caviar they
seized, the government is requesting up to $2 million in
restitution for sales of illegal caviar before to the seizure. All
three were released on bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the courthouse, Koczuk, speaking through a translator,
would say only: ``This is all a big misunderstanding that will be
made clear soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the United States joined 140 other nations to
enforce caviar importing regulations drafted by the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora,
called Cites (pronounced SIGHT-ease).
</P>
<P>
   Carter said that the United States is the world's leading
importer of caviar. More than 80 tons of caviar __ with a declared
wholesale value of $1,889,911.00 and a retail value of as much as
to five times that much _ is legally imported into the United
States each year.
</P>
<P>
   Uncounted additional tons are concealed in suitcases, packed in
shipping containers, or shipped through the mail without permits
and are most likely black market products. Throughout the caviar
industry, a markup of 100 percent is not uncommon. Black market
caviar can be marked up as much as 500 percent _ and still cost
less than legitimately imported caviar.
</P>
<P>
   Most retailers responded to questions about Friday's indictments
with shock, fear and rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terribly unfortunate thing when people do things like
this,'' said Saul Zabar of Zabar's, whose store on Manhattan's
Upper West Side has long waged holiday caviar price wars with
Macy's. He said his store has taken ``every action to protect the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   But the seven-count indictment indicates that millions of
illegal fish eggs have been smuggled into the country. Recovering
them all evokes visions of needles in haystacks.
</P>
<P>
   On numerous occasions, the indictment says, the three defendants
conspired to smuggle shipments of caviar by concealing them in the
luggage of airline passengers, whom they paid a $500 courier fee.
None of the passengers have been charged.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gino International is accused of having sold 1,900
pounds of caviar _ with a retail value of more than $5 million _
between April 1, 1998, and Nov. 3, 1998. The company, however,
received necessary government permission to import only one
shipment of 88 pounds of caviar, the indictment says.

NYC UNION TRUSTEE UPBRAIDS TOP OFFICIALS, CHARGING UNCHECKED
SPENDING
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The newly appointed trustee of the city's largest
municipal union lashed out at the union's top officials Friday,
saying they had engaged in large-scale, unrestrained spending,
including more than $300,000 in unexplained credit card expenses
and the creation of what he called a $2 million slush fund.
</P>
<P>
   Furious about the union's complete lack of financial controls,
Lee Saunders, the new administrator of District Council 37,
suspended the council's longtime treasurer and attacked the
unchecked spending for helping cause the union's net assets to
plunge to $3.4 million, from $22 million in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders said 10 top council officials had the union pay a total
of $455,300 in bills run up on their American Express cards, noting
that the officials provided rough justification for only a quarter
of that amount. Some of that spending was for personal items,
Saunders said, noting that members of the council staff often
traveled without approval and without justifying travel costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so deeply disturbed right now,'' he said at a news
conference in midtown Manhattan. ``Unions are supposed to operate
for the benefit of their members. Not as a private candy store for
the few.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders announced that he was taking strong steps to clean up
the mess, among them destroying the American Express cards held by
the 10 council leaders, and suspending a generous severance program
in which officials who resigned under a cloud left with hundreds of
thousands of dollars. Among the officials whose cards were
destroyed was Stanley Hill, the longtime executive director who was
forced to take unpaid leave when the parent union took direct
control of the council on Nov. 30.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With disgust in his voice, Saunders described a financial system
in which there were no written procedures or checks and balances,
in which officials operated without accountability and members were
kept in the dark about how their dues money was spent.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders laid out the details of the financial mismanagement
after speaking Friday morning at an internal judicial hearing at
which the council's parent union, the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, provided evidence to justify
imposing a trusteeship on the council.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau has undertaken a
broad investigation into allegations of embezzlement, kickbacks and
vote fraud at the council, which represents 120,000 city workers.
Last month, Hill acknowledged that there was vote rigging in 1996
at a large clerical workers' local, as part of an effort to insure
the ratification of the union's five-year contract, which included
an unpopular two-year wage freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders described several schemes that allowed the council's
senior officials to exploit the system. He said that in their
projected budget, council officials deliberately underestimated the
number of workers who pay dues, a move that meant the union ended
up with about $2 million more each year than it had budgeted. He
said this created a slush fund, which enabled council officials to
spend money ``without the constraints of discussion, approval or
reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   He said KPMG Peat Marwick, an auditing firm hired by the parent
union, was investigating whether the $2 million was spent
improperly.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders detailed another scheme in which the city gave the
district council dues money collected from workers' paychecks, and
the council then gave each local its share. For many locals,
council officials held back a certain amount of the dues, enabling
top officials from the locals to spend that money without its being
an official part of the local's budget and without their members
even knowing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders also acknowledged that Kroll Associates, a private
investigative agency hired by the parent union, had found that
tampering in the contract ratification vote was far more widespread
than had been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming a report in The New York Times on Friday, , he said
investigators had found irregularities and possible fraud in at
least 12 of the council's 56 locals.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders said investigators found union locals in which the
number of votes for ratification was greater than the number of
members who attended meetings where the vote was taken by a show of
hands. There were also vote tallies in the district council's
records for certain locals that voted by voice with no count taken
at their meetings.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, Saunders said, the tally in the local union's
minutes was lower than the tally in the district council's records.
He said the presidents of two locals had said their signatures were
forged when a district council official sought to certify how their
locals had voted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see here is unchecked spending, a complete lack of
critical business practices in a major organization and a vote
scheme that stole the voice of a union's members,'' Saunders said.
``That is unacceptable. This union is going to start operating in
the best interests of its members. We will expose wrongdoing and
abuses, and implement systems and controls to make sure they don't
happen again.''

LONG ISLAND REPUBLICAN LEADER INDICTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Pa.)  (rl) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ A federal grand jury Friday indicted the
Suffolk County Republican leader, John Powell, on charges that he
extorted payoffs from garbage haulers at a public landfill and
conspired to traffic in stolen trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment had been expected since Dec. 3, when federal
prosecutors revealed the results of an investigation centered on
the Town of Brookhaven in a complaint that named Powell and 18
other defendants, including participants in what the authorities
said were two separate truck-stealing rings.
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 defendants were named in the indictment. At least three
others _ minor figures in the original complaint _ have already
agreed to plead guilty, according to lawyers involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the case in Brookhaven is Joseph Provenzano, who
prosecutors said headed an organization that stole trucks from as
far away as Pennsylvania and New Jersey, took them apart at a truck
yard he owned in Patchogue or at a horse farm in Manorville, then
sold them for parts or reassembled them for sale as new trucks.
Provenzano, who is said to have a ``contact'' in the Lucchese crime
family, was indicted on 11 counts, including operating a chop shop,
altering vehicle-identification numbers, extortion, witness
tampering and corrupt payments to a public official.
</P>
<P>
   Also charged in the indictment was Joseph Lapienski, a deputy
commissioner for the Town of Brookhaven, who supervised the
landfill and who is accused of allowing access to the dump in
exchange for cash payments from Provenzano and other carters,
including one hauling company executive who is cooperating with
prosecutors. Lapienski, who has been suspended from his job, was
charged on six counts, including corrupt solicitation by a public
official.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, whom Lapienski described as his boss, according to
prosecutors, was charged with extortion and three counts of
conspiracy. The indictment provides no more detail about his
activities, however, than did the Dec. 3 arrest complaint, in which
he was accused of accepting $20,000 over a 10-month period from the
same hauling company executive who made payments to Lapienski. He
was said to have been the ``driving force'' behind the purchase of
trucks from Provenzano by GP Tech, a trucking company owned by
Powell's younger brother, George. George Powell has not been
charged in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Brafman, John Powell's lawyer, Friday accused the U.S.
attorney's office of a ``terrible abuse of prosecutorial
discretion,'' saying the government had sought to ``turn an
ordinary criminal case into an important criminal case'' by naming
him despite weak evidence. Federal prosecutors declined to comment.

EDITORIAL: JUDGE HIGGINBOTHAM'S PATH; WILLIAM GADDIS' PROSE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec.19:
</P>
<P>
   The son of a cleaning woman and a laborer, raised in a
segregated New Jersey town, A. Leon Higginbotham Jr. rose to become
a respected federal appellate judge and legal historian. His
productive career following his 1993 retirement from the bench
spanned the worlds of Harvard University, where he taught, and the
corporate boards on which he served, including that of The New York
Times Company.
</P>
<P>
   But Higginbotham, who died this week at age 70, never forgot his
roots, or his personal debt to the civil rights movement that
opened doors of opportunity long shut for African-Americans. From
Higginbotham's early struggle to overcome poverty and racial
discrimination came a lifelong commitment to civil rights and
social justice that shone through his judicial writings and his
works of scholarship. Over the years, the judge tried to repay the
teachers who helped him by acting as a mentor to talented black
lawyers. Their contributions to the law and society are an ongoing
part of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   In his final years, Higginbotham's passionate opposition to the
dismantling of affirmative action programs saw him attack the
conservative legal views of Justice Clarence Thomas with a ferocity
that even some of his friends questioned. But Higginbotham was
acting out of a deeply felt concern about reversing the nation's
march toward racial justice.
</P>
<P>
   READING WILLIAM GADDIS
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty William Gaddis presents to a reader is this:
learning to follow the mercurial glance of a writer who gives you
no warning where he will look next but who always looks with rapt
attention and who commands raptness in the language itself.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gaddis is dead at 75. He was never as aloof as Thomas
Pynchon, and the outline of his life makes an interesting narrative
in its own right. But the one essential thing to know about Gaddis
can only be found in his prose.
</P>
<P>
   He published four novels, ``The Recognitions,'' ``JR,''
``Carpenter's Gothic'' and ``A Frolic of His Own.'' Each of them is
at once dour and baldly funny, ironic and scarifying. But only an
intrinsically hopeful man ever made prose like Gaddis', so
self-aware, so unyielding and, for a reader who is happy not to
insist on a swift denouement, so generous. In Gaddis, every
sentence is its own denouement, and that is more attention to the
world and its linguistic echo than many readers can stand.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to reading Gaddis is to read the words one at a time,
one after another, just as he arranged them. That is all the
difficulty there is, and beyond it lies a sprawling, worldly
entertainment. Before he died, Gaddis had finished a new novel. May
it be as fat and rich as his early works, as fat and rich as ``Don
Quixote'' itself.  &QL;

CLAIMING HEALING BY GOD, GIRL SAYS KIDNEY IS FINE

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two weeks ago, Renada Daniel Patterson's only
kidney, donated by her father, began to fail, prompting a swirling
debate when he offered to give her his remaining one.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, even as the medical ethics committee at the
University of California-San Francisco Medical Center was
discussing whether to allow a transplant that would make David
Patterson a dialysis patient for the rest of his life, his
16-year-old daughter and her mother announced that the debate was
moot: Renada had been healed by God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Renada is healthy now,'' said her mother, Vickie Daniel.
``She's happy and well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Renada's pediatric nephrologist, Dr. Donald Potter, has a
more sober prognosis. While medication has stabilized Renada's
condition, Potter does not believe she is cured, Janet Basu, a
spokeswoman for the medical center, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Renada entered the hospital on December 2, her condition
was good,'' Ms. Basu said. ``She was released on December 6 after
treatment to prevent rejection. The results so far have been
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a cure, Ms. Basu said. ``It doesn't mean that she
won't need a transplant sometime in the future. The same condition
exists as two weeks ago. She didn't need a transplant; she didn't
need dialysis. But sometime in the future, she will need these
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Daniel had pushed hard for her daughter's right to take her
father's last kidney. Patterson, an inmate at California State
Prison in Sacramento who abandoned Renada when she was a baby, was
offering her the best gift a father could, Mrs. Daniel had said.
Besides, she said, ``we don't know how much time Renada's got
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, it seems as if Renada is fine. At a news
conference on Friday at the hospital, the University of
California-San Francisco Stanford Health Care, where she made her
stunning announcement, she said that blood tests showed that
Renada's kidney appeared to be functioning normally, and that her
doctor said she would not be needing a transplant or dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   The family's pastor, the Rev. Lorenzo Carlisle of the Oakland
United Church of Christ, called it ``a supernatural phenomenon, a
gift that God has given us for the world to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Renada was born with one kidney, which failed when she was 5.
Her body rejected a transplant a year later, and for seven years
she was a dialysis patient. Then, three years ago, her father, who
had not been in touch for years, called from prison to offer her
one of his kidneys. The transplant worked until Renada stopped
taking her anti-rejection medication because it bloated her, caused
a hump in her back and made her feel ill.
</P>
<P>
   At the university medical center, the ethics committee has been
saddled with the unprecedented situation of authorizing a
transplant that would appear to violate the Hippocratic oath that
requires doctors to ``first, do no harm'' to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wade Smith, the chairman of the ethics committee, said on
Friday that the committee was pleased to hear from Mrs. Daniel that
Renada was doing well, but that the committee would continue its
discussions, and would meet in January more than once before making
a recommendation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Medical scholars nationwide have been divided over the ethics of
accepting Patterson's offer for another transplant. Some are
categorically against it; others say it depends on how it would
affect Patterson's life. There is also debate over whether
Patterson's status as an inmate should be considered, since he
would still be an inmate if the transplant occurred before 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, 38, is serving time for burglary and drug
convictions. (In 1997, his original sentence of seven years for
burglary was lengthened by five years after he was found with
heroin in his cell.)
</P>
<P>
   In the two weeks since Mrs. Daniel first held a news conference
admonishing the hospital, University of California-San Francisco
Stanford Health Care, for even debating the transplant issue, she
has been criticized on radio and television talk shows for
insisting that the transplant be allowed.

CARTER WELCOMES CHALLENGE   OF THE WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects Ann Arbor to East Lansing in lede)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Anson Carter went to school at Michigan State in East
Lansing, slightly more than an hour outside Detroit. He never went
to Red Wings games, though. And he'd watch on television only if
one of his friends was facing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at the other team,'' Carter said. ``I try to
focus on my own team.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's team is the Bruins, and Saturday night, they'll be
focusing on the Red Wings _ the mighty Red Wings, that is, winners
of the last two Stanley Cups and 5-3 conquerors of Boston Wednesday
in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Carter took note of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they have a lot of experience and they're pretty deep
in talent,'' he said. But he also knows something about his club:
``If we're playing well, we're tough to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   And he acknowledges that the presence of the Wings gets the
juices flowing, even if that wasn't the case in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get pumped up because of their Stanley Cup
championships,'' he said. ``Every night you try to get pumped up
just because you're in the National Hockey League and you have to.
Anybody can beat anybody on any given night. The fact that they're
the Stanley Cup champions does make you a little more fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   But he won't be hyperventilating.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to play within yourselves,'' Carter said. ``Sometimes
less is more. If you get fired up too much, you tend to try to do
too much and give something up and get in a hole it's tough to
battle back from.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now Carter is trying to battle back from a slump. He has 3
goals and 9 points in 16 games after missing the first 12 in a
contract dispute, and Friday before practice, coach Pat Burns had a
talk with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see a little bit more from Anson,'' Burns said.
``I think he worries too much about everything else that goes
around him instead of making it a simple game. He's such a good
skater, a strong individual, he's got to skate down the wing and
take the shot to the net and go to the net. You can't defense
against those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter isn't overly concerned by his numbers. ``I try to play in
all three zones,'' he said, ``and if I do that, points will come.
I'm doing a lot of things well, to tell you the truth. I just carry
the puck in my danger zones, and sometimes I'm playing left wing,
sometimes right wing, and sometimes center. I've got to make sure I
stay sharp mentally because my role can change from shift to shift.
I've got to be ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame Carter's slump on missing training camp. He got in
plenty of work skating with Michigan State, Team Canada, trainer
T.R. Goodman, and the International Hockey League's Utah Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right when I got here, I felt I was ready to go,'' Carter
said. ``All the coaching staff did a tremendous job in preparing
for the season. It was a learning experience with Utah. It wasn't
the NHL but just a step below it. It did a good job of preparing me
for the NHL level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NHL players are the best in the world _ faster, bigger,
and stronger. But it's hockey no matter where you go. It's moving
two feet and playing in game situations.''
</P>
<P>
   But he knows the Red Wings bring it to another level.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You can surf the World Wide Web without one bit
of Microsoft code on your desktop, or one bit of Netscape
Communications, for that matter. You need never venture near Yahoo,
America Online or any other self-described portals. But every time
you log into the Internet, you are touched by the products and
technology of one company: Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street knows, of course. The second-most active stock in
United States markets, Cisco has more than doubled in price this
year, making it the sixth-best performer on the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   And in a market that values money-losing Amazon.com at $15.1
billion and Yahoo at $21 billion, perhaps Cisco, with fiscal 1998
revenue of $8.5 billion and earnings of $1.4 billion, or 84 cents a
share, deserves its market cap of $142.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the thinking person's Internet stock. Sure, its market
capitalization is huge and its multiple rich, but this is a company
with real earnings from the Web right now. Nothing is as ubiquitous
on the Internet as Cisco's routers, specialized computers that
manage data traffic on a network using the Internet Protocol, known
as IP.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of the routers connected to the Internet
are Cisco's. And if you believe that the Internet will grow, and
that Cisco's technology can remain competitive, then investing in
Cisco is not so scary after all.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco has been hitting new highs in recent weeks and closed on
another one Friday at $90.4375 on NASDAQ. That is about 62 times
the consensus earnings estimate of $1.47 a share for the company
for the fiscal year ending in July 1999. That multiple is more than
twice the growth rate of the consensus earnings estimate, so this
is clearly an expensive stock.
</P>
<P>
   But many technology analysts and fund managers say it is still a
stock to own. Of 28 analysts surveyed by First Call, which tracks
earnings estimates, 16 rate it a strong buy, 10 a buy and 2 a hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it's not cheap for any stock, but the growth rate has
been phenomenal and should continue to be phenomenal going forward
as long as data traffic continues to grow,'' said Alec Murray,
associate director of research for MFS Investment Management, which
owns 21 million Cisco shares in its MFS family of mutual funds.
``It's not a screaming buy here, but we think there is good upside
potential in the stock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mainstay of Cisco's business is still routers, which perform
the complex task of linking computer systems that may speak
different languages. But the company has also branched out to
include network switching devices, an alternative to routers, and
remote-access servers, which let employees in the field connect to
the network.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cisco is moving into equipment for telephone companies,
offering them the ability to add data traffic voice services.
</P>
<P>
   ``IP data is growing by 1,000 percent per year, tripling every
three months, and Cisco is the direct beneficiary of that,'' said
Al Tobia, an analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. ``The
service providers have to add more and more gear from companies
like Cisco.'' Tobia has a strong buy recommendation on Cisco, with
a 12-month target price of $100. ``There is certainly money to be
made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is possible to admire Cisco the company without
recommending the stock at the current price. Paul Saghawa, an
analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, has a rather lonely ``hold'' on
Cisco, not because he dislikes it, but because he believes the
current multiple suggests a near-term growth rate that may not be
deliverable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me for a five-year picture, I believe Cisco will
emerge as a key supplier to the telecommunications industry,'' he
said. ``My problem is 1999. In order to make the numbers the Street
has assigned, Cisco needs 35 percent top-line growth.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if Cisco does not dominate the next generation of the
Internet, when true broadband services become universal? Paul
Johnson, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens, is widely
known as the original Cisco bull, but even he notes that no
industry leader has maintained dominance from one technology leap
to another.
</P>
<P>
   IBM dominated the mainframe computer business in the 60s,
Digital Equipment the minicomputer in the 70s, Microsoft the PC in
the 80s and Cisco the network in the 90s. Who comes next?
</P>
<P>
   ``To own Cisco at this point, you have to believe they own that
next big thing, and I'm not sure I believe that,'' Johnson said.
Still, he maintains a buy rating on Cisco, he said, because it is a
well-managed company that will continue to grow. ``I don't spend a
lot of time telling people to buy Cisco, but I do recommend it and
take credit for its going up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If you do believe in the next chapter of Cisco's story, how do
you buy shares? Michael Murphy, editor of California Technology
Stock Letter, suggests dollar-cost averaging _ buying a fixed
dollar amount on a fixed schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always going to be expensive,'' he said. ``If you wait
to buy on a value basis, you will never own Cisco.''

   BUSINESS BACKERS STILL CHEERING GOP &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are already debating whether their impeachment drive
will backfire in the 2000 elections. But they appear unlikely to
suffer defections by business leaders who back them. ``I'm proud of
the Republicans, in the face of the polls, doing what they think is
right,'' said Robert Mosbacher, President Bush's secretary of
Commerce and a Houston oilman.
</P>
<P>
   David H. Koch, a senior officer of Koch Industries, the nation's
second-largest private firm, says an ouster of President Clinton,
far from rattling the economy, might aid it. ``After Nixon was
removed from office, there was a huge improvement in morale,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some other leading Republican donors late last week were pushing
for a less radical solution. ``I would be satisfied, thinking about
the short-term interests of the country and the economy in
particular, with censure,'' said Harlan Crow, the Dallas
real-estate magnate. ``I'd like to have it over quickly.'' But,
with his 3-year-old son calling the president a liar when he sees
him on TV, Crow acknowledges having second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, head of the Center for Responsive Politics in
Washington, sees signs that even business leaders who have
questioned the Republicans' case might come to see the president's
resignation or removal as the quickest way to stability. `` `Enough
already' has helped the president,'' Makinson said. Should the
House vote to impeach, he added, ``that could kill him.''

   SILVER CUPS DON'T RUN OVER  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Victor Niederhoffer, the money manager who lost all his shirts
last year, marvels that his silver-trophy collection barely fetched
the price of a ``mediocre Impressionist painting.'' Sotheby's
raised $2.6 million Tuesday, in the middle range of its estimate.
``Apples and oranges,'' Kevin Tierney, the Sotheby's silver guru,
said of the comparison. ``Everybody, after all, can recognize a
Renoir over the mantlepiece.''
</P>
<P>
   The prize piece, a five-foot horn of plenty once owned by
Sweden's King Charles XV, was bought by an Ecuadorean collector for
$140,000. Niederhoffer said he didn't make a profit on the sale and
would use the proceeds to repay debts and cover college tuition
costs for his six children. He says he held onto just one item, the
Manchester Cup, bestowed upon the winner of the Steeple Chase in
Manchester, England, in 1904, to serve as a mascot for his new
firm, Manchester Trading LLC. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A PERILOUS PARALLEL FOR RUBIN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For almost as long as Robert E. Rubin has been Treasury
secretary, there have been rumors that he was about to leave his
post. His cabinet colleagues were convinced this summer he would be
gone by year-end if the markets only calmed. Then Russia's economy
collapsed, Wall Street swooned and Brazil needed a quick $40
billion. But after the Democrats' strong showing in November and
the Dow's comeback, the rumors resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Rubin has shrugged off the reports, saying he
plans to be around ``for some time'' _ defining ``some time'' with
the same fuzziness he reserves for discussion of exchange-rate
policy. Now, with the executive branch in turmoil, the assumption
at Treasury is that he cannot jump ship. So does Rubin feel like
Hugh McCulloch, President Andrew Johnson's Treasury secretary, who
not only stuck out the impeachment hearings but engineered a huge
tax cut along the way?
</P>
<P>
   The other afternoon, Rubin conceded that he has given little
thought to McCulloch. But wandering over to a framed print over the
credenza in his office, bearing the pictures of all past Treasury
secretaries, he declared: ``Here he is. Pleasant-looking fellow.''
McCulloch did a return run as Treasury secretary under Chester A.
Arthur in 1884-85. When Rubin heard that, he cringed.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   IVORY TOWER RETIREMENT POWER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TIAA-CREF, the private pension fund for teachers, urges schools
to put new hires into their retirement plans from Day One, even
though its own employees have to wait five years before they
qualify for benefits. But that seeming contradiction doesn't bother
John H. Biggs, the fund's chief executive. Professors at many
institutions often have to switch jobs to reach the Holy Grail of
tenure, he reasons, leaving fewer years for accumulating benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get them in right away,'' he said. By
contrast, many TIAA-CREF workers are clerical workers or people
right out of high school or college, who haven't yet settled on a
career. ``It's a different job market,'' he said. &QL;

AFTER THE GOLD RUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 20, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Universities move science from the laboratory to the
marketplace, supporting 250,000 jobs and contributing $30 billion
to the economy. Academic research improves the quality of life and
creates jobs.'' It was under that headline that the Association of
University Technology Managers last week released the results of
its annual survey.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to disagree, in general, with that?
</P>
<P>
   The data from its survey of the licensing activities of 175
member institutions are always interesting. But beyond the
commonplace that universities and hospitals are nurseries for for
new science that has practical applications, there is relatively
little in the report to support the authors' choice of verb.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to say it is the universities that are doing the
``moving?''
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly 20 years since the United States declared a
pell-mell gold rush on the intellectual property frontier. The time
has come to begin toting up the results. The vigorous association,
composed of lawyers, scientists, and other professional
intellectual property managers within universities, is one of the
indisputable fruits of the scramble. A lot of rich PhDs are
another.
</P>
<P>
   What else have we got to show for it?
</P>
<P>
   University and hospital technology managers date their modern
charter to 1980, when Congress passed a law directing them and
small businesses for the first time to patent and license
inventions developed under federally funded research programs. This
was the Bayh-Dole Act, sponsored by Senators Birch Bayh (D-Ind.)
and Bob Dole (R-Kan.); before it, technology transfer had happened
_ but haphazardly and lackadaisically.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Congress rationalized the patent procedure for
the first time in in 150 years, establishing a specialized
appellate court to hear patent cases, the Court of Appeals of the
Federal Circuit. Previously, patent cases had been heard in each
district in quite inconsistent ways. The new court quickly
strengthened patent protection.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, patenting surged in the United States. Having
fluctuated at a level of around 60,000 a year from 1945 until 1980,
patents by American inventors doubled in the 15 years after 1982.
Neither Japan, France, Germany, nor the United Kingdom display a
pattern since the mid-1980s anything like that. The European trends
remained flat; the steady Japanese increase that had been going on
since the 1950s leveled off in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the frontier of knowledge expanded
dramatically. The personal computer was invented. The Internet
boomed. The biotech revolution unfolded. And the health care system
underwent a dramatic transformation. And of course the US economy
grew vigorously, adding jobs and sending asset prices to record
levels.
</P>
<P>
   So what caused what? Did a stronger protection of intellectual
property rights precipitate a technological revolution? Or vice
versa? How well have the university middlemen managed their stream
of deals? What credit belongs to the shrewd money managers who,
starting in Boston and California in the years after World War II,
learned how to breath life into the markets for new technologies?
Only in the last few years have economists begun to measure and
assess the gold rush with a view to answering these questions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting attempts to appear is a paper by
Josh Lerner and Sam Kortum that asks, ``What's Behind the Recent
Surge in Patenting?'' Because Lerner is representative of a new
approach in the nation's leading business schools _ until recently,
they were citadels of self-delight _ it is worth briefly
considering the arc of his career.
</P>
<P>
   A 1982 graduate of Yale, he worked for several years in
Washington on issues in technological innovation and public policy
_ at the Brookings Institution, for a public-private partnership,
and on Capitol Hill. Then he did a PhD in economics at Harvard for
Zvi Griliches, the guru of R&AMP;D research, and moved to Harvard
Business School to teach venture capital with William Sahlman.
</P>
<P>
   Economists in the early 1990s were struggling to come to grips
with the mechanics of technological change. For many years, they
had simply assumed that it would take place at a fairly steady
rate, come what may; but new work had placed technology squarely
within the economic system.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to grips empirically with these ideas is not easy, as
Adam Jaffe of Brandeis University has written. Investigation
``requires confronting the reality that many of the relevant
activities...are carried out in institutions such as universities
and government laboratories, and may not be amenable to analysis
with the standard tools of the theory of the firm.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lerner teamed up with Boston University's Kortum with a view
to identifying and measuring some of the components of the ``black
box'' that previously had been labeled ``technological change.''
They started with the patent system, and quickly identified three
major theories of what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Friendly Court'' hypothesis held that the change in the
legal environment was crucial. A ``Fertile Technology'' hypothesis
saw a burgeoning technological revolution at the heart. A third
notion _ ``Regulatory Capture'' _ suspected that that the American
patent system had suddenly become far less friendly to foreign
inventors after 1982; hence a surge in ``home cooking'' by domestic
inventors.
</P>
<P>
   After the usual number of statistical and theoretical trials and
errors, Lerner and Kortum concluded that Friendly Court and
Regulatory Capture could be rejected, and that the Fertile
Technology hypothesis seemed to apply generally across the board.
It seemed therefore appropriate to credit ``changes in the
management of innovation'' for the surge in patents, including the
shift to more applied science.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what changes? Lerner himself has moved on to the next
likely suspect: venture capital and equity funding. He is among the
organizers (Brandeis' Jaffe and Yale's Jean Lanjouw are the others)
of a conference on patent policy and innovation in Santa Barbara.,
Calif., next month, sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic
Research. The idea is to bring together intellectual property
practitioners with well-equipped economic students of their work _
the better to gauge the effects of public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Sample paper titles: ``Do Patents Matter? Evidence After the
General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade''; ``The Determinants of
Patenting in the Computer and Semiconductor Industries''; ``Private
and Public Responses to the US Plant Variety Protection Act of
1970''; and ``Optical Patent Length and Breadth.''
</P>
<P>
   A great deal rides on the results of such new work. The great
gold rush into computers, telecommunications, biotech, and medicine
that commenced in earnest in the late 1970s may be winding down.
Soon the territories are going to have to settle down and become
the equivalent of law-governed states. Programs designed to
stimulate the settling of these frontiers will have to stand up to
a much higher level of scrutiny in the years to come.

HOUSE SETS STAGE FOR IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Unswayed by military conflict, House Republicans
Friday launched a determined final push for President Clinton's
impeachment in a showdown that bordered on a political morality
play.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's career at a perilous crossroads, the House surged
toward approving at least one article of impeachment Saturday
stemming from the president's extramarital affair with former White
House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Only a ``miracle'' will prevent Clinton's impeachment, his top
allies said, as Representative Henry J. Hyde, chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, vowed that GOP leaders will ``keep our
appointment with history'' by recommending the president's removal
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, apparently hoping to deliver the miracle
her husband will need, urged the country to ``practice
reconciliation'' and made plans to appear at the Capitol Saturday
for a Democratic caucus before the historic vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people's trust has been betrayed,'' Hyde said Friday at
the start of a climactic, 12-hour debate on Clinton's fate. ``Let's
declare unmistakably that perjury and obstruction of justice
disqualify a man from retaining the presidency of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats plan to walk out of the House chamber en masse
in protest Saturday after they are denied a vote on a censure
alternative. They intend to return in time to vote against the
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   During Friday's debate, Democrats decried the GOP's
pro-impeachment juggernaut as an obsessive crusade aimed at staging
a bloodless coup against Clinton as the latest act of retribution
in a partisan struggle that has roiled since the fall of President
Richard M. Nixon in the Watergate era.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are permitting a constitutional coup d'etat that will haunt
this body and the country forever,'' said Representative Edward J.
Markey, a Malden Democrat. ``A constitutional clause intended to
apply to a Benedict Arnold selling out his country will now be
expanded to cover every personal transgression.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the origin of the charges, a consensual sexual
relationship, Representative Barney Frank, a Newton Democrat, said,
``This House is launched on an historically tragic case of
selective moralizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders refused to postpone the debate despite
Democratic complaints that they could undermine the ongoing US
attack on Iraq by orchestrating what Representative Ike Skelton of
Missouri portrayed as ``the political decapitation of the commander
in chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they could agree on little else, members of both
parties agreed the impeachment clash coincided with the steady
decline of American political standards. The debate unfolded the
morning after the speaker-designate, Robert L. Livingston,
acknowledged his extramarital affairs following Roll Call
newspaper's disclosure of his infidelity on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In the bitter aftermath, Republicans accused Clinton's allies of
clandestinely engineering the episode, while Democrats said GOP
leaders are so bent on bringing down Clinton that they have
overzealously pursued charges stemming from the Lewinsky episode.
``The politics of smear and slash and burn must end,'' said House
Democratic leader Richard A. Gephardt, prompting a standing ovation
from lawmakers in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to turn away from extremism and inquisition and return
to a sense of moderation in our political system,'' Gephardt added
in pleading unsuccessfully for a vote on a censure alternative to
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Amid moments of high drama Friday, laced with seething tensions,
there were tears, jeers, and cheers, acrimony and anxiety. A week
before Christmas, the standoff stretched through the wintry day
after the House chaplain, the Rev. James D. Ford, opened the
proceedings by praying for love, unity, and understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, a Lutheran minister, read the Prayer of St. Francis of
Assisi, which he later said former speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr.
once told him was a sign that a grave issue was facing the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monsignor,'' Ford quoted O'Neill as telling him once, ``when
the going gets tough, you always reach for St. Francis.''
</P>
<P>
   The House impeachment debate is the first since the post-Civil
War era, when President Andrew Johnson survived a highly partisan
Senate trial in 1868 by a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces four charges in House Resolution 611: two counts
of perjury and one each of obstruction of justice and abuse of
power. The House is scheduled to vote on each article Saturday and
is expected to pass at least one perjury count by a narrow margin,
almost entirely on party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resolved that William Jefferson Clinton, president of the
United States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors and
that the following articles of impeachment be exhibited to the
United States Senate,'' the House reading clerk, Paul Hayes, said
solemnly to open the historic debate.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, dozens of Republicans strode to a wooden
podium to declare Clinton unfit for office because of allegations
that he engaged in an elaborate effort to cover up his affair with
Lewinsky. Many of them had withheld their opinions until Friday,
and none delivered good news for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the drumbeat of calls for Clinton's resignation
quickened during the day, even among several Democrats who have
said they oppose his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's behavior has been deplorable, reprehensible,
and immoral,'' said Representative William O. Lipinski, an Illinois
Democrat who plans to vote against the impeachment charges. ``I
think it would be best for the country if he would resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore downplayed the chance of Clinton
resigning. ``I think the results of a meteor strike are more likely
than the resignation of the president,'' Gore said. ``He is just
not going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In another setback for the White House, Representative Paul
McHale of Pennsylvania became the fourth Democrat to say he will
support Clinton's impeachment. Clinton also lost a key swing
Democrat, Representative Charles W. Stenholm of Texas, who said,
``It is clear that the president's actions are sufficient to charge
him with high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton picking up no undeclared member who had not been
expected to back him, his top allies abandoned all pretense that he
might elude impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, asked about the best development that Clinton's
supporters could hope for Friday, said, ``A flood.''
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, the White House began gauging Clinton's
support in the Senate, where he is believed to have the 34 votes he
would need to block impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet House Democrats spared little in their final assault on the
impeachment resolution and its Republican backers.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the showdown spilled into the stately speaker's
lobby, as Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, a Rhode Island
Democrat, angrily confronted one of the most ardent impeachment
advocates, Representative Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, on the House floor, had accused Clinton of committing ``a
frontal assault on the Constitution'' and had quoted President John
F. Kennedy as saying, ``Americans are free to disagree with the
law, but not to disobey it.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Kennedy, the president's nephew, stepped into a throng
of reporters who were interviewing Barr and cited the Georgian's
address last year to a group that promotes white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Barr, anybody who has been to a racist crowd like that has
no right invoking my uncle's memory,'' Kennedy shouted.
</P>
<P>
   The two exchanged several gibes before Kennedy stormed off.
``The nerves are a little bit raw,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said later, ``When you have people with racist
backgrounds like that invoking my uncle and railroading this
president, I guess you can say tensions are high and frustrations
are great.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the debate alternately had the flavor of a dime-store
romance, a detective novel, a constitutional law thesis, and a
partisan position paper. There was wrangling over intimate details
of the Lewinsky affair, the four-year investigation of Clinton by
the independent counsel, and weighty issues involving the
separation of powers and world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In defending the refusal to permit a censure alternative,
Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., a Wisconsin Republican,
cited a 1970s account of Watergate that quoted O'Neill as telling
the Republican leader at the time that he was ``bitterly opposed''
to allowing a censure vote on an impeachment resolution against
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   That brought Representative J. Joseph Moakley, a South Boston
Democrat and longtime friend of O'Neill, to the House floor. ``In
1974, when Richard Nixon was being considered for impeachment,''
Moakley said, ``Thomas P. O'Neill was not speaker of the House.
Carl Albert was. Furthermore, no resolution to impeach President
Nixon ever came to the House. President Nixon resigned before that
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, the president met for an hour at the White House
with Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut, one of the
few undeclared Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   As day turned to night and the House spectator galleries began
to thin, two Massachusetts Democrats who serve on the Judiciary
Committee _ Representatives William D. Delahunt of Quincy and
Martin T. Meehan of Lowell _ spearheaded Clinton's legal defense
amid unrelenting criticism from Republican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Both are former county prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we prepare to render our verdict on President Clinton, the
American people, and history itself, are sitting in judgment on
us,'' Delahunt said. ``And I believe they will judge us harshly
because we have failed in our duty to the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan struck a similar theme: ``I am sick at heart, for I fear
that the words used to describe the Johnson impeachment will come
to characterize what this House is about to do _ impeach based not
on reason but on rancor.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, a Brighton Democrat who did
not seek reelection, is one of nearly 40 House members who will
cast their final House votes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, he attributed the impeachment crisis to a
group of conservative House Republicans ``who cannot find
forgiveness'' for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so sorry the final vote I cast here on the House floor is
going to be on an issue that is so partisan in nature,'' Kennedy
said.

<P>
   When it comes to receiving, many of America's chief executives
have clearly been reaping fortunes. When it comes to giving,
however, the picture is a lot murkier.
</P>
<P>
   After all, charity, though tax-subsidized, is a personal matter.
Some of the best-paid corporate titans advertise their donations _
witness the recent $100 million gift from William H. Gates of
Microsoft for childhood vaccinations or Ted Turner's $1 billion
pledge to the United Nations.
 &UR;  &LR;  But others, like John F. Welch Jr. of General Electric, say their
giving is nobody else's business and disclose only what the tax
laws demand. (Public records show only that Welch's charitable
foundation gave away $134,186 last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the huge sums that many chief executives are making in
this era of bull markets and stock options, they are increasingly
being seen as standard-setters in philanthropy. ``It's important to
give money away,'' Turner said, ``because the needs are so great
and such great wealth is being accumulated.''
</P>
<P>
   So Money and Business set out to survey the charitable giving of
a sampling of the best-paid chief executives at the nation's 500
biggest companies. For this article, ``pay'' was defined broadly,
to include all the earnings an executive could have given away last
year if he so chose: salary, bonus, other cash compensation and
gains from the exercise of stock options _ plus gains from options
he elected not to exercise. (The pay data were calculated by Graef
Crystal, a compensation expert in San Diego.)
</P>
<P>
   By that definition, the pay packages of the 12 executives in the
sampling ranged from $471.4 million for Michael D. Eisner, chairman
of the Walt Disney Co &UR; . &LR; , to $110.4 million for Louis V. Gerstner
Jr., chairman of IBM. And beyond their pay, of course, some of
these executives have other fortunes _ from smart investing or
earlier jobs. Four of the 12 are on the latest Forbes magazine list
of the 400 richest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the executives' giving is harder to come by than
the numbers on their pay. Money and Business reviewed the public
records of the business leaders' personal foundations, talked to
people familiar with their giving, interviewed company officials
and, when they would come to the phone, spoke with the executives
themselves.
 &UR;  &LR;  Those who were unwilling to answer questions may be donating more
than is publicly disclosed, but it is impossible to know.
</P>
<P>
   The available evidence shows that extremely rich executives can
be extremely generous. Eli Broad, chairman of SunAmerica, the
insurer in Los Angeles, gave away $11.6 million last year. Sanford
I. Weill, chairman of Citigroup, pledged $100 million, over an
undisclosed number of years, to the medical school at Cornell
University, his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest earners are not necessarily the biggest
givers. Charles A. Heimbold Jr., chairman of Bristol Myers-Squibb,
had a total pay package of $146.14 million and wrote checks last
year for $5 million to a range of charities. The pay package of
Eugene M. Isenberg, chairman of Nabors Industries, a Houston oil
drilling company, was one-third higher, totaling $209.6 million,
and he gave away $2.5 million _ half as much as Heimbold, and about
five times as much, Isenberg said, as he gives in an average year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To know people's income, sex or age won't give you much
insight into their charitable giving or enable you to predict it,''
said Ann Kaplan, editor of Giving USA, an annual report on
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest corporate chief on the list is just discovering
charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only in the past two years that I felt I had the
wherewithal to give away money,'' said Stephen M. Case, 40, the
chairman of America Online, whose personal foundation over that
time has grown from $1 million in assets to more than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, personal giving is not the only option for corporate
executives. Many can, and do, exercise control over their
companies' donations _ a source of status not available to the
average giver. Such donations can leave executives in high demand
as board members and community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Not all chief executives are involved in their companies'
foundations. And some, including Isenberg, do not believe in
corporate philanthropy. In other cases, corporate giving mirrors
the chief executive's interests; that is the case for IBM and
Gerstner, a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the size of their giving, the wealthiest executives are
often quite ordinary when it comes to choosing recipients. Like
many other people, they direct much of what they give to religious,
educational and health care causes. And their friends and
colleagues often get them involved.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bishop Edward M. Egan, the head of the Roman
Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport, Conn., it was Welch who prompted
Gerstner and Lawrence J. Bossidy, chairman of the Allied Signal
Corp., to become active in the Inner City Foundation, which
supports educational and charitable programs, primarily for
Catholic institutions but also for other religious and charitable
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Gerstner was chairman of a recent dinner that raised $1.2
million for the foundation. He also gave $1 million to Faith in the
Future, a program run by Egan that supports Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
   Both Welch and Bossidy also donate money to the Sankaty Head
Foundation, which provides college scholarships for caddies at the
Sankaty Head Golf Club &UR;  &LR; on Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack and Larry always get the best caddies,'' one longtime
member joked.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the third day of the air assault on Iraq, the
Pentagon said Friday that it was able to confirm that only 18 of
its 89 targets had been severely damaged or destroyed, despite
waves of bombers and more laser-guided cruise missiles than were
hurled at Iraq during the gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq, showed defiance toward
the United States in his first televised address since the attacks
began, calling his attackers ``the agents of Satan.'' U.S. military
planes rained thousands of leaflets on Iraq warning ground troops
that if they mobilized they would face bombing raids from the
forces assembled on aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf and at
bases scattered around the region.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was scheduled to meet Saturday with his
national security advisers to talk about how long the air campaign
would continue, but the Pentagon suggested the bombing would go on
into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, at about 4 a.m. Saturday (8 p.m. Friday Eastern time),
another air raid was reported under way in Baghdad, according to
news services dispatches from the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing Friday afternoon, the military released the first
detailed assessment of the damage inflicted on Iraq in the largest
military strike ever ordered by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to say exactly how many laser-guided cruise
missiles and conventional bombs were hurled against Iraq this week,
Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
more cruise missiles were launched in the first two days of the air
campaign than the 290 or so missiles that were showered on Iraq in
1991. Each of the flying, computer-guided bombs costs about $1
million. Cruise missiles were not the main weapon of the 1991 air
war against Iraq, which relied much more heavily on bombs dropped
from B-52 airplanes. But Pentagon planners are anxious to keep the
risk of casualties to an absolute minimum in this operation, and
cruise missiles do not require human pilots or crews. Cruise
missiles also present a lower risk of civilian casualties in Iraq,
since they are far more accurate than bombs dropped from overhead,
even laser-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, seeming anxious not to offer the sort of inflated
damage assessments that embarrassed the Pentagon during the gulf
war, acknowledged that the results of the U.S. and British air
campaign had been mixed so far.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports from the first two nights of air strikes on Iraq
showed that the Pentagon was able to confirm that only 18 of the 88
targets had been severely damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The targets included military command centers, missile
factories, television and radio transmitters and an oil refinery in
the southern Iraq city of Basra, which the United States said was
being used for oil exports in violation of United Nations economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   According to the initial assessment, the Pentagon was able to
confirm that of its 89 targets, 8 had been destroyed completely,
including an Iraqi air defense site; 10 were severely damaged,
including the Iraqi military intelligence headquarters; 18 were
moderately damaged; 8 were lightly damaged, and 12 had not been
damaged at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department said it had no assessments yet for damage
to the other 33 targets, including the Basra refinery and several
facilities believed to have been used for the production of
chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had some very good success with our strikes, but not
all of them have gone exactly as planned,'' Shelton said at a news
conference in the Pentagon, where he released videotape of
laser-guided bombs slamming into a variety of targets.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials continued to insist that
the goal of its military campaign was not to to destabilize the
Iraqi government or encourage a coup against Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon confirmed reports by the Iraqi government that
U.S. warplanes had dropped tens of thousands of leaflets on Iraqi
troops in the southern part of the country, informing them that
``only those units that support the Baghdad regime'' are being
targeted for attack by U.S. missiles and bombers.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflets, which were printed in Arabic, bore photographs of
the charred hulks of Iraqi tanks destroyed during the 1991 gulf
war. ``Your unit has not been targeted but it is being watched,''
the leaflets said, warning the soldiers not to mobilize.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Radio Free Iraq, the seven-week-old
U.S.-sponsored radio network beamed into Iraq and described by the
Iraqi government as an anti-Saddam propaganda machine, said that it
had expanded its programming to Iraq to four hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Arabic-language radio network insisted that
the programs were straightforward news broadcasts but acknowledged
that they also reported on the activities of Iraqi opposition
groups.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing its bombing reports Friday, the United States said
that it had targeted television and radio transmission towers in
hopes of cutting off communication from the central government in
Baghdad to Iraqi troops and the public, and it was unclear how many
Iraqis may have seen Saddam's defiant television address.
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, the Iraqi leader, dressed in a military uniform
and seated beside an Iraqi flag, with an enormous bouquet of red
flowers on the table in front of him, offered fierce words that
contrasted sharply what U.S. military officials have described as
the feeble response of his military to the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``By God, we will not compromise,'' he thundered in the taped
address, which was broadcast shortly before air-raid sirens sounded
in Baghdad to mark the start of the third night of air strikes.
``We stand against the barbaric way of those that have used our
airspace to launch an aggression against our people. A curse on the
agents of Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked Iraqis to ``continue resistance and attack in the name
of God and may the criminals lose.'' He added, ``We will fear
nothing but God and we will not kneel except to the face of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders at the Pentagon said Friday night they were
closely studying new bombing reports from the third day of air
strikes to determine when they they could halt the air campaign,
which they hope to do this weekend given the imminent start of
Ramadan, the month of religious reflection that begins Saturday and
is the holiest time in the Islamic calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sensitive to the issue of Ramadan and will take that
into account,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said in an
interview Friday night on CNN. ``But there is no fixed end time. We
have to keep some flexibility''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the air strikes would continue until the United
States and Britain determined that the bombing had accomplished
done significant damage to Iraq's ability to make chemical and
biological weapons. ``Once those missions are completed, the
mission will end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the United States might halt the air strikes this
weekend but make clear that bombing would resume after Ramadan
unless Iraq allows United Nations weapons inspectors to resume
their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not over by a long shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and other diplomats sought Friday to heal a rift in relations with
Russia, which has harshly criticized the air strikes on Iraq and
withdrew its ambassador to Washington in protest.
</P>
<P>
   And violent anti-American protests were reported in several Arab
capitals, with many demonstrators claiming that Clinton had
launched the attacks to divert attention from the impeachment
debate in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen insisted at a news conference that the political crisis
here was having no effect on the ability of U.S. forces to carry
out the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to speculate at this point that those people
involved in this operation are focused on one thing, and that's
carrying out the mission,'' he said. ``Whatever else is going on at
this particular moment is probably of little concern to them until
they carry out their mission.''

CLINTON'S DAY OF RECKONING AT HAND 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time in 130 years, the House on
Friday began debating the impeachment of a president, deliberations
heavy with bitter, partisan rhetoric against a backdrop of
international crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Poised to impeach President Clinton for trying to conceal his
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, Republicans
invoked their duty to uphold the Constitution, while his Democratic
defenders condemned the proceedings as unfair and counter to the
will of the people.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on the four articles of impeachment _ two accuse Clinton
of perjury, one alleges obstruction of justice, and one accuses him
of abuse of office _ were set for a vote before noon, EST,
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of sex. Sexual misconduct and adultery are
private acts and are none of the Congress' business,'' said
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill. ``The matter before
the House is a question of willful, premeditated, deliberate
corruption of the nation's system of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt said the House GOP
leadership had rejected the course of ``moderation'' and ``common
sense'' by refusing consideration of a censure resolution, an
alternative favored by Democrats and two dozen moderate
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to vote your vote of conscience and I respect that
right,'' the Missouri Democrat said to the Republicans, who hold a
228-206 majority. ``All we're asking for is that we get to vote our
conscience,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   While House members debated into the late hours Friday, the
president was monitoring U.S. air strikes against Iraq. For the
third day, U.S. air and naval forces attacked Iraqi military
targets.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N.-sanctioned strikes began Wednesday, which angered
Republicans when House leaders decided to delay the impeachment
debate set for Thursday. Less than 24 hours later, GOP leaders,
worried that holiday plans by some members might reduce their slim
edge, decided to forge ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the nation emerged from the Civil War, when Andrew
Johnson was in the White House, has a president been accused of
``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' the constitutional standard for
removal. Johnson was impeached by the House, but the Senate fell
one vote short of the two-thirds needed to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee recommended articles of
impeachment against President Nixon in the wake of the Watergate
scandal. A week later, before the full House took up the matter,
Nixon resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, a telephone survey of House members by The
Associated Press found 219 lawmakers saying they would support at
least one article of impeachment, one more than the majority needed
to send the president's case to the Senate. Another 201 members
were opposed.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times/CBS News Poll released Friday found 62 percent
of Americans want their representatives to vote against
impeachment. By a 2-1 margin, Americans said the debate should have
been delayed until the Iraqi showdown was over. At the same time,
six in 10 Americans said Republicans in Congress were out of touch
with the public's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also shows 40 percent of Americans saying it would be
better for the country if Clinton resigns should the House impeach
him.
</P>
<P>
   Reconciled to being impeached, Clinton and his lawyers have
turned their attention to preparing his defense before the Senate,
White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The president was considering making a statement after
Saturday's voting, aides said. Before the vote, House Democrats
were anticipating a private meeting at the Capitol with first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has vowed repeatedly not to resign, and Vice President
Al Gore on Friday renewed that vow, saying ``the results of a
meteor strike are more likely than the resignation of the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who would assume the presidency if Clinton
quits or is removed before his term expires in January 2001, said
Republicans are ``dead wrong'' to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said in an interview with the American Urban Radio network:
``And they (the Republicans) think people are not going to remember
this. Well I think they may be dead wrong about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Debate on the four articles of impeachment began shortly after
the House convened at 9 a.m. EST, but not before the Republican
majority had to turn back, 225-183, a move by Democrats to adjourn
until Iraq air strikes cease.
</P>
<P>
   Once the parliamentary debate began, many members drifted into
the cloak rooms, corridors or to their offices to watch the
proceedings by television. For most of the day, the public
galleries were half full. Shortly before noon, the lines of
tourists waiting to get into the Capitol to watch the historic
debate were shorter that the lines of people waiting to get into
the National Gallery to see the Van Gogh exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the debate, presiding officer Rep. Ray LaHood,
R-Ill., read from the House rules about prohibitions against
engaging in ``generally personal, abusive language toward the
president, and also in engaging in comparisons to personal conduct
of sitting members'' of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Loud groans and hisses rose from the Democratic side. Rep.
Albert Wynn, D-Md., said, ``The hypocrisy of the situation speaks
for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not the last use of the word hypocrisy, a not-so-veiled
reference to Speaker-elect Bob Livingston's confession Thursday
night to several instances of carrying on sexual affairs and
misleading a reporter who raised questions about the Louisiana
lawmaker's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the day, Livingston was missing from the House
chamber. He was expected to address his colleagues Saturday. Also
missing from the debate is current Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.,
who is quitting the House at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Their absence was noted by Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat
who said he and most Americans are ``disgusted'' with the GOP
refusal to consider a resolution rebuking the president instead of
impeaching him. Doggett characterized the proceedings ``as so
shameful that neither ... Mr. Gingrich or Mr. Livingston will
preside'' over the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, said: ``Whatever happens,
whether the president is impeached or not, our nation will endure.
We are a strong people, and we have a Constitution that works.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Rep. John Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the
Judiciary Committee, who served in Congress during Watergate,
accused the GOP leadership of misusing impeachment in its effort to
end Clinton's presidency. ``Impeachment was designed to rid this
nation of traitors and tyrants, not attempts to cover up an
extramarital affair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate at times was emotional as lawmakers shuffled to the
microphone, some reading from remarks they had written in longhand,
others from typed notes with revisions scribbled in the margins.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Dickey, a Republican who represents the area of Arkansas
where Clinton grew up, was near tears as he defended his decision
to support impeachment over the objections of many Arkansans. ``The
issue today is no longer the character of Bill Clinton, it is about
the character of the nation,'' Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   While LaHood made frequent use of his gavel to maintain decorum
in the House chamber, his authority did not extend to nearby
corridors where Democrats railed about the Republican witch hunt
and lynch mobs. GOP members angrily accused the White House of
feeding the news media tips about Livingston's adultery.

END TO BOMB CAMPAIGN AGAINST IRAQ WEIGHED 
</HEADLINE>
 LEDE-WRITETHRU-BOS  
 (Updates lede with Saturday meeting, edits throughout: i and w
coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will meet Saturday morning with
his national security advisers to discuss whether US and British
forces have damaged Iraq enough to end the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A decision to halt Operation Desert Fox would represent a
dramatic turnaround from Friday afternoon, when the Pentagon
released data showing that the airstrikes from the previous two
days had struck some targets with deadly force but left more
untouched or just slightly bruised.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts inferred from the data that the bombing would have
to go on for a while longer if Clinton intended to inflict serious
damage on Saddam Hussein's military power.
</P>
<P>
   However, political and diplomatic factors may be coming to the
fore, driven in part by the Islamic holiday of Ramadan, which
started at dawn Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Airstrikes appeared to intensify Friday night, possibly as part
of an effort to hit some targets again. Weapons have included
cruise missiles dropped by B-52 bombers and fired from ships, as
well as several types of combat planes dropping laser-guided bombs,
although Baghdad has reportedly been hit only by cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   US officials, from Clinton on down, have repeatedly said the aim
was to ``degrade'' or ``diminish'' Hussein's ability to threaten
his neighbors with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. By that
vague definition, Clinton could stop the strikes any time. But as
of Friday, the strikes' results have not been very significant by
military measures.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen said Friday that he was
``satisfied'' with the results of Operation Desert Fox so far, but
added, ``The strikes are not complete.''
</P>
<P>
   General Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
heralded ``some very good success with our strikes,'' and showed a
few videotapes of direct hits. ``Not all of them have gone
according to plan,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The information released by the Pentagon Friday was noteworthy
on its own. Some analysts said US officials released comprehensive
data on ``bomb-damage assessment'' for the first time during any
military operation. The Pentagon also released spy-satellite
photographs showing how a number of targets looked before and after
an attack.
</P>
<P>
   The data showed that, over the first two nights, US and British
forces attacked 89 targets in Iraq, striking 77.
</P>
<P>
   Of those hit, eight were destroyed, 10 were severely damaged, 18
moderately damaged, and seven only lightly damaged. The damage
inflicted on 33 targets, over one-third of those attacked, had not
yet been assessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very early in the assessment,'' Rear Admiral
Thomas Wilson, the Joint Staff's director of intelligence, told
reporters. ``It is a very incomplete picture. . . . We haven't even
looked at all the targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the data available suggest that, by any purely military
criteria, the operation itself is at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're off to a really encouraging start, but it looks to me
like they've got a long ways to go,'' John Pike, a weapons analyst
at the Federation of American Scientists, said after examining the
data. ``There's an awful lot of `light to moderate damage,' but I
don't see very much in the `destroyed' or `severe damage'
columns.''
</P>
<P>
   The results seem particularly unimpressive for the attacks on
the main target of this campaign: the facilities that develop,
produce, store, and protect Hussein's nuclear, chemical, and
biological weapons. Of 19 targets attacked that relate to the
security of these weapons, two were destroyed, one was severely
damaged, four were lightly damaged, and one was missed.
</P>
<P>
   Of 11 targets attacked that involved the production of weapons,
none were reported destroyed or severely damaged, though eight of
them are still being assessed for damage by intelligence
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if many weapons missed their targets or whether
the weapons were simply too small to do much damage to these
targets, many of which are quite large.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise missiles and laser-guided bombs range from 1,000 to
2,000 pounds in explosive energy. That is enough to demolish small
structures or punch holes in large ones, but not enough to wreck,
say, a large office building or a blast-resistant hangar.
</P>
<P>
   Targets included missile-production factories, intelligence
headquarters, communications transmitters, airfields,
security-guard barracks, air defense sites, and the only
``economic'' target, a refinery in Basra that reportedly has been
used to export oil in violation of UN sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials declined to comment on reports that they have
avoided bombing Iraqi chemical plants, for fear of releasing deadly
substances. However, Shelton noted they have not gone after
``dual-use'' facilities that make both chemical weapons and
civilian products.
</P>
<P>
   There has apparently been no resistance by Iraqi military
forces, other than scattered and ineffective antiaircraft artillery
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Officials refuse to say how many weapons have been launched at
these targets, though they have acknowledged that over 300 cruise
missiles have been fired, at roughly $1 million apiece. They have
also said over 80 strike aircraft have dropped weapons, with most
carrying two to four laser-guided bombs; that is at least an
additional 200, or over 500 weapons in all.
</P>
<P>
   All this suggests each of the 89 targets has received, on
average, the firepower from at least five weapons. Some no doubt
were hit by more, others with fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials have raised the possibility of an early end to
the airstrikes, due to the Islamic Ramadan holiday. Cohen said he
was sensitive to this factor, but emphasized it would not determine
the course of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan has not stopped wars in the past. The 1973 Arab-Israeli
war took place during Ramadan. The Iran-Iraq war went on for eight
years with no breaks for the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   National security adviser Sandy Berger said Friday that Ramadan
``is not an automatic deadline'' to end the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign that military officers are looking toward a much
longer operation was the announcement Friday that more armed forces
are continuing to come into the Persian Gulf area.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Carl Vinson, an aircraft carrier, and its battle group
were expected in the area Friday night. Additional troops and
weapons just started to load up from US shores Friday, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Friday that bombs are not the only things
US aircraft were dropping on Iraq. They said A-10 attack planes
have dropped leaflets on Iraqi soldiers in the southern part of the
country, warning them not to invade Kuwait again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraqi soldiers, save yourselves!'' one pamphlet reads. ``Only
those units who support the Baghdad regime were targeted. Your unit
was not targeted, but it is being watched. . . . Stay in your
positions. Do not head south.''

STUMPEL'S SLUMP HAS KINGS STUMPED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ He arrived and immediately performed as
advertised, instantly becoming the Kings' best center since they'd
traded a guy named Wayne Gretzky a couple of years before that.
</P>
<P>
   But as the midway point of Jozef Stumpel's second season as a
King draws near, the memories of his impressive arrival grow dim,
almost as dim as the hopes the Kings (8-19-3) have of reaching the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel's statistics limp off the page: One goal in the 17 games
this season. Two goals in the final 21 regular-season games last
year. One goal in the playoffs. Four goals in his last 42 games
overall.
</P>
<P>
   And he's supposed to be the Kings' best and most important
offensive player.
</P>
<P>
   There have been injuries, to be sure, and the 26-year-old
Stumpel's reputation has been built more on passing than shooting.
But four goals in 42 games? Philadelphia's John LeClair and Florida
rookie Mark Parrish each scored that many this season _ in one
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying everything,'' said Stumpel, a native of Slovakia,
who had 22 goals last season and was 10th in NHL scoring with 79
points. ``It looks like nothing wants to go in.''
</P>
<P>
   The bummer of 42 began on Feb. 28, when Stumpel went without a
goal in a loss to the St. Louis Blues. One game became three and
then he was sidelined four games with a bruised kidney. When he
returned, he went goal-less five more games, and by the end of the
Kings' playoff run, Stumpel scored only three goals in 25 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the time, he doesn't shoot enough,'' said
Kings coach Larry Robinson, whose slumping team begins a three-game
trip tonight in St. Louis. ``He's always looking to make that next
play. That's his biggest problem. He's got a hell of a shot. He
just doesn't use it enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel's reluctance was evident in Thursday's 5-4 overtime loss
to the New York Islanders. He passed up a good scoring opportunity
late in the third period to make an extra pass that misfired. But
Robinson was displeased after the game with much more than Stumpel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's playing well, he's getting involved, jumping on
loose pucks, finishing checks,'' Robinson said. ``If he doesn't get
involved in the play, he's not at his best. When he's at his best,
he's playing physically and doing all those little things.''
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel, who had 58 assists last season but has only five this
year, began the season injured, though he didn't tell anybody his
hip was bothering him until after he'd gone scoreless through four
games. He then was in and out of the lineup for more than a month,
with the hip injury and a sprained ankle, and his statistics
suffered as a result. But Robinson says injuries alone cannot be
blamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting pretty much frustrated,'' Stumpel said. ``I can't
figure it out even myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this is not the first time Stumpel has struggled
during his six-year NHL career. The biggest knock against him when
he was with Boston was a lack of consistency. During the 1995
lockout season, he scored just five goals in 44 games.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1996-97 season, in which he had 76 points, the Bruins
traded Stumpel and winger Sandy Moger to the Kings for center
Dmitri Khristich _ who is among the NHL's scoring leaders this
season _ and Byron Dafoe _ who has emerged as a top-flight goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the impetus for the deal was an impending contract
impasse between Stumpel and the Bruins. After the trade, Stumpel
signed a two-year, $3-million deal with the Kings that expires
after this season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Stumpel's struggles, Robinson remains patient, insisting
he expects his No. 1 center to snap out of his slump. ``Eventually,
the goals will go in,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Stumpel, ``I don't know what I should do. Maybe I should
close my eyes and shoot. If that's going to work, I'd do it every
time.''

data on ``bomb-damage assessment'' for the first time during any
military operation. The Pentagon also released spy-satellite
photographs showing how a number of targets looked before and after
an attack.
</P>
<P>
   The data showed that, over the first two nights, US and British
forces attacked 89 targets in Iraq, striking 77.
</P>
<P>
   Of those hit, eight were destroyed, 10 were severely damaged, 18
moderately damaged, and seven only lightly damaged. The damage
inflicted on 33 targets, over one-third of those attacked, had not
yet been assessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very early in the assessment,'' Rear Admiral
Thomas Wilson, the Joint Staff's director of intelligence, told
reporters. ``It is a very incomplete picture. . . . We haven't even
looked at all the targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the data available suggest that, by any purely military
criteria, the operation itself is at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're off to a really encouraging start, but it looks to me
like they've got a long ways to go,'' John Pike, a weapons analyst
at the Federation of American Scientists, said after examining the
data. ``There's an awful lot of `light to moderate damage,' but I
don't see very much in the `destroyed' or `severe damage'
columns.''
</P>
<P>
   The results seem particularly unimpressive for the attacks on
the main target of this campaign: the facilities that develop,
produce, store, and protect Hussein's nuclear, chemical, and
biological weapons. Of 19 targets attacked that relate to the
security of these weapons, two were destroyed, one was severely
damaged, four were lightly damaged, and one was missed.
</P>
<P>
   Of 11 targets attacked that involved the production of weapons,
none were reported destroyed or severely damaged, though eight of
them are still being assessed for damage by intelligence
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if many weapons missed their targets or whether
the weapons were simply too small to do much damage to these
targets, many of which are quite large.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise missiles and laser-guided bombs range from 1,000 to
2,000 pounds in explosive energy. That is enough to demolish small
structures or punch holes in large ones, but not enough to wreck,
say, a large office building or a blast-resistant hangar.
</P>
<P>
   Targets included missile-production factories, intelligence
headquarters, communications transmitters, airfields,
security-guard barracks, air defense sites, and the only
``economic'' target, a refinery in Basra that reportedly has been
used to export oil in violation of UN sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials declined to comment on reports that they have
avoided bombing Iraqi chemical plants, for fear of releasing deadly
substances. However, Shelton noted they have not gone after
``dual-use'' facilities that make both chemical weapons and
civilian products.
</P>
<P>
   There has apparently been no resistance by Iraqi military
forces, other than scattered and ineffective antiaircraft artillery
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Officials refuse to say how many weapons have been launched at
these targets, though they have acknowledged that over 300 cruise
missiles have been fired, at roughly $1 million apiece. They have
also said over 80 strike aircraft have dropped weapons, with most
carrying two to four laser-guided bombs; that is at least an
additional 200, or over 500 weapons in all.
</P>
<P>
   All this suggests each of the 89 targets has received, on
average, the firepower from at least five weapons. Some no doubt
were hit by more, others with fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials have raised the possibility of an early end to
the airstrikes, due to the Islamic Ramadan holiday. Cohen said he
was sensitive to this factor, but emphasized it would not determine
the course of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan has not stopped wars in the past. The 1973 Arab-Israeli
war took place during Ramadan. The Iran-Iraq war went on for eight
years with no breaks for the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   National security adviser Sandy Berger said Friday that Ramadan
``is not an automatic deadline'' to end the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign that military officers are looking toward a much
longer operation was the announcement Friday that more armed forces
are continuing to come into the Persian Gulf area.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Carl Vinson, an aircraft carrier, and its battle group
were expected in the area Friday night. Additional troops and
weapons just started to load up from US shores Friday, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Friday that bombs are not the only things
US aircraft were dropping on Iraq. They said A-10 attack planes
have dropped leaflets on Iraqi soldiers in the southern part of the
country, warning them not to invade Kuwait again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraqi soldiers, save yourselves!'' one pamphlet reads. ``Only
those units who support the Baghdad regime were targeted. Your unit
was not targeted, but it is being watched. . . . Stay in your
positions. Do not head south.''

KINGS TRADE FOR AUDETTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. - Los Angeles Kings general manager Dave
Taylor beat the holiday roster freeze and improved his slumping
team at minimal cost Friday, acquiring the rights to veteran right
wing Donald Audette from the Buffalo Sabres for a second-round
draft choice in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Audette, 29, has not played this season while trying to resolve
a contract dispute with the Sabres. The restricted free agent
signed a two-year, $3.6-million contract with the Kings after the
trade was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Audette, who had 24 goals and 44 points for the defensive-minded
Sabres last year, is expected to be in the lineup tonight when the
Kings begin a three-game trip in St. Louis, and among the things he
brings is the right-handed shot that the team has needed to improve
its power play. With the additions of Audette and rookie right wing
Pavel Rosa - who scored two goals in his NHL debut Thursday - the
Kings have added two right-handed shots in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to change my role,'' said the 5-foot-8,
184-pound Audette. ``I think my role is scoring goals, playing hard
and showing up every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said, ``I think he brings some qualities to the team that
we can use. He's a proven goal-scorer, he's good on the power play,
he plays with some grit and he goes to the net hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (8-19-3) have struggled all season, and most trade
speculation had focused on higher-profile players who were sitting
out for one reason or another while in disputes with their teams.
</P>
<P>
   But to acquire Vancouver holdout Pavel Bure, or New York
Islanders star Zigmund Palffy, the price would have been
considerably higher, in terms of dollars the Kings would have had
to pay Bure or Palffy and players the Kings would have had to give
up to complete a trade. Palffy signed a five-year, $25-million deal
with the Islanders on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some good young prospects in the system we don't
necessarily want to give up,'' said Taylor, adding that he does not
expect to make another deal before the eight-day holiday trading
freeze begins today.
</P>
<P>
   Audette, a native of Laval, Quebec, had a rather strange
holdout, at times seeking less money than the Sabres were offering
because, under terms of the NHL's collective bargaining agreement,
if he made below the league average, it ultimately would enable him
to become an unrestricted free agent. Audette said he at no point
believed he would have to sit out the entire season, a belief that
became reality with Friday's trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, I probably would have considered Europe,''
Audette said. ``But as long as we were talking to other teams, I
knew something would happen. I love the game too much to miss an
entire season.''

 &HT;    Public reacts to Iraq invasion
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On a day when The History Channel could have
gone live _ impeachment here, bombing there _ life rolled along as
usual for the members of Alley Oops in their Friday Night Early
Birds league.
</P>
<P>
   Five people. One bowling team. A cross-section of what has
become the greatest divide in American politics, a rift far deeper
than Democrats vs. Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On one side: Who cares? On the other: Who couldn't?
</P>
<P>
   And during a period of bombs and bombshells, the division was a
bright line as the Alley Oops members _ folks who have bowled
together on Friday nights for almost two years but never talk
politics with each other _ tried to climb from eighth place in the
14-team league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pay attention to any of it,'' said Michael Skurka, a
single, 38-year-old state computer specialist carrying a 150
average into Friday's competition. ``I heard about the bombing from
someone else. I don't pay any attention to the news.''
</P>
<P>
   He views the impeachment process as overpublicized,
``insignificant'' and ``irrelevant'' to his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will effect my life, but in a way I have no control over,''
said Skurka, expressing the views of the politically disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of talk that confounds teammate Merlene Taylor, a
65-year-old who spends much of her time doing water colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why people aren't interested in politics,''
said Taylor, who spent Friday night working on her 120 average at
Showplace Lanes in North Austin. ``It influences them in everything
they do. And it is going to influence us a lot if he gets
impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, an independent who voted for Bill Clinton in 1992 and
1996, said she believes that the president deserves punishment but
that the process should be put on hold until the bombing in Iraq is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Taylor, Merlene's husband and teammate, also can't
understand why so many people can't get interested in history being
played out live.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be off to the side for most people. That does
surprise me. People ought to be more interested because it does
have a direct effect on us, on the way our government runs,'' said
Jerry Taylor, a state employee whose Friday night goal was to pump
up his 138 average.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor votes Republican more often than not and did not vote for
Clinton in either race. He has watched some of the impeachment
proceedings. His wife said she has seen most of it.
</P>
<P>
   Willis Delhomme of Alley Oops, a Round Rock resident, security
supervisor and team leader with a 176 average, says he has watched
a little of the Iraqi bombing campaign, but none of the impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't interest me. It doesn't concern me for the simple
reason that if he would have come out with it the first time, we
wouldn't be going through all this malarkey, bullcorn, horse
hockey, whatever you want to call it,'' said Delhomme, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Just get it over with, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should drop it and leave it be,'' said Delhomme, who did
not vote for Clinton. ``It's costing us too much money.''
</P>
<P>
   Willis' wife, Shirley, a Round Rock school bus driver, fears the
impeachment process is talking time away from subjects that matter
to her, like education and care for the elderly. She has heard
little about the impeachment battle, but knows all she cares to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work, and I just don't pay attention to it because I don't
even want to know about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While many Americans are watching something they've never seen
before, Willis Delhomme is convinced it's nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's turned into a sideshow,'' he said between frames. ``It
will come and go because just about every president we have had has
done some sort of thing like he has done.''

<P>
   BEIRUT _ I called up a Saudi journalist friend of mine Thursday
and told him Downing Street was claiming the attack on Iraq was
intended to protect the Arab Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zbeili,'' he shouted down the phone to me. ``Zbeili'' is
Arabic for garbage. ``Why do you want to kill more of those poor
people?''
</P>
<P>
   The spin doctors are trying to present the Anglo-American
assault on Iraq in all its old 1991 Gulf War purity. Iraq's
neighbors are under threat and must be safeguarded from his weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But with the exception of Kuwait _ some of whose citizens
repeated their now-familiar routine of fleeing over the Saudi
border every time the Iraqi crisis reemerges, the Arab Gulf states
wanted none of the West's protection Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the West Bank, where President Bill Clinton's visit this
week had produced the largest American banners ever seen in the
Arab world, they were back to burning the U.S. flag and shouting
``death to Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had sung with a Palestinian choir in Bethlehem three
days ago; Thursday, crowds near Manger Square were throwing stones
at Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he (Clinton) carried a message of peace,'' a
disgruntled Palestinian girl said. ``But now it is clear he is a
murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to underestimate the degree of cynicism and
distrust that is now felt in the Arab world towards the United
States and the only ally to support Washington in the attack on
Iraq, Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Why, the Saudis were asking privately this week, did America and
Britain continue to pretend that the Saudis supported the
bombardment when as long ago as last February, Saudi Arabia had
refused permission for the United States to use its air-bases for
raids on Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   It now transpires that when the U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen sought Saudi help during November's crisis with Iraq, Crown
Prince Abdullah not only refused assistance but suggested that the
United States might soon be asked to remove its aircraft from Saudi
air bases altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The painful truth is that most of the Arab dictatorships are
more fearful of their own people than they are of Saddam Hussein _
especially when ordinary Arabs are angry with their governments
because of their support for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   An example of this came in Cairo where 3,000 students poured
onto the streets to protest at the American attack. State security
police patrolled the university district.
</P>
<P>
   Even Iraq's traditional enemies expressed revulsion at the
bombardment. In the Iranian capital, Tehran, a foreign ministry
official said the attacks ``will lead to even more pain and misery
for the people of that country and will bring about insecurity in
the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrilla movement in Lebanon
condemned what it called ``American-British aggression'' which, it
feared, would be used by Saddam Hussein's regime ``as an excuse for
further atrocious massacres against the Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``aggression'' _ `iitidak' in Arabic _ was used, too,
by Esmat Abdel-Meguid, the Secretary General of the Arab League,
and by Selim el-Hoss, the Lebanese prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we condemn this attack on Iraq,'' el-Hoss said, ``we are
astonished by the fact that Israel alone among the regional states
is free from the constraints and controls of possessing mass
destruction weapons.``
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, hypocrisy was what came across in many Arab newspaper
headlines. ``Desert Fox operation postpones Clinton's
impeachment,'' the Lebanese daily ``As Safir'' announced. ``Once
again, it is our flesh that is being eaten, and it is our blood
that is being shed. Let the perpetrators (of the air strike)...go
to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton launched air strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan
at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Arabs refused to
believe it was coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has attacked Iraq at the moment of impeachment hearings,
there is probably not a soul in the Arab world who does not believe
Iraqis are dying and suffering to save the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   America's failure to ensure that Israel honors the Oslo and Wye
agreements _ what is seen as Clinton's cowardice in the face of the
Israeli lobby in Washington _ is contrasted with his gung-ho,
bellicose attitude towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it about Iraq that obsesses America?'' my Saudi friend
asked. ``There are plenty of terrible people in the region. Do you
want to destroy Iraq and its people?''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to many news reports, American fixed-wing aircraft _ as
well as Cruise missiles _ were flying over Baghdad on Wednesday
night. ``We heard the planes very clearly as well as the missiles
which were literally whooshing over our heads in the darkness,''
one Westerner told me from Baghdad. ``There were a lot of impacts
near us _ and they weren't all from missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft may well have flown from the one Arab Gulf state
which wants to help any American strike at Iraq and which still
hates and fears Saddam: Kuwait. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ I called up a Saudi journalist friend of mine Thursday
and told him Downing Street was claiming the attack on Iraq was
intended to protect the Arab Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zbeili,'' he shouted down the phone to me. ``Zbeili'' is
Arabic for garbage. ``Why do you want to kill more of those poor
people?''
</P>
<P>
   The spin doctors are trying to present the Anglo-American
assault on Iraq in all its old 1991 Gulf War purity. Iraq's
neighbors are under threat and must be safeguarded from his weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But with the exception of Kuwait _ some of whose citizens
repeated their now-familiar routine of fleeing over the Saudi
border every time the Iraqi crisis reemerges, the Arab Gulf states
wanted none of the West's protection Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the West Bank, where President Bill Clinton's visit this
week had produced the largest American banners ever seen in the
Arab world, they were back to burning the U.S. flag and shouting
``death to Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had sung with a Palestinian choir in Bethlehem three
days ago; Thursday, crowds near Manger Square were throwing stones
at Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he (Clinton) carried a message of peace,'' a
disgruntled Palestinian girl said. ``But now it is clear he is a
murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to underestimate the degree of cynicism and
distrust that is now felt in the Arab world towards the United
States and the only ally to support Washington in the attack on
Iraq, Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Why, the Saudis were asking privately this week, did America and
Britain continue to pretend that the Saudis supported the
bombardment when as long ago as last February, Saudi Arabia had
refused permission for the United States to use its air-bases for
raids on Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   It now transpires that when the U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen sought Saudi help during November's crisis with Iraq, Crown
Prince Abdullah not only refused assistance but suggested that the
United States might soon be asked to remove its aircraft from Saudi
air bases altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The painful truth is that most of the Arab dictatorships are
more fearful of their own people than they are of Saddam Hussein _
especially when ordinary Arabs are angry with their governments
because of their support for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   An example of this came in Cairo where 3,000 students poured
onto the streets to protest at the American attack. State security
police patrolled the university district.
</P>
<P>
   Even Iraq's traditional enemies expressed revulsion at the
bombardment. In the Iranian capital, Tehran, a foreign ministry
official said the attacks ``will lead to even more pain and misery
for the people of that country and will bring about insecurity in
the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrilla movement in Lebanon
condemned what it called ``American-British aggression'' which, it
feared, would be used by Saddam Hussein's regime ``as an excuse for
further atrocious massacres against the Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``aggression'' _ `iitidak' in Arabic _ was used, too,
by Esmat Abdel-Meguid, the Secretary General of the Arab League,
and by Selim el-Hoss, the Lebanese prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we condemn this attack on Iraq,'' el-Hoss said, ``we are
astonished by the fact that Israel alone among the regional states
is free from the constraints and controls of possessing mass
destruction weapons.``
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, hypocrisy was what came across in many Arab newspaper
headlines. ``Desert Fox operation postpones Clinton's
impeachment,'' the Lebanese daily ``As Safir'' announced. ``Once
again, it is our flesh that is being eaten, and it is our blood
that is being shed. Let the perpetrators (of the air strike)...go
to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton launched air strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan
at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Arabs refused to
believe it was coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has attacked Iraq at the moment of impeachment hearings,
there is probably not a soul in the Arab world who does not believe
Iraqis are dying and suffering to save the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   America's failure to ensure that Israel honors the Oslo and Wye
agreements _ what is seen as Clinton's cowardice in the face of the
Israeli lobby in Washington _ is contrasted with his gung-ho,
bellicose attitude towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it about Iraq that obsesses America?'' my Saudi friend
asked. ``There are plenty of terrible people in the region. Do you
want to destroy Iraq and its people?''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to many news reports, American fixed-wing aircraft _ as
well as Cruise missiles _ were flying over Baghdad on Wednesday
night. ``We heard the planes very clearly as well as the missiles
which were literally whooshing over our heads in the darkness,''
one Westerner told me from Baghdad. ``There were a lot of impacts
near us _ and they weren't all from missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft may well have flown from the one Arab Gulf state
which wants to help any American strike at Iraq and which still
hates and fears Saddam: Kuwait. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   We are now in the endgame, the final bankruptcy of western
policy towards Iraq, the very last throw of the dice.
</P>
<P>
   We fire 200 Cruise missiles into Iraq and what do we expect? Is
a chastened Saddam Hussein going to emerge from his bunker to
explain to us how sorry he is? Will he tell us how much he wants
those nice U.N. inspectors to return to Baghdad to find his
``weapons of mass destruction?''
</P>
<P>
   Is that what we think? Is that what the Anglo-American
bombardment is all about? And if so, what happens afterwards? What
happens when the missile attacks end _ just before the Muslim holy
month of Ramadan, because of course we really are very sensitive
about Iraqi religious feelings _ and Saddam Hussein tells us that
the U.N. inspectors will never be allowed to return?
</P>
<P>
   As the Cruise missiles were launched, President Clinton
announced that Saddam had ``disarmed the (U.N.) inspectors'' and
Tony Blair _ agonizing about the lives of the ``British forces''
involved (all 14 pilots) _ told us that ``we act because we must.''
</P>
<P>
   In so infantile a manner did we go to war on Wednesday night. No
policies, no perspective. Not the slightest hint as to what happens
after the bombardment ends.
</P>
<P>
   With no U.N. inspectors back in Iraq, what are we going to do?
Declare eternal war against Iraq? We are ``punishing'' Saddam _ or
so Blair would have us believe. And all the old cliches are being
trundled out.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, just before he bombed them, Ronald Reagan told the
Libyans that the United States ``had no quarrel with the Libyan
people.'' In 1991, just before he bombed them, George Bush told the
Iraqis that he ``had no quarrel with the Iraqi people.'' And now we
have Tony Blair _ as he bombs them _ telling Iraqis that, yes, he
``has no quarrel with the Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there a computer that churns out this stuff? Is there a
cliche department at Downing Street which also provides Robin Cook
with the tired phrase of the American Secretary of State, Madeleine
Albright about how Saddam used gas ``against his own people.''
</P>
<P>
   For little did we care when he did use that gas against the
Kurds of Halabja _ because, at the time, those Kurds were allied to
Iran and we, the West, were supporting Saddam's invasion of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of any sane long-term policy towards Iraq is the
giveaway. Our patience _ according to Clinton and Blair _ is
exhausted. Saddam cannot be trusted to keep his word (they've just
realized). And so Saddam's ability to ``threaten his neighbors'' _
neighbors who don't actually want us to bomb Iraq _ has to be
``degraded.''
</P>
<P>
   That word ``degraded'' is a military term, first used by General
Schwarzkopf and his boys in the 1991 Gulf War, and it is now part
of the vocabulary of the weak.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's weapons of mass destruction have to be ``degraded.''
</P>
<P>
   How? The U.N. weapons inspectors _ led for most of the time by
Scott Ritter, (the man who has admitted he kept flying to Israel to
liaise with Israeli military intelligence) could not find out where
Saddam's nuclear, biological and chemical weapons were hidden.
</P>
<P>
   They had been harrassed by Iraq's intelligence thugs and
prevented from doing their work. Now we are bombing the weapons
facilities which the inspectors could not find.
</P>
<P>
   Or are we? For there is a very serious question that is not
being asked: if the inspectors couldn't find the weapons, how come
we know where to fire the Cruise missiles?
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, we continue to impose genocidal sanctions on
Iraq, sanctions that are killing innocent Iraqis and _ by the
admission of Cook and Mrs. Albright _ are not harming Saddam at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright rages at Saddam's ability to go on building
palaces and Cook is obsessed with the regime's purchase of
liposuction equipment which, if true, merely proves that sanctions
are a total failure.
</P>
<P>
   Cook prattles on about how Iraq can sell over $10 billion of oil
a year to pay for food, medicine and other humanitarian goods. But
since more than 30 percent of these oil revenues are diverted to
the U.N. compensation fund and U.N. expenses in Iraq, his statement
is totally untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Halliday, the man who ran the U.N. oil-for-food program
in Baghdad until he realized that thousands of Iraqi children were
dying every month because of sanctions, resigned his post with the
declaration that ``we are in the process of destroying an entire
society...it is illegal and immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   So either Halliday is a pathological liar _ which I do not
believe _ or Cook has a serious problem with the truth _ which I do
believe.
</P>
<P>
   Now we are bombing the people who are suffering under our
sanctions. Not to mention the small matter of the explosion of
child cancer in southern Iraq, most probably as a result of the
Allied use of depleted uranium shells during the 1991 war.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf War veterans may be afflicted with the same sickness,
although the British government refuses to contemplate the
possibility. And what, in this latest missile strike, are some of
our warheads made of? Depleted uranium, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there really is a plan afoot for a coup d'etat, though
hopefully more ambitious than our call to the Iraqi people to rise
up against their dictator in 1991, when they were abandoned by the
Allies they thought would speed to their rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says he wants a democracy in Iraq _ as fanciful a
suggestion as any made recently. He is demanding an Iraqi
government that ``represents its people'' and ``respects'' its
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   What hollow laughter greets such an utterance when not a single
Arab regime _ especially Washington's friends in Saudi Arabia _
offers such luxuries to its people?
</P>
<P>
   We are supposed to believe, it seems, that Washington and London
are really terribly keen to favor the Iraqi people with a
fully-fledged democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, what we want in Iraq is another bullying dictator in
the Saddam mold _ but one who will do as he is told, invade the
countries we wish to see invaded (Iran) and respect the integrity
of those countries we do not wish to see invaded (Kuwait).
</P>
<P>
   Yet no questions are being asked, no lies uncovered. Ritter, the
Marine Corps inspector who worked with Israeli intelligence,
claimed that Richard Butler _ the man whose report triggered this
week's new war _ was aware of his visits to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Is that true? Has anyone asked Butler? Indeed, dare we ask? He
may well have avoided such contacts _ but it would be nice to have
an answer.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do with Saddam? Well first, we could abandon the
wicked sanctions regime against Iraq. We have taken enough innocent
lives. We have killed enough children.
</P>
<P>
   Then we could back the real supporters of democracy in Iraq _
not the ghouls and spooks who make up the so-called Iraqi National
Congress but the genuine dissidents who gathered in Beirut in 1991
to demand freedom for their country but who were swiftly ignored by
the Americans once it became clear that they didn't want a
pro-western strongman to lead them.
</P>
<P>
   And we could stop believing in Washington. Vice President Al
Gore told Americans this week that it was a time for ``national
resolve and unity.'' You might have thought the Japanese had just
bombed Pearl Harbor or that General Douglas MacArthur had just
abandoned Bataan.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton faced the worst of the Monica Lewinsky
scandal, he bombed Afghanistan and Sudan. Faced with impeachment,
he now bombs Iraq. How far can a coincidence go?
</P>
<P>
   This week, two Christian armies _ America's and Britain's _ went
to war with a Muslim nation, Iraq. With no goals but with an army
of platitudes, they have abandoned the U.N.'s weapons control
system, closed the door forever on arms inspections and opened the
door to an unlimited military offensive against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody has asked the obvious question: what happens next? &QL;

   LONDON _ British government fears that the television coverage
of bombing Iraq could turn public opinion against the war were
highlighted Friday with a Downing Street warning to ``place a
health warning'' on some of the coverage from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   As reports came in of an Iraqi hospital being damaged by a blast
from a cruise missile in Baghdad, the Prime Minister's official
spokesman urged journalists not to be taken in by the Iraqi
propaganda machine.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed Western television film crews had been duped in the
Gulf War over the highly publicized bombing of a Iraqi plant making
baby's milk.
</P>
<P>
   The Downing Street spokesman said on another occasion, workmen
had been seen shortly before the television crews arrived, removing
slates from another building to make it appear it had been hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be a health warning attached to what the media is
allowed to see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Downing Street spokesman said that much of the bombing was
being directed at military targets outside Baghdad, believed to
include the barracks of the Republican Guard. This was not being
shown because film crews were being tightly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Television reporters in the Iraqi capital are being escorted to
sites chosen by Saddam Hussein's regime. So far these have been
sites the Iraqis claim are civilian buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Most pictures are coming from crews on the roof of the
Information Ministry. Some other pictures are also coming from the
roof of the Al-Rashid Hotel where most journalists are staying.
When the bombing begins, all foreign journalists have been ordered
to stay either at the ministry or their hotel. &QL;

3 FIREFIGHTERS DIE IN BROOKLYN FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three New York City firefighters who were trying to
rescue an elderly woman from her top-floor Brooklyn apartment were
killed Friday when a fireball engulfed them as it swept through the
narrow hallway, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The three members of Ladder Company 170 in Brooklyn fell to the
floor and shouted, ``Mayday!'' over a radio. But fire officials
said the concrete hallways acted like an oven, and the flames
melted the oxygen masks off the firefighters' faces. Within a
minute, the men succumbed to smoke inhalation and burns, according
to the City Medical Examiner's office. Unbeknownst to the
firefighters, the 67-year-old woman who lived in the apartment had
already been pulled to safety by a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The flames should have triggered a sprinkler system on the
top-floor hallway, but Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen said the
system had inexplicably been turned off. When firefighters tested
the system hours after the blaze, Von Essen said, the sprinklers
worked properly.
</P>
<P>
   The building, at 17 Vandalia Ave. near Starrett City, houses
low-income elderly people and is managed by the New York City
Housing Authority. It was built in 1983 with money from the federal
government. The hallway sprinklers are required by federal
regulations; city fire codes do not require sprinklers in
residential buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials were looking for Housing Authority maintenance
records in hopes of learning why the sprinklers had been turned off
and to determine whether the required monthly inspections had been
made. ``It would have made a difference,'' said Von Essen, stopping
short of blaming the deaths on the sprinklers. He later added:
``We're all dumbfounded. We can't figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The three deceased firefighters were identified as Lt. Joseph
Cavalieri, 42; Christopher Bopp, 27, and James Bohan, 25. By Friday
afternoon, firefighters at Ladder Company 170 on Rockaway Boulevard
in Canarsie had draped their firehouse with
black-and-purple-striped bunting, a century-old tradition
memorializing deaths in the line of duty. Bohan had delivered
Christmas presents to young patients at Brookdale Hospital Medical
Center in Brooklyn just the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Von Essen said investigators were ``95 percent sure'' that the
fire started with a discarded cigarette in the apartment of the
woman, Jacqueline Pinder. As of early Friday evening, fire
officials had not yet interviewed Ms. Pinder, who was listed in
serious condition at Brookdale Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Six firefighters have now died on the job in New York City this
year, and Friday's deaths marked the worst loss of life since three
firefighters were killed in March 1994 battling flames in an
apartment building at 60 Watts St. in Manhattan. One of the worst
fires in the city's history, a 1978 blaze at a Waldbaum's
supermarket that killed six firefighters, occurred at 2892 Ocean
Ave., a few miles from Vandalia Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very sad and difficult day for New York City,''
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said at a news conference Friday night. He
described the deceased firefighters as ``just among the very
best,'' and said, ``They were walking into flames to save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Four other firefighters who had tried to rescue their colleagues
were being treated at different hospitals for smoke inhalation and
minor burns. Two paramedics who had tried to resuscitate the three
victims were also hospitalized and being treated for burns and
smoke inhalation. Four residents of the building suffered minor
injuries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those who knew the victims mourned their loss. ``He was the best
guy that you could ever meet. He helped me shovel snow, go to the
store for me, anything I asked,'' said Ed Gleason, 73, a neighbor
of Bopp in the Midwood section of Brooklyn. Bopp's wife is
expecting their first child in July.
</P>
<P>
   The fire started in the living room of Ms. Pinder's three-room
apartment, 10-D, located in the northern wing of the building,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire Department must check the sprinklers every five years,
and fire officials said they were working properly during the last
inspection, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   City Buildings Department officials said the building had only
minor violations. But they said the Housing Authority was required
to conduct monthly checks by a certified inspector, and
investigators were seeking maintenance records to see whether the
checks had taken place. ``We'll never know if the firefighters
would have lived if the sprinklers were working, but we know the
hallway would have been a lot cooler,'' said one ranking fire
official.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Colon, a Housing Authority spokeswoman, said the employee
responsible for the maintenance records had taken the day off and
was not located until Friday night. She said Housing Authority
officials had only just begun to review the records.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters got the first call at 4:54 a.m., and the fire was
doused by 5:56 a.m. The mayor said the first trucks reached the
scene in about four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Ms. Pinder told investigators that she is a heavy
smoker. Fire officials at the scene said that as the fire grew, she
staggered into the hallway, moaning and crying for help.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man heard Ms. Pinder's cries and pulled her into his
apartment, fire officials said. Ms. Pinder's self-closing steel
door remained ajar.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few minutes, Cavalieri, Bopp and Bohan arrived. The
firefighters, who made up what is known as a ``forcible entry
team,'' did not carry a hose, and their job was to rescue victims.
Fire officials said they had climbed the 10 flights of stairs and
were groping through the hallway, about 15 feet from Ms. Pinder's
door, when the fireball slammed into them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they believed that the pressure from the fire
burst the windows in Ms. Pinder's apartment and that heavy winds
coming off nearby Jamaica Bay carried the flames into the hallway
like a blowtorch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fireball was so ferocious that it caused the peephole in
the apartment next door to explode,'' Von Essen said.
</P>
<P>
   Other responding firefighters heard a voice call, ``Mayday!''
over the radio, but the men apparently died within the next minute.
A crew from Engine Company 290 made a rescue attempt, crawling
along the 10th floor as more firefighters sprayed the hallway with
water from their hoses. The fire was contained to the northern wing
of the 10th floor.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor visited the families of the victims, noting that each
house was decorated for Christmas. ``They were devastated,'' he
said.

<P>
   PARIS _ The far-right National Front symbolically and publicly
divided into two parties Friday, confirming a 10-day-old schism
which now seems irreparable.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Le Pen, the party's founder president, and his
internal rival Bruno Megret, ``met'' for the first time since the
NF imploded. They each took their seats in the regional assembly
for Provence, the Alps and the Cote d'Azur in Marseilles.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, they had sat side by side. Friday, they sat apart,
proudly avoiding one another's gaze, and surrounded by their
respective supporters.
</P>
<P>
   At Le Pen's insistence, Megret and 10 of the 37 NF regional
councillors were made to sit apart from the rest of the group. Also
at Le Pen's insistence, they sat to the far right of the assembly,
even further to the right than the NF president and his loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between the two wings of the NF _ the Le Pen
loyalists and purists and the Megret modernizers _ has been fought,
in part, with infantile pique of this kind. But it has also
developed into a legal struggle for the party's money and the
party's name.
</P>
<P>
   As Megret put it: ``The historic Front is them. The real Front
is us. The problem now is to decide which of us is the legal
Front.''
</P>
<P>
   Megret's supporters say they have more than the 20 percent of
signatures of NF members they need to call an emergency conference
to decide the party's future. Le Pen refuses to countenance such a
meeting. The Megretistes will go ahead anyway and hold their
congress at Marignane, north of Marseilles, on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   This meeting will almost certainly declare Le Pen deposed and
elect Megret as head of his ``real'' NF. First indications from
around the country are that the party has been carved down the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   Although Le Pen took the majority of NF regional councillors in
the south, Megret has the overwhelming majority in Lorraine and
exactly half in the Paris region. He also has two of the four NF
mayors (including his own wife) and more than half the NF national
council. &QL;

   There is never a good time to impeach a U.S. president, since
the so-called head of the free world is always busy striving to
pacify some world trouble-spot.
</P>
<P>
   It must seem particularly cruel to Bill Clinton that he faces
trial at exactly the same time as he is ordering troops into
battle; but to be realistic, when has he been free of such
troubles? When he was ordering Marines into Somalia? When he was
making peace in Northern Ireland? Or on the previous occasions when
he has bombed Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   National leaders have always been assailed without regard to the
crises their nations face.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Johnson, the only other president to be impeached, was
struggling with the challenge of reconstruction after the American
Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats showed no mercy to Richard Nixon, embroiled in
Vietnam, opening up Western policy to China, and attempting detente
with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Margaret Thatcher was preparing for the Gulf war
when she was politically assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing in the Gulf makes no difference to the issues facing
Congress. Either the President has perjured himself, and committed
the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' of which the Constitution
speaks, or he has not.
</P>
<P>
   The world's cynicism about the President's motives in ordering
military action should encourage a decision. The impeachment vote
may bring the crisis to a head, and renew America's
self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress decides to allow President Clinton to escape, he can
face the world with his mandate renewed. But if he is impeached,
his authority will be irreparably damaged. Then, for all our sakes,
he should resign, and allow a successor to govern with authority. &QL;

the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' of which the Constitution
speaks, or he has not.
</P>
<P>
   The world's cynicism about the President's motives in ordering
military action should encourage a decision. The impeachment vote
may bring the crisis to a head, and renew America's
self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress decides to allow President Clinton to escape, he can
face the world with his mandate renewed. But if he is impeached,
his authority will be irreparably damaged. Then, for all our sakes,
he should resign, and allow a successor to govern with authority. &QL;

   PARIS _ The smell of the Metro _ something between burned air
and rotting bananas _ is a characteristic Parisian experience: as
much a part of the city for generations of visitors as the Eiffel
Tower or the Champs Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   The magic formula is, or used to be, a delicate blend of
scorched rubber, sweat and sewers. It also included the heavy scent
of Gauloises and Gitanes, until cigarettes were banned from the
Paris underground a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, that trademark aroma has deteriorated for other
reasons. Some of the homeless people who spend their days in Metro
stations treat the corridors and, even the platforms, as
lavatories.
</P>
<P>
   The Regie Autonome des Transports Parisiens (RATP), the
state-owned company which runs all public transport in the French
capital, commissioned an opinion poll to discover why Parisians
were using the Metro less. One of the most common replies was: ``ca
pue.'' (It stinks).
</P>
<P>
   The company decided to put things right in time for the
centenary of the Metro in 12 months' time.
</P>
<P>
   In an experiment which will probably be extended to the whole
system the RATP began Friday to suffuse one Metro station with a
scent, especially designed by one of the big French perfume
workshops.
</P>
<P>
   The perfume, called ``Madeleine,'' was created by Quest
International France, a laboratory which normally works for the
fashion designer and parfumeur, Thierry Mugler.
</P>
<P>
   The fragrance, described as having a ``hint of spring flowers,''
will be mixed with the existing cleaning agents and applied daily
to the platforms, corridors and floors of the Invalides station.
</P>
<P>
   If the experiment is a success, it will be applied to all 366
stations on the Metro system, and all 64 on its sister regional
network, the RER, in the course of next year.
</P>
<P>
   The RATP is also working on a more technologically advanced
solution: the use of ultraviolet light to smash the molecules
hanging in the air which create bad odors.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the old Metro smell seems likely to go the way of
berets and yellow car-headlights. Another ``exception francaise''
is about to disappear. &QL;

   HONG KONG _ It is fitting that the same week England's
cricketers again surrendered meekly to Australia, the government in
London should have surrendered to Washington's perceptions of U.S.
interests in the Gulf or the more immediate concerns of the U.S.
president.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a commentary on the rights, wrongs or usefulness of
the raids on Iraq. History will be their judge. It simply flows
from Britain's apparent lack of any policy in the Middle East (and
elsewhere) other than to hang on to the coattails of the United
States, be the faithful servant and show that the United States is
not alone in its actions.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are often as surprised as other non-British at this
eagerness to be bracketed with the United States in United Nations
resolutions or bombing campaigns. Meanwhile, the British are easily
irritated when others fail to notice they had a role at all.
</P>
<P>
   France has a policy which is based on more than just being seen
to oppose U.S. views. Why doesn't Britain?
</P>
<P>
   For historical reasons, Britain's links with and interests in
the Middle East, with Israel and the various countries of the Arab
world, are different from those of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's role in the creation of the political geography of the
region after the breakup of the Ottoman Empire _ in Palestine, in
the installation of the Hashemites on the thrones of Jordan and
Iraq and in the oil industry of the region _ should give it an
identifiable policy.
</P>
<P>
   Such a view could be criticized on the grounds of being
backward-looking. But then why is London looking to Washington
rather than trying to move with its own European future and promote
a common European policy?
</P>
<P>
   The EU may have blamed Saddam Hussein for the bombing campaign.
But that is a long way from reactivating the joint military action
of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   London's solo participation merely further reduces its own
influence within Europe, and the political value of its military
presence in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   If Britain was getting much in return for this stance, it might
be understandable. Yes, there was U.S. diplomatic help during the
Falklands war. But the Clinton administration, for understandable
political reasons, has not been especially helpful on the one issue
which most matters for London _ Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the slavishness be attributed to Prime Minister Tony
Blair's personal relationship with, and support for, President Bill
Clinton. This devotion is far too deeply rooted in British policy
for that.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sharing a language, some institutions and economic and
political philosophies, the British instinctively believe the
United States is usually right. The instinct to support a friend
even when unsure of the merits of the case would be admirable.
</P>
<P>
   But one suspects that there is a less admirable aspect to
Britain's role. Having lost its empire it has been unable to
reconcile itself to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As Hugo Young has demonstrated in his powerful recent book
``This Blessed Plot: Britain and Europe from Churchill to Blair,''
the British have repeatedly, under every administration, failed to
recognize and participate in European integration.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have sought solace in illusions of the
Commonwealth and by trying to stay on the world stage by
associating themselves with U.S. global supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   The United States finds this useful and is too polite to tell
London how little weight it carries in the world. The Germans,
French, even Italians and Spaniards, may say so. But they do not
say it in English. So Britain does not hear. &QL;

   HONG KONG _ It is fitting that the same week England's
cricketers again surrendered meekly to Australia, the government in
London should have surrendered to Washington's perceptions of U.S.
interests in the Gulf or the more immediate concerns of the U.S.
president.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a commentary on the rights, wrongs or usefulness of
the raids on Iraq. History will be their judge. It simply flows
from Britain's apparent lack of any policy in the Middle East (and
elsewhere) other than to hang on to the coattails of the United
States, be the faithful servant and show that the United States is
not alone in its actions.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are often as surprised as other non-British at this
eagerness to be bracketed with the United States in United Nations
resolutions or bombing campaigns. Meanwhile, the British are easily
irritated when others fail to notice they had a role at all.
</P>
<P>
   France has a policy which is based on more than just being seen
to oppose U.S. views. Why doesn't Britain?
</P>
<P>
   For historical reasons, Britain's links with and interests in
the Middle East, with Israel and the various countries of the Arab
world, are different from those of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's role in the creation of the political geography of the
region after the breakup of the Ottoman Empire _ in Palestine, in
the installation of the Hashemites on the thrones of Jordan and
Iraq and in the oil industry of the region _ should give it an
identifiable policy.
</P>
<P>
   Such a view could be criticized on the grounds of being
backward-looking. But then why is London looking to Washington
rather than trying to move with its own European future and promote
a common European policy?
</P>
<P>
   The EU may have blamed Saddam Hussein for the bombing campaign.
But that is a long way from reactivating the joint military action
of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   London's solo participation merely further reduces its own
influence within Europe, and the political value of its military
presence in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   If Britain was getting much in return for this stance, it might
be understandable. Yes, there was U.S. diplomatic help during the
Falklands war. But the Clinton administration, for understandable
political reasons, has not been especially helpful on the one issue
which most matters for London _ Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the slavishness be attributed to Prime Minister Tony
Blair's personal relationship with, and support for, President Bill
Clinton. This devotion is far too deeply rooted in British policy
for that.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sharing a language, some institutions and economic and
political philosophies, the British instinctively believe the
United States is usually right. The instinct to support a friend
even when unsure of the merits of the case would be admirable.
</P>
<P>
   But one suspects that there is a less admirable aspect to
Britain's role. Having lost its empire it has been unable to
reconcile itself to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As Hugo Young has demonstrated in his powerful recent book
``This Blessed Plot: Britain and Europe from Churchill to Blair,''
the British have repeatedly, under every administration, failed to
recognize and participate in European integration.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have sought solace in illusions of the
Commonwealth and by trying to stay on the world stage by
associating themselves with U.S. global supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   The United States finds this useful and is too polite to tell
London how little weight it carries in the world. The Germans,
French, even Italians and Spaniards, may say so. But they do not
say it in English. So Britain does not hear. &QL;

COMMENTARY: FIRE SHOWS THAT ALL PAIN STARTS AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The reports of a fire on Vandalia Avenue in Brooklyn
jolted Ricco Sanchez into reality. Forget the near-numbing talk
about presidential impeachment or the almost emotionless
descriptions of the smart bombs and surgical strikes in Baghdad.
Fire? That's big news in Sanchez's part of the world. His
grandmother lives on Vandalia Avenue, and he wasn't sure if the
flames had ripped through her building or the one next door.
</P>
<P>
   He raced by van from his job in downtown Brooklyn to her block
in Canarsie, where he learned the fire had been in the building
next to his grandmother's. He stood outside watching the somber
firefighters who lost three colleagues in the blaze. Poor guys, he
said. His voice had a sad, confused finality to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is real,'' he said. ``This happens in our back yard. So
many different things that happen. This is over here. It's like
Iraq. Over there, the civilians are going through things. Everybody
faces tough times.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps all pain _ never mind politics _ is local. Someone
should tell that to the politicians and pundits debating President
Clinton's moral and possible criminal failures. In some places,
supposedly serious people speculate that the Big Iraq attack was a
``Wag the Dog'' diversionary tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, Larry King did away with the ``serious'' part when he had
Johnnie Cochran and Dick Morris on to analyze the political scene,
as if O.J. Simpson's lawyer and a political consultant better known
for his own fetishes and indiscretions had anything worth saying.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, who was listening? In Times Square a few days ago,
there were more teen-agers jumping up and down on the sidewalk
vying for the attention of guests inside the MTV studios than there
were people watching the green-hued video of missiles launched
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But the sight of orange flames and black smoke on your block
really hits home. So, too, do the deaths of three men from Ladder
Company 170: Lt. Joseph Cavalieri and Firefighters Christopher Bopp
and James Bohan.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Devouse sighed sadly as she looked at the fire trucks
that lined the street. For all the talk about duty and government
service being bandied about in Washington lately, the sight of
those trucks was all she needed to have a little faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a retired nurse,'' she said. ``The Fire Department is the
only agency that I respect highly, because their lives are in
danger every day and they ask for no glory. I put them above the
NYPD. They save lives, regardless. My heart really goes out to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalled how when she worked at city hospitals, firefighters
would be brought in weak from smoke inhalation or worse. They
inspired her to do her best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never lost one while I was on duty,'' she said, satisfied.
``They were all in high spirits. You never heard them put their job
down. They just wanted to be treated and get back to what they were
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   What they do is rush into places that reasonable people would do
anything to escape. Their adrenaline, she said, always chooses
fight over flight. You see that often enough, and you never forget
it. Nor do you forget the faces of firefighters who have lost their
colleagues. Even with all the chaos in the nation and the world
today, nothing can compare to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I said to my family yesterday?'' Ms. DeVouse
said. ``We got a whole lot of mess to clean up right here in New
York. But we're running around, going all over the world. I live
right here. I got to be concerned about what's happening right
here.''
</P>
<P>
   That was why Elaine Sawyer stood by her window across the
street, watching the firefighters for hours. When she saw the
flames shoot out of the building she had hoped _ in vain _ that no
one was injured. ``When I heard the news, it hurt,'' she said.
``Three people aren't going home today. From that building.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke of the firefighters as if they were friends, even
though she didn't know their names. Her neighbors, she said, shared
that affection.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs from her apartment, six firefighters trudged down the
street. They boarded a ladder truck that had a Christmas wreath
hung on the front. The flashing red emergency light looked right
for the season. The side door was inscribed ``In Memory of Capt.
Scott La Piedra,'' in honor of a colleague who died in the line of
duty this year. It, too, seemed right.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sawyer stood by her open window and waved frantically at
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firemen!'' she shouted. ``Firemen! We love you. God bless
you.''

<P>
   LONDON _ All the world's a casino and everyone is a player. Or
so it seems these days.
</P>
<P>
   I have been gambling in Moscow, where it takes more courage to
walk out of a dubious dive with your winnings than to venture
through the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   Among the high rollers in London, I have been pampered by
periwigged footmen bearing caviar and champagne. And my first
resolution for the New Year is to stay at Bellagio, the latest
wonder on the Las Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas in a casino? No problem. Once taboo, gambling resorts
have become family destinations for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone can gamble to their heart's content. And if they cannot
get to a casino or a lottery terminal, electronic gambling, outside
the jurisdiction of any regulatory authority, is available on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-gambling forces in the United States have recently
scored a great victory at the ballot box, when opponents of
gambling were routed across the country. New opportunities to play
the lottery and slot machines are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The same momentum holds true across Europe. In Britain, the
lottery is the most successful commercial enterprise since Sir
Walter Raleigh brought tobacco to the court of Queen Elizabeth I,
with 30 million people buying tickets every week.
</P>
<P>
   What is going on? Why the worldwide fever to gamble? The answer
is that people have always liked to gamble. Even in prehistoric
graves, some of the dice were found to be loaded. But in previous
times, the desire to gamble, which has flared up in most societies,
has usually been suppressed, by church or state.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle Ages gambling was regarded as a sin against the
laws of God. A century ago, gambling was seen as a vice, a social
crime like prostitution. But now anything goes. It is simply part
of the leisure industry.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious dangers _ and not just for the unfortunate
compulsive gambler. For casinos, there may soon be too much
gambling for all the competing interests to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The recent battle between the Indian casinos in California,
wanting to move into slot machines, and the Nevada gaming industry
trying to stop them, was probably the most expensive campaign in
American history.
</P>
<P>
   Costing over $100 million, it was on a par with the two main
candidates' expenditure in the last presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas lost this one, but the resort is always one step
ahead. The casinos have discovered that they can make as much
money, if not more, from other attractions like theme parks and
rides. Win some. Lose some.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis has hit the high end of the market, especially
London's casinos. The Asian high rollers are staying away. But no
one doubts that when the good times roll again, the gamblers will
return.
</P>
<P>
   On the gamblers' side, how to control the current gambling
fever? A major debate has now begun in America in the forum of the
National Gambling Impact Commission, instigated two years ago by
Reverend Tom Grey, an evangelical foe of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Grey talks a good game. But he knows he does not have a prayer
against the massed forces of Nevada, led by the former Republican
fund-raiser Frank Fahrenkopf.
</P>
<P>
   The most the commission will do, observers believe, is to put
forward a series of mild recommendations, which Congress can then
mull over at leisure.
</P>
<P>
   One of these proposals could be to provide help to gamblers who
have a ``problem,'' which is the polite term used for compulsive
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The American casino industry realizes it had better get moving,
by funding research and treatment for problem gamblers. The
consequences of doing nothing is demonstrated by what happened to
the tobacco industry. Fines, lost markets, pariah status.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, governments see casino gambling as a way of
attracting foreign currency and stimulating growth. Well, most of
them do. Turkey recently closed its casinos on moral grounds. And
gambling is strictly forbidden in Israel. But gamblers are now
being lured from the Promised Land to a casino in Jericho in the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   These days, there is always somewhere new to win (or lose) your
money. &QL;

   LONDON _ All the world's a casino and everyone is a player. Or
so it seems these days.
</P>
<P>
   I have been gambling in Moscow, where it takes more courage to
walk out of a dubious dive with your winnings than to venture
through the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   Among the high rollers in London, I have been pampered by
periwigged footmen bearing caviar and champagne. And my first
resolution for the New Year is to stay at Bellagio, the latest
wonder on the Las Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas in a casino? No problem. Once taboo, gambling resorts
have become family destinations for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone can gamble to their heart's content. And if they cannot
get to a casino or a lottery terminal, electronic gambling, outside
the jurisdiction of any regulatory authority, is available on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-gambling forces in the United States have recently
scored a great victory at the ballot box, when opponents of
gambling were routed across the country. New opportunities to play
the lottery and slot machines are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The same momentum holds true across Europe. In Britain, the
lottery is the most successful commercial enterprise since Sir
Walter Raleigh brought tobacco to the court of Queen Elizabeth I,
with 30 million people buying tickets every week.
</P>
<P>
   What is going on? Why the worldwide fever to gamble? The answer
is that people have always liked to gamble. Even in prehistoric
graves, some of the dice were found to be loaded. But in previous
times, the desire to gamble, which has flared up in most societies,
has usually been suppressed, by church or state.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle Ages gambling was regarded as a sin against the
laws of God. A century ago, gambling was seen as a vice, a social
crime like prostitution. But now anything goes. It is simply part
of the leisure industry.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious dangers _ and not just for the unfortunate
compulsive gambler. For casinos, there may soon be too much
gambling for all the competing interests to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The recent battle between the Indian casinos in California,
wanting to move into slot machines, and the Nevada gaming industry
trying to stop them, was probably the most expensive campaign in
American history.
</P>
<P>
   Costing over $100 million, it was on a par with the two main
candidates' expenditure in the last presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas lost this one, but the resort is always one step
ahead. The casinos have discovered that they can make as much
money, if not more, from other attractions like theme parks and
rides. Win some. Lose some.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis has hit the high end of the market, especially
London's casinos. The Asian high rollers are staying away. But no
one doubts that when the good times roll again, the gamblers will
return.
</P>
<P>
   On the gamblers' side, how to control the current gambling
fever? A major debate has now begun in America in the forum of the
National Gambling Impact Commission, instigated two years ago by
Reverend Tom Grey, an evangelical foe of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Grey talks a good game. But he knows he does not have a prayer
against the massed forces of Nevada, led by the former Republican
fund-raiser Frank Fahrenkopf.
</P>
<P>
   The most the commission will do, observers believe, is to put
forward a series of mild recommendations, which Congress can then
mull over at leisure.
</P>
<P>
   One of these proposals could be to provide help to gamblers who
have a ``problem,'' which is the polite term used for compulsive
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The American casino industry realizes it had better get moving,
by funding research and treatment for problem gamblers. The
consequences of doing nothing is demonstrated by what happened to
the tobacco industry. Fines, lost markets, pariah status.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, governments see casino gambling as a way of
attracting foreign currency and stimulating growth. Well, most of
them do. Turkey recently closed its casinos on moral grounds. And
gambling is strictly forbidden in Israel. But gamblers are now
being lured from the Promised Land to a casino in Jericho in the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   These days, there is always somewhere new to win (or lose) your
money. &QL;

 &HT;    Georgia, Fresno State limp to rematch
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In March, Georgia guard G.G. Smith enjoyed a career
game against Fresno State, scoring 27 points on a school-record
nine 3-pointers in the consolation game of the NIT in New York.
</P>
<P>
   When those teams meet again today in the Delta Air Lines Holiday
Classic for Kids in the Georgia Dome, both backcourts will be
hampered by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the Bulldogs' undisputed floor leader, has battled a
sprained right wrist for more than two weeks. Smith was hurt when
he fell over a basketball during halftime of Georgia's 63-47 win
over Furman on Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno State senior Chris Herren, averaging 16.2 points and 7.5
assists, will miss the game with a severely sprained right ankle.
Fresno State coach Jerry Tarkanian is expected to start sophomore
Demetrius Porter or junior Shomario Richard in Herren's absence.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a 5-foot-10 senior, will be looking to rebound after two
tough outings in which he scored a combined nine points on 2-of-12
shooting against Appalachian State and Georgia Tech. In Georgia's
first seven games, Smith hit 52 percent of his shots, including 16
of 32 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``G.G.'s got a sprained wrist, and he hasn't shot the ball well,
which I think has been noticeable,'' Bulldogs coach Ron Jirsa said.
``It hasn't kept him out of games, but it's a disappointing injury.
He was one of the hottest shooters in the country before that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jirsa has backcourt help on the way, but freshmen Terrence
Edwards of Tennille and Shawn Fields of Lexington, both of whom
officially join the team today, won't play until Tuesday's game
against East Carolina in Stegeman Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a football signee, and Fields, who signed with Jirsa
last year but didn't academically qualify, will enroll at Georgia
for spring semester. Because the fall semester officially ended
Friday, however, both players are eligible to practice and play in
games beginning today.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs were left with only three scholarship guards _
Smith, senior Ray Harrison and freshman D.A. Layne _ after junior
Adrian Jones was lost for the season with a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is looking to bounce back from Sunday's 84-79 overtime
loss at Georgia Tech, in which the Bulldogs blew a 15-point lead in
the final eight minutes of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important game for us to bounce back, especially since
we're getting another chance to play in Atlanta,'' Jirsa said. ``I
think last year we played an underrated team (West Virginia). ...
Fresno State is very athletic. We need to handle the ball well
against a team that presses and traps all over the floor.

 &HT;    SLOC starts self-inquiry
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Salt Lake City's Olympic organizing committee
empowered an ethics board Friday to determine if its bid for the
2002 Winter Games was tainted by bribery.
</P>
<P>
   The executive committee, meeting behind closed doors in a 5
1/2-hour emergency session, took great pains to demonstrate its bid
for integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member ethics board's investigation will be entirely
independent of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, chairman of the
board of trustees Robert Garff said.
</P>
<P>
   However, SLOC is funding the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The five members of the ethics board must report to the board of
trustees by Feb. 11 with their recommendations about the scandal
that erupted over a scholarship fund administered by the bid
committee. The International Olympic Committee, which is
investigating the acceptance of bribes by its members, hopes to
complete its own probe in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very united front,'' said Henry Marsh, a former
Olympic steeplechaser and member of the board of trustees. ``The
whole thing is we want everybody to know the facts, and we'll have
a totally independent group and counsel come out with them.
Everything's going to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsh said the meeting did not address details of the
scholarship fund, because that will be left to the investigating
board.
</P>
<P>
   He also defended Atlanta, another city implicated in the bribery
scandal by IOC vice president Marc Hodler. Marsh was an athlete
representative when Atlanta was bidding for the right to be the
U.S. representative for 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy (Payne, who headed the Atlanta organizing committee) was
such a class guy, he did everything right by the book,'' Marsh
said. SLOC is pledging full cooperation by its trustees, officers
and past and present employees, including Tom Welch, the former
SLOC head who developed the scholarship fund. Welch resigned in
1997 in the wake of a domestic abuse case.
</P>
<P>
   Welch was not present at the meeting Friday and did not phone
in, but he has promised to aid the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret any and all embarrassment this has caused the
citizens of the state of Utah,'' Garff said.
</P>
<P>
   He handled most questions at a press briefing while Frank
Joklik, the embattled president and CEO, calmly sat next to him.
Critics have called for Joklik and Dave Johnson, the vice president
implicated in the scholarship fund, to resign or be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Garff said that the committee has confidence in the two men
until the ethics panel reports, and said speculation would be
``premature and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department is also investigating the
allegations and prosecutions could follow.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Pace, a critic of the Games, brought refreshments to the
SLOC offices Friday: a cake with a file sticking out of it.
</P>
<P>
   John Ruger, an athlete representative on the board of trustees
believes that the Olympic movement will benefit from the scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this problem is taken care of, then future cities can bid
in an unfettered environment,'' he said. ``This could be very
positive in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, with the Games a little more than three years
away, securing sponsorships is imperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the steps that have been taken today by the executive
committee ... will be a matter of reassurance to sponsors,'' Joklik
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, board member Ken Bullock believes that big money is to
blame for the atmosphere that led to corruption in the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Games aren't about athletes, and aren't about people,'' he
said. ``It's an international business.

NYC SCHOOLS CHIEF ASSAILS STATE'S CHARTER SCHOOLS PLAN
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By CLIFFORD J. LEVY with ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Hours after Gov. George Pataki and the state
Legislature agreed on a charter school plan coupled with a
cherished pay raise for lawmakers, New York City Schools Chancellor
Rudy Crew railed against the school plan, warning Friday that it
was ``fraught with peril.''
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the school-and-raise deal ended weeks of tortuous
negotiations between the governor and the Legislature, and started
what is sure to be a pointed debate between those who see charter
schools as a way to improve public education, and those who see it
as just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The passing of charter schools is truly a historic reform that
for the first time creates real competition within the public
system,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   But Crew said that the new law could divert money from other
public schools, which, he said in a statement, ``the state has
historically and notoriously underfunded.''
</P>
<P>
   He also contended that by allowing the State University of New
York to grant licenses to charter schools _ publicly financed
schools run by teachers, parents and community groups _ the law
would strip away his ability to maintain high standards in all
public schools, including charter schools.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another Pataki move here Friday _ his decision to sign a bill
that could help New York City's police union win bigger salaries _
also drew strong reaction from New York City: Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who had fervently opposed the bill as potentially
damaging to the city's finances, attacked the governor's decision
as a ``very big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has repeatedly pushed his plan for charter schools, but
failed in the past to win approval of it because of opposition from
the Democratic-controlled Assembly and the teachers' union, which
has tremendous lobbying power through its contributions to
legislators. This time, the governor won the Legislature's approval
because he had a decisive weapon: his veto pen. Lawmakers, who have
not had a raise in a decade, had spent much of the year privately
agitating for one, and earlier this month, they passed a bill that
would increase their base salaries by 38 percent, to $79,500 from
$59,500, for what is officially a part-time job. Many lawmakers
earn thousands of dollars more in stipends for serving in
leadership positions.
</P>
<P>
   State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver sought to minimize the
impact of the charter school law, saying it would permit a limited
experiment to see whether advocates of charter schools were right
in arguing that they would drive improvements in public education.
``I have my doubts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Federation of Teachers, which represents New York
City school teachers, got some concessions from Pataki during the
flurry of final negotiations over the charter school bill,
including pension and salary enhancements. But in a clear blow to
the union, new charter schools with under 250 students would not be
required to unionize. And even if those schools grow after their
first year, they could remain nonunion.
</P>
<P>
   UFT president Randi Weingarten said she shared some of Crew's
concerns about charter schools draining money from the regular
public school system, but she said the union had been given
assurances that charter schools could not have more than five
uncertified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't feel the union was hurt by this at all,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature also approved increases for judges, senior
administration officials and statewide elected officials. The
governor's salary would rise to $179,000 from $130,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the finest give-and-get tradition of Albany, Pataki made it
clear that he would sign the pay measure only if the Legislature
withdrew its longstanding opposition to charter schools. Pataki
also added two other bills to the back-room bargaining. One would
penalize lawmakers if they did not approve a budget on time, and
the other would help dairy farmers receive higher prices for milk.
At the same time, negotiators abandoned efforts to find a
compromise on bills that would end tenure for public school
principals and stiffen penalties for school violence.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki had until Monday to veto the pay bill. In the end, after
talks late into the night that left some legislative leaders fuming
about the difficulty of accomplishing things here, the parties
reached a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the final version of the charter bill, the state would
authorize the creation of 100 new charter schools, and allow an
unlimited number of existing schools to transfer to charter status.
Charter schools would be largely independent of local school
districts and not have to abide by most of the state regulations
that govern the public schools. Charter schools could be created by
the state Board of Regents, the trustees of the State University of
New York, as well as the New York City schools chancellor and,
outside New York City, local school boards. The Regents would
monitor charter schools and could revoke charters at any time.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in the late morning, Pataki eagerly
promoted the charter plan, which he hopes to use to burnish his
national standing.
</P>
<P>
   He brushed aside questions about the propriety of linking the
charter bill to a pay raise _ which Crew denounced as ``absolutely
pure politics'' _ and of the Legislature approving the measure in
the predawn hours with little discussion. ``You know how the system
works,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver was less sanguine. The speaker, who was maneuvered into a
corner by Pataki, expressed frustration that the body's Democratic
majority had to sacrifice its opposition to charter schools to
obtain a raise that it felt it deserved.

 &HT;    'Cats press to take on a hurting Tech lineup
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech knows it faces a tough assignment when it
plays Kentucky tonight in the Delta Air Lines Holiday Classic for
Kids.
</P>
<P>
   Before an 81-80 Tech win in 1991, the last time the Yellow
Jackets won was when Whack Hyder was coaching in 1964. Kentucky has
won 54 of 68 meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing Kentucky, but we get our (butts) kicked every
time,'' coach Bobby Cremins said. ``But they kicked a lot of
people's (butts).''
</P>
<P>
   This Kentucky team, 9-1 and ranked No. 3, is deep, experienced
and dangerous. Four Wildcats average double figures, and the famous
smothering Kentucky defense is as lethal as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to come after us with everything they've got,''
Cremins said. ``But I feel we'll be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Floyd, Tech's most consistent scorer with a 17.9 average,
knows the Jackets are in for a long night unless they can cut down
on turnovers and keep their minds on the task at hand. ``They are
going to focus on denying our guards the basketball,'' he said.
``We've got to go out and set great screens for our guys to get
open and we're going to have to deal with their pressure defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Jones, averaging 10.8 rebounds and 11.4 points, agrees.
``I think we're going to have to handle their pressure and take
care of the ball and not make mental mistakes,'' Jones said.
``We've got to play together now more than ever. Kentucky can make
you look real bad if you're not ready and focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech is aware of the famous Kentucky full-court press and
constant pressure defense. The Jackets have spent an inordinate
amount of time this week working on bringing the ball up against
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets' collective health is a worry for Cremins.
Starting forward Jon Babul, who has missed three games with a
severely sprained right ankle, is listed as doubtful. Power forward
Jason Collier, who has scored 44 points and grabbed 18 rebounds in
two games, including Tech's victory against Wofford on Wednesday,
has bleeding ulcers. Tech lost Dion Glover to a knee injury before
the season started.
</P>
<P>
   Collier does have a history of playing against Kentucky. The
former Indiana center has faced the Wildcats twice while in a
Hoosiers uniform. He averaged 11.5 points and seven rebounds in
those two encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need Babul,' Cremins said, ``but I'd say he's
doubtful.'' A 6-foot-7 sophomore, Babul was averaging 9.4 rebounds
and 8.4 points before he was injured in practice. Tech needs his
inside presence to help combat a Kentucky starting front line of
6-6 Heshimu Evans, 6-10 Michael Bradley and 6-9 Scott Padgett.

 &HT;    Georgia State collapses under Miami pressure
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the first time this season, Georgia State coach
Lefty Driesell had all 11 of his players ready to go against Miami
at GSU's Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   But on a night when 6-foot-11, 265-pound junior center Brad
Stricker saw his first playing time in a Georgia State uniform, and
senior forward Quincy Gause played for the first time this season,
the Panthers were blown away by the Hurricanes 76-55 before 2,189
fans Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore point guard Kevin Morris, out the previous six games
because of fractured foot, was also in the starting lineup, but
that didn't matter. Miami (5-2) used its tenacious defense to get
the game in hand at 51-28 with 15:48 remaining to play.
</P>
<P>
   Miami guard Johnny Hemsley scored 24 points and the Hurricanes
demonstrated why they led the nation in defensive field-goal
percentage last season.
</P>
<P>
   While contesting every pass and every shot, the Hurricanes
forced the Panthers (2-6) into 24 turnovers, blocked nine shots and
limited them to 33.9 percent shooting from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''Defense is what we've built our program on,'' Miami coach
Leonard Hamilton said. ''There were some years when we weren't very
good offensively, so we figured that if we were going to win, we
had to play great defense. Tonight was our best effort of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Miami's pressure, Morris turned the ball over nine times
and made only 3 of 9 attempts from the floor. Junior guard Anton
Reese, the Panthers' leading scorer, made only 6 of 17 attempts
from the field and finished with 16 points. Gause scored 14 points
and had 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''They took us out of everything we tried to do _ flat out
kicked our butts,'' Driesell said. ''Everybody was taking bad
shots. They're pretty good. It was a tough team to be playing for
those guys who haven't played for us this year. I just hope it
doesn't affect their confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogler's comments start feud
</P>
<P>
   Letters of ``admonishment and reprimand'' were sent by the
Southeastern Conference to Florida coach Billy Donovan and South
Carolina coach Eddie Fogler because of comments made at the SEC
Media Days last month.
</P>
<P>
   Fogler had questioned Florida's recruiting practices. When asked
about the letter Friday, he responded, ``I have no comment at this
particular time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogler said a former SEC basketball player had put together a
10-day trip to France last summer that benefited Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``For (Fogler) to attack my integrity and the integrity of
anyone from Florida shows he doesn't have enough class, enough
courage to come right out and confront me about it ... it shows
absolutely no guts on his part,'' Donovan said.

 &HT;    `I want to be somebody teams have to account for'
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In compiling nearly 1,600 yards in 14 games, Falcons
running back Jamal Anderson came to depend on Bob Christian. Often,
the fullback was the light to Anderson's train, leading the way
into rugged, dark territory. Now, Christian is gone, tearing up his
left knee last week in New Orleans. It was a sight that shook
Anderson _ because of his feelings for Christian and his dependency
on one of the NFL's best blocking fullbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a group of players, primarily tight end Bob Kozlowski, and
backs Gary Downs and Harold Green will combine to try to replace
Christian. Or at least Anderson hopes so. Anderson talked this week
about running without the fallen fullback.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will it be like for you playing without Christian?
</P>
<P>
   A: He was in the meetings (Wednesday). That kind of threw me off
a little. It's going to be difficult. I'm going to try to work with
Koz, Harold Green and Gary Downs. But Bob is a big loss. Guys have
to step up and make plays. I think they're capable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You played much of the fourth quarter without Christian. How
did that go?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was hard. Koz came up to me about what to do on a play,
and I just couldn't talk to him. I told him to talk to George
(Sefick, offensive coordinator). Bobby just goes out of his way. He
kind of blocks everybody. I'm serious. He'll block a tackle and
then go on and block a linebacker. I can't tell (Christian's
replacements) what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did you know Christian was a special blocker?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, when I first signed with the Falcons, Craig
``Ironhead'' Heyward used to talk about this guy and how hard he
worked. He said I wouldn't believe it. Then he came here. I told
Bob, `I know about you.' Since then, we've talked a lot. I wanted
to get into his head. After the sixth or seventh game last year, we
really started getting on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the other sideline Sunday will be Barry Sanders. What's it
like when people say you've risen to his level?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't want to start a commotion. When I talk about running
backs, I take Barry out of the equation. It's Barry Sanders and the
rest of us. But when I play against a big back, I want to make it a
dual situation. When people talk about the best backs, I don't want
to be left out. I want to be somebody teams have to account for.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your contract is up after next season. Is it important for
you to test the free-agent market?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, not at all. I have every intention of playing my last
year of my contract. ... The reason I signed with Atlanta is I saw
stability. ... We could be like Dallas (of the early '90s). My goal
is to remain a Falcon, to play my career out in Atlanta. Look at
our offensive line. They're all young. I expect 1,500 yards for
years to come.

 &HT;    No more incentives needed
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It has not been an easy week to focus for the Atlanta
Falcons, who have functioned without coach Dan Reeves, recuperating
from heart bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Falcons (12-2), perhaps, they will have
plenty of built-in incentives Sunday at Detroit (5-9).
</P>
<P>
   If Atlanta wins, the Falcons will realize several
accomplishments. Hence, the message on the bulletin board in the
lockerroom:
</P>
<P>
   W _ Det.
</P>
<P>
   2nd seed playoffs
</P>
<P>
   Division Champs
</P>
<P>
   (Bye week)
</P>
<P>
   A win by the Falcons would clinch the NFC West title for just
the second time in 33 seasons and give them a bye in the first
round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need more motivation than that, you're playing the
wrong game,'' interim coach Rich Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   A bye would buy much-needed additional time not only for Reeves,
but also for starting weakside linebacker Cornelius Bennett
(sprained left knee), defensive end Lester Archambeau (broken
thumb), among others.
</P>
<P>
   Both players will start Sunday, however.
</P>
<P>
   If the Vikings (13-1) win at home over Jacksonville, Minnesota
will lock up overall home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Early inactives
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons de-activated rookie safety Omar Brown, safety Chris
Bayne, center-guard Dave Widell, and rookie tight end Roderick
Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Batch still mending
</P>
<P>
   Detroit rookie quarterback Charlie Batch, who injured his lower
back in Monday's 35-14 loss at San Francisco, did not practice
again Friday, but coach Bobby Ross has not ruled him out as the
starter.
</P>
<P>
   If Batch does not play, 14-year veteran Frank Reich will start.
</P>
<P>
   Laying down
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's game, Lions players were asked if they quit once
the game got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do it mentally, without realizing that you're going
through the motions,'' wide receiver Herman Moore said. ``I think
we're not human if we don't do that. It seemed like late in the
third quarter we lost a little something. We kept playing hard, it
seemed, but it's the fire, something that was just missing. You
could feel it, you could sense it even on the sideline.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes
</P>
<P>
   With fullback Bob Christian (knee) out for the season, reserve
tight end Brian Kozlowski (6 feet 3, 255 pounds) will be the
primary fullback. Also, running back Harold Green (6-2, 222), who
caught 29 passes last season as the team's primary third-down back,
will return to that role in two-back sets. Jamal Anderson will
handle one-back sets. Running back Gary Downs (6-1, 218) might see
playing time at fullback. ... Reserve tight end Ed Smith, who has
not caught a pass in two seasons with the Falcons after nine years
in minor-league baseball and one on Washington's practice squad,
will be the No. 2 tight end.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket talk
</P>
<P>
   About 27,000 tickets for the first home playoff game go on sale
at 9 a.m. today at the Georgia Dome ticket offices and at
Ticketmaster outlets. A lottery drawing at 8 a.m. will determine
the order in which fans may purchase a maximum of 20 tickets at $60
each.

 &HT;    'I've been blessed': Reeves considers his experience a miracle
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves, released from Piedmont
Hospital four days after quadruple bypass surgery, spoke Friday
about the gift of life and said he had undergone ``a life-changing
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly breaking into tears, Reeves, 54, gave thanks to God,
his family, doctors, team employees and fans, two days before the
12-2 Falcons play for the second division title in their history.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, conceding the frailities of the human condition,
admitted that he nearly paid the ultimate price for his original
inclination to tough out his medical condition until the season
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm blessed,'' he said during a news conference. ``I
understand how precious life is. You do break down a little bit
more; you do cry a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   There were few dry eyes in the house. None belonged to Reeves,
whose wife, Pam, was at his side.
</P>
<P>
   He put his arm around team physician Charlie Harrison, who
helped diagnose Reeves' condition after the coach complained of
chest pains, lightheadedness and a burning sensation in his throat
after Sunday's 27-17 win at New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I want to thank God for the miracle,'' he said,
pausing and then looking at Harrison, ``because this doesn't look
like an angel right here.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves experienced similar symptoms in August 1990, when he was
coach of the Denver Broncos. He underwent an angioplasty to clear
blockages, a procedure that was repeated five months later.
</P>
<P>
   He was told then that he should be wary of similar symptoms for
the rest of his life. They returned a few months ago, although he
said nothing while the Falcons became one of the great stories of
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made up my mind about three or four months ago,'' he said.
``I had these symptoms that I wasn't going to mention. I didn't
want to do anything to distract the football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said his discomfort was especially intense on game days,
when his heart rate increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine that's normal because you're heart starts beating,''
he said. ``It was just a little bit stronger in New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of circumstances, including a pre-game prayer in New
Orleans by free safety Eugene Robinson and Harrison's presence in
New Orleans, led to a telltale evaluation of Reeves' heart Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Harrison doesn't normally go with us on the road,'' Reeves
said. ``From Eugene Robinson giving the pre-game prayer _ just the
whole thing fell together. For some reason, and I believe it's a
miracle. I mentioned it to Dr. Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to be so tough,'' he said, then paused. ``I didn't
want to do anything to distract our football team. Anyway, I asked
Dr. Harrison if I was being smart by waiting until the season was
over, and he said, 'Heavens no. You need to get it checked out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, one of the team's most spiritual players, seemed
surprised later Friday to learn of Reeves' comments. ``The Friday
before the game, I couldn't sleep,'' he said. ``The Lord kept
impressing on my mind. It seemed like I was going to be the one to
pray before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Reeves normally designates someone to pray, and he asked
(cornerback) Ray Buchanan. Ray said, 'No, but Gene will,' and he
didn't even know about my dream or anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my prayer,'' he said, ``I was talking about the blessings
God has bestowed upon Coach Reeves.''
</P>
<P>
   On Harrison's advice, Reeves checked into Piedmont Hospital
about 6:30 a.m. Monday. Dr. Charlie Brown performed an angiogram,
passing dye through various arteries to see if there were
blockages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think that you're imagining everything,'' Reeves said.
``When Dr. Brown did the angiogram, he did the dye in the first
artery, and he said, 'Well, you're not making it up. You have a
reason to be concerned.' And then he went to the second, and same
thing, and the third, and same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I still thought, 'Well, we'll do an angioplasty. I'll be
out of here tomorrow or something like that.' All of a sudden, he
called Pam in and called Dr. Harrison in, and said, 'We'll have to
do a bypass.' Bypass hits you in the head, and starts ringing in
your ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say, 'What's the alternative? Can you do the bypass when
the season is over?' And they both said, 'We won't let you out of
the hospital tonight.'''
</P>
<P>
   One of the three arteries appeared to be blocked entirely, and
the other two were more than 80 percent blocked. Harrison said
earlier this week that if a second artery had closed it could have
been ``catastrophe,'' a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Harrison said, ``I'm just glad we didn't play on Monday
Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery, performed by Dr. James Kauten, used veins from the
inside of one of Reeves' legs and from the back of his chest wall
to bypass the blockages.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have called Reeves are Saints coach Mike Ditka,
Jets coach Bill Parcells and Falconsoffensive coordinator George
Sefcik, all of whom have had heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outpouring from all people, the prayers, the gifts, it's
all been incredible,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   After thanking the doctors and others at Piedmont, Reeves,
pausing often, said, ``But it goes deeper than that. This is the
kind of stress I can't handle. People really cared, from the pre-op
room, to the operation room, to the recovery room. They constantly
kept my family abreast of what was going on. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been blessed,'' he said. ``The Falcons family, the
owners, the players, the fans, everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   As Reeves gathered himself to say more, Harrison said, ``He just
passed the stress test. He's a lot better than he sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' recovery is on schedule, but he won't make the trip to
Detroit for Sunday's game against the Lions. ``My goal is to go out
(to team headquarters in Suwanee) to at least say hello to the team
before they go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he hopes to be involved in some planning for the
Dec. 27 home game against Miami. Defensive coordinator Rich Brooks
will serve as interim coach until Reeves returns. ``You go by what
you feel like you can do,'' Reeves said. ``I've already found out
you get tired doing things you take for granted. The Lord's been
good to me. I haven't done anything to damage my heart. I've got a
strong family to support me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, through maturity, you change some of the things you
do. I still got to be myself, and I'll be myself until the first
bad call (in the football game). And then I'll go crazy again.''

ROBERT JOHNSTON, 85, WHO HELPED SHAPE CITY SKYLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert C. Johnston, who spent almost half a century
shaping Manhattan's skyline from below street level and its map
from below the water line, died on Dec. 4 at his home in Milbrook.
He was 85 and had been the foundation engineer in charge of
building the 92-acre addition to Manhattan known as the Battery
Park City landfill.
</P>
<P>
   In a city that sometimes seems defined by the soaring majesty of
its lofty spires, it is easy to forget that the towers are not
simply plopped down on vacant lots or even constructed from the
ground up.
</P>
<P>
   Before you can scrape the sky, you must scoop the earth, and in
a city where that is no mean engineering feat, Johnston was a
master in managing the designs of excavations and foundation
construction for some of the city's grandest buildings. Among them
were U.N. headquarters and the former Chase bank headquarters at 1
Chase Manhattan Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   In a society that lionizes architects, marine and foundation
engineering may not seem like a glamorous calling. But Johnston,
whose father was a builder, grew up in the Bronx apparently
dreaming of nothing else. By the time he was 14, his wife,
Charlotte, recalled this week, he not only knew exactly what he
wanted to do but had also picked out the firm he wanted to do it
with.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1910 by Daniel Moran and long known as Moran &AMP;
Proctor, the firm, one of the first to work exclusively in marine
and foundation engineering, had the field largely to itself.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston was so determined to become a part of the Moran team
that he joined the firm as soon as he graduated from Princeton in
1935. With major construction virtually halted in the Depression,
he worked for a year without pay just to be part of the action.
</P>
<P>
   With time out for civil-engineering service with the Seabees,
including the Normandy landings in World War II, he remained with
the firm through a succession of name changes for his entire
career, becoming a partner in 1951. When he retired in 1983, the
firm, now simply Mueser Rutledge, was known as Mueser, Rutledge,
Johnston &AMP; DeSimone.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did much of his work in New York, Johnston had a
national reputation. His credits include the Alcoa and U.S. Steel
headquarters buildings in Pittsburgh, and foundations to support
heavy aluminum presses used to forge aircraft components in
Massachusetts, Ohio, Missouri and California.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where he worked on the 600-acre industrial park in
College Park, Queens, one of his favorite projects was the Chase
Manhattan headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the building may seem impressive simply because it
soars 60 stories high. In Johnston's mole's-eye view, what made it
special was that it had six levels of basements extending a
thrilling 85 feet below street level.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the complex technical problems he solved along the way,
by far his most notable achievement did not involve digging a hole,
but rather filling up one that did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he finished, New York had an additional 92 acres,
extending for about two miles along the Hudson in lower Manhattan
and now the site of two parks, a school and about two dozen
apartment and office buildings, including the World Financial
Center, all supported by piers driven into the bedrock 70 feet
down, beneath the river bed.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority gave him a head start by dumping about 1.2
million cubic yards of debris from the World Trade Center
excavation into the Hudson, providing about 23.5 acres of what
became Battery Park City. But Johnston, who used sand dredged up
from New York Harbor for the rest, had to design around an array of
delicate obstacles, including the PATH tubes that cross the site
along with the river-water intake lines for the Trade Center's
cooling system.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Johnston is survived by a daughter,
Barbara Adams of Manhattan, and a granddaughter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though devoted to his work in a firm that has remained small
precisely because its senior partners want to be working engineers
rather than administrators, Johnston rarely worked late and he
never took work home to Bronxville, where he lived for many years
in a house on Bronxville Road that became a neighborhood attraction
because of its colorful profusion of blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   That was because Johnston, like his wife, was a devoted
gardener, one who spent his evenings and weekends planting flowers
after his workdays planting skyscrapers.

ELWAY, MARINO WILL FINALLY MEET AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best rivalries are played out purely in our imaginations:
Ali vs. Louis, McGwire vs. Ruth, Clinton vs. Nixon, separated by
time but linked by a million barroom debates. Pick a side; you'll
never be proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   John Elway and Dan Marino are like that, in what both
acknowledge is a weird way.
</P>
<P>
   They're contemporaries right down to sharing a rookie season,
yet considering how rarely they've collided, they might as well
have played in different centuries. The two quarterbacks' careers
have been less overlapping than parallel.
</P>
<P>
   They've faced each other precisely ONCE in an NFL game that
counted, and that was so long ago, and that 30-26 victory by
Marino's Miami Dolphins over Elway's Denver Broncos early in the
1985 season seemed so insignificant then, it might as well have
never happened.
</P>
<P>
   For practical purposes, when the Broncos visit the Dolphins
Monday night, it will be the consumation of 20 years of comparison
and contrast.
</P>
<P>
   As Elway said, ``I think that comparison has been there since we
were in the same year in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   That is when it started, when Elway was at Granada Hills High
and Marino at Central Catholic High in Pittsburgh, both top college
recruits in both football and baseball, Elway ending up at Stanford
and Marino at Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   When they entered the NFL, they were part of the 1983 draft that
included six quarterbacks in the first round, Elway going first and
Marino 27th.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for as long as it took for Jim Kelly, Ken O'Brien, Tony
Eason and Todd Blackledge to fade away, Elway and Marino were
connected by their common failure to win a Super Bowl, the
certificate of quarterbacking greatness.
</P>
<P>
   All that separates them now is style _ Marino the stiff-kneed
pocket passer and Elway the scrambler _ and the Super Bowl that
Elway finally won in January.
</P>
<P>
   They've run into each other frequently enough off the field _ at
offseason dinners, golf tournaments, promotional functions _ to
become friends.
</P>
<P>
   But they haven't gone head-to-head on the field since that
sub-freezing afternoon at Mile High Stadium that neither claims to
recall much about.
</P>
<P>
   To refresh their memories: Marino passed for three touchdowns
and 365 yards even though Mark Duper missed the game with a broken
leg and Mark Clayton missed the second half with a sprained ankle.
Elway had a subpar day _ 18 for 37, 250 yards, no TDs and one
interception _ but led the Broncos to three leads in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing that in 16 years we've faced each other only one
time,'' Elway said this week in one of the conference calls set up
by the NFL to promote Monday's showdown, which lost some of its
allure when the Broncos' winning streak ended with a loss to the
New York Giants on Sunday. ``It'll be nice to be on the same
field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible,'' Marino said of the fact Miami and
Denver have met only once since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Blame bad luck and the NFL scheduling system.
</P>
<P>
   Or thank them. If this were a twice-a-year thing, we might
forget how special it is to have the only 50,000-yard passers in
league history in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage of their careers, Elway at 38 and Marino at 37,
appreciation is a big part of their Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get older, you try to enjoy things about the game,
because you can see the end of the tunnel,'' Elway said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing each appreciates is the other. Elway would love to
have Marino's quick release. Marino would love to have Elway's
``playmaking ability'' and flair for comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   When they first matched throwing arms 13 years ago, Elway was
trying to live up to the No. 1-pick hype and Marino was coming off
an incredible 5,000-yard season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I followed his career pretty closely,'' admitted Elway, who
said he identifies with Marino more than with any other opponent.
``I came to a team that was 2-7 the (strike) year before, whereas
he went to a team that was great. He kind of hit the ground
running. It made it tough on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Things evened out.
</P>
<P>
   Then Elway went way ahead when he and the Broncos beat the
Packers in the Super Bowl last January. In the only stat that
counts for some people, it's 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing his face, holding that trophy up, that had to be a very
special feeling for him,'' Marino said this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins lost Marino's only Super Bowl to the 49ers
following the 1984 season, his second.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd asked me early in my career, `Would you rather have
one Super Bowl (winner's) ring and play two seasons, or have (a
16-year) career. . ..,' I'd rather have the career I've had,''
Marino said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure. That's what Elway used to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to miss something you don't know anything about,''
Elway said. ``You don't know what it's like to win one.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway said that if the Broncos don't win the Super Bowl Jan. 31
in Miami, he hopes the Dolphins do, but ``he's going to have to go
through us.''
</P>
<P>
   Could be. Denver (13-1) has clinched the AFC West title. Miami
(9-5) is a game behind the Jets in the AFC East but would go to the
playoffs as a wild card if the season ended now.
</P>
<P>
   But neither team is going to the Super Bowl playing the way it
has the past couple of weeks. Which, by the way, is what each
quarterback wanted to talk about on the phone, the need for the
TEAM to turn it around on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of us, Monday is about Elway and Marino, together
again for what seems like the first time.

GRIEVING FIREFIGHTERS CONVERGE ON CANARSIE FIREHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From a distance, it looked like any other wintry day
at the broad brick firehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had spelled out ``Seasons Greetings'' in shiny letters
across the facade of the station that houses Ladder Company 170. A
cardboard sign announcing a toy drive flapped in the wind.
Throughout the morning, the big red garage doors gaped open for a
procession of firefighters and engines rolling in and out.
</P>
<P>
   But no one was wearing fire gear and no alarms came in. Many of
the firefighters keeping warm inside had long since retired. Others
had worked at the station years ago, before being transferred to
other neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   They converged from wherever they were as if summoned by a
secret alarm Friday, filing in below a flag at half-staff, because
they knew that three firefighters would never return to the
Brooklyn firehouse. And on such an unthinkable day, with Christmas
only a week off, there was no other place they could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have everybody who has ever been in this house inside right
now,'' said Lt. Bill Croak, who had fought fires alongside the men
who were killed: Lt. Joseph Cavilieri and firefighters Christopher
Bopp and James Bohan. ``We are all sitting around and trying to
make sense, just like you do when a family member dies _ because
this is a family.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy that engulfed the Canarsie firehouse is the kind
that many there had experienced only indirectly before, as when
three firefighters died in a 1994 blaze in SoHo or when a fire this
year in nearby East New York killed two firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   But these were their men, and everyone who emerged from the
firehouse seemed bewildered, blinking into the bright sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, guys, please don't turn on the cameras because I can't
talk to you,'' said the company's captain, Timothy Joyce, who came
out briefly to meet with reporters. ``I knew these guys really
well, and it's just too hard,'' he said, his eyes welling up with
tears. ``I could talk for a couple of minutes, and then I'd have to
walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3 p.m., firefighters from a nearby ladder company arrived to
drape the firehouse with black and purple bunting, an age-old
tradition when firefighters are killed while on duty. They also
carefully took down the season's greeting letters and the sign for
the toy drive, part of the proceeds of which Bohan had helped to
deliver Thursday to the pediatrics ward at Brookdale Hospital
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew the dead firefighters said they had all applied
to be stationed in Canarsie because it was a busy firehouse. They
would be assured of doing the dangerous work they loved, the men
said, and this meant that the three had died doing what they loved.
But it was little consolation Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all begged to come here,'' said firefighter Dan
McSwiggan, 54, from nearby Ladder Company 174, ``and you sometimes
wonder why.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time since Feb. 24, 1868, three years
after the United States emerged from an awful Civil War, the House
of Representatives debated the impeachment of a president Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It scheduled for Saturday votes on four articles of impeachment
``for high crimes and misdemeanors'' against William Jefferson
Clinton. Although Democrats protested bitterly and ardently, they
acknowledged that passage of at least one of them, and a Senate
trial next year that could result in the president's removal from
office, had become inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a Democrat who was badly beaten
during the civil-rights demonstrations in the South during the
1960s, stilled the sometimes fractious House when he advised his
colleagues, ``The spirit of history is upon us and the fate of the
Republic before us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a grave and momentous day. For many, it was a grim day,
without joy or satisfaction. Some of the participants said they
were troubled that Congress seemed out of sync with the American
people. Others ``hated to get out of bed this morning,'' as Rep.
Tom Davis of Virginia put it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the 74-year-old chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee, sounded the Republican theme in his
opening statement, asserting that ``no man or woman, no matter how
highly placed, no matter how effective a communicator, no matter
how gifted a manipulator of opinion or winner of votes, can be
above the law in a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip in the House,
called impeachment ``a runaway train headed for a cliff.'' Rep.
Robert Wexler of Florida, another Democrat, raised the ugly specter
of McCarthyism and demanded of the Republican majority, in a
distinct echo of the Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954, ``Have we no
sense of decency?''
</P>
<P>
   Sharply partisan like all the others in recent months, the
debate lasted through the day, ending at precisely 10 p.m. It took
place as British and American warplanes rained bombs upon Iraq for
the third day running, and as Hillary Rodham Clinton offered a rare
public defense of her husband time since he admitted to having had
a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It came, too, in a coincidental conjunction that would have
delighted Kafka, at the very height of the holiday season, with
festive parties scheduled every night at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of Americans share my approval and pride in
the job the president has been doing for our country,'' Mrs.
Clinton said on the White House lawn, with the dome of the Capitol,
where the impeachment debate was under way, looming behind her.
</P>
<P>
   She planned to go up to the Hill to speak to the Democratic
caucus Saturday morning. White House aides said Clinton would
address the nation after the impeachment votes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Louise Slaughter, a Democrat from upstate New York, urged
Clinton to think about resignation if he is impeached. She said
that ``his usefulness would be lost in dealing with other
nations.'' Rep. William Lipinski of Illinois, another Democrat,
spoke in the same vein.
</P>
<P>
   Vote-counters in both parties were unanimous late Friday night
in predicting that Clinton's foes had enough votes to impeach him,
and that Democrats had no chance with a parliamentary maneuver on
Saturday to bring a censure motion to the floor to stave off
impeachment. Democrats planned to march out of the chamber in
protest after losing their censure move and to return for the
impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, replied that the
president would ``absolutely not'' consider resigning, and he
launched a fresh attack on the Republicans on Capitol Hill,
accusing Republican leaders of luring moderates into supporting
impeachment by denigrating its ultimate importance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent the day dealing with Iraq and the international
economy and in meetings with several foreign leaders, including
Chancellor Viktor Klima of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that the president had committed
``reprehensible'' acts and made ``deceitful'' statements to cover
them up, Democratic members of the House argued that his actions
did not come close to warranting impeachment, that they should be
given an opportunity to vote on censure as an alternative to
impeachment _ an option the majority has denied them _ and that the
debate should not be taking place in any case during military
action in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president did was wrong,'' said Rep. John Dingell of
Michigan, the dean of the House, who has represented a district
near Detroit since 1955, in direct succession to his father, also
John Dingell, who had represented it since 1932. ``What we are
doing is equally wrong _ an exercise in the abuse of power by the
majority over the minority.''
</P>
<P>
   The House's only independent member, Rep. Bernard Sanders of
Vermont, decried the prospect of a vote ``perhaps to paralyze our
government as the Senate explores Bill Clinton's extramarital
relations.'' He said that he had realized as never before ``just
how out of touch this institution is with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans pressed resolutely forward with their accusations
that Clinton had committed perjury, had obstructed justice and had
abused his powers as president, all to conceal the truth about the
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dramatic and possibly telling interventions came
from Rep. Tom Campbell of California, a moderate Republican often
criticized in his district for being insufficiently conservative.
He said in a soft voice that he could never trust Clinton again _
indeed that he had been persuaded that the bombing campaign was
legitimate only when Pentagon officials said it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is in his interest not to tell the truth,'' the
Californian said in a blunt indictment of Clinton, ``he will not
tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's flawless legal pedigree _ son of a federal judge,
star student at the Harvard Law School, clerk to a Supreme Court
justice, former professor at Stanford Law School _ lent weight to
his words.
</P>
<P>
   Another California Republican, Rep. Frank Riggs, one of 41
departing members who will cast the last votes of their
congressional careers Saturday, said he had talked on Wednesday to
two prominent Republicans, former President Gerald Ford and former
Sen. Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee. Both, he
reported, said that they would have voted to impeach. In an op-ed
article in The New York Times on Oct. 4, Mr. Ford proposed that Mr.
Clinton be rebuked in the well of the House.
</P>
<P>
   What little suspense there was in the daylong debate came as
some lawmakers who had been fence-sitters declared their
intentions. Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., who had been wavering,
said he would vote for at least one article of impeachment because
he had concluded that Clinton's case ``is no more about sex than
Watergate was about a third-rate burglary.''
</P>
<P>
   But another Republican, Connie Morella of Maryland, said she
would vote against impeachment. No matter what happens, she said,
Clinton's legacy ``shall be indelibly stained.'' Still another
Republican who had been expected to oppose impeachment, Peter King
of Long Island, said he would vote no.
</P>
<P>
   But a Democrat who had been leaning toward impeachment, Paul
McHale of Pennsylvania, said he would indeed break ranks with his
party and vote in favor. So did Charles Stenholm, a conservative
Democrat from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ray LaHood, who comes from the quintessentially Middle
American city of Peoria, Ill., presided over the protracted debate,
in which dozens of members participated. He urged decorum as
speeches began at 9:29 a.m., Eastern time, but he had difficulty
maintaining it, repeatedly pounding his gavel for order.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde made a not entirely successful attempt to lend a sense of
patriotic majesty to the occasion. He cited not only Roman law, the
Magna Carta and the Constitutional Congress but also the Civil War,
and the battles of Bunker Hill and Lexington and Concord.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the debate was more a series of political set
pieces rather than a clash of oratorical titans in the mold of Clay
or Webster.
</P>
<P>
   A low buzz hovered over the House chamber for most of the day,
fed by whispered chats among members, ad hoc conferences, the
rustle of turning newspaper pages and speeches practiced in stage
whispers. A few times, hissing and hooting was heard.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats bemoaned the lack of civility characterizing the
entire process that has brought the president and the nation to the
current moment of crisis. Applause greeted a demand by Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, for an end to ``the
politics of slash and burn.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning, the public galleries were packed and almost
all the House's 435 members were in their brown leather seats. But
by midday, the chamber itself was half empty, as if all the drama
had been wrung out of the debate as soon as it started. By late
afternoon, only 38 members were there, though there were still
lines of people waiting for gallery seats.
</P>
<P>
   In backstairs conferences Friday morning, the two sides reached
an agreement on the length and of the debate and other rules,
avoiding a series of noisy public procedural squabbles that both
decided they did not want.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans moderated their rhetoric a bit, softening the
prosecutorial tone they adopted in the Judiciary Committee's
proceedings. But the Democrats' fury showed through.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers of Michigan said that he was witnessing ``a
Republican coup d'etat,'' and the same phrase was used by his party
colleagues, Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York and Rep. Maxine Waters
of California. At another point, in a more analytical mood, Conyers
stated one of the central Democratic contentions: ``Impeachment was
designed to rid this nation of traitors and tyrants, not attempts
to cover up an extramarital affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rep. Ike Skelton, D.-Mo., said the Republicans wanted to
``decapitate their commander in chief.'' Rep. Steven Rothman,
D.-N.J., complained of a ``Republican juggernaut, driven by the
right wing.'' Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D.-R.I., a nephew of the late
John F. Kennedy, spoke of ``a political lynching,'' and Rep. Danny
K. Davis of Illinois denounced what he described as ``a lynching.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D.-Ill., son of the civil rights leader,
said impeachment constituted an attack not only on Clinton but also
on the accomplishments of the New Deal, the Fair Deal and the Great
Society. African-Americans, who benefited hugely from all of those
programs, have been among the president's staunchest backers from
the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1868,'' Jackson said, referring to the impeachment of
President Andrew Johnson, ``it was about Reconstruction. In 1998,
it's still about Reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   There were repeated references to the Johnson impeachment, which
was voted upon in the same House chamber where the debate took
place Friday, and to the Watergate case in 1974. Articles of
impeachment never reached the full House on that occasion, because
Richard M. Nixon concluded that his conviction in the Senate was
certain and resigned the presidency to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my colleagues,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio of California, a
Democrat who is retiring, ``obsess about Slick Willie in the same
way that those on my side of aisle used to about Tricky Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., brought up the House Judiciary
Committee's decision in 1974 that suspicions about Richard Nixon's
1969 tax returns did not justify impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman noted that a Republican congressman who would one day be
the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, had agreed
in that instance that impeachment of a president was not warranted
except for misconduct dangerous to the constitutional system.
</P>
<P>
   But the continuing air assault on Iraq came up even more often.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggested that the Democrats saw a political opening in the
Republicans' decision to stage the debate while the bombs were
still falling. But some seemed genuinely offended; their views were
crystallized on Thursday night by Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who
served in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't separate the president from the
commander-in-chief,'' he said. ``You can't salute him in the
morning and impeach him in the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Rangel asked Republicans, ``What has this
president done to cause so much hatred, so much animosity?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You brought hatred to this floor,'' Rangel said, accusing them
of having a ``lynch-mob mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, Rep. Sam Johnson of Texas, a former pilot
who languished for seven years in a North Vietnamese
prisoner-of-war camp, made this retort: ``Our military fighting men
want the Congress to carry on our responsibilities every day.''
</P>
<P>
   A potentially volatile ingredient was injected into the
political equation by the confession of marital infidelity Rep. Bob
Livingston of Louisiana, the Speaker-elect, made on Thursday
evening. But there were only a few heavily veiled allusions to his
difficulties during the debate, all from the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the item under debate Friday was called House
Resolution 611.
</P>
<P>
   As read out Friday morning in a somber voice by the House
reading clerk, Paul Hays, it began, ``Resolved, that William
Jefferson Clinton, president of the United States, is impeached for
high crimes and misdemeanors,'' and went on to accuse Clinton of
perjury before a grand jury and in the Paula Jones lawsuit, of
obstructing justice in a variety of ways, and of abusing his power
by lying to and misleading Congress in his answers to 81 questions
posed by the House Judiciary Committee.

``reprehensible'' acts and made ``deceitful'' statements to cover
them up, Democratic members of the House argued that his actions
did not come close to warranting impeachment, that they should be
given an opportunity to vote on censure as an alternative to
impeachment _ an option the majority has denied them _ and that the
debate should not be taking place in any case during military
action in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president did was wrong,'' said Rep. John Dingell of
Michigan, the dean of the House, who has represented a district
near Detroit since 1955, in direct succession to his father, also
John Dingell, who had represented it since 1932. ``What we are
doing is equally wrong _ an exercise in the abuse of power by the
majority over the minority.''
</P>
<P>
   The House's only independent member, Rep. Bernard Sanders of
Vermont, decried the prospect of a vote ``perhaps to paralyze our
government as the Senate explores Bill Clinton's extramarital
relations.'' He said that he had realized as never before ``just
how out of touch this institution is with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans pressed resolutely forward with their accusations
that Clinton had committed perjury, had obstructed justice and had
abused his powers as president, all to conceal the truth about the
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dramatic and possibly telling interventions came
from Rep. Tom Campbell of California, a moderate Republican often
criticized in his district for being insufficiently conservative.
He said in a soft voice that he could never trust Clinton again _
indeed that he had been persuaded that the bombing campaign was
legitimate only when Pentagon officials said it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is in his interest not to tell the truth,'' the
Californian said in a blunt indictment of Clinton, ``he will not
tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's flawless legal pedigree _ son of a federal judge,
star student at the Harvard Law School, clerk to a Supreme Court
justice, former professor at Stanford Law School _ lent weight to
his words.
</P>
<P>
   Another California Republican, Rep. Frank Riggs, one of 41
departing members who will cast the last votes of their
congressional careers Saturday, said he had talked on Wednesday to
two prominent Republicans, former President Gerald Ford and former
Sen. Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee. Both, he
reported, said that they would have voted to impeach. In an op-ed
article in The New York Times on Oct. 4, Mr. Ford proposed that Mr.
Clinton be rebuked in the well of the House.
</P>
<P>
   What little suspense there was in the daylong debate came as
some lawmakers who had been fence-sitters declared their
intentions. Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., who had been wavering,
said he would vote for at least one article of impeachment because
he had concluded that Clinton's case ``is no more about sex than
Watergate was about a third-rate burglary.''
</P>
<P>
   But another Republican, Connie Morella of Maryland, said she
would vote against impeachment. No matter what happens, she said,
Clinton's legacy ``shall be indelibly stained.'' Still another
Republican who had been expected to oppose impeachment, Peter King
of Long Island, said he would vote no.
</P>
<P>
   But a Democrat who had been leaning toward impeachment, Paul
McHale of Pennsylvania, said he would indeed break ranks with his
party and vote in favor. So did Charles Stenholm, a conservative
Democrat from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ray LaHood, who comes from the quintessentially Middle
American city of Peoria, Ill., presided over the protracted debate,
in which dozens of members participated. He urged decorum as
speeches began at 9:29 a.m., Eastern time, but he had difficulty
maintaining it, repeatedly pounding his gavel for order.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde made a not entirely successful attempt to lend a sense of
patriotic majesty to the occasion. He cited not only Roman law, the
Magna Carta and the Constitutional Congress but also the Civil War,
and the battles of Bunker Hill and Lexington and Concord.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the debate was more a series of political set
pieces rather than a clash of oratorical titans in the mold of Clay
or Webster.
</P>
<P>
   A low buzz hovered over the House chamber for most of the day,
fed by whispered chats among members, ad hoc conferences, the
rustle of turning newspaper pages and speeches practiced in stage
whispers. A few times, hissing and hooting was heard.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats bemoaned the lack of civility characterizing the
entire process that has brought the president and the nation to the
current moment of crisis. Applause greeted a demand by Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, for an end to ``the
politics of slash and burn.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning, the public galleries were packed and almost
all the House's 435 members were in their brown leather seats. But
by midday, the chamber itself was half empty, as if all the drama
had been wrung out of the debate as soon as it started. By late
afternoon, only 38 members were there, though there were still
lines of people waiting for gallery seats.
</P>
<P>
   In backstairs conferences Friday morning, the two sides reached
an agreement on the length and of the debate and other rules,
avoiding a series of noisy public procedural squabbles that both
decided they did not want.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans moderated their rhetoric a bit, softening the
prosecutorial tone they adopted in the Judiciary Committee's
proceedings. But the Democrats' fury showed through.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers of Michigan said that he was witnessing ``a
Republican coup d'etat,'' and the same phrase was used by his party
colleagues, Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York and Rep. Maxine Waters
of California. At another point, in a more analytical mood, Conyers
stated one of the central Democratic contentions: ``Impeachment was
designed to rid this nation of traitors and tyrants, not attempts
to cover up an extramarital affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rep. Ike Skelton, D.-Mo., said the Republicans wanted to
``decapitate their commander in chief.'' Rep. Steven Rothman,
D.-N.J., complained of a ``Republican juggernaut, driven by the
right wing.'' Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D.-R.I., a nephew of the late
John F. Kennedy, spoke of ``a political lynching,'' and Rep. Danny
K. Davis of Illinois denounced what he described as ``a lynching.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D.-Ill., son of the civil rights leader,
said impeachment constituted an attack not only on Clinton but also
on the accomplishments of the New Deal, the Fair Deal and the Great
Society. African-Americans, who benefited hugely from all of those
programs, have been among the president's staunchest backers from
the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1868,'' Jackson said, referring to the impeachment of
President Andrew Johnson, ``it was about Reconstruction. In 1998,
it's still about Reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   There were repeated references to the Johnson impeachment, which
was voted upon in the same House chamber where the debate took
place Friday, and to the Watergate case in 1974. Articles of
impeachment never reached the full House on that occasion, because
Richard M. Nixon concluded that his conviction in the Senate was
certain and resigned the presidency to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my colleagues,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio of California, a
Democrat who is retiring, ``obsess about Slick Willie in the same
way that those on my side of aisle used to about Tricky Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., brought up the House Judiciary
Committee's decision in 1974 that suspicions about Richard Nixon's
1969 tax returns did not justify impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman noted that a Republican congressman who would one day be
the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, had agreed
in that instance that impeachment of a president was not warranted
except for misconduct dangerous to the constitutional system.
</P>
<P>
   But the continuing air assault on Iraq came up even more often.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggested that the Democrats saw a political opening in the
Republicans' decision to stage the debate while the bombs were
still falling. But some seemed genuinely offended; their views were
crystallized on Thursday night by Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who
served in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't separate the president from the
commander-in-chief,'' he said. ``You can't salute him in the
morning and impeach him in the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Rangel asked Republicans, ``What has this
president done to cause so much hatred, so much animosity?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You brought hatred to this floor,'' Rangel said, accusing them
of having a ``lynch-mob mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, Rep. Sam Johnson of Texas, a former pilot
who languished for seven years in a North Vietnamese
prisoner-of-war camp, made this retort: ``Our military fighting men
want the Congress to carry on our responsibilities every day.''
</P>
<P>
   A potentially volatile ingredient was injected into the
political equation by the confession of marital infidelity Rep. Bob
Livingston of Louisiana, the Speaker-elect, made on Thursday
evening. But there were only a few heavily veiled allusions to his
difficulties during the debate, all from the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the item under debate Friday was called House
Resolution 611.
</P>
<P>
   As read out Friday morning in a somber voice by the House
reading clerk, Paul Hays, it began, ``Resolved, that William
Jefferson Clinton, president of the United States, is impeached for
high crimes and misdemeanors,'' and went on to accuse Clinton of
perjury before a grand jury and in the Paula Jones lawsuit, of
obstructing justice in a variety of ways, and of abusing his power
by lying to and misleading Congress in his answers to 81 questions
posed by the House Judiciary Committee.

   The television screen showed the House of Representatives more
than three-quarters empty. And if Congress wasn't watching, why
should we? The House floor was meant to be the site of
history-making drama, but the action Friday was all off-stage. It
was definitely on camera, though, captured in the talk of reporters
and commentators who helped shape the political spin and
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The day and the television coverage had started with a far
different tone, dramatic and anachronistic in its aura of ceremony
and historical import. Paul Hays, the house reading clerk, read the
four articles of impeachment against President Clinton. A balding,
nondescript man, he looked like Middle America, an odd touch of
realism in the midst of chiseled television correspondents and
politicians with conspicuous hair weaves.
</P>
<P>
   The weight of the impeachment process seemed to sink in further
each time he repeated the words ending each article: ``William
Jefferson Clinton has undermined the integrity of his office, has
brought disrepute on the presidency, has betrayed his trust as
president.'' The portentousness did not come exclusively from the
content; every network and cable channel focused on this reading
without commentary, creating the rare, unanimous sense that this
was truly a moment of history.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, there was a passionate argument on the floor, as Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the Judiciary Committee chairman, spoke in
favor of impeachment and Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the minority
leader, objected to having the debate during the U.S. military
attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But as the speeches became familiar echoes of the Judiciary
Committee hearings, the networks cut away to talking heads. In the
most lightweight and ludicrous instance, while most network cameras
were still focused on the House floor, NBC went to a Maria Shriver
interview with Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif., whose on-screen
identifications included ``Elected in 1998'' and ``Widow of Rep.
Sonny Bono.'' In this celebrity-driven moment, as Ms. Bono repeated
without analysis the often-heard Republican line that the
impeachment was about ``the rule of law,'' it seemed as if Vanity
Fair magazine were setting the tone for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The serious news came with updates from Baghdad, as these two
stories continued to veer erratically in and out of each others'
paths. The networks carried a briefing by Defense Secretary William
Cohen. The cable channels (and, briefly, NBC) cut away from
Congress to cover a news conference by Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime
minister of Iraq. But, when word came that the debate would
continue until 10 p.m., with the impeachment vote scheduled for
Saturday, the networks returned to their soap operas. (NBC and CBS
offered local stations a choice of network news coverage or
entertainment shows. ABC offered its regular shows or House images
without commentary.)
</P>
<P>
   There was every reason to leave. The votes had been counted if
not cast. As Tom Brokaw said on NBC, in words often echoed through
the day, ``Barring an unforeseen miracle on behalf of the
president, he will be impeached by noon tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable channels dutifully dipped in and out of the debate all
day. But when Judy Woodruff of CNN looked at the nearly-empty House
floor and described ``this building, where all the action is
today,'' it sounded like a rote lesson from an outdated history
book. The action was clearly elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   George Stephanopoulos offered a more sophisticated sense of the
battle that was actually taking place. As he had pointed out the
previous day on ABC, the Democrats knew the impeachment fight was
lost; it was now a matter of who would win the spin.
</P>
<P>
   That made a briefing by White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart
at least as relevant as what was happening in the House. Lockhart
said Republicans were ``dumbing down impeachment'' and using a
``cynical political strategy'' in first playing down the importance
of impeachment and then using an impeachment vote to call for
Clinton's resignation. Analyzing that news conference on MSNBC,
Brian Williams said, ``Notice the talking point: dumbing down
impeachment. It's been handed to the Democrats; you will hear it
all day.'' (He was right; the term had already been heard in the
House debate.) Don't think for a second that dissecting a press
conference is trivial or merely time-filling. It is crucially
important in this political equivalent of a chess game, with
Republicans and Democrats looking several moves ahead to a possible
trial in the Senate, and floating every idea on television.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the cable channels went to Baghdad every time an air
raid warning sounded. In one false alarm, what seemed to be a new
bombing attack turned out to be a cannon set off to announce that
Ramadan would begin at dawn. Though the pictures from Iraq
continued to be startling, a fresher turn in the coverage came
after the first attack Wednesday. In daylight, reporters have been
making it clear how short a leash they are on, being led to see the
damage the Iraqis want to show, unable to wander freely to verify
damage or deaths independently.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, reporters and commentators were looking ahead to the
statement promised from the president after the impeachment vote,
and beyond that to a Senate trial or (possibly floating ideas for
both sides) a censure deal.
</P>
<P>
   And, looking at the empty House floor, some commentators
speculated that the representatives and the public were following
the debate on television. There was no reason to think they were,
or that they should, when television's talking heads were so
clearly the ones moving this process along.

 UNDECIDED REPUBLICANS SHOWN DOCUMENTS ON '70s CLINTON ALLEGATION  
(rl) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Democrats complained Friday that some
Republicans who were undecided on impeachment had been shown sealed
documents that the House Judiciary Committee received from the
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, which include investigative materials pertaining
to an unsubstantiated encounter between President Clinton and a
woman in the 1970s, were shown to lawmakers like Reps. Mark Souder
of Indiana and Christopher Shays of Connecticut, Republican
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The document referred to by the officials was an affidavit filed
in the Paula Jones case. Officials said it was forwarded from
Kenneth Starr's office to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One official said he did not know who had alerted Souder but
that Souder had been told that anyone voting against impeachment
would look bad if the document became public. The official said the
document seemed to have bothered Souder, who worried it might be
true. The White House has previously denied the allegation in it.
</P>
<P>
   But the official said that Souder might still vote against
impeachment since the document was not part of the impeachment
record. Shays has not announced a decision.
