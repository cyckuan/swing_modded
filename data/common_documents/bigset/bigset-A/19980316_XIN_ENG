<HEADLINE> Sudan to Restore Expropriated Egyptian Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- In a step towards improving the
long-hit ties with Egypt, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has
ordered necessary arrangements to restore Egyptian property in
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"The arrangements fit within the Khartoum government's policies
to remove obstacles impeding progress of the long-established ties
with Cairo," said a statement released by the Sudanese Embassy
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to sources of the embassy, al-Bashir's instructions
cover the branch of Cairo University in Khartoum, public schools
and the guesthouse of an Egyptian irrigation and hydrological
survey team.
</P>
<P>
These properties have been seized by Khartoum over chilling
relations after an Islamist-backed government assumed power in
Sudan in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Ad hoc committees composed of officials of the Sudanese
irrigation and education ministries began as of Sunday putting
al-Bashir's directives into effect, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir's decision came just a month after the two countries
resumed the river Nile navigation after a hiatus of three years, a
move hailed by both sides as a good turn after a long period of
deteriorating ties.
</P>
<P>
The neighbors were at odds over a border dispute and have
traded accusations of harboring militants and oppositions, but
there are signs of a tentative thaw in relations.
</P>
<P>
A top-level Egyptian delegation, headed by Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri, recently went to Khartoum to convey condolences over
the death of Sudanese First Vice President al-Zubeir Mohammed Salih
in a plane accident.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Saturday voiced pleasure
over the amelioration in relations between the two neighbors,
saying he would hold talks with his Sudanese counterpart Mustafa
Ismail in Cairo on March 23.

<HEADLINE> Israel Strives to Thwart Cook's Har Homa Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli government is making
intense efforts Sunday to thwart a planned visit by British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook to the controversial site Har Homa
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At the weekly Israeli Cabinet session, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu described as "unacceptable" Cook's planned visit to Har
Homa with Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Minister of
Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry has been ordered to hold intense contacts
with British Foreign Office in a bid to cancel Cook's visit to Har
Homa, where Israel is building a Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
Cook, whose country is holding the rotating presidency of
European Union, is due here on Tuesday as part of his upcoming
Middle Eastern tour that also includes Palestine, Egypt, Jordan,
Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel began the construction of Har Homa settlement in March
last year, precipitating the deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks. The PNA charged Israel for violating the Oslo accords which
demand both sides refrain from changing the status quo of
Jerusalem, whose fate should be settled through permanent talks.
</P>
<P>
Husseini was vague about the exact itinerary of Cook's Har
Homa tour and his role in it. Local English daily The Jerusalem
Post quoted him as saying Sunday that he and Cook would hold a
meeting, but he was not clear about the exact plan for the Har
Homa visit. "If he (Cook) asks me to go there I will go with him,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government was also upset by the reports that Cook
would launch a new initiative to break the deadlock in the
Israeli-Palestinian talks by demanding Israel carry out 15-20
percent further pullback in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The government, which is only willing to redeploy troops from 9
percent of West Bank in the second redeployment, has said it would
not compromise on any issues over its security.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Plans to Increase Export of Tea in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam plans to export 35,000
tonnes of dried tea buds in 1998, a 12 percent year-on-year
increase, according to Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development.
</P>
<P>
The export in the first two months of this year amounted to
nearly 5,000 tonnes, a 53.5 percent growth as compared
to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
To encourage tea planting, Vietnam's Tea Corporation has raised
its price for the purchase of fresh tea buds by 10 percent as
compared to last year.
</P>
<P>
This year, the corporation will concentrate efforts in
fertilizing land and promoting intensive farming on the present tea
acreage of 70,000 hectares which are expected to yield 10 tonnes
of fresh bud per hectare. Meanwhile another 5,000 hectares will
be planted with a new tea strain which can yield 15 tonnes of buds
per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The corporation also plans to put six new processing factories,
equipped with modern technology, into operation this year, and
build a number of small-sized factories in tea growing areas.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwen Ruling Party Supporters Call for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A number of the Zimbabwean ruling
ZANU (pf) supporters Sunday agreed that the constitution must be
amended to ensure a limited presidential term, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was made when the 200 ZANU supporters met in
Bulawayo, the second biggest city in the country. They were
addressed by Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa who said that
the request for a limited presidential term did not mean that
they wanted president robert mugabe to go.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe has been leader of the country since independence in
1980.
</P>
<P>
Dabengwa, a member of the ruling party politburo said, ''In
all this debate, nobody is saying the current leadership should
go.''
</P>
<P>
He said that people should be allowed to debate the question
of succession in the leadership of both the party and government.
</P>
<P>
''Some of us in leadership are now old. They are in the
twilight of their lives. They will need to be replaced,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
''It is you who should choose the next leadership. A
leadership that will decentralise power. A leadership that has
national appeal and will treat all Zimbabweans equally,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
On the constitution, Dabengwa said, ''The main issue being
debated on the national constitution is the term of the
president. Some people say the constitution must specify that a
president should serve two five-year terms only, while others say
that part of the constitution should be left as it is.''
</P>
<P>
''These are the things we are appealing to you to discuss
seriously and make recommendations through the party hierarchy
and subsequently to parliament until the issue is resolved,'' the
minister said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Faces Shortage of Vaccines for Livestock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is facing serious
shortages of vaccines to combat livestock diseases because its
major South African supplier is failing to meet the demand, a
senior government official said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Veterinary Services Director Stuart Hargreaves told the
Zimbabwe News Agency that Onderstepoort, South Africa's largest
veterinary institute, could not produce enough vaccines due to
staff shortages.
</P>
<P>
South African press recently reported that five out of the six
of the institute's vaccine specialists were leaving the country
for greener pastures.
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned about the shortage because a disaster
is imminent if an outbreak of major diseases occurs," the
director said.
</P>
<P>
Vaccines for combating endemic diseases such as heart water
and gall sickness had already run out of stock in Zimbabwe, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The country was not experiencing any major animal disease
outbreaks, save for a few cattle dying from tick-borne diseases,
Hargreaves noted.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is relatively quiet these day," Hargreaves
said, "but we are on the watch for any serious outbreaks."
</P>
<P>
Veterinary experts in Namibia had been warned against an
expected outbreak of lumpy skin diseases, another sickness for
which vaccine stocks at Onderstepoort were critically low.
</P>
<P>
Vaccines for foot-and-mouth and lung disease were also said to
be running out fast.

<HEADLINE> IGAD Summit to Open in Djibouti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi Sunday left here for Djibouti to attend the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) summit due to
open on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the IGAD member states have begun their
meeting there Saturday for preparation of the forthcoming summit.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the Somali conflict and southern
Sudan civil war will be on the agenda of the summit.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached by Somali two main faction
leaders Hussein Aideed and Ali Mahdi, at the end of last year, a
national reconciliation conference would have been held at Baidoa
in February this year. However, the Baidoa conference failed to
be held as schedule. Hostilities and fightings still prevail in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The 67th ordinary session of the Council of Ministers of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) held at the end of February
pointed out: ''The peace and national reconciliation process is
at a critical stage''in Somalia and urged ''all the parties to
work together with a view to achieving national reconciliation''.
</P>
<P>
The seven member states of IGAD are Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya,
Uganda, Sudan, Djibouti and Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Retail Trading in Bonds to Be Conducted on Lusaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Zambia announced on
Sunday that all retail trading in bonds will be conducted on the
Lusaka Stock Exchange (LUSE) with effect from Monday.
</P>
<P>
This will promote transparency in market dealings and improve
market efficiency while reducing the risks associated with using
papers as well as the continual cost of safe custody, Zambia News
Agency (ZANA) quoted Kabinga Pan de, the public relations manager
of the central bank, as saying.
</P>
<P>
He explained that this action to activate secondary market
liquidity and improve price formation requires the broadest
possible participation, in particular the engagement of small
investors.
</P>
<P>
The minimum value of orders placed on the LUSE for trading
will be 100,000 Zambian Kwacha (about 65 U.S. Dollars) to
encourage more participants.
</P>
<P>
These measures, said Pande, will enhance liquidity in the
Zambian financial system and result in better price formation in
addition to laying a foundation for the development of longer
dated capital market instruments by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The central bank official urged the public and other non-bank
institutions interested in investing in bonds to contact
commercial banks, the only institutions to conduct all retail
trading and rediscounting of bonds on the LUSE.

<HEADLINE> Health Service Coverage Rises in Ethiopian Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Health Bureau of Afar
Region announced on Sunday that the health service coverage in
the region which was rather low four years back, has now risen to
11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Afar Region which located in north-eastern part of Ethiopia is
a backward region in the country. The rise in health service
coverage should be attributed to a rapid increase in the number
of health professionals and institutions in the region over the
last four years.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau of the Afar Region, the number of
health stations and clinics in the region which was only two and
15 respectively in 1994, now reached four and 47 respectively.
Two new hospitals have also been built in the region during the
stated period. At present there are more than 350 health
professionals in the region.
</P>
<P>
The region plans to increase the health coverage to 29 percent
in the near future with particular emphasis to be put on
expanding services to the rural parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
The health service coverage in Ethiopia currently stands at 40
percent and the nation is determined to increase it to 50
percent in the coming five years, said an announcement
made recently by the Ministry of Health.

<HEADLINE> 5 Killed, 50 Injured in Iran's Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A strong earthquake on Saturday
has killed five people and injured 50 in Iran's southeastern
province of Kerman, a relief official said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA quoted Red Crescent Society
official Mohammad Dabaghzadeh as saying that the quake inflicted
heavy damage on about 2,000 residential units of 3,600 houses in
the district of Golbaf, some 950 kilometers south of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The quake, measuring 6.8 degrees on the open-ended Richter
scale, occurred at 23:12 local time (1942 GMT) in Golbaf district,
well-known for hand-woven carpets, and affected some 15
surrounding villages.
</P>
<P>
Golbaf has a population of 24,000. In 1981, an earthquake of
the same magnitude rocked the region, killing 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
IRNA attributed the low casualties in Saturday's quake to the
safety measures taken in construction of buildings in the wake of
the 1981 quake.
</P>
<P>
Head of the provincial headquarters for natural disasters
Mohsen Salehi said the relief operations to rescue those trapped
under the debris were completed within four hours after the quake.
</P>
<P>
He said the hit areas were quickly identified and relief
workers rushed to the area 20 minutes after the quake. A total of
23 ambulances, 2,550 blankets, 370 makeshift tents, food and
medicines were immediately dispatched to the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IRNA reported that the central and southwestern
provinces of Kohkilouyeh, Boyer Ahmad and Yazd were also jolted by
mild quakes over the past two days. No reports were available
about possible casualties.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Awards Giant Project to Public Bidders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A contract was signed here Sunday
to build one of the world's largest pumping stations for a huge
land reclamation project in Egypt by a group of Egyptian and
foreign companies, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Described as a "unique engineering project," the station will
pump water from Egypt's largest man-made lake, Lake Nasser, into
the Sheikh Zayed Canal, which is now under construction for a year.
</P>
<P>
The pumping station will be built in four years at a total cost
of 1.48 billion Egyptian pounds (435.3 million U.S. dollars) by
Egyptian, British, Japanese and Norwegian companies.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian component will be about 25 percent of the total
cost of mechanical works and about 50 percent for civil works.
</P>
<P>
The canal, known as the South Valley or Toshka project, is
designed to pump 5 billion cubic meters of water a year from Lake
Nasser into the Western Desert to bring one million feddans
(420,000 hectares) under cultivation.
</P>
<P>
The investments of the South Valley project amount to about 300
billion pounds (88.2 billion dollars), and the government will
bear 20 percent, in cash, for the infrastructure, said Prime
Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, who attended the signing ceremony with
other cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed by engineer Abdel Latif Askar, head of
the Mechanical Department at the Ministry of Public Works and
Water Resources, and a representative of the Union of the Egyptian
and Foreign Companies which will carry out the project.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Abu Zeid, minister of public works and water resources,
said that the station includes a 4.5 kilometer inlet inside Lake
Nasser to adjust to water level changes, a sucking basin and a
discharge basin, administrative buildings, workshops and annexed
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Electricity is building a transformers station
now to feed the pumping station. It will be ready in 15 months.

<HEADLINE> Iran Raps U.S. Double Standard over Nuclear Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday blamed the United
States for its double-standard stance towards nuclear projects in
different countries, and repeated its call for freeing the Middle
East from weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said the U.S. is launching a
"unsubstantiated propaganda" against Iran to divert attention from
the U.S. support for Israel and its stockpile of nuclear weaponry.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. propaganda, Mohammadi said, "seeks to deprive
independent countries of economic and industrial development."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran's nuclear activities were for peaceful
objectives, and its cooperation with other countries in the field
of nuclear technology fully complies with international
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said the International Atomic Energy Agency is
monitoring Iran's nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the U.S. double-standard stance towards the
issue of nuclear capability by various states, voicing Tehran's
position that the Middle East region should be free from weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"The regional countries should pay due attention to the serious
threat posed by the Zionist regime (Israel) and should further
move through international organizations to control the regime's
weapons of mass destruction," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Iran puts emphasis on eradication of weapons of mass
destruction, and within the framework of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference, it would pursue its goal of ridding the region
of such weapons, he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thriving East African Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Zhang Dacheng)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 15 (Xinhua) - Though only two-year-old on
Saturday, the East African Cooperation (EAC) has laid a solid
foundation for common development and prosperity for its three
member states, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Stretching roots back to the former East African Community
which collapsed in 1977, the EAC has rekindled hope for a total
of some 80 million Kiswahili-speaking residents along the Great
Rift Valley, which is well known as one of the cradles of the
human civilization.
</P>
<P>
The defunct community, founded in accordance with a treaty
signed by presidents of the three neighbouring countries in
Kampala, Uganda, in June 1967, several years after their
independence from the western colonizers, explored positively
regional cooperation by establishing joint ventures in the
sectors of railway, ports, telecommunication, aviation as well as
banks.
</P>
<P>
However, the 10n-year-old Community disintegrated in February
1977 following the development of independent railway, aviation
and other companies in its member states.
</P>
<P>
Spurred by waves of the worldwide regional cooperation,
Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda united again on November 22, 1991 by
forming a Permanent Tripartite Commission at the ministerial
level, and finally, the East African Cooperation was ushered in
on March 14, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The new EAC, whose Secretariat is based in Tanzania's northern
city of Arusha, the so-called "heart of the three states", is
entrusted with a mandate to promote a people-centered economic,
political, social and cultural development on the basis of
balance, equity and mutual benefit by exploiting the natural and
human resources in the region.
</P>
<P>
From the very beginning, the EAC identified economic
cooperation as its key priority and its immediate focus was put
on economic infrastructure in the sectors of transport,
telecommunication, energy as well as movement of capital,
information and technologies.
</P>
<P>
Great progress have been made over the past two years. For
example, the currencies of the three states were made
convertible, the double taxation lifted and the oil pipeline from
Eldoret, Kenya, to Kampala of Uganda extended.
</P>
<P>
The most important achievement is that a mutual-confidence has
been built among the three EAC states which have mapped out a
series of macro-economic growth plans with the EAC Development
Strategy (1997-2000) at the core. The plans have won extensive
support from international and regional organs such as the World
Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of
African Unity, the Southern Africa Development Community and from
countries in Europe, Asia and America.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, a lot still remains to be done but all indications
are that we are moving on the right track," said Francis
Muthaura, the EAC Executive Secretary, in a statement released
Saturday to mark the second anniversary of the EAC's foundation.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the increasing interest shown by both local and
foreign investors, he said, the EAC will hold a two-day donors'
meeting by the end of this May to collect fund for the ambitious
regional road and railway networks.
</P>
<P>
An EAC summit is also planned in June to sign an agreement to
upgrade the cooperation to the treaty level and to formally
launch the long-expected east African passports to guarantee free
movement of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, sources from the Tanzanian Defense Ministry
disclosed that Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda will take a joint
military exercise in northern Tanzania in the near future, which
will be the first of its kind in the history.
</P>
<P>
At a cocktail party in Arusha on Saturday evening, Jakaya
Kikwete, the Tanzanian Minister of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation, and current Chairman of the EAC
Permanent Tripartite Commission, outlined EAC's long-range
perspective as a single market and an East African Federation.
</P>
<P>
Julius Nyerere, Tanzania's first president since independence,
once said that one of the important reasons for the slow African
economic development is that many African countries whose borders
were demarcated maliciously by the western colonizers, are too
small to engage in large-scale economic construction.
</P>
<P>
The 76-year-old Nyerere, who is respectfully called "Muwalim"
( means "teacher" in the Kiswahili language), said last month
that he has been longing for an early unity of all the African
countries, especially the three in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that I would be the first permanent representative of
the `East African Federation' to the United Nations," said the
Muwalim, voicing the aspirations of the people of the three EAC
members for a common development and prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Arab Ministers to Sign Anti-Terrorism Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Arab ministers of justice and
interior will sign in April the first collective Arab
anti-terrorism and extremism pact after four years of debate, the
Middle East News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will convene at the Arab League headquarters in
Cairo on April 22 to endorse the final draft of the deal ahead of
the signing ceremony, said the Egyptian Minister of Justice Farouq
Seif el-Nasr, who unveiled the date of the signing.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting of an ad hoc technical committee, which
convened here last week, a consensus was reached on the final
draft of the pact after a thorough revision.
</P>
<P>
"The deal is designed to enhance inter-Arab cooperation in the
face of terrorism and extremism threatening the Arab region,"
el-Nasr said.
</P>
<P>
The deal underlined principles of Islam, international law, the
Charter of the United Nations and related anti-terrorism
international agreements, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The draft agreement gives peoples the right to struggle against
foreign occupation to win independence and maintain
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
Extradition of criminals, joint anti-terrorism research and an
identification of terrorism are included in the draft blueprint.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Cuts Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has cut its budget by 14
billion Ugandan Shillings (some 13 million U.S. Dollars) this
month to fit its revenue collection condition, the Monitor
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate made by Keith Muhakanizi, the special
adviser to the finance minister, the country failed to realize
its revenue target by 22 billion Shillings, and has to spend an
extra expenditure of 6 billion Shillings due to El-Nino on
repairing roads, treating cholera patients.
</P>
<P>
Uganda decided to cut a large proportion of its non-wage
expenditure in government agencies and cancel all development
expenditure for this month.
</P>
<P>
The cut will reduce consumption and most likely slow down
economic growth for this financial year, local analysts noted.
</P>
<P>
The government made the decision to qualify for a proposed 700
million debt relief in April under World Bank and International
Monetary Fund program, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Imports form Kenya could not reach Uganda in time and
quantities due to destruction of the roads and railway from
Mombasa (Kenya port city) )to Kampala, and that has a negative
influence on revenue collection, said Lawrence Kiiza, the
Commissioner for Taxation in the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Import contributes 60 percent of the total revenue of the
country, Kiiza said.
</P>
<P>
Farmers can not transport their products to market in time and
this greatly reduced the income of the people in countryside.
</P>
<P>
Majority of the rural population could not earn their usual
money and they could not buy things produced in cities and towns,
that also means the government could not get taxes as usual, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Key Minister Submits Pullback Plan from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli National Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon submitted a proposal about Israeli troop
pullback from southern Lebanon to a cabinet meeting on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, which Sharon made public in an
interview with a television station on Friday, Israel would
conduct a unilateral, gradual and phased troop pullback from
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel would issue a warning that any attacks
launched on Israel from Lebanese soil after Israeli troop pullout
would be met with severe retaliation.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to implement a pullout in stages while
monitoring any results that might ensue," he said, adding that
"Israel would make it clear in advance that it would hold Lebanon
responsible for any future cross-border attacks."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee of the Israeli
Knesset (parliament) will examine all proposals on Monday
concerning troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Sharon's proposal has won the support of prominent Knesset
member of the opposition Labor party Yossi Beilin, who is a
fervent advocate of Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Sharon's plan is a positive move which would lead to eventual
pullout of the Israeli Defense Force from Lebanon, Beilin told
Israel Radio on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel has offered to withdraw from southern Lebanon under the
United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 if the Lebanon
agrees to curb guerrilla attacks on Israel from its territory.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanon has rejected the offer, maintaining that the U.N.
resolution, which was passed in 1978, demands an unconditional
withdrawal by the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in 1985 in southern Lebanon to
allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
It has been waging a war of attrition with Lebanese resistance
forces, in which hundreds of its soldiers have lost lives.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Honor Debt Repayment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has assured creditors that Tanzania will continue
to honor its internal and external debt.
</P>
<P>
In a speech broadcast Sunday night to the whole nation, the
president said he feels obliged to correct recent misleading
media reports that the country will halt repayment of debt after
a severe flood that has brought economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need to allay fears of the internal and
external creditors," Mkapa said through Radio Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"We need to acquire more loans since our economy is still not
self-reliant," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Explaining how the country's economy is still dependent on
foreign loans, Mkapa said out of the 1997/1998 annual budget of
975.6 billion Shillings (about 1.45 billion US Dollars), 340
billion Shillings are expected to be raised from foreign loans
and grants.
</P>
<P>
In addition, by the year 2000 Tanzania will require an
estimated sum of 8.4 billion US Dollars in the form of loans and
grants to finance the country's development and expenditure.
</P>
<P>
"In the face of such an extent of dependency, where do we get
the audacity to refuse to repay our debts?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
He said the only audacity Tanzanians could show is to develop
the economy through austerity measures and speed up economic
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's external debt has reached 7.9 billion US Dollars,
more than 10 times the country's export earnings per year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, even if we were to spend our entire export
earnings without importing anything, as little as a single drop
of petrol and an aspirin tablet, it will take us 10 years to
finish repaying our external debt," the president observed.
</P>
<P>
Despite the heavy debt burden, the president said the
Tanzanian government has decided to accelerate debt repayment
pace so as to maintain honesty and dignity of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The loans, he pointed out, have in fact helped Tanzania a lot
in building infrastructures, providing social services and
launching industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
"The main task facing us is to initiate sound economic
policies, maintain good relations with donors and creditors,
enhance the spirit of self-reliance, so as to sustain the
country's economic development tempo," Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
However, he believed that it is necessary to create a
conducive atmosphere for negotiations on the possibility of
reducing repayment burden with creditors, which have produced
positive results, such as debt relief and extension of grace
periods of repayment.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Prepares for Conflict Prevention Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Minister of the 16-member Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have worked out
guidelines for the establishment of a sub-regional mechanism for
conflict prevention, management and resolution as well as
peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
The move was made at the just-concluded two-day meeting of the
ECOWAS foreign ministers in Yamoussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire, the News
Agency of Nigeria reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The official agency quoted Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi
as saying that details of the mechanism would be worked out by
experts and technical staff in liaison with the ECOWAS
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, preceded by that of ministers of defense and
internal affairs, was in response to the mandate of the ECOWAS
heads of state at their fourth extraordinary meeting in Togo last
December to implement such protocols so as to strengthen
sub-regional security and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The protocols relate to conflict prevention, early warning,
cross-border crime control and proliferation of and traffic in
small arms and narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi, who is also chairman of the ECOWAS Council of Foreign
Ministers, said the mechanism had the prospect of being
replicated by other sub-regional groups on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held after the overthrow of Sierra Leone's
military junta by ECOWAS peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) and the
reinstatement of ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, reviewed
efforts to establish a sub-regional framework for security and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also reviewed and assessed the security
situation in the sub-region, particularly in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the Nigerian-led ECOMOG is expected to play
a key role in the proposed mechanism.

<HEADLINE> Greece Announces Measures for Restructuring Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government Sunday
announced a package of drastic measures for restructuring its
ailing economy and fiscal adjustment after drachma's entry into
the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) as of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the measures, Greek National Economy and Finance
Minister Yannos Papantoniou stressed that all such measures would
be implemented within the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Greek national currency's new parity to the
European currency unit (ecu) was set at 357.00 drachmas against
one ecu, denoting a 14 percent devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Athens asked to join the ERM, saying that this would lead the
country's economy to strong "self-fueling" development.
</P>
<P>
The package reportedly provides for the partial privatization
of 11 public companies and three or four state-run banks in 1998
and 1999, with the state retaining minimum 51 percent stakes.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government will also streamline other loss-making
enterprises including Olympic airways, railways, urban transport
and the post-office in accordance with the measures.
</P>
<P>
Papantoniou stressed that the fiscal adjustment measures aimed
at reducing public deficits to 2.4 percent and 2.1 percent of the
gross domestic production (GDP) in 1998 and 1999, as well as bring
down inflation to 2.5 percent by the end of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean refugees in Nigeria
Sunday called on the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR) to repatriate them as peace has returned to their home
country.
</P>
<P>
The request came on the heels of similar calls by the more
than 6,000 Liberian refugees in Nigeria to be sent back home
following the restoration of peace in Liberia after a seven-year
civil war.
</P>
<P>
Paul Minah, Counsellor in the Sierra Leonean High Commission
in Nigeria, was quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria as
confirming that the refugees from his country had been expressing
willingness to go home.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for a feedback on the issue from the UNHCR,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UNHCR said it already began voluntary repatriation
of Liberian refugees in February despite alleged pre-occupation
with the issue.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation exercise is going on with the collaboration
and support of Nigeria's National Commission for Refugees, the
African Refugees Foundation, the Nigerian Red Cross, the Justice
and Peace Commission and other non-governmental organizations,
according to UNHCR representative in Nigeria, Guenet
Gubere-Christos.
</P>
<P>
"The voluntary repatriation of Liberians is one of the major
voluntary repatriation exercises that UNHCR will undertake in
1998," she said.
</P>
<P>
It would cost 40 million U.S.Dollars to repatriate Liberian
refugees in Nigeria, Cote d'Iivoire, Guinea, Ghana and Sierra
Leone, the UNHCR representative added.

LAGOS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- More tha 54,000 cases of leprosy
have been treated in Nigeria in the past decade, the News Agency
of Nigeria reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, when the national tuberculosis and
leprosy control program began in 1988, Nigeria had about 200,000
reported cases of leprosy.
</P>
<P>
The people affected with the ailment were treated free through
"multi-drug therapy" approach with drugs suppled by the sasakawa
Foundation through the World Health Organization, said Chukwu
Ekezie of the program.
</P>
<P>
He stated that 20 percent of those who had been treated and
discharged were now undergoing rehabilitation in lepers colonies
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the poor state of facilities in the colonies
and the beliefs that the disease makes the patient an outcast,
among other factors, lepers are seen begging on a Lagos
expressway.
</P>
<P>
A local foundation is now planning to evacuate the lepers
begging to their colony in Edo State more than 200 km to the

<HEADLINE> Trips to Athens, London Fruitful: Cyprus President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said on Sunday that his week-long trip to Greece and
Britain have been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
"The objectives of my trip were fully accomplished, since our
proposal to the Turkish Cypriots to join the government's
negotiating team was favorably accepted (by European Union
members)," Clerides told reporters upon his return from London,
where he attended the European Conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference participated by the leaders of the 15 EU members
and 11 central and eastern European countries was aimed at
discussing issues concerning EU's enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied with the fact that all countries (of the EU)
have appreciated our gesture, describing it ... as courageous and
imaginative, giving the opportunity to the Turkish Cypriot side to
respond positively," Clerides added.
</P>
<P>
But he expressed regret that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash has rejected the proposal - Denktash described the offer
for Turkish Cypriots to join the accession talks as a "Byzantine
intrigue and a trap."
</P>
<P>
Prior to his London trip, Clerides paid a three-day visit to
Athens and discussed the offer with Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers agreed at a meeting in Edinburgh, Britain,
on Saturday to open accession talks with Cyprus on March 31, as
scheduled, with or without Turkish Cypriots' participation.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops took
over the northern third of the Mediterranean island after a failed
coup by Greek Cypriot supporters for a union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which was only recognized
by Turkey, against the internationally recognized Republic of
Cyprus.

the establishment of a sub-regional peace and security
observation system as part of their efforts to contain and defuse
conflicts in the region.
</P>
<P>

<P>
The ministers therefore directed experts and the ECOWAS
secretariat to work out a mechanism for the realization of this
purpose, using the sub-regional peacekeeping force ECOMOG as the
framework.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism will incorporate the composition of troops,
decision-making process, relations between troops and political
authorities, deployment, political and diplomatic management of
crisis, command structure, training and finance, among others.

rightwing oppositions and 15.7 percent by the far-right National
Front.
</P>
<P>
This is the second defeat in a row for the Gaullist Rally for
the Republic (RPR) and its central-right ally of Union for French
Democracy (UDF), since the early legislative elections held in May
and June 1997.
</P>
<P>
The latest account jointly issued by the CSA polling
institution, France 3 television and Radio France said that the
Socialists, Communists, ecologists and other smaller leftwing
parties have won 37 percent of the votes, while the RPR and UDF
obtained 28.5 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The National Front won 15.7 percent of the votes and other
rightwing parties won 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear so far who has won the majority of the
municiple parliament of Paris region, or Ile-de-France, but the
leftist parties won a narrow majority in the traditional rightwing
stronghold of Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur with 40 to 42 seats,
against 38 to 40 seats by RPR and UDF.
</P>
<P>
The PRP and UDF maintained their majority in the local
parliaments of Alsace, Lorraine, Basse-Normandie, the Pays de
Loire and Rhone Alpes, while the leftwing parties won majority
seats in Aquitaine, Languedoc-Roussillon, Limousin, Picardie,
Nord-Pas-de-Calais, Midi-Pyrenees, Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur.
</P>
<P>
After the primary results came out, the First Secretary of the
Socialist Party Francois Hollande said: "This evening, the result
is attained."
</P>
<P>
The RPR-UDF candidate for the presidency of the Paris council,
former Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, said that the opposition
"carry collectively the responsibility" for the new defeat.
</P>
<P>
He urged all the "Republican and liberal rightwing" parties
to create a new organization to renew the RPR and UDF.
</P>
<P>
The president of the far-right National Front Jean-Marie Le Pen
said that his party has become "the only national opposition
force" after the election.

<HEADLINE> Zambia, Angola to Discuss Border Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia and Angola are to hold a
joint meeting soon to discuss the situation along their common
border, Zambian Foreign Minister Keli Walubita said here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, military inspections on the common border will be
carried out by both countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the statement as a reaction to Angola's
allegation that Zambian territory has been used to ferry arms to
Angola's former rebel movement the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Walubita said that the alleged supply of arms to UNITA through
Zambia has already been referred to the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and that Zambia is working with Angola to minimize
the tension between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Angolan Ambassador to Zambia Manuel Augusto
told a news briefing here that some Zambians have been supplying
weapons to the UNITA and that the Zambian territory is used in
many ways by these Zambians who support UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador described the situation in Zambian-Angolan
border as " serious", saying the border is almost under UNITA's
control.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Angola will try in its own ways to ensure that
Zambian territory is not used by the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
But Zambian President Frederick Chiluba last Thursday denied
that his government has any involvement in the supply of arms to
any country.
</P>
<P>
"We are a very peaceful and friendly nation and we have no
capacity to give arms to UNITA," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
After Angola's independence in 1976, the UNITA fought a civil
war for about 20 years against the government. Although the two
sides signed the Lusaka Peace Accord in 1994, peace has not
prevailed all over the country.

<HEADLINE> Syria Denounces Israeli Obstructing Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Syria on Sunday denounced Israel
for its hardline policy which has obstructed the progress of the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace process is on the brink of collapse due to Israel's
racist and anti-peace policies, Syrian Vice President Zuhair
Masharqa said at a ceremony marking the Arab Teachers' Day.
</P>
<P>
Israel is endeavoring to displace the inhabitants and owners of
the occupied Arab territories, exercising racism, oppression and
terrorism, he said.
</P>
<P>
Recent massacre in Hebron stands as an evidence of that policy,
he added, referring to three Palestinian workers killed by Israeli
troops last Tuesday at a roadblock near the West Bank city when
they drove back to Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian leader reaffirmed that peace is the strategic option
of Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Syria is seeking a just and comprehensive peace that will
provide security for all nations in the region, based on Israeli
pullback from all occupied Arab territories to the June 4, 1967
borders, from south Lebanon and the West Bekaa, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people
should be ensured, which include their right to returning home,
self-determination and an independent statehood on their national
soil.
</P>
<P>
Masharqa accused Israel's construction and expansion of Jewish
settlements, judaization of Jerusalem and execution of racist
repression and brutal terrorism against the Arabs on the occupied
territories.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti National Assembly
(Parliament) decided on Monday to adjourn its current session
until March 28 due to the resignation of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Because of its resignation, the government would not be
represented in the current or upcoming parliamentary sessions,
Parliament Speaker Ahmed Abdul Aziz Al-Sadoun said.
</P>
<P>
This has forced the parliament to take the decision, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Kuwaiti constitution, the 50-member parliament can
not hold sessions without government representation.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti cabinet resigned on Sunday after parliament members
intended to press ahead with a no-confidence motion against
Information Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah over display of
controversial books at the Arab Book Fair last month.
</P>
<P>
The move has been seen as an effort of the government to show
solidarity with the minister so as to abort parliament's
no-confidence motion attempt.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah has re-named Crown
Prince Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah as Prime Minister

BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Deputies from coastal areas to

early March, pledge to make due contributions to the country's
goal of achieving an eight-percent economic growth rate this year.
</P>
<P>
He Guoqiang, governor of east China's Fujian Province, says the

<HEADLINE> Iran Exports 105 Tonnes of Caviar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran exported 105 tonnes of caviar
worth about 11 million U.S. dollars during the current Iranian
fiscal year which ends March 20, the official news agency IRNA
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Fisheries Commercial Company Mohammad
Reza Hosseini told local press Sunday that the export of caviar
registered a 5 percent growth compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
He did not give the total amount of caviar harvested during the
year, but said the country expected to export 130-140 tonnes in
the next Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
Caviar is made of roe of the Caspian Sea sturgeon and called
"black gold" for its preciousness. Iran is a main caviar exporter
in the Caspian region, followed by Russia.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to preserve the delicious resource of the Caspian,
Hosseini said, Iran reduced the catching of sturgeon from 3,200
tonnes 10 years ago to 1,500 tonnes in the current Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that sturgeon in the Caspian was in great
jerpardy due to increasing illegal fishing and water pollution.
With the start of exploration for oil and gas in the world's
largest lake, some experts warned, the fish is faced with possible
extinction.
</P>
<P>
Hosseini said that the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in its
conference held in Zimbabwe last June decided that caviar trade
should be covered as endangered plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
Iran joined CITES in 1972, which currently has 135 members.

India's Congress party, was unanimously elected chairperson of the
Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) on Monday, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
Sonia Gandhi, Congress star campaigner in the just-concluded
general elections to the 12th Lower House of the Parliament, was
elected at a general body meeting of the CPP in late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The meeting ratified a decision taken earlier Monday by the CPP
Executive Committee to amend the CPP's constitution to enable the
newly-elected Congress leader to become chairperson of the CPP.
</P>
<P>
Sonia Gandhi, whose Italian origin gave her opponents
propaganda grist, succeeded Sitaram Kesri to become the new
president of the Congress party Saturday at a meeting of the
Congress Working Committee, the highest decision-making body of
the party.
</P>
<P>
The dual chief of the century-old Congress is neither a member

In 1978, when Indira Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi's mother-in-law, was
made chairperson of the CPP, she was also not a member of either
house.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning to Continue to Push Forward SOE Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The northeastern province of
Liaoning, China's leading old industrial base whose ill-managed
state sector is overstaffed but not efficient, will continue
advancing the reform of state-owned enterprises and displacing
laid-off workers by improving social security system.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made here today by top Liaoning officials,
including Governor Zhang Guoguang and executive vice-governor Guo
Tingbiao, at a press conference hosted by the ongoing First
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress, China's top
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that as an old industrial base developed in the
1950s when China practiced strict central planning in enterprise
management, Liaoning, where 10 percent of the country's large and
medium-sized state enterprises are based, has heavy historical
burdens in the shift toward a socialist market economic system.
</P>
<P>
While striving to improve the management and performance of
large state enterprises, he said, Liaoning this year will further
ease the control over medium-sized and small enterprises in the
state sector and promote common development of multiple economic
elements through various means.
</P>
<P>
In the face of increasing layoffs of state-owned enterprises,
Zhang said, governments at all levels across Liaoning have
intensified their efforts to improve the social security system
for the laid-off and retired workers.
</P>
<P>
"Now 98 percent of the workers in large and medium-sized state
enterprises in Liaoning have been covered by various insurances,
while all the 14 cities across the province have established
complete systems to help the extremely needy workers," he noted.

SINGAPORE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Internet service
providers will be required by law to offer parents a way of
weeding out on-line pornography by the end of this year,
Information and the Arts Minister George Yeo said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Parliament, the Minister said that the Internet
service providers would, according to the law, install a filter in
their servers to block access to undesirable sites.

<P>
"All Internet service providers will be required by regulation
to provide parents with the option," he said.
</P>
<P>
The "cleaner, more sanitized" Internet service will be built in
at the server level, he stressed, citing Cyber Patrol and Nanny
Net as examples of such filtering programs. The Minister noted
that children were now knowledgeable about gaining access even to
blocked sites.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has agreed to the
promotion of intra-ASEAN trade using their own currencies,
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was expressed by Vietnamese President Tran Duc
Luong at a meeting with him, Mahathir told reporters after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, together with some other countries of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), has been pushing for the use
of regional currencies in trade between ASEAN members after their
currencies have declined dramatically against the U.S. dollar
since July last year.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the Vietnamese president had also requested him
to explain the economic crisis faced by Malaysia and other ASEAN
countries.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said they also discussed the ASEAN summit to be held
in Hanoi, the forthcoming Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting.
</P>
<P>
Tran Duc Luong arrived here Monday afternoon for a three-day
visit, the first by a Vietnamese head of state since the two
countries established diplomatic ties in 1973.

ISLAMABAD, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange
(KSE) 100-Index dropped Monday as the market reacted to the news
about the forming of a government by the BJP (Indian People's
Party) in the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the stock market reacted negatively to the

the expulsion of diplomats of each other's countries over the

"We are expecting a worsening in relations," said one broker,
who argued that this may lead to an increase in Pakistan's defense
budget.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Jobless Rate Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in Hong
Kong rose to 2.9 percent for the three months ending in February
while the underemployment rate edged up to 1.6 percent, the
government said in the labor force figures released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate for the period between November 1997 and
January 1998 was 2.5 percent while the underemployment rate was
1.5 percent, according to the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said Monday that the distinct rise in
the unemployment rate was observed after the Chinese New Year
holidays, which fell on the last few days in January. He said
employers usually adjusted their work force during this period of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial turmoil and the consequential setback in
the local economy also produced a negative effect on the labor
market, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the unemployment rate was mostly found in such
sectors as construction, retail trade, restaurants and hotels,
real estate and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the government's substantial expenditure
program on public housing and new infrastructure projects would
continue to provide job opportunities at a time when the current
economic setback led to slackening job creation in the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the extensive tax concessions proposed in the
1998-99 financial budget would help boost consumption and create
employment opportunities in retail sectors.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia: No Need for Economic Union With Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian International Trade
and
Industry Minister Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz said here on Monday that
there is no necessity for a Malaysia-Singapore Economic Union.
</P>
<P>
There is already the ASEAN (Association of South East Asian
Nations) Free Trade Area (AFTA) with "a lot of bilaterals going
on," the minister was quoted by Singapore television as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah made the remarks after a dialogue session with
Singapore businessmen. The dialogue session was jointly organized
by the Singapore Confederation of Industries and the Malaysian
High Commission in Singapore and sponsored by Maybank.
</P>
<P>
However, Rafidah urged Singaporean and Malaysian businessmen to
seek more areas of cooperation rather than compete head-on on the
world market.
</P>
<P>
She said both sides can improve their market shares by
cooperating instead of remaining stagnant by competing against
each other.
</P>
<P>
The chemical sector is one area where Malaysia and Singapore
can avoid competition, the minister said, adding that competition
in this instance will only lead to huge investments and
over-capacity.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah also said companies in Singapore should consider
cooperating with Malaysian investors in human resources
development such as training trainers, setting up skill-training
institutes and other collaborative efforts.
</P>
<P>
"There is still at present a high level of interdependence
between the economies of the two countries, including in the
manufacturing sector," she added.
</P>
<P>
The two countries would emerge from the current economic
turmoil on an even stronger footing if they work closely in
developing their economies, she said.

<HEADLINE> Sandstorm Hits Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The sandstorm originated in Egypt
is covering the whole of Cyprus Monday, but no air traffic was
affected.
</P>
<P>
Loizos Hadjioannou, a senior meteorological department
official, said the sandstorm was caused by atmospheric pressure
activity and was transferred to Cyprus by strong southern winds.
</P>
<P>
The storm began to affect the island at around 0200 local time
(2400 GMT), according to the official.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the atmosphere to clear after midday either because
of a change in the direction of the wind or rain," Hadjioannou
added.
</P>
<P>
The sandstorm in Egypt forced British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook, heading for Egypt on a three-day tour of the region, to
make a stop-over in Cyprus Sunday evening as the Cairo airport
was closed.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary is scheduled to meet Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak later Monday within the framework of a Middle East
tour aimed at helping revive the stalled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The civil aviation official said visibility at Larnaca Airport
is about 700 meters and flights to and from Cyprus have not been

<HEADLINE> WFP Urged to Restart Food Supplies to Somalis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Rahanwein communities of
Southwestern Somalia Monday urged World Food Program (WFP) to
resume its relief food supplies to the flood-ridden areas in
Somalia after attacks on a relief mission aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program (WFP) has discontinued its foodstuff
airdrops to flood stricken Somalis in Bay, middle and lower Jubba
regions after its aircraft were attacked three days ago.
</P>
<P>
The Rahanwein officials have portrayed that the firing upon
the WFP airplane that transported the dry food to the flood
displaced families near Sakow Weyn village was an unfortunate and
isolated incident perpetrated by irresponsible armed gangs.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian affairs secretary of the Rahanwein Resistance
Army Sheikh Qasim Ibrahim Nur, speaking to reporters in Mogadishu
here Monday, said two of the gunmen who fired upon the relief
airplane were caught Sunday and put into custody while the rest
are still being hunted down in nearby villages.
</P>
<P>
Qasim said the perpetrators of the attack will be severely
dealt with under the Islamic laws of the local Sharia court.
</P>
<P>
He said the elders are now in control of the situation and a
peaceful environment is created for the smooth resumption of the
humanitarian supplies of food aid by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Qasim called on the WFP to recommence its noble activities in
which thousands of somalis have been saved from hunger and
starvation following the disastrous floods that hit these regions
late last year.
</P>
<P>
As the floods began receding in many places in Southern
Somalia, thousands of people are still in desperate need for
humanitarian help since they were still dislodged from their home
places, he said.
</P>
<P>
The flood affected families are less likely to return to their
places of origin in the near future unless seeds and three months
food ration are provided to each family for self-sustenance
project in the near future, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people are believed to have died and over
60,000 hectares of farmland were erased while nearly 40,000 head
of goats, cattle and camels were also washed away by the floods
which have been the most serious for more than 40 years in the
history of Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Israel Refuses EU Mediation Role if Cook Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel threatened Monday to
deny the European Union (EU) as a mediator in the Middle East
peace process if British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook insists on
visiting Har Homa in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, continued to criticize Cook's plan to visit the
controversial Har Homa site, where Israel is building a Jewish
settlement.
</P>
<P>
He told Israel Radio that just as the Israeli premier should
not hurry to meet Northern Irish separatist Sinn Fein leader Gerry
Adams during his visit to London, Cook should not meet in
Jerusalem with Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Minister of
Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini and leaders of Israeli peace
movement Peace Now.
</P>
<P>
Cook, whose country is holding EU's rotating presidency, is
due here on Tuesday as part of his upcoming Middle Eastern
tour that also includes Palestine, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Illan denied Israel is threatening to remove the EU
from the peace process over Cook's Har Homa visit, but he
stressed that the EU could not serve as a mediator in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process because of its support to the
Palestinian positions. He added that the EU could still play a
role in helping advance the multilateral Middle East talks and
in providing financial aid to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel began the construction of Har Homa settlement in
March last year, leading to a seven-month suspension of
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The PNA charged Israel for
violating the Oslo accords which demand both sides refrain from
changing the status quo of Jerusalem, whose fate should be
settled through permanent talks.
</P>
<P>
Due to the strong opposition by Israel, Cook reportedly has
dropped his plan to visit the Har Homa site with the escort
of Husseini.
</P>
<P>
Cook's decision to visit Har Homa has also sparked angry
protests from Israeli rightwingers, who vandalized the British
Consulate in Jerusalem by painting slogans on its walls
denouncing Cook as "an antisemite." The consulate expressed regret
over the acts, saying the purpose of Cook's visit was to advance
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government was also upset by the reports that Cook
would launch a new initiative to break the deadlock in the
Israeli-Palestinian talks by demanding Israel carry out 15-20
percent further pullback in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government, which is only willing to redeploy troops
from 9 percent of West Bank in the second further
redeployment, has said it would not compromise on any issues
over its security.

<HEADLINE> Regions Along Yangtze River Take Economic Lead in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The regions along the Yangtze
River, China's longest river, have recorded rapid economic growth
in the past several years as a result of the correct economic
strategy adopted by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, the Chinese government decided to place
emphasis on the development of Shanghai, China's largest city at
the mouth of the Yangtze, so as to promote the overall economic
growth for all regions along the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
A series of major decisions have since been made, such as
the opening-up and development of the Pudong New Area in Shanghai
and the start of construction of the Three Gorges Dam, the world's
largest hydropower project.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a dozen ports and cities by the Yangtze River,
including Zhangjiagang, Nanjing, Wuhan and Yichang, have been
announced to be open to the outside world, while Chongqing, a
major industrial center in southwest China, has been upgraded to
be the country's fourth municipality directly under the central
government after Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in recent years, the economic growth for
the seven provinces and two municipalities along the Yangtze,
namely Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan,
Shanghai and Chongqing, has been much higher than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
The overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for these regions now
accounts for one third of China's total, and the amount of foreign
capital invested in these regions has surged to 30 percent of the
country's total from only 10 percent six years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Ju, Party secretary of Shanghai and a deputy
to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's top
legislature, in session here since early March, Shanghai has used
25 billion US dollars of foreign capital and scored an average
annual GDP growth of 13.8 percent over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Zhejiang, one of Shanghai's neighboring
provinces, has scored a more astounding high growth of 19
percent a year in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
The GDP of Chongqing, which became a municipality a year ago,
reached 137.5 billion yuan (15.57 billion US dollars) last year,
up by 11.5 percent over the previous year, said NPC deputy Zhang
Delin, who is Party secretary of Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the strong momentum shown by regions along the
Yangtze in their opening-up and development over the past six
years indicates a most promising future for these regions'
economic growth in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"We're striving to turn Pudong into a bridge linking Shanghai,
the Yangtze River delta and even the entire Yangtze River economic
zone to the rest of the world," said Deputy Hu Wei, deputy
director of the Management Committee of the Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Jiang Zhuping, governor of Hubei Province, which is
along the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, suggested that all
regions along the Yangtze further pool their efforts and economic
strength and build a "Yangtze River Economic Community".

LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- England's head coach Glenn Hoddle
has left Paul Gascoigne out of his 26-man team for a friendly

</P>
<P>
Gascoigne, who will turn 31 in May, has only played one full

Rangers to either Crystal Palace or Middlesbrough.
</P>
<P>
While Gascoigne was missing, Middlesbrough's inspirational
midfielder Paul Merson has been called up by Hoddle after battling
back from drug, drinking and gambling addictions to re-establish
his career at the top.
</P>
<P>
Merson, who will be 30 on Friday, last played for England as a
substitute against Italy 13 months ago, has shown superb form for

Having survived the impacts from rivals such as Microsoft

the current financial turmoil in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"These talks are part of a continuing dialogue which the
Australian government has been vigorously pursuing," he said,
adding "as both a contributor to the IMF package for Indonesia and
a neighbor of that country, with great strategic interests at
stake in Indonesia's economic and political stability, we

Indonesia and the IMF."

Australia welcomed the progress south Korea had made in
implementing the conditions of its IMF bailout, a package
Australia had contributed to, he added.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, he said, he would meet with senior ministers there,
as "the key roles of both countries have in contributing to a
resolution of the crisis and Japan's status as our largest market
and major source of investment, the visit is very important and
timely," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cook Arrives in Egypt on Mideast Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook arrived here Monday noon at the first leg of his Middle East
trip aimed at helping break the deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Cook will meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and other
government officials.
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary, accompanied by European Union
Middle East envoy Miguel Moratinos, will discuss with his
Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa a European Union (EU) proposal
aimed at pushing forward the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for Palestinian commitment to Israel's
security demands, and urges Israel to implement a significant
redeployment, halt settlement expansion and support the
Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
The talks will also deal with bilateral relations between Egypt
and Britain which currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace process has been deadlocked since
March 1997 after Israel began construction of a Jewish settlement
in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Cook's tour also includes Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas, Syria and Lebanon. He was scheduled to arrive
here Sunday night, but was forced to stop over in Cyprus due to a
sandstorm that hit Egypt, Lebanon, Cyprus and other regional
states.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between Britain and Egypt amounts to one billion
U.S. dollars annually. Britain is Egypt's second largest foreign
investor with investments standing at one billion sterlings (1.67
billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> China's Population Expected to Peak in Mid-21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China's population will begin to
decrease after it reaches its peak in the mid-21st century,
according to the State Family Planning Commission (SFPC).
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that the peak number will be about 1.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
China will try to control its population within 1.3 billion by
the year 2000 and 1.4 billion by 2010, according to a plan set
forward by the SFPC today at an ongoing National Conference on
Family Planning in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with population control, China will try to reduce the
incidence of defects in newborn babies and provide better
reproductive health care for the people of child-bearing age,
according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
The problems of an aging population and the unbalanced gender
ratio among newborns in some areas will also be resolved, the plan
said.
</P>
<P>
The population will maintain a low growth rate by 2021, and the
people's health and education level will be greatly improved, it
predicted.
</P>
<P>
China's population will begin to drop gradually in the middle
of the 21st century when the population structure becomes more
rational and the people conscientiously practise family planning,
the plan said.
</P>
<P>
The country's birth rate was 16.57 per 1,000 in 1997, 1.67
permillage points lower than that of 1992. The total population,
including the people in Hong Kong, reached 1.243 billion at the
end of 1997, according to the SFPC.
</P>
<P>
Experts said China's population will continue to increase by an
average of 13 million a year in the next two or three years,
although the population growth rate keeps dropping.
</P>
<P>
In family planning, China will continue to put the stress on
the rural areas, especially those in central and west China
provinces, and will improve family planning management among
transients.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champion Wang Junxia Still Training: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion and world record
holder Wang Junxia has fully recovered from injury and resumed
normal training in her home province Liaoning, an sports official
said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"She is training under a normal schedule," said Cui Dalin, head
of the Liaoning Physicial Culture and Sports Commission.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who won China's only Olympic track and field gold in the
women's 5,000 meters event in the 1996 Games, had not returned to
the track until late last year following her Atlanta triumph.
</P>
<P>
Cui said Wang has been coached by Wang Helin after her coach
Mao Dezhen retired late last year.
</P>
<P>
Mao took charge of Wang after the 10,000m world record holder
broke away from legendary coach Ma Junren's training camp in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Liu Dong, who won the women's 800m gold in Stuggart and split
with Ma together with Wang, was also under the coach of Wang
Helin, Cui said.
</P>
<P>
Cui also said that coach Ma was working hard in establishing
the Liaoning track and field training base. "His health was
really worrying," Cui said, adding Ma still had blood in his
stool.
</P>
<P>
Ma led his new team to win the Beijing women's marathon
relay race on February 28. The new protegees, including Jiang Bo,
Dong Yanmei, Zhao Fengting, Ma Zaijie, Lan Lixin, and Lin Na, set
a race record of two hours 11 minutes and 35 seconds over 42.195
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Bo also broke the women's 5,000 world record in the
Chinese Eighth National Games last October in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"Their performance last month boosted our confidence," said
Cui. "If they continued to work hard, the Sydney Olympic Games
will be the right place for them to emerge as glittering stars."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Calls ASEM Very Important to ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said here Monday that the Second Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM)
is very important to ASEAN member countries including Indonesia
because it will discuss economic cooperation between Asia and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Newly-elected Vice President B. J. Habibie will represent
President Soeharto at the ASEM to be held in London between April
1 and 4, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Alatas, who will also attend the meeting, also stressed the
importance of stabilizing the country's currency, the rupiah, and
settling the private sector's foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
The two issues are high on Indonesia's priority list to pave
the way for economic recovery, he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, along with other countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), has been hit by a monetary crisis
since July last year, with the rupiah having lost about 80 percent
of its value against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Economists held that the private sector's foreign debts, which
account for 60 percent of the country's total foreign borrowing of
about 140 billion dollars, is one of the main causes of the
monetary crisis in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Alatas also hoped that the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
which has promised a 43 billion dollar bailout package to
Indonesia and asked the country to carry out economic and
financial reforms, would be more flexible in the implementation of
some aspects of the IMF program.

<HEADLINE> 1.8 Billion-Year-Old Brown Algae Fossils Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered more than 120 pieces of 1.88 billion-year-old
multicellular algae fossils, the earliest record of multicellular
life on Earth. The fossils were found in the eastern part of
Yanshan Mountain in northern China.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe that the discovery of the fossils are of
great importance to the research of early evolution of life on
Earth and ancient geological environments.
</P>
<P>
It has been generally acknowledged that the geological record
of the appearance of the multicellular organism was 900 million
years old. The recent discovery by Chinese archeologists shifts
the record of multicellular organisms to 1.88 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
The fossils were located in sandwich structures of rock, and
more than 300 brown algae were found on each fossil. The algae are
in three types: round, oval and spiral-shaped.
</P>
<P>
Some of the fossils became curled and smaller after they were
taken from the rocks and were exposed to the air, indicating
activated changes in the organisms.

BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese securities investment
funds -- Kaiyuan and Jintai -- have been approved by the China
Securities Regulatory Commission to begin issuing at the stock
exchange on March 23.
</P>
<P>
As a new kind of securities in China, the Kaiyuan and Jintai
funds would be issued equivalent to 2 billion yuan (240 million
U.S. dollars) each with a deposit term of 15 years. The Industrial
and Commercial Bank of China will be the trustee for the
investment funds.
</P>
<P>
The two funds will also apply for listing and trading at stock
exchanges after being issued. Twenty percent of the basic assets
would be invested in state bonds, while the remaining 80 percent
would go to stocks in open circulation of the country.
</P>
<P>
The securities investment fund, in which investors would
commonly share interests and risks, has become popular overseas.
</P>
<P>
The fund will help absorb more individual capital into the
stock market and turn savings into investments to better serve the
reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Medium and small investors can spread investment risks through
management of money matters by experts, while the development of
securities investment funds will change the situation that medium
and small investors constitute too large a proportion in stock
exchanges, and make the securities markets more stable.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait's Crown Prince Asked to Form New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah asked Crown Prince Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah
Al-Salem Al-Sabah to nominate new members of the cabinet after it
resigned Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The Emir instructed the crown prince and the outgoing ministers
whose resignations were accepted by the Emir to carry on their
duties to handle emergency affairs pending formation of a new
government, a statement from the Emir's office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The resignation came following members of the parliament
maintained their intention to press ahead with a no-confidence
vote against Minister of Information Sheikh Saud Nasser
Al-Sabah over display of controversial books at the Arab Book
Fair last month.
</P>
<P>
The resignation has been seen as a government attempt to abort
a vote of no-confidence against him.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member cabinet was formed upon an Emiri decree
following general elections on October 15, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait saw the most serious clash between the National
Assembly and government last Tuesday on grilling the information
minister as the crown prince strongly criticized some
parliamentary members for trying to abuse democracy in the small
Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 Islamic members in the parliament submitted a
motion of no-confidence against the information minister on March
10.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary members supporting the motion have spent the last
few days frantically lobbying more back-up from their fellow
members. It was reported that as many as 30 members were ready to
vote for the motion.
</P>
<P>
Members of the cabinet submitted their resignations to show
solidarity with the information minister.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad sternly warned the opposition political group last
Tuesday that their activities could put the country's future at
stake, explaining that his government would not be lenient with
those who were trying to undermine the country's security.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Prepares for Chemical Weapon Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Armscor, South Africa's
state-owned arms producer, is gearing up for chemical weapons
threat, local daily Business Day reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The threat of chemical weapons changing from purely a military
form to one in which they are unleashed by terrorists or fanatics
emphasized the need for research into better chemical defensive
method, Armscor's executive chairman Ron Haywood said at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Haywood said Tokyo's recent crude chemical attack carried out
by a Japanese cult, which killed 12 people and sickened 5,000,
emphasized the need for research on trace quantities of chemical
agents and adequate protection of personnel.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the opening of Protechnik, a chemical
defense research institution based in Pretoria, which was wholly
owned by Armscor but self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
The institution is the only South African firm which can
synthesize enough scheduled chemicals for testing and evaluation
of chemical defense equipment.
</P>
<P>
Protechnik is subject to regular international inspections,
with one successfully done at the new site recently. Haywood said
the move to the new site facilitated the functioning of a
sophisticated laboratory utilizing advanced computer-controlled
equipment and electronic communication.
</P>
<P>
Among some of its other achievements, Haywood said Protechnik
had established an internationally recognized quality assurance
system and also took part in proficiency test. This was done to
enable it to become the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons designate for Africa.
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, Protechnik had developed a nuclear biological
and chemical filter system for the South Africa-made G-6
artillery which had been exported to several countries.

in both goods and services markets are key priorities for policy
making by my government," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian exporters received 303
million Naira (about 3.6 million U.S. Dollars) as export
incentives in 1997, the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC)
has said.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Yuguda Usman, chairman of the NEPC, was quoted by
Monday's Daily Champion as saying that the incentives were funded
through the NEPC's Duty Draw Back Refund scheme and the Export
Expansion Grant.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the NEPC now applies the uniform rate of
four percent of foreign exchange proceed repatriated as basis for
the disbursement of export expansion grant.
</P>
<P>
The chairman disclosed that new incentive schemes are being
fine-tuned to take off next year.
</P>
<P>
Usman commended the government's motion to promote non-oil
export and canvassed for more funds to encourage export.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the 13 percent increase in Nigeria's non-oil
export from 108 billion Naira (about 1.3 billion Dollars) in 1996
to 123 billion Naira (about 15 billion Dollars) was possible
largely due to the incentive schemes.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Expects Malaysian Economy to Recover Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 16 (Xinhua) -- World Bank Senior Vice
President and chief economist Joseph Stiglitz said here Monday
that the Malaysian economy has prospects for a quick recovery as
the stock and foreign exchange markets have stabilized.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the markets have stabilized is good news and is
(the) basis for prospects of a quick recovery to the economic
situation here," he told reporters after meeting Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz praised Malaysia for having undertaken measures before
the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has the good fortune of having undertaken a number of
actions over several years preceding the present situation, which
put it in a much stronger stead than many other countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
This meant that its exposure to some of the risks faced by
other countries is much less, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The state of the economy in Malaysia is clearly one of the
strongest points within the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz's visit to Malaysia is part of the World Bank's
on-going dialogue with the countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its continuing assessment of
the region's economic conditions in view of the crisis facing the
region.
</P>
<P>
Describing his talks with Anwar as "very fruitful, enjoyable
and interesting," Stiglitz said the discussion with Anwar was a
continuing dialogue on a range of economic issues, including
various measures that the government has already undertaken to
strengthen the economy.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz said the World Bank's discussion with regional
economies focused on the "financial sector, corporate governance
and most importantly, the social safety net."
</P>
<P>
He said the Malaysian government has already undertaken
measures to ensure that the most vulnerable people are not
adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
"We are continuing discussions about any other way that we at
the (World) Bank can help either through financial or technical
assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
To a question about the World Bank's forecast of Malaysia's
economic growth in 1998, Stiglitz said: "I don't have our numbers
for 1998 at this point."
</P>
<P>
Anwar said Monday on another occasion that Malaysia's growth
projection of between 4 and 5 percent for 1998, which was revised
last December from an earlier forecast of 7 percent, is no longer
realistic and should be revised again to a lower figure, taking
into account the most recent trade and economic statistics.
</P>
<P>
On a soft loan offered by the World Bank as announced by Anwar
during the weekend, Stiglitz said the issue is currently being
discussed actively. The soft loan, according to Anwar, is to be
used for rural development and poverty eradication programs in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz said that over the last 35 years, Southeast Asia has
been the most successful region in terms of reducing poverty and
improving living standards.
</P>
<P>
He was of the view that the present financial turmoil is "just
a short interruption in the rapid growth" of the region.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank's objective is to get the economies back
on the growth track and to ensure that the most disadvantaged in
the society do not suffer too much.
</P>
<P>
Like other Asian countries, Malaysia has been severely affected
by the regional financial crisis triggered by the devaluation of
the Thai baht in early July last year.
</P>
<P>
The most affected are Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea,
which have received International Monetary Fund (IMF) aid
exceeding 100 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, due to its better economic position, has been able to
evade the IMF's package but nevertheless has taken IMF-style
reforms in an effort to ensure loans to productive sectors such as
manufacturing and agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Firm Sues U.S. Company for Copyright Infringement (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The manufacturer of Chinese Star,
the country's first software providing solutions to processing
Chinese characters in a Microsoft Windows environment, has sued a
U.S. company for infringing upon its copyright to a state court in
New York with a demand for 5 million U.S. dollars in compensation.
</P>
<P>
According to a chief manager of Beijing Founder SunTendy
Software Technology Ltd., the New York court has agreed to
consider the lawsuit against New York City-based Alestron Inc. for
possible infringement upon the Beijing company's rights.
</P>
<P>
The manager who invented Chinese Star claimed that the software
is worth 1.22 billion yuan (140 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
SunTendy's market manager, Zhou Mi, said that his company and
Alestron failed in a recent talk initiated by the U.S. firm to act
as sales agent for Chinese Star in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that Alestron registered itself on the World Wide Web
under a Web site name "extremely similar to that owned by the
Chinese Star."
</P>
<P>
"What's more," he said, "under the name of Chinese Star,
Alestron is promoting those products which are competing with
Chinese Star's products."
</P>
<P>
Last September SunTendy hired a U.S. lawyer and formally filed
suit against Alestron in New York.
</P>
<P>
Before and after taking its action, SunTendy tried to contact
Alestron, but received no "substantial response," Zhou said.
"Their only visible reaction was to erase all contents on their
Web home page."
</P>
<P>
At present, the Web site "http://www. Chinese-Star.com" owned
by Alestron is blank.
</P>
<P>
The SunTendy manager said that his company "is sure to win. It
is just a matter of how much compensation we shall get," Zhou
said.

<HEADLINE> Baig Calls for Greater Pakistani-Iranian Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Iran should
cooperate with each other and develop an all-time friendship to
counter the odds, Pakistan's former army chief General (R) Aslam
Baig said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on "Globalization: Prospects for Economic
Development in Iran and Pakistan", Baig said Iran and Pakistan had
long friendship and in today's changed international environment
the two countries should join hands for enhanced cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Mehdi
Akhundzada criticized the U.S. for its policy of sanctions and
embargoes. He also defended Iran's policy on global information
technology. Cultural heritage must be defended against the inflow
of satellite programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Syed Muhammad Musavi, an Iranian scholar of political and
international studies, said that hegemony of any country must not
be allowed to take over the international economic order.
</P>
<P>
Musavi said that regional cooperation is the ultimate way out
for the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the belief that Pakistan, Iran, Turkey and
Central Asia is a visible globe for furthering regional
cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed mixed in
thin trading on the Singapore market, while the benchmark Straits
Times Industrials Index (STII) gained 6.16 points to close at
1,604.79 points on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the market sentiment was affected by regional
uncertainty and a recent crop of poor corporate earnings and most
investors were thus kept sidelined.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the STII ended higher, helped by light fund
buying mainly in newspaper monopoly Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Further upside of the market hinges on whether liquidity from
foreign funds increases, they said.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume stood at 181.95 million units, worth
247.46 million Singapore dollars (about 153.7 million U.S.
dollars). Declines led advances by 198 to 127, while 287 other
counters remained unchanged.

<HEADLINE> China's Tibetan Art Exhibition Opens in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A six-day China's Tibetan Art
Exhibition opened at the Birendra International Convention Center
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, Minister for Youth,
Sports and Culture Sharat Singh Bhandari, Finance Minister
Rabindra Nath Sharma and some foreign diplomats were among some
400 people attending the opening ceremony of the exhibition
sponsored by the Chinese Embassy in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Chinese Ambassador Zhang Jiuhuan said this is an
art exhibition from "the Roof of the World." With diligence and
wisdom, the Tibetan people living in this miracle land for
generations have created their splendid art with unique charms.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, thanks to the concern and support of the
central government and the Tibet Autonomous Region government, the
Tibetan art has been further enriched and developed from the basis
of its tradition, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Tibet Autonomous Region of China and the Kingdom of Nepal are
linked by common mountains and rivers, and have stood together
both in good and bad times," he said, adding "For centuries, there
have been frequent exchanges of visits and close cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the stability and development of Tibet, including
the prosperity of the Tibet art, are also due to the valuable
support and help from Nepal," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the art exhibition will further
strengthen the exchanges, understanding, friendship and
cooperation between China and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Minister Bhandari said the exhibition provided a very rare
opportunity for critics and art lovers to see and enjoy the beauty
of paintings, tangkas, sculpture, jewelry costumes and artifacts
from the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"Such exhibitions are always welcome as they enrich our
knowledge about Tibetan art and craft and promote mutual
understanding and friendship between the peoples of Nepal and
Tibet Autonomous Region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Thapa said on the occasion that the bilateral
relations between Nepal and China have always been marked with
friendship, cordiality and mutual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Because of our geographical proximity, Nepal has been enjoying
most cordial relationship with the Tibet Autonomous Region of
China since time immemorial," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that bilateral relations are greatly
consolidated by promoting understanding of each other's culture at
the people's level.
</P>
<P>
On display are about 100 pictures and some 500 objects relating
to animal husbandry, agriculture, dress and personal adornment,
tangka and masks in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Tangka is the most common traditional art products of Tibetan
Buddhism, which depicts a wide range of subjects including
historical events, biographies, religious doctrines, Tibetan
natural conditions and social customs, folklore and mythologies.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan folk songs and dances were also performed on the
occasion.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Steps Up Efforts to Promote Chinese Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is stepping up its
efforts to promote Chinese Internet as the government announced on
Monday that it has set up a Steering Committee to establish
Singapore as a cyber hub for Chinese Internet.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the setting up of the Committee, George Yeo,
Minister for Information and the Arts, said at the Parliament
session that many Singaporeans are fluent in the language and
China is expected to have up to 4 million Internet users by the
year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
This was the time to make headway in this area, the Minister
said, adding that the members of the committee come from a cross
section of organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Information and the Arts (MITA) said in a
statement that the Committee was set up to look into ways to
promote the development and the use of Chinese Internet among
Singaporeans.
</P>
<P>
The Committee is chaired by Professor Wee Chow Hou, Dean of the
Business Administration, National University of Singapore. Prof.
Wee is also the Chairman of the Committee to Promote the Use of

</P>

<HEADLINE> 3 Muslim Rebels Killed in Clash in South Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Three members of the rebel Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) were killed over the weekend
during a series of skirmishes with a former Muslim rebel group in
a southern Philippine province, the Philippine News Agency said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mastura Sultan, a commander of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF), was quoted as saying Monday that the MILF and the
MNLF clashed last weekend in Midsayap town of Cotabato Province in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Sultan said the conflicts erupted when the MILF guerrillas
encroached upon the MNLF-controlled village of Labas to impose
revolutionary taxes on its residents who had long resisted the
taxation.
</P>
<P>
MNLF leaders in Midsayap town have urged government troops to
intervene in the recent conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, speaking over a local radio station, Ghadzali
Jaafar, MILF vice chair for political affairs, confirmed the
reported skirmishes, but he downplayed them as a "petty
misunderstanding" between members of the two Moro fronts.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar said he would bring the incident before a joint
MNLF-MILF committee for an immediate investigation.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the larger MNLF, is now the
strongest anti-government force in the country with an estimated
membership of 12,000 after the MNLF signed a peace treaty with the
government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which has refused to be included in the
MNLF-government peace treaty, began its own peace talks with the
government in early 1997.

<HEADLINE> Regional Seminar Begins on Financing in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A five-day regional workshop began
here Monday on rural and micro-financial products and services in
Asia, with the aim of disseminating innovative concepts,
strategies and models of poverty alleviation through rural credit
and micro-finance.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, sponsored by the Asia Pacific Rural and
Agricultural Credit Association, the International Fund for
Agricultural Development and Bangladesh Bank, will concentrate on
the design of financial products and provisions of financial
services for the rural poor.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the workshop, Governor of Bangladesh Bank Lutfur
Rahman Sarkar said the approach of providing micro-credit to the
poor through official, private and non-governmental organizations
has gained ground, as the existing financial system could not
ensure the poor the right of access to credit.
</P>
<P>
Per-capita GDP in Bangladesh is quite low and the distribution
system in the country is skewed, he noted. Thus both productive
and income-generating activities must be encouraged among the poor
through the provision of financing and other inputs.
</P>
<P>
"This is expected to result in increased production and an
egalitarian distribution of income," he added.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three delegates, including 52 from 13 foreign
countries, are participating in the seminar, the second of a
series of yearly workshops. The first workshop was held last year
in Jakarta, Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Refugees in NE Kenya Receives Half Food Rations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) has
enough relief food stocks in Mombasa but has been forced to cut
food rations by half for refugees in northeastern Kenya because
of insufficient funds to airlift them.
</P>
<P>
WFP Country Director Mike Sackett was quoted as saying Sunday
that "15 day rations were cut in half for the first time at the
beginning of March when the road to the camps was impassable and
the funds for air transport insufficient."
</P>
<P>
The 50 percent cut in food rations for refugees in Kenya's
northeast would have to continue until the end of this month, the
U.N. official added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the fleet of smaller food trucks currently
being used to move the food to the camps carries an average of 60
tons of food per day.
</P>
<P>
The roads leading to the refugee camps are currently
impassable as a result of heavy rains caused by the El Nino
phenomenon since last October.
</P>
<P>
For the three Dadaah camps, the WFP provides about 2,000 tons
of food each month to the 125,000 Somali refugees in Kenya.

PARIS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The ruling leftwing coalition of France came ahead of the
rightwing opposition in the regional elections held on Sunday
without being able to obtain the scores they won in the legislative
elections last year. Aggravating the crisis within the rightwing
opposition, the leftwing coalition could obtain majority in at least
eight regional councils or parliaments, including that of Paris and
Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, while the extreme-left will also enter
some regional councils.
</P>
<P>
-- The chief of the team of the opposition RPR and UDF in Paris,
Edouard Balladur, has called for the forming of an organization
rallying ``all the republican and liberal right'', after he lost the
campaign for the Paris council. The far right National Front (FN)
again won 15 percent of votes and increased their capacity in local
parliaments. Both the RPR and UDF have ruled out an alliance with
FN.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The regional elections on Sunday confirmed the electoral
supremacy of the leftwing parties, established less than a year ago
during the legislative elections. Interior Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement announced that the rightwing oppositions were ``beaten
in 13 of the 20 regions they had controlled in France proper.'' The
right lost mainly the regional councils or parliaments of the Paris
region, Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur and Midi-Pyrenees.

<HEADLINE> Indian Finance Minister Urges Continuous Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Indian Finance
Minister P. Chidambaram called upon the next government to
continue the current economic reforms especially those in the
financial and public sectors.
</P>
<P>
"The way to a bright and prosperous future is to affirm
economic reforms and ensure that they gather pace," Chidambaram
said in a bowing-out statement released on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The statement dwelt on the current state of the Indian economy
and recounted the achievements of the 21-month-old United Front
government.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the statement appears to pre-empt any whole-sale
criticism by the new government of the way the United Front
government has managed the economy.
</P>
<P>
Indian President Kocheril Raman Narayanan Sunday evening
authorized Atal Behari Vajpayee, leader of the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP), to form a new government, which is expected to take
oath Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The BJP-led coalition is planning to come out with a white
paper on the state of the economy, focusing on its weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
Among the major achievements of the United Front government,
Chidambaram listed the lowest inflation in 12 years of 5 percent
in 1997-98 and the "respectable" gross domestic product (GDP)
growth rate of 5 to 6 percent, though it is below the 7.5 percent
in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
The debt service ratio is estimated at below 20 percent in the
financial year of 1997-98 compared to 24.3 percent in 1995-96 and
the debt to GDP ratio is estimated to have fallen to 24 percent in
1997-98 from 28.2 percent in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Chidambaram claimed that the United Front government has
succeeded in adding 2 billion U.S. dollars to the country's
foreign exchange reserves in 1997-98 despite an increasingly
uncertain and hostile international economic environment.
</P>
<P>
He urged the new government not to forget the lessons learned
during the past seven years, saying a tight control on government
expenditure, limits on government borrowing and reduction of
fiscal deficit are necessary conditions for ensuring high growth,
low inflation and moderate indebtedness.
</P>
<P>
On the external front, the outgoing minister suggested that the
next government cope imaginatively with the new challenges posed
by the continuing East Asia crisis.

<HEADLINE> China's Butterfly Trade Has Bright Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Experts point out that China
should attach great importance to the development of its butterfly
trade and enter the international market with related products.
</P>
<P>
International Business Daily recently carried an article
pointing to the bright prospects and great potential for the
nation's butterfly trade.
</P>
<P>
This Beijing-based newspaper said the annual worldwide trade
volume for butterfly products stands at several hundred million US
dollars, with Taiwan's annual exports of related products valued
at dozens of millions US dollars. The article noted that hundreds
of thousands people currently work in Taiwan's butterfly sector.
</P>
<P>
However, small-scale display centers in China's inland areas
currently offer nothing more than samples of butterflies used for
popular science, collecting and education purposes. Related
processing levels for butterfly products remain relatively low.
</P>
<P>
China is home to some 1,300 of the world's 14,000 butterfly
species, and thus is one of the richest countries in terms of
related resources
</P>
<P>
Collection has no affect on reproduction since butterflies die
soon after mating, according to experts. Therefore, protecting
their natural habitat will ensure the longevity of butterfly
resources.
</P>
<P>
Reports indicate that Chinese experts have recorded major
progress in research related to breeding, collecting and producing
samples, as well as establishing butterflies as a possible food
source.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Protests Against Israeli Statement on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian official Sunday
summoned Israeli Ambassador to Jordan Odid Airan to protest
against statements on assassination of Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal
made by an Israeli cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan rejects any assault on the life of any citizen whether
it was carried out inside or outside the kingdom and considers
(what Sharon said) a threat to its security and a violation of
international law," Jordan's official news agency quoted acting
Minister of Foreign Affairs Talal Sata'an Hassan as saying.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon has said that
the Israeli government was determined to kill Mashaal, who
survived the assassination attempt by two Israeli Mossad agents
last September in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Israel had informed Jordan that it intended "to finish off the
job" of assassinating Mashaal, but not on Jordanian soil, Sharon
has reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
"It is strange to issue such statements at a time when all the
parties concerned are seeking to bring the peace march back on
track in order to fulfill the peace that guarantees security and
stability in the Middle East," the Jordanian official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan's Deputy Prime Minister for Services and
Minister of Information Abdullah Nsour said that "Mashaal is a
Jordanian citizen protected by the Jordanian law and the
leadership of Jordan and we will never accept such threats to his
life."
</P>
<P>
"The statements do not tally with statements made by the
Israeli government earlier that it was willing to regain
understanding with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We denounce these statements. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs
will take the appropriate action," Nsour said in a statement to
the news agency.
</P>
<P>
Also joining the protests were Speaker of the Lower House of
Parliament Saad Hail El Sorour and Abdullah El-Jazi, head of the
Arab and International Affairs Committee of the Jordanian
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Such statements violated Jordanian security and contradicted
with the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty signed in 1994, El-Jazi
told Jordan's official news agency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hamas (anti-Israeli Islamic Resistance Movement)
warned Israel that it would retaliate if the Jewish state carried
out the threat.
</P>
<P>
"The Zionists' attempts to whitewash the image of its secret
security service (Mossad) will not pass unpunished. The time
when their crimes were carried out without punishment has
vanished," said a statement issued by Hamas' office in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli Mossad agents holding fake Canadian passports were
arrested after they attempted to kill Mashaal in Amman on
September 23 last year, and later released in exchange for the
release of Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian-Israeli relations sharply deteriorated over the
assassination attempt. Mossad chief Danny Yatom resigned last
month after a series of failed operations.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral ties began to warm up as both sides exchanged
high-level visits and signed some agreements to boost bilateral
trade last week.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the second Arab country after Egypt that signed peace
treaty with Israel.

<HEADLINE> China Promotes Sino-South African Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Developing trade ties with South
Africa in an active and orderly manner is not only of great
political significance, but also serves the needs of China's
multipolar marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shanzai, China's vice-minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, made the remarks during last week's Beijing
meeting on Sino-South African economic and trade policies and
investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, a major trade power in Africa and China's major
trade partner on the continent, enjoys an annual foreign trade
volume of 60 billion US dollars. The two nations also enjoy highly
complementary economies.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between China, including the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, and South Africa hit two billion US dollars
in 1997, and jumped to 2.55 billion US dollars in 1997. China
currently ranks as South Africa's fifth largest trade partner,
according to statistics released by the South African Ministry of
Trade and Industry.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of diplomatic relations on January 1, 1998,
has greatly promoted favorable conditions for economic and trade
contacts between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Liu stressed that efforts to expand and develop economic and
trade ties with South Africa should be implemented in an active
and orderly manner.
</P>
<P>
China should proceed with a full understanding of the situation
in South Africa, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises are greatly attracted by the coexistence of
both first and third world consumption levels in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the nation enjoys the most advanced infrastructure
construction sector in Africa, and is considered to be the
bridgehead for exploring markets in the southern part of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The most important factors Chinese enterprises hoping to
develop traded ties must remember is to gain a keen awareness of
the economic situation, market environment and investment demand
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Liu stressed that priority should be placed on establishing
enterprises and encouraging larger enterprises to participate in
major projects. He also expressed hope for doubling the originally
targeted bilateral trade volume for 1998.

<HEADLINE> S. African Children Suffer Malnutrition: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A quarter of all South
African children aged between six months and six years suffer
from malnutrition, the Star, a daily paper published here Monday
quoted experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 22.9 percent of children in South Africa are stunted, a
major symptom of malnutrition. Another 5.5 percent show other
symptoms of malnutrition, such as abnormally low weight,
according to a survey by the Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts said malnutrition could cause serious mental
and physical problems for affected children.
</P>
<P>
"Without adequate food, young bodies and brains can't grow and
develop properly, these children will be stunted physically and
mentally, for the rest of their lives," said Jeanette Molefe of
the African Children's Feeding Scheme.
</P>
<P>
A study by a university-based research group, the South
African Vitamin A Consultative Group has shown that the highest
incidence of malnutrition is in the Northern Cape Province, with
the lowest being reported in KwaZulu Natal Province,
</P>
<P>
The study also found that the prevalence of malnutrition is
far higher in urban areas than in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
According to United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef), more
than 200 million children in developing countries under the age
of five are malnourished.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition is responsible for more than half of all children
deaths worldwide, resulting in the death of at least six million
children under the age of five every year.
</P>
<P>
Prompted by the Unicef's decision to make malnutrition its
theme for the year, South Afirca's local and provincial
authorities have decided to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
Provincial and local authorities, non-government organizations
and the metro council will jointly focus on projects which will
include short and medium-term projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China should develop water-saving
agriculture in view of the country's water shortages, stressed Niu
Maosheng, minister of water resources, recently.
</P>
<P>
Niu said that China should energetically spread water-saving
techniques in developing agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Using traditional irrigation methods such as allowing
water to flood fields rather than sinking, dripping or spraying
water onto the roots of crops, China's agriculture is very
wasteful to the already scarce water resources, Niu said.
</P>
<P>
With per-capita water resources of 2,300 cubic meters, roughly
a quarter of the world average, China is one of the 13
water-deficient countries.
</P>
<P>
By the end of February, 3.96 million hectares of farmland has
been affected by drought in northern China, while the south was
frequently threated by floods.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Sell 2 Largest Copper Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia will finalize the sale
of two of its biggest copper mines by the end of this month,
Zambia Daily Mail reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM)
Privatization Chairman Francis Kaunda as saying here Sunday the
Kafue Consortium has offered 400 million U.S. Dollars for the
purchase and development of the Nkana and Nchanga mines and that
the deal is expected to be signed by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
He said a legal framework should be worked out and agreed on
so that neither party will renegade on the deal.
</P>
<P>
"The consortium was offered last year the purchase of the
package which include the two mines, now we have to sign those
agreements which were in general terms then," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that there is need to ensure that the consortium
which has offered to buy the package of Nkana and Nchanga mines
are bound by legal instruments so that what they promised to do
is attained.
</P>
<P>
"We have to make sure that what is in the agreement of offer
should be followed even after the deal has been concluded so that
we do not run into unnecessary problems in future, and this
process normally takes about three months," he said.
</P>
<P>
The privatization of the country's two largest mines is
expected to bring in huge sums of foreign exchange which would in
turn spiral economic activity on the Copperbelt.
</P>
<P>
The Kafue Consortium groups world mining houses such as Anglo
Vaal, Phelpe Dodge and the Commonwealth Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The privatization of the copper mines is part of the
government policy to liberalize the economy.

<P>
KAMPALA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in the
country increased from 851 million U.S. Dollars in 1996 to 1.566
billion U.S. Dollars in Uganda, the New Vision reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
But individual investors complained about the incomplete
services in transport, land accessibility and capacity
utilization, though they conceded there are some improvement in
the service delivery.
</P>
<P>
Both foreign investments and joint ventures are in increasing
trend, said Uganda investment authority in its year activity
report in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report said increased foreign investments translate into
greater capital, technology and skills transfer.
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of joint venture partnership enables
local investors to select foreign investor and technology and in
turn enable the foreign investors to link with reliable local
partners who are more familiar with the local environment.

<HEADLINE> Drug Abuse Rampant in Kenya's Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- An anti-drug official has said
drugs were commonly abused by students in Kenyan secondary
schools and colleges, urging the government to fight against the
user, the supplier and the source of drugs.
</P>
<P>
Daily Nation Monday quoted Maina Wanbugu, Chairman of the
Anti-Dangerous Drugs Organization of kenya, as saying that about
10 percent of male students in Central Province were regular drug
users.
</P>
<P>
According to a study carried out in the province by the
organization, from a sample of 1,500 boys, 10 percent said that
they chew khat occasionally.
</P>
<P>
The drugs most commonly abused by students are bhang, alcohol,
and khat, and amphetanines are also commonly abused by female
students.
</P>
<P>
The study said that sources of the drugs include bars, drug
stores, auxiliary staff, social gatherings, shops and black
markets.
</P>
<P>
Wambugu attributed the rampant drug-abuse among students in
this East African country to peer influence and more pocket money
given by their parents. He recommended a concerted fight against
legalized advertisements of common used drugs in the country.

<HEADLINE> AIDS, S. Africa's Worst Enemy: Health Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- South African Health
Minister Nkosazana Zuma has described AIDS/HIV as a bigger enemy
than apartheid in the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing medical students at the University of Transkei at
the weekend, Zuma said, "it (AIDS) knows no color, no race and no
class."
</P>
<P>
She said even if the government and South Africans went all
out to boost economic growth, all efforts would be in vain if the
HIV/AIDS pandemic were not taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said every day 1,500 South Africans became infected with
the disease. To date 2.8 million South Africans have the virus.
The bulk of those infected were between the ages of 15 and 40.
</P>
<P>
AIDS could, if left unattended, undermine efforts to build
South Africa, Zuma warned, adding that a World Bank study has
predicted South Africa would loose one percent of its gross
domestic products because of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The spread of AIDS would lead to high levels of absenteeism,
premature deaths of skilled and unskilled workers. Hundreds of
orphans left by young people who died of AIDS would create
enormous strain on the welfare services and the country's budget,
social expert predicted.
</P>
<P>
The South African government reportedly has taken over the
AIDS/HIV campaign from the Department of Health. A cabinet
sub-committee, chaired by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, has been
established to spearhead the campaign against AIDS.

<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province will prepare more than 500 small and medium-sized
state-owned enterprises (SOE) for sale at a local fair this week.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Daily" reported that some 14 cities will attend
the fair which will be held in Shenyang, the provincial capital,
on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to push completely all the medium-sized and small
SOEs onto the market through the fair," the newspaper quoted an
official of Liaoning Provincial Economic and Trade Commission as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the SOEs are selected from a dozen
industries, including petro-chemical, machine-building,
metallurgy, construction materials, textiles, and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, which is China's oldest industrial base, is home to
one-tenth of China's large SOEs and has 4,000 medium-sized and
small SOEs.
</P>
<P>
The sale of those small SOEs was designed by the province as a
guide to revitalize all SOEs within the next three years, said the

<HEADLINE> All Australian Whales Now Under Protection List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- All of Australia's whale species
are now protected by the Australian law following Monday's
announcement that the Sei and Fin whales have gained legislative
protection.
</P>
<P>
Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill said the decision
would add impetus to Australia's push for a global whale sanctuary
at the International Whaling Commission meeting in Oman in May.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that whaling countries like Japan will oppose
such a sanctuary at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts to conserve our own whales strengthen our push for
a global whale sanctuary," Hill said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Listing the Sei and Fin whales as vulnerable species under the
Endangered Species Act, which meant they could not be killed,
traded or moved and that the Australian federal government must
develop recovery plans for them, was the most effective way to
ensure their survival, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's populations of the Sei whale have declined by 75
percent in the past 40 years alone, and there are estimated to be
only 25,000 of this species of whale remaining," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"Populations of the Fin whale have seen an even greater decline
in numbers. They were originally estimated at 500,000 prior to the
1960s and have been depleted to a mere 25,000."

<HEADLINE> Fisheries Booming in Dry-Land Gansu Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- In the past, local people in
Gansu, a dry-land province in northwest China, had no idea that
one day they would have so much locally produced aquatic food on
their table.
</P>
<P>
However, the fishery industry has drawn a growing number of
local people into the lucrative business because of the
2-decades-old, market-led economic reform. Local aquatic products
also have been exported to European countries.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the province turned out 93.15 million tons
of aquatic products, 201 times the figure in 1978 from local
rivers, including parts of the country's two largest -- the
Yangtze and the Yellow.
</P>
<P>
Gansu has enough sunshine for fish to grow, but for a long time
local production of aquatic food was very small. The saltwater
Qinghai Lake in neighboring Qinghai Province used to be the main
source of fish for Gansu.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, local governments in areas along the rivers
have encouraged people to develop freshwater fisheries with
financial and technological assistance.
</P>
<P>
So far, local authorities have held 52 training courses to help
local people and a series of local laws have been passed to ensure
smooth development of local fisheries.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Softer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A falling Japanese yen dragged
the Australian dollar off its highs Monday, leaving the local
currency on a weaker note at the local session close in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended in Sydney at 67.17 US cents from
67.30 late Friday.
</P>
<P>
Paul Macarounas, treasury manager with Rothschild Australia,
said the fortunes of the Australian dollar have been largely tied
to the Japanese yen in recent weeks and Monday was no exception.
</P>
<P>
"Whether that link disappears when the fiscal year ends in
Japan at the end of this month remains to be seen but it is
certainly there now," he said.
</P>
<P>
Early strength in the Japanese yen was reversed following
reports that Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga was not considering
an extra budget.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 86.73 yen from 86.35, and at
1.2233 marks from 1.2282 marks.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Focuses on Industrial Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The annual growth rate of
industrial added value in southernmost China's Hainan province
recorded 11.3 percent during 1993-1997.
</P>
<P>
The great achievement is contributed to the effective plan made
by the local goverment, according to the latest statistics. To be
a leading industrial province, the local government has put the
industrial sector in the first place in economic development.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the annual growth rate of the cement,
artificial board, automobiles and cans sectors hit 15.6 percent,
9.9 percent, 20.7 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that before Hainan became a province in April
1988, its industrial output value was less than three billion yuan
and lower than that of the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts of rationalizing the structure of
industries, the total industrial output value in the province
surpassed 10 billion yuan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A group of rising industries have become the province's pillar
ones and the car and motorcycle have emerged as the most
important products in its machine-building industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, the province has built a polyester
plant with an annual production ability of 60,000 tons,
and a blanket firm which can produce 1.4 million blankets annually.
</P>
<P>
The number of medicine companies has shifted from five in 1978
to the present more than 50. And the beverage products in the
province, especially coconut milk, are famous all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Some industrial development zones have formed and absorbed
great amounts of overseas investment. The Yangpu Economic
Development Zone, for example, has become a base for large
investment projects and China's largest export-bonded zone.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Cabinet Resigns Over Dispute With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 16 (Xinhua) -- All 15 Cabinet ministers in
Kuwait headed by Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah resigned Sunday night over a dispute
with parliament.
</P>
<P>
The resignation was accepted by Kuwait Emir Sheikh Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, local newspapers reported Monday, quoting
sources close to the emir as saying that an emiri decree in this
regard would be issued, but ruled out the dissolution of the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet resignation has been seen as a government attempt
to abort a vote of no-confidence against Information Minister
Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah, who was accused of violating the
country's laws through allowing controversial books to be publicly
displayed.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait saw the most serious clash between the National Assembly
and government last Tuesday on grilling the information minister
as the crown prince and prime minister strongly criticized some
parliamentary members of trying to abuse democracy in Kuwait,
which is the only Gulf state that has a parliament.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 Islamic members in the parliament submitted a
motion on March 10 for a vote of no-confidence against the
information minister.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuwaiti constitution, a no-confidence will be
taken up for voting on Tuesday, seven days following it was tabled
in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
A non-confidence motion needs a simple majority to pass in the
50-member parliament. Four Kuwaiti cabinet ministers who are also
parliamentary members are not allowed to vote and, therefore, 24
votes for the motion will let the minister out.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary members supporting the vote have spent the last
few days frantically lobbying more back-up from their fellow
members and sources were quoted as saying that as many as 30
members were ready to vote the minister out of office.
</P>
<P>
Political sources said Sheikh Saad had discussed the issue
with some presenters of the no-confidence motion who refused to
withdraw it.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Cabinet submitted their resignations to Crown
Prince Sheikh Saad to show solidarity with the information
minister and relieve Sheikh Saad of embarrassment with regard to
the current crisis. Sheikh Saad had conveyed the resignations to
Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah earlier Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister sternly warned the opposition political
group last Tuesday that their activities could put the country's
future at stake, explaining that his government would not be
lenient with those who were trying to undermine the country's
security.
</P>
<P>
The motion against Sheikh Saud is the fourth such motion in
Kuwait's 35 years of democracy, but none of the three previous
no-confidence attempts had passed.
</P>
<P>
One parliamentary member was quoted as saying that the
government decision not to go to parliament Tuesday for the
no-confidence vote move means that it realizes that it does not
have enough votes to save the minister.
</P>
<P>
The current cabinet, which includes 15 ministers, four of whom
are elected members of parliament, was formed in October, 1996
after general elections.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here expect Sheikh Saad to conduct a
cabinet reshuffle in the next few days which could bring back
Sheikh Saud in another ministry.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Thirty people in Dar es
Salaam have been made homeless after a fire gutted two flats on
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Properties worth thousands of Dollars were destroyed by the
fire in the first flat, leaving six families in despair. The
second flat was also razed to the ground, Daily News reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
But owner of the house Mohammed Dikata claimed some people who
came to the rescue had stolen three mattresses, three radios,
chairs and clothes.
</P>
<P>
The "good Samaritans" threw most of the valuables out to safe
places. They had even opened three big holes on the walls to pull
out belongings, Dikata told the paper.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Dakita claimed he lost 500,000 shillings (about
740 U.S. Dollars) of cash while his young brother lost 800,000
shillings in chaos.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Regional Police Commander, Alfred Gewe,
confirmed the incident, saying the police were still trying to
establish the cause of the fire.
</P>
<P>
One of the six tenants in the first flat at Bunguruni-Pandia,
Aziza Ali, aged 35, said the house caught fire at 8:30 pm and
continued till the early hours of the next day. Fire is believed
to spread from the first flat to the second in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
She said the fire started burning from the ceiling of her
bedroom. "I entered my bedroom at 8:30 pm and found the room full
of smoke as the fire razed the ceiling board made of carton box
pieces."
</P>
<P>
Ali said she tried to put out the fire with water but in vain.
</P>
<P>
The woman said it is difficult for her to know the cause of
the fire which destroyed everything of her family except the
clothes they have on. The house had no electric power.
</P>
<P>
Her neighbor phoned the police and City Commission Fire
Brigade Unit which arrived at the scene at 10 p.m. and managed to
extinguish the fire.
</P>
<P>
The homeless people have appealed for relief of temporary
shelter and food.

built at a cost of 32 million U.S. Dollars would greatly improve
ship turn-around at the port by almost 75 percent, the weekly
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Assistant Minister for Finance Mathias Keah was quoted
as saying last week that the project was the biggest single
capital investment venture in sub-Saharan Africa recently.
</P>
<P>
Once complete, the new facility will enable vessels to be
discharged by two Buhler Protalino mechanical ship unloaders with
a design capacity of 14,000 tons per day.
</P>
<P>
The bulk commodities will be transferred from the port to the
transit handling facility by two 600-ton-per-day conveyor
systems, one for cereals and the other for fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The facility will be made of steel silos with an initial
capacity for 67,200 tons of cereals and a flat storage area for
18,000 tons of fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the bulk commodity handling facility
is the first of its kind between the Suez Canal and Cape of Good
Hope.

</P>
<P>
This is Luong's first overseas trip since being elected
president last September and also the first by a Vietnamese head
of state to the two countries since diplomatic relations were
established 25 years ago, the official daily Nhan Dan said Monday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Eight Farmers Become Civil Servants in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Eight farmers in Guangyuan city
in southwest China's Sichuan Province, have been appointed as
leading officials in the township governments this year because
of their outstanding capability in handling governmental affairs.
</P>
<P>
The farmers were selected by the local personnel bureau after
they had gone through strict procedures which included a written
test, interview and physical examination.
</P>
<P>
As an experiment to recruit civil servants, the Guangyuan
personnel bureau conducted open examinations for 170 village
officials recently. Those who served as village leaders for more
than three years could take the exam to compete for township
government positions.
</P>
<P>
Township government officials said the farmer-civil servants
should be able to do their new jobs well because they were born in
rural areas and are familiar with the conditions.
</P>
<P>
The system of recruiting civil servants through open exams
is also practiced in China's central and provincial government
departments.
</P>
<P>
Governments at the provincial, county and township levels in 18
provinces even held unified exams to recruit new officials. A
total of 520,000 people competed for the 53,000 offered
positions.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Sends Troops to Zambian-Angolan Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has sent over 500 soldiers
to its borders with Angola, the most influential and leading
independent newspaper, the Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted military sources who confirmed the movement
as saying Sunday that the troops traveling in eight 75 seater
buses are moved to the country's North Western province to
increase the one company's combat strength initially deployed
there.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's military buildup in border areas comes two weeks
after Angola warned Zambia of possible military aggression if
supplies of arms from its territory to the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) forces is not stopped.
</P>
<P>
The increased deployment of troops by Zambia army's 4th
battalion (4ZR) of the infantry unit appears to be in response to
the charges made by Manuel Augusto, Angolan Ambassador to Zambia
that arms have been transported through Zambia to the UNITA,
which was denied by the Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
But there are speculations among diplomats here that Zambia's
military buildup can be a relief measure to curb the alleged arms
supplies to the UNITA and possible aggression.
</P>
<P>
In a news briefing held in Lusaka on March 5, Augusto told
Zambia to take "appropriate" measures to control the gun-running
racket and if failed to do it the Angolan government "would have
no option but to defend it's citizens who have been dying in
large numbers in the past few years."
</P>
<P>
The Angolan ambassador warned that while Angola does not wish
to have a repeat of the Congo (B) and Congo (K) incidents where
his government participated in dislodging the governments there.
</P>
<P>
"Angola does not rule out any option if UNITA did not stop
getting arms from some territories," said Augusto, adding his
government is aware that the rebel organization is using a
certain "neighbor" to supply arms to its strongholds.

<P>
BEIRUT, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A strong sand storm coming from
the Sahara Desert between Libya and Egypt entered Lebanon Sunday

</P>
<P>
Sources from Lebanese meteorological department said the
country has seldom seen such a heavy sand storm with the wind
speed of 110 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
The storm, which is also striking other neighboring countries,

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Province Helps Guangxi Shake Off Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- This capital city of south
China's Guangdong Province donated more than 30 million yuan in
1997 to help resettle 2,000 impoverished households in Bose
Prefecture in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Guangzhou has aided the prefecture in
developing its natural resources and improving the construction of
basic facilities by absorbing overseas investment, holding trade
fairs and training local officials.
</P>
<P>
As a result, three resettled villages, with a population of
more than 10,000 farmers, harvested 3.24 million kilograms of
grain in 1997. The per-capita grain and net income reached
320 kilograms and 850 yuan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
With the aid of Guangzhou, these villages spruced up their
infrastructure with 238-kilometers of highways and 10 schools
covering 3,960 square meters. So far, more than 4,800 villagers
have access to electricity and clean water, said an official from
the regional government.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Bose, located on the banks of the scenic
Chengbi Lake, is home to a variety of ethnic minority groups, such
as the Zhuang, Yao Miao and Yi. The prefecture is best-known as
the site of a Red Army uprising led by Deng Xiaoping in December
of 1929.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Guangzhou will pay more attention to helping the
villagers get training and grasp agricultural production
techniques, said Chen Kaizhi, vice-mayor of the city.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese farmers are worried by
the damage caused by rats and drought to their spring crops, Vietnam
News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In January and February, nearly 98,000 hectares of paddy fields
were damaged by rats, of which 12,000 hectares were severely or
totally destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Drought is estimated to have caused a loss of 65,000 tons of
coffee beans, or over 1,000 billion Vietnamese dong (77 million
U.S. dollars) in cash term.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 265,000 hectares of summer-autumn rice growing
areas in the central provinces, 90,000 hectares will be affected
by drought, the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
It is forecast that the drought will last through March and
April and the rainfall in the north will decline by between 10-20
percent as compared to the same season of previous years.

CAIRO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A sandstorm engulfing Cairo for 24
hours has forced British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's plane to
land in Cyprus on his way to Egypt, Egyptian Presidential Palace
officials said Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Cook was scheduled to arrive here Sunday night at the first leg
of his first-ever mission to the Middle East to unblock the
deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He was supposed to meet Monday morning with President Hosni
Mubarak and then with other government officials.
</P>
<P>
But the seasonal sandstorm has had his trip postponed to a
later hour when the dust wind subsides, according to an
information officer in the Itihadiya Palace, where talks between
Mubarak and Cook will take place.
</P>
<P>
The sandstorm hit Cairo Sunday morning, raising temperature by
11 degrees centigrade, turning the sky into a yellow blanket, and
reducing visibility to about 500 meters, according to Director
of the Egyptian Metereological Center Mohammed Abudulla Ahman
Mahran.
</P>
<P>
Poor visibility has forced several incoming flights in Cairo
diverted to eastern and southern Egypt as strong gust halted
operation of transit ships and ferry boats in the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
Khamaseen, meaning in Arabic 50-day wind, usually sweeps across
Egypt in spring, packing desert sand into the cities and towns

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Releases Agricultural White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's agricultural unions
have produced a white paper outlining measures that need to be
undertaken to boost export earnings and increase overall crop and
livestock production.
</P>
<P>
The 21-page document, "Agriculture in Zimbabwe 1998" released
here Sunday, was compiled by the Zimbabwean Farmers' Union, the
Commercial Farmers' Union and the Indigenous Commercial Farmers'
Union and looks at the contribution of selected crops to the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The document noted that while focus should be placed on
increasing the total crop and livestock production, water storage
and development played the most important role in the
agricultural industry.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the paper recommended that to increase
productivity in the small-scale sector and to ensure food
security in drought times, it was imperative that the potential
for irrigation was developed.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of Zimbabwe's export earnings are derived
from agriculture in raw or semi-processed form.
</P>
<P>
The main export earners are tobacco, horticulture, cotton
lint, sugar, beef, coffee, maize and poultry products.
</P>
<P>
On tobacco, the document noted while Zimbabwe was the second
largest exporter after Brazil, exporting 98 percent of its
overall production and with about 21 percent of world trade,
there was need to improve the 21 percent world market share with
good quality tobacco.
</P>
<P>
This could be achieved by maintaining the large-scale
commercial sub-sector efficiencies, expanding production in the
small-scale sub-sector through the expansion of tobacco schemes,
keeping costs down without compromising quality and improving the
quality of support services.
</P>
<P>
The horticultural industry has experienced phenomenal growth
and is now the third largest in terms of value of output in
commercial agriculture.
</P>
<P>
But due to substantial growth in producing countries, there
was now a worldwide over-production of some flowers like roses.
</P>
<P>
The document made it quite clear that the liberalization of
maize marketing in the country had made information on
production, marketing and pricing more difficult and this tended
to affect farmers' plans and government's policy.
</P>
<P>
The paper recommended that crop forecasting systems and
methods need to be improved.
</P>
<P>
One of the main recommendations on maize was that the
strategic grain reserve needed to take the livestock industry
requirements into account to prevent fluctuations in livestock
output caused by periods of high maize prices due to drought or
shortages.

<HEADLINE> University Vice-President on Juvenile Class </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese University of Science
and Technology (CUST), a cradle of juvenile class in China, will
go on enrolling young prodigies at its juvenile class this year.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Yongfei, vice-president of the CUST, which is located in
east China's Anhui Province, made the remark at the Ninth National
People's Congress in session here since early March.
</P>
<P>
The university has recruited approximately 1,000 prodigies
since its founding of a juvenile class in 1978, with an average
recruitment of 50 each year with the youngest aged only nine.
</P>
<P>
To date, about one third of the prodigy graduates have gone
overseas for advanced studies and some are working in cooperation
with scientists of other countries, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
As most of these young talents have been wise since childhood
and fast in learning things new, they usually complete the junior
or even senior middle school courses when they are pupils at
primary schools, he said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other college students, those at juvenile classes
are doing much better with the subjects to their own interest than
other students. Nevertheless, a few are easily upset because of a
somewhat weak character resultant from meticulous care of their
parents. And a small number of these youngsters had to suspend
their studies for their failure to adapt themselves to changes in
life on the campus, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
To cope with this, the university should pay attention to their
interests as well as to their study in the basic theories, so as to
enable them to develop morally, intellectually and physically, he
urged.
</P>
<P>
So far, juvenile classes have also been set up in a number of
other universities despite the differing views on whether it is
good or not to run such classes, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
But he pledged that the CUST would continue running the
juvenile classes as it is an essential exploration in the field of
education in a country with a population of 1.2 billion.

State Statistical Bureau census results for last year show that

<HEADLINE> Increased Input Shows China's Commitment to Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China is fully committed to
environmental protection, according to a top Chinese environmental
official.
</P>
<P>
"This determination is fully demonstrated in the government
work report delivered by Li Peng at this year's session of the
National People's Congress (NPC)," said Qu Geping, director of the
NPC Resources and Environment Subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, environmental protection is listed as a
government investment priority, on a par with agriculture,
forestry, water conservation, energy, transport and telecoms," Qu
said.
</P>
<P>
Annual government funding for environmental protection
undertakings has exceeded 50 billion yuan in the last five years.
And nearly 70,000 polluting enterprises across the country have
been shut down during the last three years,"a move rarely seen in
any parts of the world," Qu said.
</P>
<P>
The clean-up of the Huihe, one of the most polluted rivers in
the country, unveiled in 1994, cost central and local governments
some 5 billion yuan from 1994-97, and another 15 billion yuan will
be spent continuing the clean-up before the year 2000, according
to Qu, one of the founders of China's green movement.
</P>
<P>
China's five-year plan covering the 1996-2000 period projects a
total investment of 450 billion yuan for environmental protection
projects across the country, or 0.8 percent of the country's GDP.
"As a matter of fact, annual input in a dozen coast cities has
exceeded that percentage," Qu said.
</P>
<P>
However, the tasks ahead are more difficult to accomplish, with
problems ranging from severe and almost nationwide water shortages
to soil erosion and a continuous shrinkage of farm land, said the
environment official.
</P>
<P>
He said that, despite the country's intensive efforts, water
and air pollution is still rampant. Each of the seven main rivers
in the country has had half of its length polluted and, of the
600-strong cities nationwide, only five or six enjoy clean air
defined as first-grade by the state.
</P>
<P>
China has promulgated 15 laws and regulations on protection of
natural resources and the environment. "The most important thing

<HEADLINE> 2 More Zimbabwean Sites Named in World Heritage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Matopo Hills, south of Zimbabwe's
second largest city Bulawayo, and the Ziwa settlements in east
Zimbabwe were Sunday nominated for listing among the world's most
endangered sites, the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana reported.
</P>
<P>
The National Museums and Monuments of Zimbabwe (NMMZ) and
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO)'s World Heritage Committee said the two sites should be
put on the world heritage list.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO's Southern and Central African Representative Lupwishi
Mbuyamba Sunday said in Bulawayo that once on the world's most
endangered list the sites would benefit from a world heritage
fund.
</P>
<P>
"The fund was set up to assist in the preservation of such
sites and their promotion as historical and cultural sites that
society can learn from and appreciate," said Mbuyamba.
</P>
<P>
NMMZ Executive Director and World Heritage Committee member
Dawson Munjeri said Matopo Hills where the founder of Rhodesia,
Cecil John Rhodes, was buried along with several Ndebele chiefs
were of significant historical and cultural value to Zimbabwe and
the world.
</P>
<P>
The Ziwa settlements, ruins of pre-colonial Manyika settlers
north of Nyanga in Manicaland province's eastern highlands were
also noted.
</P>
<P>
If put on the world heritage list, the two sites would join great
Zimbabwe in Masvingo of South Zimbabwe and Khami ruins west of
Bulawayo, two Shona settlements of the 15th century that have been
preserved as cultural sites.

<HEADLINE> Australia Urged to Become Model for Electronic Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia was urged Monday by
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates in Sydney to capitalize on the
growing popularity of the Internet by becoming a model for
electronic commerce and publishing.
</P>
<P>
Gates, who founded Microsoft two decades ago and whose
operating system is now installed on over 90 percent of the
world's personal computers, said politicians world-wide had
already recognized the importance of the Internet to the
competitiveness of their countries in the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
"In the infrastructure that exists here with the skills, the
use of English, there are some incredible opportunities for
Australia in particular," he was quoted by the Australian
Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gates, who has a personal fortune estimated at 37 billion US
dollars, is on a two-day whirlwind visit to Australia.
</P>
<P>
"It's an incredible opportunity to share government
information, to improve the educational system, to allow the
businesses in the country to reach out in a way they never did
before."
</P>
<P>
Gates spent an hour at a media conference in Sydney about his
vision for information technology which he said was still at the
"Paleolithic stage" of development.
</P>
<P>
"Basically we're at the early age," Gates said.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe in 10 years from now we'll be through the early stages
of the Information Age."
</P>
<P>
With the evolution of the Internet, governments faced major
challenges including addressing privacy concerns and accessibility
to technology for the entire population, he said.

<HEADLINE> Oceanologist on Developing Marine Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Though he has recently received
surgery, Zeng Chengkui, the oldest deputy to the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, in session here
since early March, looks energetic and talks with a clear mind.
</P>
<P>
As one of the country's leading oceanologists, Zeng, 88, has
served as an NPC deputy for seven consecutive terms since 1964.
</P>
<P>
"In my 30-plus-year career as a people's deputy, I have put
forth a lot of motions and suggestions, most of which urge the
state to attach importance to science and technology," says Zeng,
who is an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
He notes that development of science and technology is a
basic guarantee for any country's economic growth and social
progress, especially for a relatively backward country like China.
</P>
<P>
As an oceanologist who has devoted his life to marine study,
Zeng says that he and some other deputies have put forward a joint
proposal to the current NPC session, urging intensified efforts in
developing "marine agriculture", or the breeding of aquatic
products in marine water.
</P>
<P>
"For a populous country like China, it is of vital importance
to develop sea-water breeding and turn the ocean into a major food
supplier," he notes.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Zeng headed a research group of the Marine
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which solved major
technical problems in the breeding of kelp and helped raise
China's annual kelp output to 600,000 tons, the world's highest.
</P>
<P>
Despite his senior age, Zeng is still engaged in research on
marine alga and seaweeds. Thanks to efforts by Zeng and other
local marine scientists, Shandong, a coastal province in east
China which is Zeng's hometown, has enjoyed the country's most
developed marine economy.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the output value of Shandong's marine economy
exceeded 80 billion yuan (about 10 billion US dollars), one third
of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
China has paid increasing attention to marine science and
technology in recent years. The central government has decided to
spend one billion yuan on marine science in the five-year period
from 1996 to 2000, 10 times more than in the previous five years.

<HEADLINE> New Bank Opens, Aiming at Assets of Closed Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A newly-established bank,
Radhanasin Bank, officially opened Monday, which plans to bid for
good assets of the 56 finance companies that were closed last
December.
</P>
<P>
Radhanasin Bank, Thailand's 16th bank and the sixth state-run
institution, will be headed by former Bangkok Bank president
Vichit Surapongchai and has an initial capital base of four
billion baht (100 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The bank, seen as the realization of the government's "good
bank" concept, was established by the government last year, along
with the Asset Management Corporation, which will take on the
financial sector assets no one else wants to buy.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be part of the government's efforts to
alleviate Thailand's banking problems and to bring stability,
confidence and trust back to the Thai financial system.
</P>
<P>
Some of the non-core assets of the 56 closed firms, such as
cars and antiques, had been auctioned last month by the Financial
Restructuring Authorities.
</P>
<P>
But the core assets, such as loans and bond holdings, are still
waiting for marketing.
</P>
<P>
Local financial institutions reportedly carry 1.3 trillion baht
(32.5 billion dollars) in non-performing and poorly-performing
loans, equal to about a quarter of the total credit system.
</P>
<P>
Radhanasin Bank will compete with local and foreign
institutions in an open bidding process to buy the assets of the
closed firms.

<HEADLINE> EA Countries to Hold Joint Military Exercises in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are
scheduled to hold joint military exercises in Kenya this June in
a bid to enhance regional military cooperation, the East African
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper quoted Kenya's Department of Defense as
saying that each of the three east African countries would be
free to send whatever detachments it could afford to take part in
the show.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan People's Defense Forces public relations officer,
Captain Shaban Batarinza, told the paper that the exercise is
designed to promote east African military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
If need arose, he added, the forces of the three countries
could be used for peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
The joint exercises are being seen in Uganda as the first step
toward the formation of the United States-mooted standing
regional peace-keeping force, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that America had been encouraging closer
military cooperation in the east African region in order to form
a joint force to carry out peace-keeping and humanitarian
missions.
</P>
<P>
Last month, defense chiefs of the three east African countries
met in Nairobi to discuss security and defense cooperation
following a similar meeting held last November in Arusha,
Northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the United States organized a training course on
defense resource management for Kenyan military officers in
Nairobi and similar arrangements are in place for Uganda and
Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Seeks Closer Ties With Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 16 (Xinhua) -- North China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region plans to promote economic and trade cooperation
with Hong Kong in order to make full use of the latter's unique
advantages.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent meeting on the region's opening effort,
Wang Fengqi, vice chairman of the autonomous region, said that
Hong Kong's return to China on July 1, 1997, has not only created
favorable conditions which will enable the new administrative
region to play a greater role in linking interior areas with the
international economy, but also offers bright prospects for closer
cooperation between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Wang expressed hope for multi-dimensional forms of cooperation
and pledged that Inner Mongolia will strictly observe the
principle of mutual benefit and basing cooperation on
complementary advantages.
</P>
<P>
He said Inner Mongolia will issue more stocks and bonds in Hong
Kong in order to attract more foreign funds to develop
wide-ranging sectors, including agriculture, animal husbandry,
energy and environmental protection. He added that the region will
extend great efforts and with Hong Kong's help to attract more
representative offices of overseas banking and financial
organizations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Wang also noted that efforts will be made to increase exports
of manufactured commodities and to promote the introduction of
advanced foreign techniques.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia has entrusted exclusive business rights to a
local Hong Kong company and invited two businessmen from Hong Kong
to serve as senior economic advisors.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia, which covers 1.18 million sq.km. and is home to
120 varieties of mineral resources, is one of China's five leading
pastoral regions.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-nine Hong Kong companies registered business operations
in Inner Mongolia during 1997, with total investments standing at
well over 45 million U.S. dollars.

rupees (approximately 1.93 billion US dollars) in 1995-96 to 49.95
billion rupees (approximately 1.33 billion US dollars) in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
India hopes that the pact would weed out the existing anomalies
that have crept into the rupee trade mechanism, and boost economic
and trade cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are keen to sort out outstanding issues like the
long-pending plan to set up a State Bank of India (SBI) subsidiary
in Moscow, the capital of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Russian commitment to set up a representative
office of Incombank in India was yet to materialize even though
the Reserve Bank of India has already provided the necessary
clearances.
</P>
<P>
The Hindustan Times said that the problems faced by trading
communities of both countries were discussed on several occasions
but emphasis was lacking.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also discussed the establishment of proper
shipping channels to spur bilateral trade.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka City Population Exceeds Capacity: Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The capital city of Bangladesh is
good for 3 million people, but about 9 million are living in the
metropolis straining its services, Mayor Mohammad Hanif said.
</P>
<P>
Hanif was speaking at a three-day workshop on Sunday on Dhaka
City Management Reform, part of a participatory process in
developing a plan for reforming the administration and improving
the services in the city, press reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
To some, the city covering an area of 365 square kilometers was
full of problems, and to many others, it was one of unlimited
opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most of those came to the city with great hopes to earn a
living, and they ultimately ended up as beggars, hawkers and
richshaw pullers, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He made a call to decentralize development activities to stop
the migration of people to the city from rural areas for a
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Fifty percent of the residents in the city were poor, with the
rest belonging to the middle- and high-income brackets, according
to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized by the Bangladesh Center for Advanced
Studies and other institutions, was opened on Sunday and attended
by participants from India, Sri Lanka, the Asian Development Bank
and other organizations.

<HEADLINE> Hendry Wins Thailand Masters Snooker Tournament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Six-time world snooker champion
Stephen Hendry won the Beer Chang Thailand masters tournament
Sunday night by defeating 1991 world champion John Parrott 9-6.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Hendry had won a ranking title in
Thailand in nine years and, more importantly for him, also his
first championship of the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
He pocketed the first prize of 50,000 pounds (83,000 U.S.
dollars) against Parrott's 26,000 pounds (43,000 dollars) plus
another 3,000 pounds (5,000 dollars) for the highest break, which
was 138 in the seventh frame of the final.
</P>
<P>
In the 17-frame final, Hendry began in devastating style as he
raced into a 5-0 lead. However, Parrott fought back to make the
scores 6-2 at the interval.
</P>
<P>
After the interval, Parrott took the advantages of the mistakes
Hendry made and won four more frames after the 13th frame.
</P>
<P>
Hendry then displayed why he has been the world's number
one for the past eight years by winning the two frames left.
</P>
<P>
Hendry was clearly delighted with his victory, but admitted
that he wasn't at his best against Parrott.
</P>
<P>
He said this win would give him confidence for the forthcoming
British open, one of the two remaining tournaments of the season.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh Tea Growers See Bright Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi tea growers have more
to expect this year, with the average tea price in auctions in the
country showing an upward trend and favorable weather conditions
and adequate rain for tea growing.
</P>
<P>
The average tea price in an auction held in Chittagong,
Southeast Bangladesh, on February 17 was 80.12 taka (about 1.74
U.S. dollars) per kilogram against 46 taka (1 dollar) a year
earlier, press reports on Monday quoted brokers as saying.
</P>
<P>
At the previous sale on February 11, the average auction price
rose to a record high of 118.29 taka (2.57 dollars) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
"During the 1990-96 period, the average auction price of tea
fluctuated between 41 taka (0.89 dollars) and 50 taka (1.08
dollars) against the production cost of 50 taka one kilogram," a
tea grower/exporter said.
</P>
<P>
The price shot up in auctions in the country as a result of a
worldwide shortfall in tea production, especially in Kenya, whose
output was 36.5 million kilograms short of target last year, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall in production last year was recorded at about 20
million kilograms in Indonesia, one of the world's major tea
producers, and 2 million kilograms in Bangladesh, which had a
production target of 54 million kilograms, a broker said.
</P>
<P>
World tea production totaled 2.61 billion kilograms in 1996,
but declined to about 2.5 billion kilograms in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The global production shortfall increased demand for Bangladesh
tea abroad. In the first 34 sales in the current season (May
1997-April 1998) up to December 1997, Bangladesh exported 23.4
million kilograms of tea worth 1.8 billion taka (39.1 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The country exported 22 million kilograms of tea worth 998.1
million taka (21.7 million dollars) during the same period of the
previous season, according to statistics from the Bangladesh Tea
Board.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian nation sells tea to some 20 countries,
including Afghanistan, Russia, Jordan, Pakistan and Sudan, with
Poland topping the importers list of Bangladesh tea in 1997.
Poland purchased from Bangladesh 5.3 million kilograms of tea
worth 253 million taka (5.5 million dollars) from July to December
last year.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh tea also has a bright future in the country itself
as the domestic market is growing fast, with nearly 50 percent of
the country's 120 million population now taking tea against only
30 percent a few years ago, a tea grower said.
</P>
<P>
"The home consumption will increase further as the
socioeconomic condition of the people is improving," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 15.8 million kilograms of tea was consumed within the
country against 13.4 million kilograms during the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Increase Tea Export in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam plans to export a record
35,000 tons of dried tea this year, 12 percent more than 1997, the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development announced.
</P>
<P>
In the first two months of this year, Vietnam exported about
5,000 tons, a 53.5 percent increase on the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam exported 31,500 tons to the Middle East, Eastern
Europe, Britain, the United States and Japan last year.
</P>
<P>
To encourage tea planting and the processing industry,
Vietnam's tea corporation has raised its price for the purchase of
fresh tea by 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The corporation will concentrate efforts on fertilization and
intensive farming on the present acreage of 70,000 hectares which
are expected to yield 10 tons per hectare.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile another 5,000 hectares will be planted with a new tea
strain which can yield 15 tons per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The corporation this year plans to put six new processing
factories into operation and build a number of smaller factories
in tea growing areas.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Integrated Program of Action Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- An Independent Expert Group has
completed a major review of the SAARC Integrated Program of Action
(IPA), said a press release issued by the Kathmandu-based SAARC
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The review was carried out as part of an on-going process
initiated by the member countries of the South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- to identify measures to
significantly enhance the capabilities of the SAARC to address the
common concerns of its member countries on various issues both
through institutional reform as well as rationalization of the
SAARC's work programs including the prioritization of its many
initiatives, said the press release available Monday.
</P>
<P>
The IPA was formally launched in August 1983 along with the
formation of the South Asian Regional Cooperation, the predecessor
of the SAARC formed in December 1985.
</P>
<P>
It forms a key component of the present SAARC arrangement and
focuses on promoting cooperation among member countries in such
areas as agriculture, communications, education, culture and
sports, environment and meteorology, health, population and child
welfare, prevention of drug trafficking and drug abuse, rural
development, science and technology, tourism, transport and women
in development.
</P>
<P>
At their ninth summit held in last May, the leaders of the
SAARC countries stressed the need to make the IPA more effective
through the selection of target-oriented and time-bound activities
within an overall framework of enhanced cooperation among member
countries.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the SAARC secretary-general was authorized by
the governing Council of Ministers to constitute an expert group
to review the IPA.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Expert Group has made important and
far-reaching recommendations to significantly overhaul the IPA
programs and enhance their effectiveness, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
With its final meeting at the SAARC Secretariat on March 9-11,
the expert group had concluded its work, the press release added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Approves Plans of Anti-Economic Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia approved plans on cracking
down on the rising number of financial and credit crimes.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Sardak, director of the anti-economic crimes bureau,
said Sunday that it planned to become more involved in the illegal
circulation of negotiable securities, mining and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of financial and credit crimes and
corruption in government offices had risen rapidly in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Recorded cases of economic crime amounted to 210,000 in 1997, an
increase of 7.5 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
The authorities confiscated 790 kilograms of gold, 928
kilograms of silver, 135 kilograms of platinum and about 13,000
carats of diamonds last year. False and unguaranteed bills worth
about 18 billion U.S. dollars were seized and 2,200 underground
factories producing methylated spirits smashed.
</P>
<P>
On March 4, Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree
authorising the severe crackdown of economic crimes.

<HEADLINE> Future of Disputed Bosnian Town Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A decision on the future of the
disputed Bosnian town of Brcko has been postponed amid threats
that it could lead to a renewal of the war.
</P>
<P>
The International Arbitration Tribunal decided on Sunday to
postpone the final phase of arbitration until late 1998 or early
1999.
</P>
<P>
The panel said the delay would give Bosnian Serb leaders a
chance to carry out important reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs have administered the town of Brcko since gaining
control at the start of the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the tribunal Robert Owen said Brcko would be kept
under international supervision until the final decision is made.
</P>
<P>
A port town of about 40,000 residents on the Sava river, Brcko is
one of the most contentious disputes between postwar Bosnia's ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
For the Serbs, its six-kilometer corridor is the only passage
linking the western and eastern parts of their territory.
</P>
<P>
But for Croats and Muslims, who formed the majority of Brcko's
population before the war, said that to hand it to the Serbs would
be rewarding "ethnic cleansing".
</P>
<P>
Since neither side could agree on the control of Brcko, the
tribunal was then set up under the 1995 Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
President of the Serbian Republika Srpska Biljana Plavsic
welcomed the tribunal's decision to put off the final
arbitration. She said she would abide by all requirements of the
International Arbitration Tribunal with a view to keeping Brcko in
her republic.
</P>
<P>
Muslim-Croat Federation President Ejup Ganic responded by
saying that if Brcko were given to the Serbs, it would mean the
end of Bosnia and the end of peace for many years.
</P>
<P>
The status of Brcko, the only unsolved dispute under the Dayton
agreement, was to have been decided by December 14, 1996. But due
to the severe differences, the tribunal has already put off the
date of decision for three times.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin: President, Chairman of Central Military Commission (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, was
re-elected president of the People's Republic of China and
chairman of the Central Military Commission at the First Session
of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
In China, Jiang Zemin is generally regarded as "the core of the
leadership of the third generation" since, in people's eyes, he is
the top leader succeeding Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, at the
center respectively of China's leadership of the first and second
generations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's re-election as president of the People's Republic of
China and chairman of the Central Military Commission is a common
wish of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
In the past nine years since Jiang became the country's top
leader, China has been stable socially and politically, its
economy has continued to develop, its national strength has
continuously increased, its government has been extremely active
diplomatically and the people's living standard has risen
steadily.
</P>
<P>
During this period, the country's gross domestic product (GDP)
grew at an average annual rate of about 11 percent. Not only did
the economy undergo a rapid growth, but inflation was brought
under effective control. It is a common wish of the Chinese people
of all ethnic groups to maintain the current momentum of
development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was born in August 1926 to an intellectual family in
Yangzhou, a historically and culturally famous city at the lower
reaches of China's Yangtze River. The cultural background of his
family with a long tradition of learning enabled him to read
extensively Chinese and foreign literary masterpieces and thus to
have a solid foundation in literature.
</P>
<P>
However, he chose Shanghai Jiaotong University, a prestigious
university of engineering in China, with electrical engineering as
his major.
</P>
<P>
It was Jiang Shangqing, his uncle and foster father, who
exerted a great influence on his becoming a career revolutionary
later. His uncle, a Communist, who led a regional anti-Japanese
armed force in the northeast of Anhui Province and north of the
Huai River in China, sacrificed his life for the country in a
battle in 1939.

<P>
Jiang graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong University in 1947.
During his college years, he participated in the CPC-led student
movement against Chiang Kai-shek's autocratic rule, and joined the
Communist Party of China in 1946.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of New China, Jiang served as an associate
engineer, head of a workshop and deputy director of a factory in
Shanghai. In 1955, he was sent to the Soviet Union to work in
Moscow's Stalin Automobile Works as a trainee for one year.
</P>
<P>
After his return home in 1956, he served as director of
factories and research institutes in the big industrial cities of
Changchun, Shanghai and Wuhan. Later, he was transferred to
Beijing to take charge of the Foreign Affairs Department of the
First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry under the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
After 1980, he served successively as Deputy Director of the
State Import and Export Administration and the State Foreign
Investment Administration, Vice-Minister and Minister of
Electronics Industry, Mayor of Shanghai, Secretary of the CPC
Shanghai Municipal Committee, and member of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee. After June 1989, he was elected
General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, President of the
People's Republic of China and Chairman of the Central Military
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Jiang' family background and unique personal experience have
made him always cherish a lofty ideal to enrich the people,
strengthen the nation and rejuvenate China. When Deng Xiaoping put
forward his initial ideas to build special economic zones (SEZ),
Jiang, serving as a leading official at that time in the State
Import and Export Administration and the State Foreign Investment
Administration, was resolute in their implementation without the
least hesitation.
</P>
<P>
Facing a wilderness-like Shenzhen then, he made a clear
proposal: "All development projects in the SEZ should be started
from a long-term point of view and should not follow the
traditional system." Now, China's first special economic zone,
Shenzhen, which is adjacent to Hong Kong, has developed into a
busting metropolis with a population of over one million.
</P>
<P>
While he was in office in Shanghai, he won public praise from
the more than 12 million Shanghai residents for his remarkable
achievements.
</P>
<P>
Above all, the relatively backward condition of urban
construction and infrastructure in Shanghai had to be changed so
as to expedite city development. Jiang together with his
colleagues drew up a plan to transform municipal infrastructure
with the help of international capital, using external investments
of over three billion US dollars for the construction of key
projects such as a subway, Nanpu Bridge, water pollution
treatment, airport expansion and program-controlled telephone
exchanges.

<TEXT>
<P>
Now, people marvel at rapid developments in Shanghai, where
"there is a change in a year and a big one in three years." This
has to be attributed to the new thinking of utilizing external
funds and the new mechanism of "borrowing, spending and repaying
money by oneself." These policies were made while Jiang held
office in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
After he came to Beijing, Jiang's ability to manage Party and
state affairs was further put to good use. Under the leadership of
the CPC Central Committee with Jiang at the core, China's reform,
opening up and the modernization drive moved forward
uninterruptedly. Based on Deng Xiaoping Theory, a major policy
decision was made under his direction to establish a socialist
market economy, and an Outline of the Ninth Five-year Plan
(1996-2000) for National Economic and Social Development and
Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2010 were formulated.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of summing up the experience of the reforms and
opening up, he expounded in an all-round way 12 major
relationships in China's economic and social development and
pointed out that a proper balance between them should be
maintained. Especially in his report delivered to the 15th
National Congress of the CPC, Jiang, holding high the great banner
of Deng Xiaoping Theory, drew up a series of important guidelines
for an all-round advancement of the cause of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Particularly in economic restructuring, new significant
advances have been made. Not only has it been established that to
keep public ownership in a dominant position and to have diverse
forms of ownership develop side by side is China's basic economic
system for the primary stage of socialism, but also it is clearly
pointed out in the report that public ownership can and should
take multiple forms and that all government methods and
organizational forms that reflect laws relating to socialized
production, including the joint stock system and the joint stock
cooperative system, may be utilized boldly.
</P>
<P>
It is further clarified that the non-public sector is an
important component part of the socialist market economy and
should continue to be encouraged and guided to a healthy
development. In the reform of the political structure, new
progress has also been made.
</P>
<P>
It is clearly pointed out in the report that the scope of
democracy should be further extended, ensuring people the
rights to hold democratic elections, make policy decisions in
a democratic manner, and institute democratic management and
supervision. Ruling the country by law should be upheld and great
efforts be made to promote socialist democracy with Chinese
characteristics.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin: President, Chairman of Central Military Commission (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His report of more than 30,000 Chinese characters has been
regarded as "a political declaration and program of action of the
third generation of the collective leadership of China leading the
nation toward a new century."
</P>
<P>
In leading China's reform, opening up and modernization drive,
Jiang has paid close attention to the correct handling of the
relationship between material progress and cultural and ethical
progress. He has said that economic backwardness is not socialism
and nor is spiritual deficiency socialism.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the CPC Central Committee under his direction
made a series of major policy decisions to develop socialist
culture and ethics, and to strengthen and improve the leadership
of the Party.
</P>
<P>
These measures have helped China improve its social atmosphere.
Paying attention to ethics and civilities has become common
practice.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption campaign has also won positive results.
Such major cases as that of Chen Xitong, a former member of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and former Secretary
of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, have been
investigated and dealt with according to law. All these moves have
won popular support.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is fully aware that in order to carry out the
modernization drive in a big country with a population of 1.2
billion, social stability is a prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
Hence, he lays particular stress on the need to balance reform,
development and stability, and has formulated the basic principle
of "seizing the current opportunity to deepen reforms and open
China even wider to the outside world, promoting development and
maintaining stability."
</P>
<P>
Even though China's political situation has become more stable,
its economy prospered and people's living standards improved day
by day, Jiang as China's top leader has never been intoxicated
with successes, and has constantly exhorted leading carders at
all levels: "We should have the awareness of hardships and think
of danger in times of safety."
</P>
<P>
With regard to contradictions and difficulties existing in
economic and social life, he always keeps a clear head and exerts
himself to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
In the past nine years, he has traveled to all of China's
provinces (except Taiwan), autonomous regions and municipalities
directly under the Central Government, and gone deep into
grassroots units for investigation and study as well as for the
understanding of social conditions and popular will.
</P>
<P>
Wherever he goes, he will invariably visit those workers whose
enterprises have not extricated themselves from difficulties, and
express his sincere concerns. He pays special attention to the
life of those people who live in poor areas of remote provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government under his direction worked out a very
ambitious "plan to alleviate poverty" and was determined to
accomplish in the main the task of providing adequate food and
clothing for the needy in rural areas within this century.

<P>
In the diplomatic field, the third generation of collective
leadership with Jiang at the core has demonstrated its outstanding
capability to cope with the international situation and handle all
kinds of complex international affairs.
</P>
<P>
In the past nine years under his leadership, China has scored a
series of diplomatic successes. China's international standing has
risen increasingly and its influence on international affairs has
kept growing.
</P>
<P>
China's relations with all countries in the world have further
developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence. The good-neighborly relations with surrounding
countries have further consolidated, and solidarity and
cooperation with the vast number of developing countries have
greatly strengthened.
</P>
<P>
In particular, his successful state visit to the United State
in 1997 made the Sino-US relations enter a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Jiang as a statesman of the new generation has the distinct
makings and style of a scholar. He has extensive knowledge. He
loves reading, and the most he reads are the latest books on
economics, science and technology, politics and culture.
</P>
<P>
While in office in Shanghai, he wrote papers such as On the New
Features of the Development of World Electronic Information
Industry and Strategic Problems of the Development of China's
Electronic Information Industry, the Trend of Energy Development
in the World and Main Energy-Saving Measures, which were published
in the "Shanghai Jiaotong University Journal".
</P>
<P>
He can use English, Russian and Romanian, and knows some German
and Japanese. In meeting with foreign guests, he often expresses
his viewpoints in foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
He is highly accomplished in famous works of classic Chinese
literature and often quotes in talks well-known lines from
exponents of various schools of thought as well as Tang, Song and
Yuan poetry.
</P>
<P>
He also reads extensively famous works of Western literature.
He loves to read novels by Mark Twain, and can recite passages
from "Hamlet" by Shakespeare and verses from "Ode to the West
Wind" by Shelley. He also knows very well works by Leo Tolstoy,
Pushkin, Chekhov and Turgenev.
</P>
<P>
He not only loves literature, but has a wide range of other
interest. He likes both erhu tunes by A Bing, a great master of
Chinese folk music, and symphonic music by Mozart and Beethoven,
great masters of Western music.
</P>
<P>
At leisure, he may play erhu and bamboo flute, traditional
Chinese musical instruments, as well as the Western musical
instrument piano. He thinks that art treasures of Chinese and
Western cultures are the common spiritual wealth of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Jiang has a warm, harmonious and happy family. He and his wife
Wang Yeping have two sons, a grandson and a granddaughter. In his
spare time, Jiang often indulges in sporting with these "pearls in
his palm" in great joy, tells them stories and teaches them to
recite ancient poetry and read English, thus enjoying the
traditional Chinese family life of "several generations living
under one roof."

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao: Vice-President of People's Republic of China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a top official of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), was elected vice-president of the
People's Republic of China today at the First Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
He is the youngest among the Standing Committee members of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the highest
decision-making body of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Hu, 55, has been taking charge of Party affairs work as a
Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the CPC
Central Committee. He also serves concurrently as president of the
Party School of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 when he began to serve as a member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and
member of the secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, Hu Jintao
has won praises from all quarters for his superb theoretical
attainment and his sure and steadfast style of work.
</P>
<P>
When he was elected into the CPC Central Committee 16 years
ago, Hu was only 39, also the youngest of the CPC Central
Committee then.
</P>
<P>
Born in December 1942 in Jixi County, east China's Anhui
Province, Hu studied hydroelectric engineering in Beijing-based
Qinghua University, the country's most prestigious polytechnic,
where he joined the CPC in April 1964.
</P>
<P>
As an outstanding student in his department, Hu had the dream
of becoming an expert on hydropower.
</P>
<P>
After his graduation in July 1965, Hu remained at Qinghua
University as a researcher and political instructor until the
start of the "Cultural Revolution" in 1966. In 1968, he was
assigned to work in Gansu, one of China's least-developed
provinces in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
After doing manual labor for one year in a housing construction
team, he served successively as technician, office secretary and
deputy Party secretary in an engineering bureau under the Ministry
of Water Resources and Electric Power. This signified the beginning
of his career in Party affairs work.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, he was transferred to the Gansu Provincial

Hu was elected member of the Secretariat of the CCYL Central
Committee and president of the All-China Youth Federation.
</P>

<P>
In 1985, when he was 42, Hu became secretary of the CPC Guizhou
Provincial Committee, again the youngest of his rank across the
country.
</P>
<P>
He visited 86 counties, cities and prefectures in this poor
southwestern province in two subsequent years in Guizhou. He once
said that economic development in poverty-stricken areas requires
the effort of one generation of dedicated people.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1988, Hu became secretary of the CPC Tibet
Autonomous Regional Committee. During his four-year stay there,
despite the harsh natural conditions on the Tibet Plateau, Hu
visited many areas and made extensive contacts with people in
various circles, contributing tremendously to this region's ethnic
unity, stability and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
During the 14th CPC National Congress helded in October 1992,
Hu was elected Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee, as well as a member of the CPC
Central Committee's Secretariat. He has served concurrently as
president of the Party School of the CPC Central Committee since
1993.
</P>
<P>
He was also a member of the Standing Committee of the Sixth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference.
</P>
<P>
Being a leader of the Communist Party of China, Hu Jintao has
paid quite a number of visits to foreign countries at the head of
delegations in recent years, enhancing friendly cooperations
between China and other countries.
</P>
<P>
According to his former colleagues, Hu was a very persuasive
person, and was very good at coping with complex situations with
firm principles and flexible tactics.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of his basic qualities as a leader, Hu himself once
said that a good leader must have firm belief and lofty pursuit,
do solid work, seek no fame or gain, do away with air of
bureaucracy and share the feeling of the masses of people.
</P>
<P>
A good leader should carry forward democracy and also be
capable of taking resolute actions at critical moments, and must
love life, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hu's experiences with the work related to youth has enabled him
to become aware of the country's younger generation. He once noted
that in the process of the reform, the Chinese youth should not be
imbued with only only a sense of urgency and a sense of mission,
but also a good understanding of the reform's arduous and complex
nature.
</P>
<P>
"Do not place high expectations while your psychological
capacity for endurance is low," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hu loves literature and art, and plays table tennis well.
</P>
<P>
Hu and his wife, who now works in the Beijing Municipal
Construction Committee, were schoolmates at Qinghua University.
They have a son and a daughter.

<HEADLINE> Last Year's Haze Costs S'pore 65 Million US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Last year's haze which affected
most countries of the region cost Singapore at least 104 million
Singapore dollars, or 65 million U.S. dollars at current exchange
rate, the national newspaper Straits Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a study by a private research environmental group in
Southeast Asia, the report said that the figure is about 20
percent higher than the initial estimate. The initial estimates
had put the loss at 88 million Singapore dollars (55 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
David Glower, director of the group, was quoted as saying that
the tourism industry was the hardest hit, losing about 81.8
million Singapore dollars (51.13 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Health costs came up to 12.5 million Singapore dollars (7.8
million U.S. dollars), and the airline industry lost 9.7 million
Singapore dollars (6.1 million U.S. dollars), Glower said, adding
that this amount was only the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by the Economy and Environment Program
for Southeast Asia, which was established in 1993 and is funded by
governments and private bodies in Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
Its researchers come from countries in the region, and the
program is administered by the International Development Research
Center in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that between August and October last year, the
number of tourists arriving in Singapore fell to 1.7 million,
about ten percent less than the expected 1.8 million, while hotel
occupancy rates dropped to about 67 percent in October, compared
with 80 percent for the same month 1996.
</P>
<P>
The study, which was released last Saturday at a Singapore
Environment Council briefing, concluded that while there are no
visual reminders of the haze in Singapore, such as charred forests
and drought, the economic impact on the island was substantial.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Reconsider English Teaching in Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Education Ministry has
been proposed to review its policy to teach English from primary
school grade 1 since pupils at that age may not learn a second
language well, the Bangkok Post said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Curriculum and Instruction said the policy,
issued in 1996, was not suitable for young pupils who are not
skilled yet in their mother tongue.
</P>
<P>
A research by Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Education
said that pupils should begin to study a second language when they
are able to listen, speak and write their mother language.
</P>
<P>
Forcing young pupils to study another language while they are
not ready will only make them confused and they may end up poorly
in both languages.
</P>
<P>
The department also cited the fact that the country does not
have enough teachers who are specially trained in English
teaching.
</P>
<P>
Pupils are risking learning incorrect English from their
teachers, which can have a bad influence on them for the rest of
their life, the department said.
</P>
<P>
A research by the department showed that English teaching in
primary school grade 1 may arouse the pupils' interest in learning
English but is unlikely to lay a strong foundation for further
study.
</P>
<P>
However, there are different opinions among the Education
Ministry. Some said that the policy has just been implemented and
should be maintained, adding that it is intended to give pupils
sound basics of the English language.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Gem Export Earnings Down in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka exported 219 million
U.S. dollars worth of gem and jewelry in 1997, a drop from a year
earlier, according to media sources here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Gem and Jewelry Authority (GJA) expects a significant
growth in exports this year following the tax relief provided by
the government for the gold, gem and jewelry industry.
</P>
<P>
These incentives are expected to strengthen the gem industry
further and help Sri Lanka get an edge over other competitors in
the international market, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The best seller among Sri Lanka gems was cut diamonds which
fetched over 131 million U.S. dollars. Other gem exports earned
24.6 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
At present Japan, the United States, Germany, Australia, Italy,
Switzerland, Singapore, Thailand and France are Sri Lanka's major
gem buyers.
</P>
<P>
GJA sources said that there were plans to start a comprehensive
training course in gem heating, treatment, gem cutting and jewelry
designing.
</P>
<P>
There were also plans to establish a school to provide training
in gem and jewelry designing according to international standards.

As the premier of the People's Republic, Li Peng has always
kept a packed schedule. Li often went down to grassroots units
across the country to do investigations and study. Over the past
11 years as premier, he made inspection on study tours almost all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
As the premier, he has paid equal attention to economic growth

socialist cultural and ethical progress as ideological and ethical
progress and development of education, science and culture. Li
showed particular care and attention for the work and life of the

At home, Li is a good helper and often does some house work.
Newspapers once published a photo showing Li Peng mending his
overcoat. He said he learned sewing in Yan'an in the 1940s when he
lived together with children of many other revolutionary martyrs.
"Li Peng has not the slightest traces of male chauvinism," said
Zhu Lin, his wife. "Whenever he is free, he would lend a helping
hand in household chores either when he was an ordinary official
or later a minister or even after he became the Premier."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Singapore Bank Seeks More Deals in Thailand, SE Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Development Bank of Singapore
(DBS) is planning to acquire more banks and related businesses in
Thailand and Southeast Asia after successfully taking over
Thailand's Danu Bank (TDB), DBS President Ng Kee Choe said here
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at potential investment opportunities in the
region and Thailand," The Bangkok Post newspaper quoted Ng as
saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ng was leading a team of senior executives of DBS and
affiliates to meet TDB counterparts in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore bank's move to take 50.27 percent of stake in
Thai Danu was part of its drive to become a regional player with
global reach, Ng said.
</P>
<P>
DBS is supported by the Singapore government, which takes 40
percent of stake in the bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the first local bank to be successfully
recapitalized, Thai Danu Bank claimed it is in a much better
position than other local banks.
</P>
<P>
TDB President Pornsanong Tuchinda said that DBS has already
injected six billion baht (150 million U.S. dollars) in fresh
capital.
</P>
<P>
The deal marks the first major capital injection by foreign
investors in domestic banks, which have been unable to restructure
to meet international financial standards, particularly a capital
base requirement, without foreign participation.
</P>
<P>
TDB's registered capital was raised from 2.5 billion baht (62.5
million dollars) to 5.5 billion baht (137.5 million dollars),
which boosted its capital adequacy ratio from 11-12 percent to 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
It would now be looking into buying a securities business in
Thailand with the aim of offering a full range of services.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia Coming Down Hard on Illegals (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is coming down hard
on the illegals as government officials say they not only pose
economic problems but also threaten the country's security.
</P>
<P>
Illegal immigrants have been plaguing the country which has
more than two million foreign workers with some 800,000 illegals
mostly from Indonesia, posing a headache to the authorities and
causing disquiet among the local communities.
</P>
<P>
What is worse now is that in the recent months, more and more
immigrants from neighboring countries are attempting to enter the
country illegally.
</P>
<P>
According to a police statement issued at the end of February,
3,036 illegal immigrants were arrested during a two-week period.
The number was more than a third of the total nabbed by the
uniformed authorities in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli Ghazali said the various
operations throughout the country result in the daily detention of
300 to 500 illegal immigrants. The immigration authorities
deported 3,500 illegal immigrants last month and hope to deport
another 6,500 this month, he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told reporters last week
that a total of 17,576 Indonesian nationals had been detained by
Malaysian authorities since January for entering Malaysia
illegally.
</P>
<P>
The increased landings of illegal immigrants over the first two
months of the year prompted the marine police to deploy 100
vessels on a round-the-clock patrol of the 2,000 kilometer
coastline.
</P>
<P>
Because of its economic problems, Malaysia is no longer in a
position to accommodate foreign workers, the foreign minister said
Sunday after opening the three-day 8th Southeast Asia Forum here.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the police, the Immigration Department, the National
Registration Department and the Attorney-General's Chambers had
their first meeting here on illegal immigrants and discussed
various proposals to deal with the problem of illegal immigrants
including the imposition of whipping for illegal immigrants and
the mastermind behind their illegal entry and intensified patrols
to prevent illegal entry of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Home Minister Ong Ka Ting said the other day Malaysia
had a consistent policy of not allowing illegals into the country,
and the government would not compromise the country's security in
dealing with the illegals.
</P>
<P>
"We have alerted the authorities on the possible entry points
used by the illegals," Ong said.

<TEXT>
<P>
To prevent the increasing influx of illegal immigrants from
neighboring countries, Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar said
three days ago that more Territorial Army personnel would be
deployed alongside regular soldiers to help guard national borders
against the influx of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Syed said, "The army is ready to increase the frequency of
patrols and extend areas of surveillance as requested by the Home
Ministry."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Army Chief Mohamed Zahidi Zainuddin said the army
was willing to cooperate with the police and the Immigration
Department to flush out illegal immigrants from their hide-outs
since it involved national security.
</P>
<P>
More patrols would be held along the border area between
Sarawak, East Malaysia, and Kalimantan, Indonesia, to prevent the
entry of illegal immigrants, the enforcement authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The enforcement authorities said they would also step up sea
and land patrols along the Thai-Malaysia border, following
Thailand's plan to repatriate some 800,000 illegals from the
country by May 1, to curb their entry into the northern states of
Peninsula Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli Ghazali has warned that stern
action would be taken against policemen and immigration officers
involved in smuggling the illegals into the country.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government would not tolerate employers hiring
more than five illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
To expedite the deportation of illegals, the police have
proposed to set up a special court in the country to deal with
cases of illegal entry of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Yusof Said, deputy director of the Department of Internal
Security and Public Order at the federal police headquarters
here, said that normal courts take a long time to dispose of cases
involving illegal immigrants because they also have to deal with
other cases.
</P>
<P>
"When cases involving illegal immigrants are delayed, it means
a longer detention for them and further costs for the country.
Therefore with the setting up of a special court, prosecution and
the various process will take a shorter time and they could be
deported faster," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has expressed the hope that countries with their
nationals working illegally abroad will accept them after being
repatriated by the host countries.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Badawi said he would go to Jakarta as soon as
possible to discuss with his Indonesian counterpart the issue of
the influx of illegal Indonesian migrant workers to Malaysia,
which the Indonesian Embassy here considered as a serious problem
now.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian side has pledged to cooperate even more closely
with Malaysia in handling this matter.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia hoped that with operations stepped up at its borders
to check illegal entry and with cooperation from neighboring
countries, the ever-increasing influx of illegals would be curbed.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Beijing Relay Station Undergoes Restoration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Concerned departments in Beijing
are currently restoring an ancient relay station in Yanqing
County, a northwest suburb county of the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Experts confirm that the station, which covers 162,000 sq.m.,
was built during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). The site includes a
600 meter section of the ancient city wall and a castle.
</P>
<P>
The site has yielded a number of cultural relics, including
over 20 stone stables and 100 stone pillars.
</P>
<P>
The relay station provided ancient couriers with fresh mounts
and an opportunity to rest. Historical documents verify that China
established a series of relay stations over 3,000 years ago, with
a majority of the facilities destroyed during periods of war.
</P>
<P>
A researcher from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
discovered the Yanqing station in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Cultural Relics has placed the
site under municipal level protection, and the Yanqing county
government will open same as a tourism site.
</P>
<P>
The restoration project is scheduled for completion in
1999.

<HEADLINE> Liaison Officers Oversee to Textile Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The China National Textile
Council (CNTC) has dispatched a group of over 30 liaison officers
to all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly
under the central government to inspect the ongoing restructuring
of the textile industry.
</P>
<P>
The latest contingent represents the second group of CNTC
liaison officers sent to different parts of the country since last
month's decision to reduce the number of spindles in the nation's
cotton mills.
</P>
<P>
The CNTC president and five vice-presidents led the first group
of liaison officers to six major parts of the country in
mid-February to conduct studies and investigations of the textile
industry.
</P>
<P>
The tasks of the current group include supervising, inspecting,
coordinating and assisting the ongoing effort to reduce the number
of spindles, as well overseeing mergers or bankruptcies of
selected enterprises, the reemployment of laid-off workers and
erasing losses and increasing profits of the textile sector in
various localities. Liaison officers are also responsible for
supervising the destruction of dismentaled spindles.
</P>
<P>
The Central government decided that the reform of state-owned
enterprises should include breakthroughs in restructuring the
textile industry.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai took the lead by destroying a large number of obsolete
spindles in February, with a number of cities following suit by
eliminating over 222,000 spindles.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources note that major textile producers in Shandong
and Zhejiang provinces will begin destroying obsolete and excess
spindles later this week.
</P>
<P>
CNTC Officials stress that attaining the goal of destroying
750,000 spindles by the end of March is well within reach.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry plans to eliminate ten million spindles
and reduce its work force by over 1.2 million workers over the
next three years. In addition, Central government plans call for
the textile industry to turn losses into profits by year
2000.

COLOMBO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Sweden has provided 3.1 million
U.S. dollars to Sri Lanka this year for rehabilitation activities
in the Jaffna Peninsula, The Official Daily News reported Monday.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Registers Rapid Growth in Liaoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The private sector has registered
rapid growth in northeast China's Liaoning province, one of the
country's industrial bases.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the private sector turned out an output value of
58.8 billion yuan (7 billion US dollars), accounting for 16.8
percent of Liaoning's GDP, said Wang Huaiyuan, deputy to the Ninth
National People's Congress and deputy secretary of the provincial
Party committee.
</P>
<P>
The sector now employs more than 2.5 million people, or 7.6
percent of the province's labor force, of which about one million
have been laids off from the state-own industry.
</P>
<P>
Last year, private businesses turned over 2.56 billion yuan in
taxes, making up 6.5 percent of Liaoning's revenues. In some
counties and districts, half of their revenues come from the
private sector, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Liaoning has encouraged the growth of the private
sector in recent years to diversify the economic structure in the
process of building a market economy. In the former planned
economy, the public sector played a dominant role in the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
"Development of the private sector will also help absorb the
large number of laids-off from state-owned industry as a result of
the transformation in China's economic system," Wang acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses has spread from the service industry, its
traditional realm, to agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry,
fishery, minerals exploitation, manufacturing, house building and
transportation, Wang said.

<P>
ROME, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
has defended his government's economic policies against criticisms
by Fiat auto company Chairman Cesare Romiti.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Romiti compared Italy to a "stressed-out boxer"
entering the European single currency ring, ready to be felled "by the
first blow".
</P>
<P>
And the industrialist called for less fiscal pressure on the
domestic economy to free resources for investments, especially in
the depressed southern regions.
</P>
<P>
But Prodi said Sunday that Romiti's opinion had always differed
from the government's policy on joining Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, events did not go the way Romiti wanted," the
prime minister said in his home town Bologna.
</P>
<P>
Prodi cited business agreements signed between enterprises in
the north and south of the country to defend his policies and said
the national economy had begun growing again.

ROME, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Rolf Sorensen of Denmark won a photo
finish in the 215-km fifth stage to take the overall lead in the
Tirreno Adriatic cycling race on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, his victory was argued by team manager of German Erik
Zabel, who claimed that Sorensen had elbowed his opponent in the
final sprint.
</P>
<P>
The Danish cyclist was only awarded the stage from Torricella
to Sicura after judges resorted to a photo-finish review.
</P>
<P>
Sorensen clocked six hours four minutes and 13 seconds to
complete the longest course first in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Rolf Jaermann, second in the overall standings three
seconds behind Sorensen, was edged into third. Zbigniew Spruch of
Poland was fourth in the stage and is third overall, two seconds
further back.
</P>
<P>
Sorensen's victory gives him a slender three-second lead in an
eight-stage race which features 50 riders after the organizers
disqulified 129 last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With 20 kilometres to the finish line, Sorensen and 29 other
riders made their final break. Three members broke away for their
own attack, but were caught in the last 600 meters.

<HEADLINE> Flower Industry Expected to Be New Agricultural Growth Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Experts predict that the flower
industry will become a new area for the country's agricultural
growth, according Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that China has become one of seven countries in
the world with annual flower exports increasing at an average 20
percent or more.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the acreage of flowers in the country has
expanded from 11,000 hectares in 1984 to the current 75,000
hectares, with the annual output value rising from 600 million
yuan to 4.8 billion yuan. The total export volume is 130 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
For example, in east China's Shandong Province, more than 6,000
hectares are planted in flowers producing more than 600 million
yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
The province has more than 1,100 flower firms and more than 20
flower wholesale markets employing more than 500,000 people. The
province has also established six flower-planting centers for
roses, cyclamen, azalea and honeysuckle.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, demand for flowers in the cities of Guangzhou,
Shanghai and Beijing has increased at 30-to-40 percent annually.

<HEADLINE> Rios Takes Champions Cup Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Seventh seed Marcelo Rios of
Chile outwitted sixth-seeded Greg Rusedski of Britain to take the
Champions Cup title in Indian Wells, California on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the win of 6-3, 6-7 (15-17), 7-6 (7-4) and 6-4 after two
hours and 46 minutes, Rios reached the highest ranking of his
career by climbing to number three in the world.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a big step in my career. One year ago, I was 20,
now I'm three. That gives you more confidence, you get more energy
to keep on going and try to be better each day," said Rios.
</P>
<P>
The victory was the second of the year for Rios, who also won
at Auckland in January. He reached the final of a Grand Slam for
the first time at the Australian Open in January, but lost to Petr
Korda of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski, who reached his first career Grand Slam final at the
U.S. Open last September, was competing in his third final of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The match resulted in the longest tiebreaker of the year on the
men's tour with 32 points.
</P>
<P>
Despite 21 aces, Rusedski was unable to capitalize on any of
the three break points he had in the match, while Rios broke serve
twice and his steady baseline game dictated the match.
</P>
<P>
This was the third all left-handed final of the year in men's
tennis. The Rios loss to Korda in Australia was another, along
with the Rusedski loss to Goran Ivanisevic at Split.
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Connors was the last left-handed player to win this title
in 1984.

3-6, 6-1, 6-1 to take the Copenhagen Open title here on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai People Prefer Investing in Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A variety of bonds are taking
the place of bank deposits and stock speculation to become a
consumption fad for Shanghai city dwellers, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Investing in bonds caters to household financial managers who
now have a stronger fiscal awareness, said observers, since it has
a lower stake than buying stocks and higher return of interest in
three or five years in the short run, compared with bank deposit.
</P>
<P>
Construction bonds for 1998, issued by Shanghai Urban
Construction Investment Co. to raise 500 million yuan in funds,
were sold out in less than an hour on the first selling day, in
contrast to 35 days of designated selling duration.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the 1998 certificate state bonds issued Feb. 20 and
planned for an eight-month-long sales, have been sold for 10.4
billion yuan through banks, accounting for 80 percent of the
issuance.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the active bond market should be partially
attributed to the low ebb of Shanghai's stock market, which is
undergoing an adjustment.

<HEADLINE> Briton Hickman Reaps Four Wins in World Cup Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEFFIELD, England, March 15 (Xinhua) -- James Hickman of
Britain became the biggest winner by reaping two more wins in a
World Cup swimming meeting which concluded here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Briton swam the fourth fastest 100-meter
butterfly following his win in the 200m individual medley on
Sunday, bringing to four golds in his credit after he won the 100m
individual medley and 200m butterfly on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hickman clocked a British record of one minute 57.98 seconds in
the 200m medley, and won the 100 butterfly in 51.56 seconds, a
time bettered only at the first of the nine rounds of this year's
World Cup meetings in January.
</P>
<P>
Nowsdays, the Briton hoped to break the world marks in the
month as his timings are very close to the world marks in the 100m
and 200m butterfly events.
</P>
<P>
"Being so close to the world records, I'd love to break the two
world records in Paris. But they're not easy. They're tough world
records," Hickman said.
</P>
<P>
He will compete in the last two World Cup events of the season
in Imperia, Italy, on March 25 and 26 and Paris on March 28 and 29.
</P>
<P>
World and Olympic champion Susie O'Neill justified her prowess
in the women's 200 butterfly and Helen Denman, 100 breaststroke
silver medallist at the world championships in January, won the 50
breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
Australian Petria Thomas, silver medallist behind O'Neill at
the Perth worlds, was disqualified for a faulty turn in the 200
butterfly heats but finished third in the 50 butterfly behind
Denmark's Mette Jacobsen and Swedens European champion Johanna
Sjoberg.
</P>
<P>
Swedish world short-course champion Patrik Isaksson added
victory in the men's 100 breaststroke to the one he achieved on
Saturday in the 50 breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
Germans Katrin Meissner and Sandra Voelker also savored their
golden doubles. Meissner, who beat Voelker in Saturday's women's
50 freestyle, took the 100 freestyle ahead of Britain's Karen
Pickering while Voelker completed a backstroke double adding
Sunday's 100 to Saturday's 50 victory.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Ian Wilson won the longest race of men's 1,500 meters
in 14:45.65, denying Denmark's Jacob Carstensen a second victory.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Within Anti-Taliban Alliance Intensify in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Heavy clashes between two
factions of Afghanistan's anti-Taliban alliance have intensified
in Mazar-e-Sharif, about 300 km north of Kabul, for the second
day, Afghan sources told Xinhua Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Mazar-e-Sharif, headquarters of the northern
alliance, was "highly tense" as forces loyal to ethnic-Uzbek
warlord Rashid Dostum stepped up battle against the Shiite
Hezb-e-Wahdat faction inside the city, said the sources in
Peshawar, a major border city in northwestern Pakistan, Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
"Heavy fighting has taken place right inside the center of the
town and the situation can only be described as confusing and
chaotic," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, no further details on the clashes or information on
casualties were immediately available, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan-based private Afghan Islamic Press reported
Saturday that dozens of people had been killed in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Mazar-e-Sharif, de facto capital of the northern alliance, is
the only largest city outside the control of the Islamic Taliban
militia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dostum's forces have launched an all-out offensive
on Heritan, a strategic town bordering Uzbekistan, in a bid to
take it back from the hands of the Hezb-e-Wahdat faction, the
Afghan sources said.
</P>
<P>
Dostum had lost control of Heritan since mid-1997 when his
right-hand man general Abdul Malik revolted against him in
Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The northern alliance, composed of forces led by Dostum,
Hezb-e-Wadhat and former Afghanistan's military chief Ahmad
Masood, has been battling the hardline Taliban, who control two
thirds of Afghanistan, since Taliban drove them out from the
capital city of Kabul in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite Hezb-e-Wahdat rose to dominate the historic
Mazar-e-Sharif late last year when it led a massive defense of the
city from a major Taliban assault in September.
</P>
<P>
Since then Dostum, who once formed the dominant power in the
city, has been attempting to regain control of the dusty
stronghold.

</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>

offering.

<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia risks social upheaval and losing control of its

<HEADLINE> French Leftists React with Restrained Happiness to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- France's leftists reacted with
restrained satisfaction to the results of Sunday's regional
elections, which will allow them to take over 13 of the 20
regional parliaments controlled by the rightwing parties.
</P>
<P>
France has a total of 22 regional parliaments or councils
representing 22 different regions in France proper.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said that the result of the
elections confirmed that "the government can go ahead in its
action" undertaken since it came to power nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
Jospin's Socialist-led leftwing coalition came to power in the
early legislative elections held in May and June 1997 at the
expense of the rightwing Rally for the Republic (RPR) and Union
for French Democracy (UDF).
</P>
<P>
The First Secretary of the Socialist Party, Francois Hollande,
said that by leading the right by five points, the left coalition
has uncontestably won the elections.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Communist Party have also expressed with
restrained satisfaction over the election result.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Edouard Balladur and Francois Leotard, who lost
their campaigns for the Paris municipal council and the regional
council of the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur respectively, called for
a reorganization of the rightwing forces.
</P>
<P>
"Above all, we should imagine the organization expressing the
need of unity and coherence... in the Republican and liberal
right," said Balladur.
</P>
<P>
Leotard said that France needs an opposition enriched with more
diversities.
</P>
<P>
Alain Madelin, the president of the rightwing splinter party
Liberal Democratic Party, admitted that the left coalition has
"carried a relative success" and the right opposition "has
registered a defeat."
</P>
<P>
The number two of the far-right National Front (FN), Megret
Bruno, said that the FN has become "the second structural pole of
the political life of France."

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: French Rightwing Oppositions Suffer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- France's rightwing opposition
parties of Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) and Union for
French Democracy (UDF) Sunday suffered another major setback by
losing many regional parliaments -- including that of Paris -- to
the leftwing coalition.
</P>
<P>
By winning 37 percent of the votes in the elections for 22
regional parliaments or councils across the country, the
Socialist-led leftwing coalition, which controlled only two
regional parliaments since 1986, is expected to take over about
half of the regional parliaments from the rightwing oppositions
and share equal stand with them in some others.
</P>
<P>
What is particularly humiliating for the RPR and UDF is that
the regional parliaments in Paris and the southern Provence-Alpes
Cote d'Azur, which are traditional strongholds of the right, have
fallen to the left.
</P>
<P>
Despite relentless efforts made by former Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur, who was RPR and UDF candidate for Paris
parliament presidency, the Socialist-led left coalition won 40
percent of the votes, against 37.2 percent by the right
oppositions and 17 percent by the National Front (FN).
</P>
<P>
Francois Leotard, the president of UDF, was beaten by both the
Socialist candidate and the FN candidate in the wealthy tourist
region of Provence-Alpes Cote d'Azur, where the Mediterranean
metropolis of Marseille and the major cities of Nice, Toulon and
Cannes are located.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the election results for the 99 cantonal councils of
France showed that the left and right have won almost equal number
of votes, with both of them winning around 43-44 percent of the
votes. Most of their candidates will compete for the second run

<HEADLINE> Brain Cell Implant Possible to Aid Stroke Victims </HEADLINE>

<P>
LONDON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Researchers in Britain and America
have shown that it is possible to transplant brain cells grown in
the laboratory into stoke victims to repair permanently damaged
nerve tissue.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have discovered that human brain cells grown outside
the body can restore some of the functions of the damaged brains
of crippled rats or mice, whose symptoms are similar to that
caused by strokes and head injury.
</P>
<P>
This raises the prospect of helping sufferers of brain diseases
such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as victims of stroke,
The Sunday Times newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time that artificially cultured brain
cells will be injected into human patients in what will become a
milestone in transplant surgery, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In their research, scientists have identified immature cells
that can regenerate any part of the brain. Called stem cells, they
have the unique ability to grow into any kind of brain cell.
</P>
<P>
Two independent groups of scientists, one at Britain's
Cambridge University and other at Harvard Medical School in the
United States, have almost simultaneously isolated the stem cells
of human brain tissue.
</P>
<P>
Both are preparing to publish their work this year, The Sunday
Times said.
