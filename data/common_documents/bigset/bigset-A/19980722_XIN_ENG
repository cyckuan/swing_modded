<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A man appeared in a Belfast court
Tuesday charged with murdering three young Catholic brothers in an
arson attack.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Gilmour, 23, from Ballymoney, is accused of killing
Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn when their home was petrol-bombed
nine days ago.
</P>
<P>
Police have made several arrests since the arson attack, which
has been blamed on Protestant extremists.
</P>
<P>
Gilmour pleaded not guilty. Another man being held in
connection with the deaths has been released without charge. But
several others are still being questioned.
</P>
<P>
Gilmour has been remanded in custody until August 12, when he
will appear at another hearing at the court attached to Northern
Ireland's top security Maze prison.
</P>
<P>
The attack on the Quinn home took place at the height of a
protest by traditionalist Protestants camped out in a field near
Portadown to insist on their right to parade through a Catholic
area of the town.

<HEADLINE> China To Abandon Old Housing Distribution System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The State Council has issued a
circular ordering all localities to stop the decades-old practice
of distributing public-owned apartments at very low rents to those
working in government departments and state-owned institutions and
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the second half of this year, these employees will
have to purchase residences with either their own salaries, public
housing funds, mortgage loans, or, in some places, subsidiaries
from the government using apartment-building funds.
</P>
<P>
The exact time for implementation of the new housing system
will be set by local governments in accordance with local
situations, and the reform will be carried out step by step, the
circular says.
</P>
<P>
In principle, newly-built apartments will be available only for
purchase, not for rent, but local governments and institutions
will also provide low-income families with low-rent apartments for
leasing, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
The country will continue to popularize and constantly improve
the public housing fund system, according to the document.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Construction Starts Up Strongly in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Stimulated by lower mortgage
rates and a strong economy, the U.S. housing starts increased
strongly in June, reversing three straight months of decline, the
Commerce Department reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Builders started construction in June at a seasonally adjusted
rate of 1,615,000 new housing units, up 5.6 percent from May and
about 8 percent above the level of new starts in June 1997,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Construction had slowed in March, April and May after reaching
a nine-year high of 1.62 million units in February.
</P>
<P>
For 10 straight months now, home building has been above a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.5 million units, the longest
building boom since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
However, new building permits fell 1.7 percent in June to 1.52
million units, reflecting an anticipated shortage of skilled
construction workers.
</P>
<P>
But construction of new homes is continuing strong into July,
with interest rates on 30-year fixed mortgages averaging 6.94
percent this month, as compared with 7.0 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
New construction of single-family homes last month rose 2.5
percent from May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.25
million units. Townhouse construction, however, fell 19.2 percent
to an annual rate of 42,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, apartment building construction rose 24.7 percent to
a rate of 323,000 units.
</P>
<P>
By region, housing starts in the Northeast fell 9.3 percent in
June to an annual rate of 136,000 units after rising sharply in
May. But in the rest of the country, the housing boom continued
unabated. New starts rose 1.6 percent in the Midwest to 310,000,
8.9 percent in the South to 760,000, and 9.4 percent in the West
to 409,000.

<HEADLINE> India, U.S. End Third Round of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- India and the United States
ended here Tuesday morning their third round of talks primarily on
nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament without tangible
results.
</P>
<P>
Both sides admitted that differences persisted over
security-related issues but termed the talks as "constructive and
ongoing" and agreed to continue the dialogue process in Washington
in August.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation led by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott and the Indian side headed by the prime minister's special
envoy Jaswant Singh held a 90-minute meeting Tuesday morning
mainly to sum up the two-day discussions and to chart out the
broad agenda for the next round of talks, Indian officials said.
</P>
<P>
An American spokeswoman told reporters that both sides were
looking forward to areas of agreement and there has been steady
movement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has insisted that India should roll back or freeze its
nuclear weaponization and missile programs while India has made it
clear that this is not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. asked India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT) unconditionally and forthwith while India said it can not
sign so long as New Delhi is accorded the status of a nuclear
threshold state under the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from his meeting with Indian Prime Atal Bihari
Vajpayee Monday, Talbott told reporters that the two countries had
not yet reached a point that was conclusive, adding that "we have
a long way to go."
</P>
<P>
The American envoy conveyed Washington's desire to put
bilateral relations on a solid footing in the aftermath of India's
nuclear tests in May, said Talbott who arrived in New Delhi Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Bill Clinton's visit to India slated for
November this year was under review.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, who left for Islamabad Tuesday morning, delivered a
letter Monday from President Clinton to Vajpayee, the content of
which is unknown.
</P>
<P>
Talbott is the first high-ranking U.S. official to visit the
South Asian country since India conducted the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement
Monday, saying that Talbott's talks with Indian officials were
marked by a spirit of working together to find common ground and
to narrow gaps in their governments' respective perceptions.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that during his meeting with Talbott Monday,
Vajpayee was informed of the progress towards removal of problems
in Indo-U.S. relations which surfaced after India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"There is now a clearer understanding of each other's concerns
and certain steps in the direction of addressing those concerns
are contemplated," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
This is the third meeting between Talbott and Singh in less
than 40 days. His first two rounds of talks with Singh -- in
Washington on June 12 and in Frankfurt on July 9 -- reached no
concrete results.
</P>
<P>
The talks came ten days before the scheduled meeting between
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines of the three-day summit of
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in
Colombo beginning on July 29.
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. and India were reportedly keen on improving the
bilateral relations so as to save the plans of President Bill
Clinton to visit South Asian countries later this year.

<HEADLINE> Chirac's Support Rate Soars After World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac's
support rate has soared in the wake of France's victory in the
World Cup football tournament, according to a latest poll
published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's support rate now stands at 67 percent, seven points
more than last month, and that of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin now
stays at 65 percent, two points higher, said the poll conducted by
the BVA-Paris Match among 1,005 people from July 16 to 18.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Chirac to win more support than
Jospin since they began government cohabitation 13 months ago.
</P>
<P>
Chirac has won more support from the partisan fields of the
Green Party, the Socialist Party and his Gaullist RPR.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-seven percent of the people polled said that Chirac is
"very good" or "fairly good" as president, against 23 percent who
said the opposite.
</P>
<P>
The poll also shows that more French people now consider the
political cohabitation between the right and the left is a good
thing than before.

<HEADLINE> CIS Countries Join Hands to Fight Organized Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian law enforcement
official said here Tuesday that Russia and other countries of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) would work together in
the fight against organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Col. Vladimir Selivanov of the Interior Ministry told a press
briefing that organized criminal gangs, involved in money
laundering, drug trafficking, kidnapping, arms smuggling and car
theft, are rampant in Russia and other regions of the CIS.
</P>
<P>
He said a Russian mafia was active in the territories of 26
countries worldwide, especially in the United States, Germany,
Switzerland, Israel, Turkey and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Selivanov said illegal immigrants in Russia also aggravated the
situation. More than 8,000 crimes were committed by foreigners in
Russia in the first quarter of the year alone, an increase of 27
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
From July 6 to 9, interior officials from 13 former Soviet
republics met in Moscow to discuss measures against organized
crime and attempts by rich mafia to penetrate politics.
</P>
<P>
The conference was also attended by diplomats from local
embassies of Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, Vietnam, Italy, Finland
and Sweden, Selivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Participants to the conference agreed to strengthen cooperation
in fighting organized crime, establish a unified databank for such
crime and exchange information on the movement of leaders of
organized criminal gangs, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in the leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Saying safer schools are "central to the mission of renewing
America," President Bill Clinton Monday urged the nation's
second-largest teacher's union to help him promote greater use of
school uniforms, curfews and old-fashioned crackdowns on truancy.
</P>
<P>
-- House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (Republican from
Texas) Monday vowed an all-out effort to keep Congress from
approving any allocation more than 3.4 billion dollars for the
International Monetary Fund and, in a reversal, predicted he would
prevail.
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton will travel to Ireland and Northern
Ireland in September to celebrate and try to reinforce the
historic peace accord his administration helped negotiate earlier
this year, the White House announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- From Florida through Louisiana and Texas to Colorado, weeks
of incessant heat and drought are causing scores of deaths,
burned-out homes and withered crops. Although the numbers are
preliminary, local and state authorities blamed the heat for 117
deaths, including 81 in Texas, 22 in Louisiana and 11 in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton Administration and the Republican leadership are
bracing for another showdown over taxes and spending.
</P>
<P>
-- American and Indian officials held a round of talks to ease
the standoff that developed after India conducted underground
nuclear tests in May. But officials on both sides said there were
no breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Internet privacy legislation is expected to be urged Tuesday
in FTC testimony to Congress, a departure from the
administration's hands-off stance. The guidelines, among other
things, would require Web sites to tell consumers what data they
collect and how they are used.
</P>
<P>
-- SunTrust Banks is set to acquire Crestar for stock valued at
8.61 billion dollars, creating the nation's 10th-largest bank and
extending the consolidation of the U.S. bank industry.
</P>
<P>
USA Today:
</P>
<P>
-- With official attention in Washington riveted on the U.S.-
Mexican border, crime along the USA's undefended border with
Canada is climbing to levels surpassing the rum-running days of
Prohibition.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Tuesday described its
first day of talks with a high-level U.S. delegation led by Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott as "comprehensive and in-depth."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad, who is leading the Pakistani
side, and the U.S. deputy state secretary have made an "extensive
review of the entire range of security concerns and issues
including the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir," said a press
release issued by the Foreign Office after the meeting which
lasted more than three hours.
</P>
<P>
The discussions, which took place in a "friendly and positive
atmosphere," also focused on the post-nuclear test environment in
South Asia, the release said.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan understands the U.S. concerns over the increasing
threat of an arms race and escalation, and welcomes the U.S.
interest in preventing further deterioration of the security
situation in South Asia," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani side emphasized the need for the effective
engagement of major powers with the security issues and help
Pakistan and India solve their problems, it added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will continue their talks Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, who is on a two-day visit to Pakistan, arrived here
from New Delhi where he held similar talks with the Indian
leadership.
</P>
<P>
He will also call on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub Khan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Talbott's visit is part of the U.S. efforts to try to convince
Pakistan and India to sign the non-proliferation accords including
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
His current South Asian tour takes place a few days after the
Clinton Administration got broad authority to temporarily lift all
economic sanctions against Pakistan and India imposed following
their nuclear tests in May.

WUHAN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Torrential storms lasting from 5:00

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Tells U.N.: Turkey Violates Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has strongly protested to
the U.N. over the violations of its sovereign airspace by Turkish
military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Cyprus
Permanent representative to the U.N., Sotiris Zackheos, said
Turkish war planes violated Cyprus' airspace and Nicosia flight
information region (FIR) on July 10.
</P>
<P>
Zackheos protested strongly against "these new provocative acts
by Turkey, a member state of the U.N., against the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus," Cyprus News
Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said such intrusions broke international air traffic rules
and run against Security Council resolutions on Cyprus which state
that such overflights increase political tension on the island and
undermine efforts toward achieving a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
These acts, he added, "are in complete disregard of
international law, the U.N. Charter and the relevant decisions of
the organization on the question of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island has remained divided since
1974 when Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern
third in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Host Int'l Conference on Energy in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Experts from some 40 countries
will assemble here in October to discuss the role of renewable
energy technology (RET) in rural development, organizers said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the three-day conference starting October 12, the experts
are scheduled to disseminate successful RET undertaken in their
respective countries and exchange experiences and information.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they will identify ways on how to maintain closer
cooperation among the participating countries and explore the
existing engineering educational activities related to RET, the
organizers said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The conference is organized jointly by the Alternative Energy
Promotion Center under the Nepali Ministry of Science and
Technology, the Institute of Engineering of Tribhuvan University
and Nepal Solar Energy Society.
</P>
<P>
The conference secretariat has received 87 abstracts of papers
from 22 countries -- Bangladesh, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, India,
Israel, Japan, the Maldives, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua
New Guinea, Romania, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Thailand, Britain,
the United States, Vietnam, Zambia, France and Russia, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
But about 40 countries have been wishful to attend the
conference, the organizers told a press conference held here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There are gaps and bottlenecks to optimize the use of RET for
the benefit of rural people in Nepal, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The limited knowledge in the area of technology, policy and
program at implementation level is the major reason of
unsuccessful results in some RET-related areas, it added.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, the knowledge and experiences of the
participating countries/experts will certainly be useful for
solving at least some of the problems being faced in Nepal," it
said.
</P>
<P>
In Nepal, fuelwood accounts for 67.6 percent of the energy
consumed, leading to depleting forests in the country.
</P>
<P>
And fuelwood is used mainly for cooking in the country, said
Professor Jagan Nath Shrestha, president of Nepal Solar Energy
Society.
</P>
<P>
He told the press conference that such renewable energies as
micro hydro-power, biomass and solar energy have been used in
Nepal.

<HEADLINE> India to Import Currency Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
permitted the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to import a total of 3.6
billion pieces of printed bank notes as a measure to overcome the
shortage of the rupee notes in the country.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha Tuesday told Rajya Sabha, the
Upper House of Parliament, that the RBI would commence full
production of the notes by the end of the year and would be able
to produce 4.77 billion pieces of the notes.
</P>
<P>
He said in a written reply to Members of Parliament that the
production capacity of the government note-printing presses would
increase from 5.876 billion pieces to 8.3 million a year by the
end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar
depreciated from 39.48 one dollar in early April to 42.47 at the
end of June, dropping by about seven percent.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Legislators' Delegation Leave for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the Palestinian
Legislative Council (PLC) left for Washington Tuesday to discuss
with U.S. Congress members issues concerning the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
PLC Speaker Abu Ala, who is the head of the delegation, told
the Voice of Palestinian before departure that the visit is
important because this is the first PLC delegation visiting
Washington since the PLC coming into being in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"In reality, we look at the visit as important and I believe,
if God will be with us and the results are successive, the visit
will help improve the Palestine-U.S. relations," the Speaker said.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, we know that the U.S. Congress has a very
strong and biased relation with Israel. We hope to establish a
relationship with the U.S. Congress which will gradually develop
so that its members will turn to understand more about our people,
society, problems and our people's sufferings," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he will use this opportunity to tell the Congressmen
about the true picture of the Middle East peace process, about the
Palestinian positions in the peace talks with Israel and help them
have a more clear understanding about the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich visited Ramallah in May this
year and met with Abu Ala there.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two speakers promised to further
promote the relations between the lawmakers of the two sides and
Gingrich invited his Palestinian counterpart to visit
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Republic Prime Minister to Visit France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The prime minister of the Bosnian
Serb sub-state of Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodic, will start an
official visit to France Wednesday, announced the French Foreign
Ministry Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The visit by Dodic, who is invited by French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine, is aimed at continuing the contacts between France
and the Bosnian Serb authorities, said Foreign Ministry assistant
spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the Bosnian Serbs have chosen to cooperate
with the international community for the full application of the
Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
French officials will focus their talks with Dodic on the issue
of the return of displaced people, the running of the common
institutions of the two entities of Bosnia and the internal
situation of Republika Srpska which will hold its general
elections in September.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate the balance sheet of these six primary months of
the government (of Dodic) but we remain careful about the crucial
question of the return of refugees and displaced persons," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Only 20,000 displaced people have returned to Republika Srpska,
as against 120,000 to 140,000 first expected by the international
community.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAUNDA, July 21 (Xinhua)-- Angola needs 470,000 tons of grain
the 1998-99 agricultureal year to deal with the food crisis
facing the country.
</P>
<P>
A report made jointly by the U.N. Agriculture and Food
Organization and World Food Program said that due to the abundant
of rainfalls, Angola will yield 594,000 tons of grain this year,
an increase of 38 percent over the previous year. But due to poor
infranstructure and transportation, much grain was stranded in
some grain-producing areas, especially in the central highllands
where have been seen as Angola's "grain Barn", and couldn't reach
the areas where food is badly needed, the report added.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the report said, though Angola's food production
will incrase this year, the country still needs 120,000 tons of
food aid from the international community during the 1998-99
agricultural year. Of the 120,000 tons of food aid, 90,000 tons are
in emergency.
</P>
<P>
If the world food aid can'nt reach Angola in time, 750,000
Angolans will face serious food crisis this year.

Hurriyet (Freedom)

<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz announced Monday that
his government would dismiss 328 local officials with radical
ideas in light of a report prepared by Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The powerful military has long accused the Yilmaz
administration of not being firm on fighting the rapidly
expanding Islamic fundamentalism in the secular republic.

Seleznyov told a press conference in Ankara Monday that the S-300
missiles ordered by Cyprus are only for defensive purposes,
saying the missiles would be delivered to Cyprus late this year.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Seleznyov, Turkish Parliament Speaker
Hikmet Cetin stressed that "it is necessary to avoid attitudes
that will increase tensions and make the settlement of the
Cyprus issue more difficult."

<HEADLINE> Hamas Denies Link With Car Bombing Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Islamic group
Hamas denied Tuesday that it was connected with a suspected car
bombing attempt Sunday in Jerusalem, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted a Hamas spokesman as saying in Gaza that
Hamas "knew nothing about" the vehicle, a small van suspected by
Israeli police as a car bomb when what they called "dangerous
materials" were found on it.
</P>
<P>
The van caught fire Sunday on a main street in Jerusalem and
Israeli police rushing in to the rescue said that they found the
van was actually a car bomb. They claimed that a terror attack was
averted and Hamas was suspected to be behind the plot.
</P>
<P>
Both Palestinian security sources and Hamas activists raised
question Monday about the incident. They maintained that the
driver, who still remained unconscious in hospital after badly
burned, apparently had not intended to commit a suicide bombing.
</P>
<P>
The driver was heading into Jerusalem with materials required
for a construction job, they said. The van was loaded with gas
canisters, fuel oil and several dozen kilograms of nails. No
explosive was found.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem police, however, stood by their original
assessment: that the van was "definitely a car bomb." Police and
security forces were on high alert Monday in major cities, fearing
that terrorist groups might attempt to finish what they called the
botched terror attack.
</P>
<P>
Exactly one year ago on the Jewish calendar, a suicide bombing
killed 16 and injured hundreds of others in an open market in
Jerusalem. Hamas claimed responsibility for that attack.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday incident also happened just hours before the
Israelis and the Palestinians would hold their first high-level
talks in months. Sources said that the attempted attack was aimed
at preventing progress in the talks.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians to Reject Israeli Proposals: Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians will reject
Israeli proposals on its second redeployment during the next round
of direct talks later Tuesday, reliable Palestinian sources said.
</P>
<P>
Following consultation with Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat's office, the Palestinian negotiators have
decided to officially turn down the Israeli proposals during the
imminent third round of talks, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Israeli team proposed at the last
meeting that Israel carry out a 10 percent withdrawal and turn
the other 3 percent into "nature reserves," where no construction
(of Jewish settlements) will be permitted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel backed down from the demand that Arafat
convene the 460-member Palestinian National Council to reaffirm
the deletion of the clauses in the Palestinian Covenant that call
for Israel's destruction. They suggested that they agree to a
ratification of the changes by the smaller 100-member Palestinian
Liberation Organization Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli third round of talks will be held at a
kibbutz near Jerusalem where the second round was secretly held
Monday night. The discussions were aimed at reaching agreement on
an American initiative calling on Israel to withdraw from 13.1
percent more of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of the Palestinian intention to reject Israeli
proposals came amid reports that the Palestinians are prepared to
compromise on the issue of "natural reserve."
</P>
<P>
The talks which began Sunday were the first direct negotiations
between senior Palestinian and Israeli officials in months.
Israeli negotiators described the second round as "very good."
They said the Palestinians responded favorably to their proposals.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, however, have repeatedly emphasized that the
percentages in the American initiative were "non-negotiable."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Arrests 5 Palestinians for Spying for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese security forces have
arrested five members of the mainstream Palestinian faction Fatah
on charges of spying for Israel, the National Broadcast Network
radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They were suspected of being connected with a recently cracked
espionage ring of 77 Lebanese who gathered data for Israel about
Syrian troops in Lebanon, the Lebanese army and the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah (Party of God) guerrillas in south Lebanon, the radio
added.
</P>
<P>
Three of the Palestinians were arrested on Monday by
Lebanese police in the country's southern coastal city of
Sidon, and the two others, including a Fatah lieutenant, were
picked up by Palestinian military police in the Ein El-Hilweh
Palestinian camp in Sidon.
</P>
<P>
This was the third secret ring smashed by Lebanese security
apparatus in less than a month. The groups were all believed to be
linked with Israeli intelligence institutions.
</P>
<P>
Some 360,000 Palestinian refugees are living in 12 camps
across Lebanon. They have established a small society inside the
camps and have their own police in charge of the inner security.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the lieutenant had been handed over to the
Lebanese army while contacts were still under way to transfer the
others from the Palestinian police. The Fatah faction is led by
the Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Reinforcement of EC-ACP Partnership Calls for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Acting Head of the European
Commission (EC) delegation, Paul Malin Tuesday said the major aim
of future partnership with the African, Carribean and the Pacific
(ACP) states should be to contribute to a global policy of peace
and security.
</P>
<P>
Malin said the the EC had prepared proposals which aimed at
reinforcing the political dimension of European Union-ACP
relations.
</P>
<P>
"Promoting a stable and democratic political environment
conducive to fundamental freedom, the rule of law and good
governance are not only preconditions for the success of
development policies, but they also form an integral part of our
objectives," Malin said.
</P>
<P>
He was presenting a paper on the EU position on post-Lome
Convention negotiations at a workshop organized by the Southern
African Development Community in Harare, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Lome conventions are a set of trade arrangements signed in
1975 between ACP states and the EU.
</P>
<P>
The pact will expire in February 2000 and a negotiations for a
successor arrangement will begin in September.
</P>
<P>
Malin said, "We see the expiry of the Lome Convention as a
unique opportunity to rethink and fundamentally adapt our policy.
This convention is an important facet of the EU's external
policy."
</P>
<P>
He said the new partnership should prioritize conflict
prevention and seek ways of dealing with the underlying causes of
violent conflicts.
</P>
<P>
There was also need to refocus the partnership on the
elimination of poverty and to reform management of financial
cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU was also proposing a major innovative approach to trade
and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Under the Lome Convention, trade cooperation largely takes
the forms of preferential tariffs. In future, economic and trade
cooperation should consist of a more comprehensive set of
arrangements," Malin said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Chief Says Ready to Combat Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan said here Tuesday that the central bank was ready
to "resist vigorously" any threatened increase in inflation.
</P>
<P>
While delivering his mid-year report to the Senate Banking
Committee, Greenspan indicated that central bank policy-makers
were more concerned about a potential outbreak of inflation than
they were about the current dramatic slowdown in economic
activity.
</P>
<P>
"Given the current tightness in labor markets, the potential
for accelerating inflation is probably greater than the risk of
protracted, excessive weakness in the economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Even with his warnings about inflation risks, Greenspan gave no
indication that an increase in interest rates is imminent.
</P>
<P>
The testimony Tuesday stood in contrast to Greenspan's last
economic report to Congress, in February. At that time, the Fed
chairman said the risks appeared equally balanced between higher
inflation coming from the tight labor markets and greater economic
weakness coming from the fallout of the Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the U.S. economy has boomed, with overall output of
goods and services rising at an annual rate of 5.4 percent in the
first three months of the year. That surge of growth pushed
unemployment down to a 28-year-low 4.3 percent in the spring.
</P>
<P>
"As evidence piled up that the economy continued to run hot
during the winter, the Federal Reserve's concerns about
inflationary pressures mounted," Greenspan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Because of the strong growth and low unemployment, Greenspan
said that Fed policy-makers moved in March to a "state of
heightened alert against inflation."
</P>
<P>
The central bank has not changed interest rates since March
1997, when it boosted the federal funds rate by a quarter-point to
5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the past 16 months, the Fed has maintained the rates steady
as inflation has been well tamed. Consumer prices for the first
six months of this year, helped by plunging oil prices, have risen
at an annual rate of just 1.4 percent, even lower than the
11-year best of 1.7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan acknowledged that some economists were forecasting the
gross domestic product might have actually declined in the
just-completed April-June quarter, the first time that has
occurred since the end of the 1990-91 recession. But he said that
special factors were involved, including a need to work off a huge
increase in unsold goods from the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Even if the GDP rate dropped in the second quarter, it should
not be the cause for undue concern because, Greenspan said.
"Underlying trends in domestic final demand have remained strong,
imparting impetus to the continuing economic expansion," he added.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan also acknowledged in his testimony to Congress that
considerable uncertainty remained about effects of the Asian
crisis, especially with respect to spreading economic weakness in
Japan, the world's second-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
The Fed chief warned, "The risks of further adverse
developments in these economies remain substantial." He said Fed
policy-makers were aware that raising U.S. interest rates "could
have outsized effects on the very sensitive financial markets in
Asia, a development that could have substantial repercussions on
U.S. financial markets and, over time, on our own economy."

<HEADLINE> German Money Supply Registers Quick Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Germany's M3 money supply registered
a clear increase in June, expanding by an annual rate of 5.3
percent compared with the 4.4 percent recorded in May, the German
central bank Bundesbank announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The M3 money supply, the broad measure of money circulating in
the economy, serves as the German central bank's key indicator of
the country's inflation trends, which could influence its
decisions on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Despite the latest increase, experts said they did not expect
an interest rate hike in Germany because the M3 growth rate was
still within the target range of 3 to 6 percent set by the
Bundesbank for this year.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank said that the money supply expansion in June was
boosted by higher borrowings by the public sector.

to participate in a dialog for the solution to the Cyprus
problem, based on U.N. resolutions, at any time," Kasoulides
told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace talks hit a snag last July after Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out of the U.N.-sponsored
peace talks with Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides to protest
against an EU decision to start accession talks with the
Clerides-led Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has said he will not participate in intercommunal
peace talks unless his breakaway entity in northern part of the
island is recognized and Cyprus withdraws its application to join
the EU.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Cypriot government's invitation to Turkish
Cypriots to participate in the EU negotiations, Kasoulides said
that despite the negative developments in efforts to settle the
Cyprus problem "we are ready to talk to them, if they accept
President Clerides' invitation."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus opened accession talks with the EU in March 1998, but
the Turkish Cypriot side has turned down an invitation from
Clerides to nominate representatives in the official negotiating
team.
</P>
<P>
On security matters, Kasoulides underlined the government's
concern for security, but said it would never take measures that
would lead to tension or are beyond its legal rights.
</P>
<P>
He noted that U.S. State Department Special Coordinator for
Cyprus, Thomas Miller, is expected to discuss security issues
during his brief Cyprus trip beginning on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and some EU countries have criticized Cypriot
government's decision to buy Russian-made surface-to-air S-300
missiles in a bid to boost its air defenses.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to strike the missiles if they are
deployed, but the Cypriot government has said that it would not
cancel the missile plan unless progress is made in resuming the
stalled peace talks and on its proposal for demilitarizing the
island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of short-lived pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained a 35,000-strong forces in Northern
Cyprus, which was declared unilaterally in 1983 by Turkish
Cypriots as a breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus",
recognized only by Ankara.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, Julys 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) is earning more and more from international
computer technology services although its sales of computers and
software have been hurt by the Asian economic slump.
</P>
<P>
IBM, best known as a company making computers and software,
reported late Monday that its revenue from the global services
unit increased by 22 percent in the second quarter. The unit has
been helping larger corporations set up computer systems and
networks worldwide.
</P>
<P>
As dispensing high-tech advice has become an increasingly
important money-maker for the world's computer giant, IBM was less
hurt by slower sales of personal computer, price wars in computer
chips and reduced consumer demand for products in a wave of Asian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Overall, IBM said that its profits were flat in the second
quarter. The results slightly beat Wall Street forecasts.
</P>
<P>
IBM's stock rose 6.8 percent, or 8.25 U.S. dollars per share,
to 130.25 U.S. dollars on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday
morning.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Budget Deficit Down to 0.9 Pct in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch national budget deficit
in 1997 accounted for 0.9 percent of the gross domestic product,
lower than the forecast made this March, it was announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Statistics Netherlands in the National Accounts reported
that the 1997 government's budget deficit declined to 0.9 percent,
from 2 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
It was the lowest level since 1977, the statistical bureau
said.
</P>
<P>
The March deficit forecast of 1.4 percent enabled the
Netherlands to meet the criteria for entry into the European
Economic and Monetary Union or better known as the single currency
mechanism, euro.
</P>
<P>
Lower interest rates, the Statistics Netherlands claimed, were
the chief reason behind the fall in the deficit while at 3.6
percent, the rate of economic growth in the country was well above
the average of the 15-nation European Union, which was also part
of the reason for the decline.
</P>
<P>
The union-wide economic growth was at 2.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Exports, especially of chemicals and metal products, made the
biggest contribution to the acceleration in growth last year.
</P>
<P>
But the statistical bureau admitted that Dutch households drew
less benefit from the economic growth than did the government and
business community despite the fact that interest and profit
distributions received from abroad reached record levels.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Military Ready to Go Back to Barricks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian military, which has ruled
the most populous African country for more than a decade, is "really
and very prepared" to go back to the barricks, a presidency spokesman
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
David Attah, Chief Press Secretary to the head of state, made the
remarks in the capital Abuja one day after General Abdulsalam Abubakar
announced that the military government will handover power to an
elected civilian president next May.
</P>
<P>
The press secretary refuted the speculation that some members of
the military do not want to go back to the barracks while others think
the army is the only institution that can keep Nigeria together.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that is the correct reflection of the situation in
the military today," Attah said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the military believes "it's about time they went back to
the barracks. It's not just physical movement. It is equally
psychological. They are really and very well prepared for this."
</P>
<P>
They also believe that the wind of change that is blowing across
Nigeria is very positive, he said, adding: "The prospect of the future
society of Nigeria is very great."
</P>
<P>
The press secretary also dismissed the saying that the announcement
of the military's new transition to civil rule program by General
Abubakar is simply a case of making the best out of the bad job.
</P>
<P>
"It's more than making the best out of a situation as some of the
policies initiated are very profound in the meaning of significance,"
Attah said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, broad consultations have been held involving
every one without conflict before arriving at such major decisions,
including the release of all political prisoners, the dissolution of
the political parties and transitional institution set up before
Abubakar and the cancelation of all elections.
</P>
<P>
Currently the interantional response to the new transition program
is generally positive while there are mixed reactions among Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
Some politicians welcome the new timetable while others insist that
Abacha keep to the October 1 this year deadline set by his predecessor
General Sani Abacha.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Labor Party to Motion for Early Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition Labor Party
will present a bill to the Knesset (parliament) next Wednesday
calling for early general elections.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Israel Radio, the move was announced
by Labor whip Micha Goldman on Tuesday after his meeting with
Knesset Speaker Dan Tichon.
</P>
<P>
This came after threats by several ruling coalition partners to
oust Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over a U.S. proposal on the
next redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Goldman said that before next Wednesday, the last day of the
Knesset summer session, it would be clear whether an agreement
with the Palestinians would be reached on the further withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Then the coalition parties should redeem their pledges and
topple the current government for holding early elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian negotiators restarted their direct talks on
Sunday after the peace process has been stalled for months due to
Israel's intransigent policy.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who had been resisting the U.S. proposal calling for
a 13 percent Israeli pullback, now wants to reach an agreement
with the Palestinians on something watered down under
international pressure.
</P>
<P>
The right wing in the Netanyahu government, however, rejected
any yield to pressure. Rafael Eitan, the Tzomet Party leader,
warned Monday that the government would be brought down if the
scope of the second redeployment would be more than 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, the dovish Third Way Party has also threaten
that the party would leave the coalition government if no progress
was made in the negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Netanyahu government has only a slim majority of 61
in the 120-seat Knesset. The departure of any coalition member
will force his government to step down.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Yemen, Saudi Arabia to Avoid Escalation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Expressing regret over the border
conflict between Yemen and Saudi Arabia, Jordan Tuesday urged the
sides to exercise restraint to avoid escalating the tension.
</P>
<P>
The problems between Yemen and Saudi Arabia should be solved
through "dialog and understanding" instead of the use of military
force, Information Minister Abdullah Ensour said after a regular
Cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet decided to entrust Foreign Minister Jawad Anani
with the task of holding contacts with the concerned parties to
monitor the developments in the border conflict, Anani added.
</P>
<P>
Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh Monday accused Saudi naval
ships of shelling its Red Sea island Duwaima, in which three
Yemeni guards were killed and nine others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The conflict on the Duwaima island, off the coastal area
marking the Yemeni-Saudi Arabian border, was only the latest in a
series of territorial disputes between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Yemen have been locked in border disputes since
1934. The tension was eased in 1995 when Sanaa and Riyadh signed a
Memorandum of Understanding in which they agreed to conduct
negotiations to solve the border demarcation.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Rebels Condemned for Breaking Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan National Congress
(parliament) passed a resolution here Tuesday, condemning the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), for
irresponsible attitude in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The resolution forwarded by the ruling People's Liberation
Movement of Angola passed with 112 votes for, 59 against and two
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that what UNITA has been doing in the
country was to undermine the effort of the government for peace,
create discontent and chaos in the society, and seize power by
forces in the end.
</P>
<P>
UNITA Chairman, Jonas Savimbi, should take full responsibility
for all the consequences, the resolution said, adding that the
war UNITA is provoking, would delay the planned national
development programs and bring fresh disasters to the people.
</P>
<P>
The resolution suggested that actions be taken home and abroad
to keep the current armed conflicts from spreading further and
guarantee the practice of democracy and laws for the peaceful
life and national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also urged the international community to offer
continued aid to Angola and prevent UNITA from waging a new war.
</P>
<P>
Peace is the precondition for development of the rich
resources in the country, the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
Loao Lourenco, Chairman of the ruling party's delegation to
parliament, said in the debate over the resolution that the
approval of the resolution does not mean a declaration of war, as
UNITA has already fighting in the country, recapturing 68 cities
and towns, and rendering 150,000 people into refugees.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Manufacturing, Mining Sectors Operate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Studies show that between 72
percent and 73 percent of Zimbabwe's manufacturing and mining
firms, operated below capacity in the first four months of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistical Office (CSO) Tuesday said although the
trend showed an improvement in business sentiment compared with
the previous survey done in December last year, companies in the
two sectors, Zimbabwe's key economic sectors, indicated
lower intentions to invest this year.
</P>
<P>
"Negative balances of 26 percent and 75 percent for firms in
manufacturing and mining respectively indicated that their order
books were below normal," the CSO said.
</P>
<P>
"Firms in manufacturing and mining indicated that they had a
drop in orders and deliveries for both the home and export
markets in the four months ending April 1998," it said, adding
that the trend was likely to continue until August.
</P>
<P>
Employment levels in manufacturing and mining also dropped as
weak demand on both domestic and export markets, as well as
cash-flow difficulties, continued to be major constraints
affecting industry.
</P>
<P>
A total of 164 companies out of 204 firms approached responded
to the CSO survey.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's business sector is struggling to survive high
interest rates in the region of 40 percent, rising inflation, an
unstable currency and a weak domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said gross domestic product growth will be 2.5
percent this year compared with 3.7 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Warns: No Longer Accept U.N. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraq warned on Tuesday that it can
no longer accept the U.N. sanctions, Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The warning was announced at Tuesday's joint meeting of the
powerful Revolution Command Council and the ruling Baath Party,
chaired by President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The joint meeting warned that Iraq can no longer accept that
the United States or U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on
disarmament in Iraq) "uses flimsy, minor or fabricated pretext as
covers to mar Iraq's position and distract the attention of the
public opinion with the end of prolonging the sanctions."
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed Iraq's relationship with the
U.N. Security Council and UNSCOM in the light of Saddam's speech
on the 30th anniversary of July 17-30 Revolution and the open
letter to the U.N. Security Council and the secretary-general on
May 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
In a nationally broadcast speech on the 30th anniversary of
July 17-30 revolution, the Iraqi president vowed to have the
U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait lifted
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Saddam, in that speech, also mentioned the open letter
addressed to the U.N. Security Council and the secretary-general,
which demanded immediate lifting of trade embargo as a prelude to
lift the overall sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Iraq will consider "alternative strategy" if its
cooperation with UNSCOM can not bring about the lifing of
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday meeting also announced that "the fact that all that
has been implemented by Iraq of requirements under Security
Council resolution 687 (on disarmament in Iraq) over a span of
more than seven years necessitate the immediate lifting of the
sanctions."
</P>
<P>
The joint meeting also warned that anyone, "with the intention
of obstructing the lifting of sanctions or prolonging them would
be met with firm opposition by the people and leadership of Iraq,"
adding "Iraqi leadership will continue watching the situation and
will take the appropriate action to handle it."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership issued this stern warning just after
UNSCOM announced that its head Richard Butler would visit Baghdad
early next month to hold talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
During his last Baghdad trip in June, Butler and the Iraqi
side agreed upon a working program for two months. Butler said in
Baghdad that "the light at the end of tunnel (of disarmament) is
more visible" than ever before.
</P>
<P>
However, it was reported that an American army laboratory had
found traces of deadly VX gas on some remnant of Iraqi missile
warheads. Butler also said he had no doubt about the findings.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has admitted experimenting with VX gas, but denies it
ever deployed the gas in weapons.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Denies Role in Forming Unity Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
Tuesday denied reports that he is working for the formation of a
unity government in a bid to achieve peace with the Palestinians,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted President Office Director Arie Shumel as
saying that Weizman will welcome the establishment of a unity
government but will not involve in the negotiations for that aim.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Weizman has been in contact with
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition Labor leader Ehud
Barak in recent days over the issue.
</P>
<P>
On Monday Weizman was quoted as saying that a unity government
could advance the peace talks with the Palestinians and "prevent
tragedy." The right wing Likud coalition government under
Netanyahu has seemed unable to proceed with the peace process
which started seven years ago under the Labor government.
</P>
<P>
As the post of the president in Israel is only ceremonial,
Weizman has been criticized by some politicians for his outspoken
remarks on the political process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian negotiators restarted their direct talks on
Sunday for the first time since the peace process was stalled
months ago over Israel's intransigent policies in settlement
construction and further troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The hardline right-wingers in Netanyahu's government have
stanchly rejected a U.S. peace initiative, which calls on Israel
to hand over another 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The formation of a unity government was seen an option for
Israel to adopt a resolution on the withdrawal and reach a peace
agreement with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Complains About Delay in Spare Parts Delivery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 21 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi oil official complained
Tuesday about the delay by foreign companies in delivering the
badly-needed spare parts for its oil sector.
</P>
<P>
General Director of Planning and Studying Department of the Oil
Ministry Falih Hasan Marhon said that although Iraq had signed 70
contracts valued at 70 million U.S. dollars with foreign firms to
import spare parts, no spare parts had been delivered so far.
</P>
<P>
Under the fourth phase of oil-for-food deal approved by the
United Nations, Iraq is allowed to export 5.2 billion dollars
worth of oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies
for its suffering people.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq has repeatedly said that it cannot meet the export
target due to the severe lack of spare parts in its oil sector and
the sharp decline of oil prices on world markets.
</P>
<P>
At the suggestion of a U.N. team of oil experts, the
U.N. Security Council allowed Iraq to import 300 million dollars
worth of oil spare parts to increase its oil production and
exporting capacity.
</P>
<P>
Marhon said that the 300 million dollars cannot meet even the
minimum need of its oil sector, which has been badly effected by
the eight-year crippling U.N. economic sanctions imposed in 1990
after its invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Oversupply Threatening Tea Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Over-production of tea is
threatening to push the price of the crop down on the world
market, United Kingdom-based tea council chief executive Illtyd
Lewis said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lewis said tea had the potential to seek three times more than
its current average price but there was need to keep a check on
production levels to prevent oversupply.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing journalists at a news conference here in
Harare.
</P>
<P>
At the moment world tea production stands at 2.5 million tons
per year while the average price is between 1.94 U.S. Dollars and
2.22 U.S. Dollars per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
"Although the surplus has been small over the last 10 years at
an average of 100,000 tons per annum, this still has the
potential to depress the price of tea which is very volatile," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to keep production levels at reasonable figures to
keep the demand for tea high," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that tea was facing stiff competition from carbonated
soft drinks, a trend which also threatened the viability of the
crop.
</P>
<P>
The food agricultural organisation in conjuction with the tea
council have embarked on a 200,000 U.S. Dollar campaign to
promote tea as a healthy drink in a bid to keep demand high, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The)dda council is a non-profit making organisation sponsored
by governments of all countries exporting tea to the U.K.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Wide media coverage and concerted
efforts by government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
on reproductive health has put Malawi among twenty three top
Sub-Saharan African countries, a Malawian minister said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Malawian Minister of State in the office of the president and
cabinet responsible for human resource, management and
development, Edda Chitalo said this upon her return from Port
Louis, Mauritius where she had attended a conference for female
ministers and parliamentarians in Sub-Saharan Africa on
reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
Malawi News Agency quoted Chitalo as saying that the week-long
conference in Mauritius had been convened to review the
implementation of what the countries in the region have embarked
upon in terms of reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
"The conference was aimed at looking at the progress female
parliamentarians are making to assist women in reproductive
health," Chitalo said, adding that the conference also drew up a
declaration on women, reproductive health and rights.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the Malawian female minister said, the
participants agreed in principle to act on a program to help
girls to avoid early marriages and also to sensitize them on
their rights concerning marriage.
</P>
<P>
Women should exercise their rights of the freedom to marry,
whom to marry and also decide how many children they are to bear,
Chitalo said, adding that "such a domain should not be a monopoly
of men."
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Malawi won applause at the conference
for its efforts in the field of reproductive health which has
been tremendously successful because of the joint efforts by the
government and other NGOs.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from reproductive health, the Malawian government was
also hailed for its tireless efforts in the promotion of girls'
attainment of basic literacy education," Chitalo added.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Aqaba Airport to Lift Limitation on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The airport in Jordan's Red Sea port
city of Aqaba will soon start to accept passengers of different
nationalities and allow them to travel to either Aqaba, Amman or
the Israeli city of Eilat.
</P>
<P>
"After three years of heated arguments, we managed to convince
the Israelis that carrying passengers of different nationalities
would not be dangerous for Israel's national security," the
semi-official Jordan Times Tuesday quoted Director General of
Jordanian Civil Aviation's Jasser Zayyad as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed an agreement with Israel on the joint operation
of the Aqaba airport in August 1997, allowing international
flights to Eilat to use the Aqaba airfield. This was aimed at
easing the over-crowding of the Israeli airport at Eilat, a
booming tourism city situated just across the Jordanian border.
</P>
<P>
But the old agreement only permitted passengers of certain
nationalities destined for Israel to transit the airport.
</P>
<P>
By opening Aqaba and Amman to passengers transiting the
airport, Jordan wants not only to collect landing fees, but also
to encourage passengers to come to Jordan as well, said Zayyad
during his meeting with a visiting Israeli aviation delegation.
</P>
<P>
"The new terms of the agreement will help boost the tourism in
Aqaba and create more jobs in the port city," said Zayyad.
</P>
<P>
Zayyad also urged the Israelis to allow an increase in
passenger capacity and frequency of cargo flights between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Further subcommittees from both sides will meet to discuss the
implementation of the new terms of the agreements in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Israel used to divert three flights a week to the Aqaba
airport, but with the implementation of the new terms, the number
will be decreased to one each week.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's 1st New Party Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Less than 24 hours after the
Nigerian military administration scrapped former political
parties for new ones to come for fresh elections, the first party
was launched here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Advance Movement (DAM) was launched by a
Lagos-based lawyer and politician Tuesday morning, prior to the
announcement by the to-be-constituted electoral commission of
guidelines for the formation of parties.
</P>
<P>
The organizer whose name was yet unavailable said that he had
formed the party and picked the date for the launching before
Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar made his nationally
televised address Monday night.
</P>
<P>
In the eight-page broadcast speech which took 40 minutes,
Abubakar announced the shift of date of the military's hand-over
to civilian rule from October 1 this year to May 29 next year.
</P>
<P>
He also announced the dissolution of the five registered
parties and transition institutions set up under his predecessor
late General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
All elections which had been conducted on the basis of the
parties and institutions were also cancelled.
</P>
<P>
According to Abubakar, an independent electoral commission
will be constituted soon to supervise the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
International response to Abubakar's new transition program is
generally positive so far, while there are mixed reactions among
Nigerian politicians.

<HEADLINE> Old Houses Force Zanzibar Government to Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 21 (Xinhua) - The Zanzibar government is
seeking funds to remove its headquarters from the centuries-old
houses in the famous Stone Town to a new place, sources from
Zanzibar said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of State in the Chief Minister's Office, Iddi
Pandu Hassan, was quoted by the sources as addressing the House
of Representatives on Monday that the move to build new buildings
for the government headquarters at the Chuini area, a few
kilometers from the Stone Town, was aimed at abandoning the
dilapidated buildings.
</P>
<P>
"Almost all buildings housing public offices in the Stone Town
have been built before the 19th century and most of them are on
the verge of collapse due to lack of repair for a long time,"
Hassan said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that several workers of the Communications and
Transport Ministry cheated death a few month ago when their
offices, which are in a state of disrepair, sagged.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the government will look for temporary
alternative offices to protect its assets and staff.
</P>
<P>
Lying in the west of the Indian Ocean and 40 kilometers off
the mid-Tanzanian coast, Zanzibar consists of Unguja, its sister
island Pemba and dozens of small isles.
</P>
<P>
It is famous for the Stone Town with Arab style, the widely
planted cloves and the clear and smooth beaches.

<HEADLINE> Russian, German Defense Chiefs Discuss Kosovo, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The defense ministers of Russia and
Germany Tuesday called for a political settlement to the Kosovo
conflict that is threatening to spill over the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and his German
counterpart, Volker Ruehe, held an informal meeting in the Russian
resort city of Sochi, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev described the talks as successful and constructive,
adding that "in the course of the meeting our positions became
closer."
</P>
<P>
The two discussed implementation of understandings on
cooperation of defense and defense technology, Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
The views of Moscow and Bonn on Kosovo largely coincide, but
Germany has "its own accents," Ruehe said.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a region in the Yugoslav republic of Serbia. Ethnic
Albanians, which account for 90 percent of the total population
there, are seeking independence.
</P>
<P>
Armed clashes between militant Albanians and the Yugoslav
security forces have resulted in dozens of deaths.
</P>
<P>
Tension increased over the weekend when the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA), the armed wing of the Albanian separatists, tried to
storm a police station in Orahovac and capture its first town in
the five-month conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe said neither Serbia nor the ethnic Albanians can maintain
the status quo in Kosovo on their own.
</P>
<P>
Both Russia and Germany are members of the five-nation Contact
Group seeking peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The Russian defense minister said developments in Kosovo
threaten peace in the Balkans and reinforcements for the KLA are
arriving.
</P>
<P>
"This jeopardizes attempts to settle the conflict," Sergeyev
said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin hinted Tuesday that Moscow would not object if
a political party representing the KLA took part in negotiations
with the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said "Russia's conviction that it is
political parties that should represent the Kosovo Albanians at
negotiations with Belgrade remains unchanged," Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Congressmen, Business Urge Congress for Renewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Some congressmen and small
American business Tuesday urged Congress to vote for China's
renewed Most-Favored Nation (MFN) trading status.
</P>
<P>
Representative Philip M. Crane, chairman of the House Committee
on Ways and Means, told a press conference on the Capitol Hill,
"Normal trade with China is the right policy for America and the
best way to expand democratic values and freedom for the Chinese
people."
</P>
<P>
The House is scheduled to vote Wednesday on President Bill
Clinton's decision to renew China's MFN for another year. Clinton
informed Congress of his determination in early June.
</P>
<P>
"Trade with China is also the right policy for hundreds of
thousands of American families and jobs," Crane told the press
conference sponsored by the powerful U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, representing more than 3 million
businesses and organizations, released a report at the conference
entitled "Small Business Success Stories in China" one day before
the House vote.
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud to be with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to highlight
how U.S.-China trade has helped American small business," said
Crane, who is from the state of Illinois where over 1 billion U.S.
dollars of products were exported to China last year.
</P>
<P>
He added that the timing of this vote is "critical in light of
the Asian economic crisis." "We must reassure our friends in that
region that America will not turn its back at this sensitive
stage."
</P>
<P>
Representative Calvin Dooley from California also expressed
support for the renewal of China's MFN, believing that both
peoples of the United States and China benefit from a normal trade
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Dooley's home state earned more than 2.27 billion dollars from
exports to China in 1997. He said that it is important to continue
the trade ties and contribute to financial stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Willard Workman, chamber vice president for international
policy, introduced several small business representatives at the
press conference, calling them "prime examples of the successes
resulting from continued trade with China."
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, American companies of all sizes and the workers they
employ have a stake in the expansion of China trade. Last year
alone, the U.S. exported 12.8 billion dollars in goods and
services to China, supporting thousands of high-wage American
jobs," said Workman.
</P>
<P>
He urged the congressmen to "remember these small businesses
around the country that have invested people, time and capital
into building a trade relationship with China."
</P>
<P>
It is said that some 30 percent of the U.S. exports to China
were conducted by the small businesses in 1997. Their business
volume doubled in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the vote in Congress would be affected by the alleged
political contribution and possible satellite technology transfer
to China, Crane said that the allegations have to prove factual.
</P>
<P>
Representative Dooley believed that President Clinton's recent
visit to China has eased much of the people's anxiety.
</P>
<P>
Workman predicted that the voting result would be of little
difference from the 259-173 of last year because the people have
been alerted to the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Congressmen "must remember that the people are going to
choose their congressional representatives later this year," he
told Xinhua after the press conference, referring to the mid-term
congressional election scheduled in November.

<HEADLINE> Britain Unveils Crime Reduction Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The British government Tuesday
unveiled plans to spend 250 million pounds (some 410 million U.S.
dollars) over the next three years on a crime reduction strategy.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw told parliament that the plans "will
be the first time a centrally coordinated program of such
magnitude... has been put in place anywhere in the world."
</P>
<P>
The program is based on a survey by officials at Straw's
ministry of the methods that work around the world in reducing
crime and disorder.
</P>
<P>
Straw said crime had been rising at an underlying rate of 5
percent a year in Britain since the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
"Increases in crime have, to many, appeared inexorable.... The
assumption has been that nothing works, that nothing could be done
to reverse this long-term rise in crime. I disagree," Straw said.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office was allocated an extra 3 billion pounds (4.92
billion dollars) early this month by the Finance Ministry over the
next three years in anti-crime push in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Straw, the program will tackle the social causes
of crime, target crime "hot spots" and work to combat repeated
attacks on victims.
</P>
<P>
It will also focus on burglary and on work with offenders to
cut re-offending.
</P>
<P>
The police would get an extra 1.2 billion pounds (1.968 billion
dollars) over three years, and the Probation Service is to get an
extra 127 million pounds (208.28 million dollars), Straw said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) launched a
joint initiative here Tuesday to help the developing countries
within the WTO meet year-2000 commitments on intellectual
property.
</P>
<P>
With less than a year and a half away from the January 1, 2000
deadline, the two organizations hope to help provide technical
cooperation for the developing countries to conform with the WTO
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
(TRIPS) on time.
</P>
<P>
The forms of technical cooperation that are available include
assistance in preparing legislation, training, institution
building, and modernization of intellectual property systems and
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
This process involves bringing the laws on copyright, patents,
trademarks and other areas of intellectual property in the
developing countries in line with the TRIPS agreement, and
providing for effective enforcement of these laws in order to deal
with piracy, counterfeit goods and other forms of intellectual
property infringements.
</P>
<P>
Each of the developing countries concerned will be informed of
the WTO/WIPO joint initiative. The aim is for the WIPO and the
WTO, together with the countries requesting assistance, and donor
countries, to maximize the use of available resources in the
coming critical period by improved planning and coordination of
technical cooperation activities.

MOSCOW, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Four members of the U.N. observer
mission in Tajikistan were shot in cold blood rather than killed

</P>
<P>
The assertion was included in a mission report circulated

<HEADLINE> Egypt Starts Land Reclamation Via Huge Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has embarked on several huge
projects to turn its uninhabited deserts into a valuable source of
energy, food and dwelling space for a surging population in the
coming century.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri
Tuesday before the Major National Projects Committee of the ruling
National Democratic Party (NDP).
</P>
<P>
"The aim of these mammoth national projects in various parts of
Egypt is to increase the inhabited area in the coming 20 years to
27.5 percent (of the whole land) compared to no more than 5
percent at present," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among these projects is the cultivation of altogether 1.678
million feddans (704,760 hectares), respectively at Toshka in the
southern desert, in the areas along Al Salam canal in the
northeast, in the Dakhla and Kharga oases in the Western Desert,
and in the northwestern desert area along the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
The canal being built at the Toshka area is designed to pump 5
billion cubic meters of water a year from Lake Nasser into the
Western Desert to bring 1 million feddans (420,000 hectares) under
cultivation in several decades.
</P>
<P>
Uninhabited deserts account for some 95 percent of Egypt's 1
million square kilometers, of which only 35,189 square kilometers,
that is 3.6 percent are populated.
</P>
<P>
The pinch of a dwindling share of resources is acutely felt as
the population which is over 60 million, is growing at the rate of
2.1 percent per year at which it can be expected to double every
30 years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Exploring Alternative Way for Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Tuesday
it was exploring the possibility of trying two Libyans suspected
of the Lockerbie explosion in a third country before a Scottish
judge and under Scottish procedures.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters that the
United States still insisted that the two Libyan men "must face
justice before British or Scottish courts," but said it was
considering whether a trial could be held in a third country under
Scottish procedures and before a Scottish judge.
</P>
<P>
In effect, Rubin said, the venue would still be a Scottish
court. "If it were in another location, it is still a Scottish
court. The point is to bring them to justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin was speaking at a briefing after Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
spoke to 11 relatives of 270 victims of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am
flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
According to a relative called Rosemary Wolf, Albright and
Berger had told them "they were exploring options that would lead
to a Scottish, not an international, trial with Scottish judges
and Scottish law, in another country."
</P>
<P>
"They are talking to the Dutch to discuss conditions for a
Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands, but there has been no
resolution of this," she said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin confirmed that Washington had not made decision whether
it would take any practical alternative way other than its
position to try the two Libyans in Britain or the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We have been exploring alternative ways to bring the suspects
to justice," he said. "So far, we haven't found any practical
alternatives to a trial in the United States or Scotland."

<HEADLINE> Zambia Will Not Reintroduce Forex Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Zambia Tuesday
reiterated that it will not reintroduce foreign exchange control
and assured investors that stability in the country's financial
market will soon be achieved, Zambia National Broadcasting
Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's governor Jacob Mwanza said in his official
opening speech at a one-day bond market workshop in Lusaka that
investors should not be frightened with the unstable foreign
currency flows in the country because the problem will be
overcome.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has no intention to reverse the
liberalization policies being pursued, he said, adding that the
central bank will continue with its monetary policies which are
already showing signs of growth.
</P>
<P>
Mwanza explained that the falling copper prices coupled with
dwindling donor funding are responsible for the shortage of forex
in the Zambian market.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said once the mines are privatised and donor
funding inflows stabilised, there will be enough forex in the
country to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, copper prices have kept falling in the
world market, which is attributable to the acute shortage of
forex in Zambia since it depends heavily on the traditional
copper export.
</P>
<P>
Mwanza challenged the financial sector to come up with
financial managment styles that will suit the changing global
financial market and the needs of local investors.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Talks Prove Tough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The second round of Burundi
peace talks started Tuesday in Arusha in north Tanzania, but
negotiations of conflicting parties, lasting three hours in the
morning, proved to be tough.
</P>
<P>
The bone of contention was whether the issue of "nature of the
conflict in Burundi" should be discussed at the plenary session
or at sub-committee level, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Sources attending the meeting, chaired by Tanzania's former
president Julius Nyerere, said that the Burundian government
officials at the peace talks are of the opinion that the issue
should be handled by a sub-committee and its proposals be
forwarded to the plenary session whereas the armed groups --
CNDD, FROLINA and PALIPEHUTU wanted it to be directly discussed
at the plenary session.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, the international mediator on Burundi, adjourned the
meeting to allow leaders of all warring parties to discuss the
issue among themselves and propose their positions when plenary
session resumes on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen parties are taking part in the talks aimed at ending
a bitter ethnic conflict in which more than 150,000 people have
died since October 1993 in a series of bloody conflicts between
the Tutsi-dominated army and rebels who claim to represent the
country's Hutu majority.

<HEADLINE> New Chairman At LIFFE Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Brian Williamson, chairman of
Gerrard Group plc, has been appointed the new chairman of the
London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange
(LIFFE).
</P>
<P>
The Board of the LIFFE confirmed the three-year appointment at
a meeting Tuesday. The appointment takes effect on 3 August.
</P>
<P>
It was also announced at a press conference that Daniel Hodson,
the LIFFE's chief executive since 1993, has decided to leave the
exchange.
</P>
<P>
The current deputy chief executive, John Foyle, will become
acting chief executive until a new appointment is made.
</P>
<P>
Williamson said of his appointment, "I believe that the
challenges faced by LIFFE, for example, the advent of electronic
trading and increased competition, are placing more and more
demands on the chairman. I am, therefore, giving up my
chairmanship of Gerrard Group."
</P>
<P>
The new chairman was confident that the challenges can be
successfully met and that the LIFFE can become more competitive
and can deliver a first-class product to the benefit of its
customers and members.
</P>
<P>
Williamson said, "The exchange must continue to play a full
part in maintaining and growing international business in the City
of London to ensure that it remains the pre-eminent international
financial center."

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: No Evidence to Support CNN Allegations on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A Pentagon review has found no
evidence to support allegations by CNN and Time magazine that U.S.
troops used sarin nerve gas during a 1970 operation in Laos to
hunt down American defectors, Defense Secretary William Cohen said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The allegations were made during a report on "Operation
Tailwind" broadcast by CNN on June 7, followed by an article in
Time magazine under the bylines of two CNN employees. But by early
July, the network retracted the story.
</P>
<P>
"We studied scores of documents about 'Operation Tailwind,' and
conducted interviews with soldiers and officials at all levels of
command," Cohen said in a statement. "We found no evidence to
support the CNN/Time assertions on defectors or the use of sarin
nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
"No document -- military order, after-action report, briefing
paper or official military history -- mentions pursuit of U.S.
defectors as Tailwind's mission. While sarin was stored in Okinawa
in 1970, we found no evidence sarin nerve gas was ever sent to or
used in Vietnam or Laos," Cohen said at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
In its June 7 report, CNN alleged U.S. Special Forces troops
were put into Laos to locate and kill American defectors. It said
the troops destroyed a village and killed American defectors as
well as enemy troops and civilians. U.S. aircraft dropped the
sarin gas to suppress the enemy as the Americans were to be taken
from the scene by helicopter, the CNN report alleged.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon study said the operation was launched as a
reconnaissance mission "to engage the enemy and to divert enemy
attention" from an offensive mission designed to gain control of
terrain in Laos.
</P>
<P>
"No records or personal recollections were discovered to
suggest that targeting U.S. defectors played any part in the
operation," the report said.
</P>
<P>
On the allegations of sarin use, the report noted that U.S.
policy since World War II had been to prohibit the use of lethal
chemical agents, unless first used by the enemy. "No evidence
could be found that the nerve agent sarin was ever transported to
Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand).... No evidence could
be found that sarin was used in Operation Tailwind," the report
stated.
</P>
<P>
Air Force personnel involved in the mission have stated CS tear
gas was used, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen ordered a Pentagon investigation shortly after the story
was broadcast.
</P>
<P>
In its retraction, CNN apologized for "serious faults" in its
reporting and that a CNN-requested investigation by a prominent
media attorney concluded that its joint "NewsStand" report with
Time magazine could not be supported.
</P>
<P>
The report's two main producers, Jack Smith and April Oliver,
were fired after a CNN-requested investigation by a prominent media
attorney. Senior producer Pam Hill resigned, while the lead
reporter, Peter Arnett, was reprimanded.

<HEADLINE> Chissano Calls for Dialog Among Govt., Employers, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Tuesday called for dialog among the government,
employers and trade unions to resolve their disagreements.
</P>
<P>
Dialog should be considered as a major priority "weapon" in
solving the problems facing the government, employers and the
unions, Chissano said at the opening of the National Symposium on
the Role of Trade Unions in Mozambique's Development.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the improvement of the people's living
standards depends upon the concerted efforts by all walks of the
society.
</P>
<P>
Chissano praised the Mozambican people for their efforts in
the implementation of the structural adjustment, noting that the
economic policy is bearing fruits.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released by the National Statistics
Bureau recently, the gross domestic product of the southern
African country grew by 14 percent last year. And it is predicted
that the growth rate will be 10 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the president acknowledged that much has to be done
so that the economic growth can have a positive impact on the
living of the Mozambicans.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the issue of privatization, the Mozambican
president pointed out that the policy is in the interests of the
employed and can keep the vitality of the enterprises and it is
"the only option to overcome the difficulties facing the
industries."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there are now 100,000 people who have
lost their jobs as a result of privatization and they complained
a lot.
</P>
<P>
Chissano called on all his people to come up with good ideas
to help their nation solve the social and economic problems.
</P>
<P>
With the support from the International Confederation of Free
Unions, the symposium was sponsored by the Mozambican
Organization of Workers.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the government, employers and some unions
participated in the conference. The main purpose of the workshop
is to discuss the role of trade unions in the national
development.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was scheduled to end on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Three-Year ESAF Credit for Central </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Tuesday approved a three-year credit under the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) equivalent to about 66
million U.S. dollars to back the Central African Republic's
economic program for 1998-2000.
</P>
<P>
The first annual credit of about 22 million dollars is
available in two equal semiannual installments, the first of which
will be made available shortly.
</P>
<P>
The country's medium-term program seeks to maintain an average
annual real GDP growth of about 5 percent, stabilize inflation at
about 2.5 percent per annum, and contain the external current
account deficit at 5 percent of GDP by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Consistent with the strategy, the 1998 program projects a real
GDP growth of 5.5 percent, an inflation rate of 2.6 percent on an
average annual basis and an external account deficit of 6.1
percent of GDP, assuming a continuous strong growth in agriculture
and a recovery of manufacturing output.
</P>
<P>
Central African Republic joined the IMF in July 1963. Its quota
is about 55 million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF
financing currently totals about 10 million dollars.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A new U.S. aircraft carrier
will be put into service, the Navy said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton will preside over the official
activation on Saturday in Norfolk, Virginia, of the Harry Truman,
the 13th aircraft carrier, "the most formidable ship ever put to
sea," the Navy said.
</P>
<P>
The Truman is the eighth nuclear-powered Nimitz-class carrier,
with virtually unlimited range at more than 30 knots without
refueling for 20 years because of its twin nuclear reactors, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The truman's air wing includes nine or 10 squadrons that fly
the F-14 Tomcat, F/A-18 Hornet strike fighters, Ea-6b Prowler
electronic warfare aircraft and multirole SH-60b seahawk
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The Truman will serve the United States for half a century,
the Navy said.

<HEADLINE> EU Updates Consumer Price Index Calculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission welcomed
Wednesday a decision by the Council of Ministers to update the
consumer price index to make it a better measurement for
inflation.
</P>
<P>
European Monetary Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy
described the ministers' decision as concrete progress toward
harmonized statistics in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Accurate inflation statistics are vital for the European
Central Bank's management of monetary policy in the euro-zone from
January 1, 1999," said the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
He added that the EU inflation index, with the transformation
decided by the ministers Wednesday, will be more comprehensive
than most national consumer price indices.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers decided to incorporate into the
European-wide inflation index financial services and cross-border
shopping as well.
</P>
<P>
The incorporation will fill the gaps in the existing Harmonized
Consumer Price Index (HCPI) which the European Central Bank will
use as a yardstick for its monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Services, hitherto omitted like health, education, refuse
collection, sewage service, water supplies, social services and
house rentals, will be included in the index calculation starting
in December next year.
</P>
<P>
Cross-border shopping will also be covered by the HCPI in the
country where the purchase is made.
</P>
<P>
The two additions will make up 10 percent of the new HCPI.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat, the statistical bureau of the European communities,
publishes the HCPI every month for each of the 15 European Union
countries, the entire European Union and the 11-country euro-zone.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Urges Amicable Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- President Joseph Estrada Wednesday
appealed to the management and striking employees of the
Philippine Airlines (PAL) to be open to an amicable settlement
since the continued labor unrest is harmful to the economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing, Estrada offered anew to mediate a
lasting solution to the indefinite strike staged by thousands of
ground crew of the national flag carrier starting Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Estrada invited the officers of the PAL Employees Association
(PALEA) to meet with him soon so they could discuss their
grievances and come up with a just and fair solution.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Estrada ordered Labor Secretary Bienvenido
Laguesma to push a compromise formula that would ensure a lasting
resolution of the PAL row which, he said, was hurting the economy
and the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said he might call a dialogue with management and
labor so they could work out a speedy settlement that is fair and
beneficial to all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has directed the Department of Transportation and
Communications to mobilize its resources in order to help stranded
passengers get to their destination.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he had arranged to meet with PALEA officials last
week but they did not come, although he voiced the hope that they
would honor his invitation this time.
</P>
<P>
The PALEA went on strike early Wednesday morning in protest of
the retrenchment of some 5,000 employees who were fired last month
under a massive downsizing program.
</P>
<P>
The PAL began to massively downsize its operations after its
620 pilots staged a wildcat strike in early June, bringing huge
financial losses to the already financially-troubled airline.
</P>
<P>
The strike has delayed most of the PAL's international and
domestic flights. But the airline managed to mount all flights in
early evening except a U.S.-bound international flight.

<HEADLINE> Surplus Spindles Move from Eastern China to Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Another 50,000 spindles will soon
leave the bulky textile industry of the coastal city of Qingdao in
east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Under the joint investment contract signed recently between
Qingdao cotton textile mills and a Pakistani partner, Qingdao will
contribute 50,000 spindles, 500 looms and other equipment,
equivalent to 40 percent of the venture's registered capital.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, 98,000 spindles were reduced in Qingdao in some six
months of this year alone.
</P>
<P>
Spindle-reduction is one of the essential measures needed to
allow China's textile industry to get out of the red. China is
expected to reduce its spindle supply by 10 million, and those
employed in the industry by 12 million, by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Aside from simply destroying spindles, Qingdao city seeks to
move them to foreign countries whose textile industries do not
suffer from export quota limitations.
</P>
<P>
The massive transportation of 50,000 spindles follows the
movement of 20,000 spindles from the Qingdao No.9 Cotton Textile
Mill to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Under the recent pact, 23,000 spindles will be moved to the

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Korean Confederation of Trade
Unions (KCTU) said Wednesday it will join the strike staged by the
Korean Metal Workers' Federation (KMWF) to protest rising
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
About 6,500 KMWF members went on strike Wednesday,the second
strike organized by the federation within a week, despite
government warnings of tough action.
</P>
<P>
They will be joined by 600,000 members of the KCTU, said KCTU
chief Lee Kap-yong at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's unemployment rate had already shot up to 6.9
percent in May, as against just 2.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Labor unions hold that the recent massive layoffs are in
violation of a labor-management-government accord that stipulates
the pain from economic reforms should be evenly distributed.
</P>
<P>
However, the government said the layoffs had been legalized.
</P>
<P>
The law enforcement authorities Wednesday renewed the
government's tough stand against illegal strikes at a meeting
attended by officials from the Prosecutor General's Office, the
National Police Agency, the Labor Ministry and the Agency for
National Security Planning.
</P>
<P>
The government has threatened to mobilize riot police to defuse
illegal strikes and take stern legal action against alleged
illegal strikers.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached last December with the International
Monetary Fund for a bailout loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars, South
Korea has to restructure its economy, open markets and shut down
ailing financial institutions and companies this year.
</P>
<P>
In a restructuring program released last month, the government
ordered 55 manufacturing firms to be closed and forced five weak
banks to merge with stronger ones.
</P>
<P>
The government also decided to privatize 11 state firms,
including Pohang Iron and Steel Co., the world's second-largest
steel maker.
</P>
<P>
There is fear the restructuring program will leave an
increasing number of workers jobless.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Urges Israeli People to Promote Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Wednesday appealed to the people of Israel to adopt a stance that
helps promote the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I call on the people of Israel, who share with us the
responsibility to build peace, to adopt the stance that
corresponds to the current danger, the inevitable repercussions of
the collapse or stagnation of peace," Mubarak said in the
nationwide televised speech made at the closing session of the
seventh congress of the ruling National Democratic Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
He noted that rigid policies and unjust practices could not
build "bridges of amity and co-existence" among nations.
</P>
<P>
"They only widen the gap among nations and shatter any hope for
a better future," he added in the keynote speech to mark the 46th
anniversary of the 1952 revolution ending Egypt's monarchy.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also reviewed Egypt's efforts to establish a just and
comprehensive peace in the region, the required U.S. role in
unblocking the long-standing peace deadlock as well as the peace
efforts exerted by Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader called on peace-loving forces to persist in
their efforts to further peace and contribute to the elimination
of obstacles on its road, because "every incident in this
sensitive region must leave strong echoes and wide repercussions
behind in the various parts of the world."
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process has come to a standstill on various
tracks in the past two years since the hard-line Likud government
took power in Israel in mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
For the past 16 months, the Israeli-Palestinian talks have been
stalled due to Israel's actions to expand settlements and its
repeated delay in carrying out the long overdue further troop
redeployment in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank to Have More Powers to Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will ask
Congress to arm the country's central bank with more muscles to
deal with upheavals affecting the banking sector, the official
Philippine News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The amendment of the General Banking Act is one of the proposed
priority legislative measures that President Joseph Estrada is
submitting to Congress when it opens on July 27, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada wants to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory
powers of the central bank so that it can invigorate the banking
sector and help power the economy out of the currency storm that
sent business firms into doldrums.
</P>
<P>
The Estrada administration is confident that with these new
powers, the central bank would be better equipped to parry
external economic storms such as the region-wide currency upheaval
that led to the sharp devaluation of the Philippine peso.
</P>
<P>
A stronger central bank is among the financial and monetary
reforms set to be initiated by the new government to help deflate
the prevailing high interest rates in order to spur new
investments from both domestic and international sources.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Seoul Not to Intervene in Foreign Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korea should not intervene in
its foreign exchange market as the South Korean won might start
losing strength against the U.S. dollar the second half of the
year, an IMF official warned Wednesday
</P>
<P>
John Richard Dodsworth, director of the IMF's Seoul office,
told a seminar sponsored by the Federation of Korean Industries
that South Korea will see its current account surplus sharply
diminish during the second half this year due to recessions in
Japan and Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The reduced exports pressed down by the weakening Japanese yen
and enlarged raw material imports would cut down the country's
current account surplus, Dodsworth said.
</P>
<P>
Given the uncertainties of the other regional currencies, it is
especially important for South Korea to keep an exchange rate
policy with a non-interventionist tone, letting interest rates
move according to foreign exchange trends, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Seoul's efforts to lower interest rates, the IMF
official said exchange rate movements did not affect interest
rates and the recent downturn in interest rates did not lead to
inflation.
</P>
<P>
"While lower interest rates are beneficial, many companies are
concerned with the availability rather than the cost of credit,"
Dodsworth said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that it will take three to five years for South
Korea to fully ride out the current crisis.

<HEADLINE> HK Committed in Efforts to Eliminate Racial Discrimination, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- David Lan, Secretary for Home
Affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), said
here Wednesday that the SAR government perseveres in the
opposition to racial discrimination and is making efforts to
eliminate discriminatory practices and attitudes.
</P>
<P>
Lan made these comments while answering a question raised in
the Legislative Council meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The question was related to a recent local press report that
the operators of some bars and clubs in Hong Kong had charged
non-white customers at higher rates.
</P>
<P>
After learning about the incident which happened last month,
Lan said, the authorities decided that the best way to address
this issue was to write to the 500 bars and clubs in Hong Kong,
explaining the SAR government's opposition to racial
discrimination and encouraging them to join the authorities in
their efforts to eliminate discriminatory practices and attitudes.
</P>
<P>
Public education and persuasion was the best and most suitable
approach to address this issue, Lan said. The SAR government had,
besides other efforts, recently conducted TV announcements of
public interest, TV variety show, drawing competition/exhibition,
as well as launching a 2.5 million HK dollars (0.32 million U.S.
dollars) funding scheme to sponsor community projects aimed at
promoting equal opportunities and support for the needs of
minority groups.
</P>
<P>
Lan said that the authorities believed that the various
educational initiatives taken were expected to gradually and
progressively foster a culture of racial equality within the local
community.

area of two to three square kilometers. However, it took the roofs
off more than 250 workshops, warehouses and residences, casting
many of them as far as 20 to 30 meters.
</P>
<P>
The direct economic losses caused by the tornado are estimated
at one million yuan (120,000 US dollars), said Chen Youli, deputy
director of the Ningbo Weather Meteorological Observatory.
</P>
<P>
The meteorologist said the tornado was caused by cold air
penetrating into Ningbo area, which has been under a system of
consecutive high temperatures and low pressure. The observatory
warned local residents of the impending tornado, though it could
not forecast the exact spot it would touch down, he added.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Organized Crime Body Created in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Wednesday ordered the creation of a presidential anti-organized
crime commission and a presidential anti-organized crime task
force to investigate and prosecute criminal elements in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, Estrada appointed himself chairman of the
anti-crime commission. The task force will be headed by Chief
Superintendent Panfilo Lacson.
</P>
<P>
The commission members include Justice Secretary Serafin
Cuevas, National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre, Armed Forces
Chief of Staff Joselin Nazareno and national police chief Roberto
Lastimoso.
</P>
<P>
The commission also includes four civic leaders from
non-governmental anti-crime organizations.
</P>
<P>
The task force will be composed of 800 to 1,000 men from the
police, the military and the National Bureau of Investigation
(NBI).
</P>
<P>
Among the offenses over which the task force and the commission
are empowered to gain jurisdiction are gun running, illegal
logging, robbery-hold-up, kidnapping for ransom, smuggling,
piracy, drug trafficking and other heinous crimes.
</P>
<P>
Estrada expressed the hope that organized crime groups will be
eliminated within the period covered by the Estrada administration
and the two anti-crime bodies will not be permanent government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has promised to restore peace and order in the country
where organized crimes such as kidnappings and robberies have been
rampant for years.
</P>
<P>
The new president vowed earlier to eliminate major crime
syndicates within his first six months in office.

<P>
TEHRAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry's spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi on Wednesday condemned the assassination of
U.N. observers in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Three U.N. observers along with their interpreter on duty were
ambushed and killed by unknown gunmen in Tajikistan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Calling the killing as an "inhuman act," Mohammadi offered
condolences to the U.N., the families of the victims as well as
their nations, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said Iran believed that such atrocities were
orchestrated by opponents of peace and tranquillity in
Tajikistan. He emphasized the need for prompt implementation of
the Tajik peace accord.

<HEADLINE> Threat of Cardiovascular Illness May Lessen Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The latest breakthrough in the
study of hypertension has made it possible for the mankind to
minimize the risk of cardiovascular illness sometime in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
The Symposium of International Study on Hypertension Optimal
Treatment (HOT), which opened here today, disclosed that six years
of research, in which nearly 19,000 patients in 26 countries
received Plendil (felodipine)-based antihypertensive treatment,
has helped medical scientists to determine the optimal blood
pressure for patients with hypertension.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that among more than 690 million patients with
hypertension worldwide, some 2.9 million die of the illness
annually.
</P>
<P>
The HOT, the world's largest project for the study of
hypertension, was endorsed by the European Society of Hypertension
to find the optimal blood pressure for hypertension patients.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that patients who had their systolic pressure
reduced to 138 mm Hg and their diastolic pressure reduced to 83 mm
Hg experienced a 30 percent reduction in the risk of death from
cardiovascular illness.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Liu Lisheng, chairwoman of the Chinese Association of
Hypertension, said that international health organizations will
regard the achievement of the HOT study as the worldwide criterion
in the future treatment of hypertension patients.
</P>
<P>
"And the achievement has been a blessing for Chinese patients,
as this treatment is particularly effective for Asians," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar FM Leaves for ASEAN Ministerial Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw
left here Wednesday for Manila, the Philippines, to attend the
31st annual meeting of foreign ministers of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its related meetings due to
begin Friday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, along with Laos, was admitted into the fold of ASEAN
last July which also groups Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM), which follows the ASEAN
Standing Committee Meeting and Senior Officials Meeting in the
Philippine capital, is expected to focus on the ongoing regional
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, senior finance officials of the ASEAN met
for the first time in Yangon and discussed the crisis prior to the
AMM.
</P>
<P>
Since integration into the ASEAN, Myanmar has been working
closely with other ASEAN members, forming respective committees
and groups in all sectors and taking an active part in various
meetings and activities of the association.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has also attended since then a series of regional
meetings relating to ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) scheme,
investment, agriculture, forestry, transportation, drug control,
education, tourism, environment, financial, labor and home
affairs.
</P>
<P>
On these occasions, Myanmar joined in signing accords on
regional cooperation in finance and tourism as well as the
setting-up of a foundation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, together with Laos, is also receiving technical
assistance from the grouping at the Kuala Lumpur meeting of the
AFTA Council in October 1997, for the fulfillment of its
obligations to the AFTA.
</P>
<P>
For the establishment of AFTA, Myanmar has presented its
commodities list for tariff reduction.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, investment in Myanmar from
other five ASEAN countries -- Indonesia, the Philippines,
Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand -- added up to more than 3.3
billion U.S. dollars in over 140 projects at the end of March this
year, accounting for about 45 percent of the 7-billion-dollar
total foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland to Beef up Water Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland is preparing a
water bill which will declare all water in the country an
economic national resource, a senior Swazi official said in
Mbabane Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The increasing scarcity of water demanded that the government
take measures to ensure water conservation, Swazi National
Resources and Energy Minister Prince Sobandla said upon his
arrival from the official opening of the Friekoppies Dam in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Sobandla said the water bill will also address water pricing
to bring it in line with the cost of making water available to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
The preparation of the bill follows concern expressed by the
Swaziland Water Corporation over the large number of bore holes
being sunk in rural areas by farmers and others to avoid paying
the high tariffs for piped water supplied by the authority.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product (GDP)
of Shanghai, China's largest trade and financial city, reached
173.6 billion yuan in the first half of this year, up 9.4 percent
over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics released today, the product
value of the city's foreign-funded enterprises increased by 17.1
percent in the first half, despite the negative effects of the
financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The export volume of local foreign trade companies witnessed a
9.5 percent growth to reach eight billion U.S. dollars due to
fast-expanding business in European and American markets and the
enhanced competitiveness of their products.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth rate of the city's exports in the first
half dropped by 3.2 percent compared with the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The city's combined export volume to Europe increased by 35
percent in the first five months of this year, with shipments to
the United States up 28.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's industrial product value also grew by 9.1 percent to
281.6 billion yuan over the past few months as a result of
expanding home demand and greater investment.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index for Shanghai residents increased by
only 2.8 percent over the past few months, with retail commodity
prices lower by 3.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Go-Ahead Given for EU-MERCOSUR Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission gave the
go-ahead on Wednesday for negotiations leading up to the formation
of an inter-regional association between the European Union (EU)
and Mercosur plus Chile.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, gave its approval by adopting two recommendations from EU
agriculture ministers who met on Monday.
</P>
<P>
European Commission Vice-President Manuel Marin said the
commission made a positive decision after intense discussions, and
the go-ahead was given by "a very broad majority" of the 22-member
commission.
</P>
<P>
Disagreement arose mainly from the agricultural sector within
the union that fears cheap imports of Latin American agricultural
products, especially cereals, sugar and beef, would flood the EU
markets after the formation of the inter-regional association.
</P>
<P>
Marin stressed that the formation of the inter-regional
association was not a new concept in that the initiative was taken
when the EU signed an agreement with the South American free-trade
zone on December 15, 1995 and with Chile on June 21 the following
year.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, consisting of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay, is ranked the fourth largest single market in the world
after the EU, the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Marin said the EU should not lose its advantageous negotiating
position after the U.S. Congress voted against President Bill
Clinton's fast-track initiative.
</P>
<P>
But he said the actual negotiation for the formation of the
EU-Mercosur association could not be started until after next year
because of necessary paperwork.
</P>
<P>
Marin said that now that the issue of the go-ahead was fixed,
the issues of when and how would become the focus of attention in
the commission and the European Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the EU and Mercosur increased 76 percent between
1990 and 1996, totaling 33.35 billion ECU (36.67 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In 1996, EU enjoyed a trade surplus with Mercosur of 3.6
billion ECU (3.96 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Bahraini Intelligence Agent Found Dead in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A Bahraini intelligence officer
has been found dead here with a bullet in his head, the National
Broadcast Network radio reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The initial investigation showed that Tawfik Abdanabi Ibrahim,
who was found on Monday in a tourist area of Beirut, is
an officer of Bahraini intelligence apparatus," the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old Ibrahim was found with a pistol in his hand,
the radio said. The cause of his death remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that Ibrahim, who entered Lebanon eight times last
year using different names, was in charge of monitoring the
activities of Bahraini opposition figures living in Lebanon, the
radio added.
</P>
<P>
Despite Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz's claim that
Ibrahim was an intelligence officer, Bahrain on Wednesday formally
denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz has asked Bahrain to provide more information about
Ibrahim, and he didn't rule out the possibility of conducting a
joint investigation with Bahraini officials.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain does not have an embassy in Lebanon despite the
existence of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Launches Software for Chinese Small Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Even for a small Chinese business
equipped with only two computers and no computer engineers,
management can be much easier and more efficient by running the
latest Microsoft software on its computer system.
</P>
<P>
This is made possible by Microsoft, the world's leading software
producer, which launched here today a new Chinese
BackOffice version that is specially designed for small and
medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to a Microsoft engineer, the new product offers
businesses with only two to 25 computers a platform linking staff
members, customers and management.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show there are 10 million small and medium-sized
enterprises in China, accounting for 99 percent of all its enterprises.
</P>
<P>
These small enterprises generate 60 percent of the national industrial
output, and employ 70 percent of the nation's workers.
</P>
<P>
An authoritative survey shows that small companies using
computers connected to the Internet or platforms have 20 percent
more per capita annual turnover than the ones that do not.
</P>
<P>
In order to survive in intensifying market competition, small
businesses in China are increasingly aware of the importance of
information technology in management, and have started to take
measures in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Microsoft, IBM, Compac, Hewlett-Packard,
and China's largest computer company, the Legend Group, announced
an alliance as the new BackOffice version became available on the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The alliance will work with local software developers and
Internet providers on business computing solutions for small
companies.

<HEADLINE> All Chinese Army-Owned Businesses to Be Shut Down (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese central leadership has
ordered the armed forces to clear and close down all its
businesses as a major contribution to the current nationwide
anti-smuggling drive.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China
and State President, disclosed the plan at a joint
anti-smuggling conference held in Beijing on Monday and Tuesday by
the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
Army leaders including vice-chairmen of the Central Military
Commission Zhang Wannian and Chi Haotian, as well as members of
the commission Fu Quanyou, Yu Yongbo, Wang Ke and Wang Ruilin took
part in the conference..
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also Chairman of the Central Military Commission,
urged the armed forces to fully understand the importance and
urgency of the nationwide anti-smuggling campaign in order to
ensure the country's long-standing stability and the army's purity.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces must play a leading role in the current drive
to set a good example for the society and further the efforts
to build a clean Party style in the army, he said.
</P>
<P>
The current international situation is favorable for China's
ongoing modernization drive as the country's international status
has been further enhanced, while China's economic growth
has maintained a relatively high speed, despite the current
financial turmoil in Asia, Jiang told the participants.

<HEADLINE> Great Lakes Cleaner Than Before, Commission Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Great Lakes are cleaner now
than they have been for 50 years, but people and wildlife still
face threats from toxic substances, the International Joint
Commission says.
</P>
<P>
The commission, a bi-national organization that oversees
trans-boundary issues between the United States and Canada, is to
release an assessment Wednesday in its ninth biennial report on
water quality in the Great Lakes, the largest fresh-water system
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Mercury, dioxin, toxins within the PCB group and agricultural
pesticides are among the chemicals that the commission said are
posing major threats to about 40 million Canadians and Americans
living in the Great Lakes area, and the 25 million who depend on
the Lakes for drinking water.
</P>
<P>
But the Great Lakes environment has improved significantly over
the past 25 years, the report notes. Viable bald eagle communities
have returned to the shorelines, and recently four species of fish
-- sturgeon, lake trout, lake herring and deep-water sculpin --
reappeared in Lake Ontario after long absence.
</P>
<P>
Success is attributed to government imposed bans or production
limits on some of the most toxic substances, such as DDT and
PCBs. However, more subtle and insidious injuries caused by
pesticides and industrial chemicals are continuing to occur, the
report notes.
</P>
<P>
The commission makes 19 recommendations in its report to the
Canadian and U.S. governments.
</P>
<P>
Among these, it calls for a strategy for heavier industry to
reduce its emissions of mercury, a nerve toxin, and nitrogen
oxides, the pollutant that causes smog and contributes to acid
rain.

SINGAPORE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for Foreign
Affairs and Law S. Jayakumar will attend the 31st ASEAN
Ministerial Meeting (AMM), the 5th ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and
the annual Post-Ministerial Conference (PMC) with ASEAN's Dialogue
Partners, to be held from July 24 to 29 in Manila, the
Philippines, a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the 31st AMM to be held on July 24 and 25, the ASEAN Foreign
Ministers will review ASEAN's activities and external relations
over the past year, lay down policy guidelines for the coming
year, exchange views on the regional financial situation as well
as the preparation for the 6th ASEAN summit scheduled for December

Drug-Free ASEAN, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The 5th ARF Ministerial Meeting will be held on July 27 and

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Privatize National Railways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is bent
on pursuing the privatization of cash-strapped Philippine National
Railways (PNR), the official Philippine News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Transportation and Communications Secretary Vicente Rivera was
quoted as saying that "the only way to make PNR efficient and
profitable is to give it to the private sector."
</P>
<P>
Rivera said this was the same recommendation made by
international consulting firm Price Waterhouse in a study it
conducted on the agency in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"The need to privatize the PNR is largely due to the problems
besetting the company," he said. "For one, the company has been
solely dependent on the financial assistance coming from foreign
governments to rehabilitate its dilapidated facilities."
</P>
<P>
As this developed, a bill has been filed in the House of
Representatives calling for the privatization of the PNR.
</P>
<P>
If the bill is approved, the PNR will enter into separate
operating leases with private firms for commuter service, freight
service and long-distance passenger service.
</P>
<P>
The private company may also employ its own personnel and have
free reign over operation decisions such as fares, schedules and
compensation.

<HEADLINE> Spain Pledges Support for Turkey's EU Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Spain's Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar pledged Wednesday that Spain supports Turkey's bid for full
membership of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Aznar made the promise at a joint press conference here
following his one-hour-and-half meeting with his Turkish
counterpart Mesut Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
"As both members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, I
believe that Turkey and Spain will cooperate in the issues
concerning the EU," said Aznar, who arrived here Tuesday for a
two-day visit aimed at boosting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Yilmaz complained to his guest about the "wrong
and unacceptable" attitude adopted by the EU toward Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkey-EU relations fell to the lowest level last December
when the EU leaders made a formal decision at the Luxembourg
summit to exclude Turkey from the EU enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
In angry reaction, Turkey swiftly decided to suspend its
political dialog with the EU to protest its unjust attitude toward
the Muslim-dominant nation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yilmaz and Aznar signed a plan of joint action on
political, economic and cultural relations after their talks in
the building of the prime ministry.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said that "there is no political problem existing
between our two friendly and allied countries", adding it was
necessary for the two sides to give full play to the potentials
of enhancing bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz announced that he and Aznar agreed to hold a meeting
every year, but he fell short of disclosing the fixed place and
date for the next meeting.
</P>
<P>
He added that Turkey and Spain would hold a meeting of the
Mixed Economic Council in Madrid, capital of Spain, in October to
discuss ways of expanding trade and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said the trade volume between the two
countries was 1.78 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 and is expected to
increase to 2 billion dollars this year.

<HEADLINE> China Tightening Down On Smuggling (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is planning
a large scale anti-smuggling campaign for the second half of this
year to demonstrate its determination to assure the healthy
economic growth to protect stability.
</P>
<P>
The drive is, according to President Jiang Zemin, "a major
economic struggle" as well as a "political struggle" that will
have a bearing on the reforms, opening-up, and modernization.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told a conference on smuggling earlier this month that,
to win the campaign, China will deal with major cases in an
efficient way and it plans to reform its system and set up a
national police force especially for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
The reforms include asking departments to turn all fines and
confiscated goods from smuggling cases over to the state
treasury, and much of the profit will be used to fight smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Although China has achieveed a great deal in its endeavor
against smuggling in the past few years, there is still a lot of
smuggling of oil products, automobiles, cigarettes and other items
along coastal areas and borders.
</P>
<P>
The General Administration of Customs reports that in the first
five months of this year, they dealt with 2,322 smuggling cases,
involving 2.78 billion yuan (334.94 million US dollars) worth of
goods, a 10 percent increase from the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Kim Dae-jung to Invite Predecessors for Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
will invite his four predecessors to dinner about the end of July,
a presidential spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The invitation to Kim Young-sam, Roh Tae-woo, Chun Doo Hwan and
Choi Kyu-hah, all Kim's former rivals or oppressors, is an effort
to seek national harmony amid a downturn in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"The president is inviting the former presidents to express his
gratitude for their attendance at his inauguration, and to hear
their views on state affairs," spokesman Park Jie-won said.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time for the president to meet his
predecessors since Kim's February 25 presidential inauguration
this year.
</P>
<P>
The four former presidents have accepted the invitations.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking official said the move was Kim's effort to
achieve national harmony and unity at a time of economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once an economic powerhouse in the world, has
plunged into economic standstill since late last year.
</P>
<P>
The dinner will, perhaps, pave the way for Kim to ask the
ex-presidents to play some role in the future, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
President Kim might ask his predecessors to act as his advisors
or envoys to end regional rivalry or reduce rampant regionalism,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Kim Young-sam, Roh Tae-woo and Chun Doo Hwan are all from the
south-eastern Kyongsang province while President Kim came from the
south-western Cholla province.

<HEADLINE> China Tightening down on Smuggling (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since China started its reforms and opening up in the late
1970s, its economy has maintained an annual growth rate of 10
percent. Even this year, though it was affected by the Asian
financial crisis and serious flooding, it still registered a 7
percent growth in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Economists have praised the economic achievements, but they
still pinpointed that smuggling has done a great deal of damage to
industry and has caused a substantial loss of tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
In the past six months, the price of domestic petroleum dropped
by more than 300 yuan (36 US dollars) per metric ton, causing
industry profits to edge down. Some analysts describe smuggling as
one of the chief factors.
</P>
<P>
The automobile industry has suffered a similar fate. Domestic
auto makers have found themselves caught in a squeeze between a
slump in the market and rampant smuggling and find it difficult to
breathe.
</P>
<P>
A Customs official said that China's annual losses from
smuggling may be as large as approximately 100 billion yuan (12
billion US dollars) when one considers the large number of
smugglers who escape the net of justice.
</P>
<P>
No country is lucky enough to completely get away from
smuggling, he acknowledged, but he referred to the rampant
situation in China "shocking". The resolve of the Chinese
government is admirable, he said and he believed smuggling can in
fact be checked with the intense campaign.

<HEADLINE> Inquiry on HK New Airport to Be Conducted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Justice Woo Kwok-hing, chairman
of the Commission of Inquiry on New Airport, pledged here
Wednesday that the commission would be absolutely independent and
impartial in conducting an inquiry into the operation of the new
Hong Kong International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The commission, comprising Woo and Edgar Cheng, former chairman
of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, was appointed by the Chief
Executive-in-Council on Tuesday to probe into various matters
relating to the operation of the new airport at Chek Lap Kok,
which was opened on July 6 this year.
</P>
<P>
These matters include the decision to open the airport on July
6, the planning and preparation for its opening and problems which
arose thereafter.
</P>
<P>
"We will ensure that the entire process will be highly
transparent," Woo said at a press conference on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Woo said that the commission plans to exercise the powers
appropriately under the Commissions of Inquiry Ordinance (Chapter
86) to summon witnesses to give evidence and produce documents.
</P>
<P>
Local and overseas experts may be invited for assistance if
necessary, he said. A thorough report will be submitted to the
Chief Executive after the inquiry is completed and depending on
circumstances, an interim report may be submitted within six
months, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, said Tuesday that the appointment of an
independent statutory commission demonstrates clearly the
government's determination to find out what went wrong, to
establish where the responsibilities lie, and to help prevent
similar incidents from happening again.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive inspected the new airport on Monday. After
his two-hour tour, Tung said that tremendous progress had been
made on the passenger services, yet much had to be done to improve
the cargo operations.
</P>
<P>
The cargo operations were affected due to the breakdown of the
Super Terminal One, which handles 80 percent of the total air
cargo in Hong Kong. The franchisee Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminal
Ltd. has planned to gear up the throughput at the terminal step by
step till it runs in full strength in mid-August.

<HEADLINE> Interview: SAARC Progress Great But Slow, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The achievements made by the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) are
"great," but "unfortunately the progress is slow," Bangladeshi
Ambassador to Nepal Mohiuddin Ahmed said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"What we would like SAARC to achieve has not been achieved," he
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said that cooperation among the member countries is new, and
unlike Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) whose member
countries do not have a big difference in size, SAARC has a small
member country like Bhutan and a giant like India.
</P>
<P>
"So economic cooperation between these kinds of countries is
not very easy. It takes time," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that as a whole, SAARC has different economies which
are not complementary. For India, Pakistan, Bhutan, the Maldives
and Bangladesh, the priority differs.
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh has a huge population, our priority is agriculture,
education and health," he said.
</P>
<P>
This makes it very difficult to bring them together and work
out very ambitious plans, he said.
</P>
<P>
But some success has been made in certain fields like
agriculture, telecommunications and health, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the idea of SAARC came from Bangladesh, and from
the very beginning, his country has been very serious and fully
committed to SAARC.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely believe that cooperation among the seven
countries of the region is beneficial to all the member countries.
The progress has been slow, but we are hopeful. It will go faster
now as SAARC has become mature," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that in this region in South Asia, it is very
important for us to work together. Unless we work together, we
cannot achieve economic development," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We're all aware of the great potentials of the whole region.
We're optimistic that the whole potential can be fully tapped," he
added.
</P>
<P>
SAARC was formed in December 1985 to promote regional
cooperation in economic development and other areas among its
seven member countries -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
It launched the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA)
in December 1995 as a first concrete measure for economic and
trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
And SAARC leaders decided last year to go for South Asian Free
Trade Area (SAFTA) preferably by the year of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of trade negotiations have been completed under
SAPTA and the member countries have exchanged more than 2,000
items of products for preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
Special treatment has been offered to Bangladesh, Bhutan, the
Maldives and Nepal, the four least developed countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The 10th SAARC summit, to be held on July 29-31 in Colombo, Sri
Lanka, will study and analyze the report submitted by the Group of
Eminent Persons which was commissioned last year to conduct a
comprehensive review of SAARC and map out future strategy for the
regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the report has identified such areas where
special treatment is given to the least developed countries,"
Ambassador Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the common problem facing all the member countries
is poverty, so the priority should be poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Attention should also be given to health, education,
communication and transportation, he said.
</P>
<P>
On sub-regional cooperation among Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and
Nepal, he said, "If you look at the SAARC, the map and the
economies of different countries, it is very logical that there
should be sub-groups."
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, Nepal initiated the Growth Quadrangle
comprising the above four countries with a view to jointly
developing the eastern Himalayan rivers for rapid economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Ahmed said that Bangladesh was very enthusiastic
about the idea and immediately gave its support. "This is one way
where development can be made," he added.
</P>
<P>
He observed that sub-regional cooperation may help expedite the
SAARC process and this is the beginning for smaller groups to
appear in the region.
</P>
<P>
At the ninth summit in May 1997, SAARC leaders encouraged the
development of specific projects relevant to the specific
individual needs of three or more member countries.
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming SAARC summit, the ambassador said that the
summit is very important as it will study the report of the Group
of Eminent Persons, which will have repercussions on SAARC itself.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the summit provides an opportunity for leaders of
India and Pakistan to sit down together and discuss their own
problems bilaterally following their nuclear explosions in May, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is no major problem affecting regional
cooperation in South Asia. "Kashmir problem is there since 1947,
but that never affected the cooperation within SAARC," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, "we sincerely hope that it is resolved bilaterally
between India and Pakistan," he added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Build Five More Fertilizer Factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will set up five more
fertilizer factories, including some in the northern region, to
meet the growing demand of fertilizer in the country, Commerce and
Industries Minister Tofail Ahmad said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"After satisfying domestic demands, excess fertilizer would be
exported to different countries," Ahmad told a two-day annual
conference of the Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation
(BCIC).
</P>
<P>
The minister did not mention when the construction of the new
fertilizer factories would start and where they would be located.
</P>
<P>
The BCIC consists of seven large fertilizer factories and has
been a losing organization for the last 22 years. It managed to
reduce the loss by 1.43 billion taka (30.43 million U.S. dollars)
during the 1997-98 fiscal year as a result of efficient management
effected by the government, according to Ahmad.
</P>
<P>
He urged all concerned to make industries under the BCIC
profitable organizations to meet the challenges of the open market
economy.
</P>
<P>
Industries Secretary K.M. Ejazul Huq also called on officials
and employees of the BCIC-run industries to turn themselves into
skilled manpower by undergoing training.
</P>
<P>
The BCIC produced 182.4 million tons of fertilizer during
fiscal 1997-98, about 12.3 percent higher than that in the
previous year, according to BCIC Chairman M. Anwarul Huq.
</P>
<P>
"If there was no gas shortage, around 50 million tons of
additional fertilizer would have been produced," he said.

ISLAMABAD, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Wednesday expressed the hope that his meeting with his
Indian counterpart Atal Behari Vajpayee would "lead to progress in
addressing the core issue of Kashmir in a meaningful manner"
between the two countries.

MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan will give the Philippines a
grant worth 350 million pesos (8.5 million U.S. dollars) to
finance equipment for road construction in the southern island of
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Notes on the assistance were signed here Wednesday by

</P>
<P>
It will likewise enable the people of Mindanao to have greater
access to basic social services such as health and education as
external coordination is facilitated and outside linkages are
formed.
</P>
<P>
The project is in line with the commitment made by the Japanese
government to supporting the development efforts in Mindanao as
embodied in an agreement signed earlier between the two countries.

nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan during today's talks
and jointly reaffirmed their positions not to recognize India and
Pakistan as nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
It is important for China and Russia, both influential
countries and permanent members of the UN Security Council, to
conduct close consultation and coordination on issues concerning
regional and world peace and security, they agreed.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers covered both bilateral relations and
regional and international issues of common concern, reaching

Jiang noted that the sound situation of the reform and economic
drive has enabled China to resolve problems and difficulties the
country has been encountering as it advances.
</P>
<P>
He termed the recent launching of the nationwide anti-smuggling
drive by the Party Central Committee and the State Council a major
decision, which was made to better safeguard healthy economic
development, social stability and the interests of state security.
</P>
<P>
Smuggling has been rampant in parts of the country and some
government departments, he said, noting that this kind of severe
crime will bring enormous danger to the society if it is not firmly
abolished.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed: "The People's Liberation Army is a staunch
pillar of the people's democratic dictatorship and an iron and
steel Great Wall for safeguarding the socialist motherland."
</P>
<P>
The army must implement the major arrangements made by the
central leadership for the anti-smuggling campaign, and actively
join in the nationwide anti-smuggling programs, while sparing no
effort to support and cooperate in local anti-smuggling
activities, and making serious investigations of problems related
to the PLA and the People's Armed Police (PAP).
</P>
<P>
"Our armed forces is a people's army under the absolute
leadership of the Party," Jiang said, assuring the conference that
the army could stand any kind of test, no matter whether in war or
peace.
</P>
<P>
"The People's Liberation Army has a glorious history and enjoys
a lofty reputation among the people of different nationalities,"
he said, praising the armed forces for its great contribution
to the Party-led revolution, economic drive and reform.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton vetoed legislation late Tuesday that
would have provided tax breaks to parents saving money for
education, including private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
-- Pentagon officials formally declared Tuesday that they have
found nothing to support an explosive report by CNN and Time
magazine that American troops used lethal sarin gas in Laos in
1970 during a secret mission to hunt down and kill American
defectors.
</P>
<P>
-- A powerful sky-blackening thunderstorm swept across the
Washington area Monday, toppling trees, knocking out power to tens
of thousands of homes and briefly interrupting the season's most
intense heat wave.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton ordered a crack down on nursing homes that
abuse patients or repeatedly violate health and safety standards
established by Congress 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
-- The House approved money for the National Endowment for the
Arts, long a scourge of conservatives and a prime target of
Republican leaders. Senate leaders have said they intend to
support the arts money, and President Clinton has said he also
favors it.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Greenspan said that Fed is more concerned about inflation
than a recession. But his carefully balanced congressional
testimony suggested the Federal Reserve is unlikely to make any
interest-rate move soon. The Dow-Jones average slid 105.56, or
1.14 percent, to 9190.19, and the Nasdaq composite fell, missing a
chance to set 10 straight records.
</P>
<P>
-- The House put off an IMF vote as a Senate panel cleared the
17.9 billion dollar plan. Divided House Republicans decided not to
bring up the long-delayed administration request until September.

<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of departures and
arrivals through Chinese Customs offices reached a record high of

than the figures for the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Exit-Entry Administration Bureau under the

measures have improved the services of Customs departments around
the country.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, Chinese citizens made 4,135,400 exits,

their main destinations including Hong Kong, Macao, Thailand,
Japan, Russia, the United States, Singapore, the Republic of Korea
(ROK), the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Australia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran to Answer US Overture: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi reaffirmed here Wednesday that Iran would answer the
U.S. overture for a rapprochement between the two rivals.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Kharrazi said that the
promise made by Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on July 1
to answer the U.S. overture was still valid and "we will
give the answer if necessary."
</P>
<P>
Following repeated goodwill signals from Washington, President
Khatami confirmed "a change in tone" in the statements of the
U.S. officials, but stressing that Iran would judge the
U.S. sincerity only through actions.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also said that the change in tone would be valuable
only when the U.S. changed its policies and behavior toward
Iran.
</P>
<P>
He criticized U.S. politicians for lagging behind the new
developments in the international relations at the threshold of
the new century by keeping the mentality of the cold war era.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. extraterritorial legislation and its disregard for
other civilizations and cultures were the clear evidence to show
that Washington had not changed that mentality, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the world has entered a new era and even
the European states resisted the U.S. policies, a proof that
today's world is not a unipolar one and all the nations should
have a say in global policy-making.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the policy of dialog by the European states,
Kharrazi said that as long as they honor the principle of mutual
respect, Iran would have good relations with them.
</P>
<P>
On the relations with Britain which were strained by the
Rushdie dispute, he said Iran would welcome any move by the
British government to improve bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
But he signaled no compromise on the issue of Salman Rushdie,
the British writer condemned to death by late Iranian supreme
leader Ayatollah Khomeini, saying Rushdie insulted 1 billion
Muslims through his book "The Satanic Verses."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said if Britain intended to enter the new era, it
should abandon the old mentality of civilization confrontation and
refrain from insulting others' sanctity.
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit to Tehran, a European Union Troika
delegation asked Iran to revoke the award for killing Rushdie
according to the fatwa issued by Khomeini, but Iran rejected the
demand.

<HEADLINE> Strikers in Philippine Airlines Ready for New Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Philippine Airlines
(PAL) Employees Association (PALEA), who went on strike early
Wednesday morning in a bid to paralyze the firm's operations, said
that they are ready for new talks with the management.
</P>
<P>
"This (the strike) is the ultimate decision, after efforts to
reach a compromise with management proved futile," said Alex
Barrientos, PALEA president.
</P>
<P>
But a certain Capili, a PALEA member who joined the dawn picket
at the domestic airport, said that sincere negotiations by the PAL
management can lead them back to work.
</P>
<P>
This means that the management should re-hire all the 5,000
dismissed PAL employees who were fired under a massive downsizing
program.
</P>
<P>
The PAL management was forced to massively downsize its
operations last month after its 620 pilots staged an illegal
strike on June 5, further aggravating the financial position of
the debt-ridden airline.
</P>
<P>
The PALEA, which represents the PAL's thousands of ground crew,
mounted the strike in protest of the retrenchment of the 5,000
employees, more than one-third of the company's 13,500-strong
workforce.
</P>
<P>
About 200 PALEA members carrying placards and streamers
picketed the Manila domestic airport trying to stop pilots and
other workers from launching early morning flights.
</P>
<P>
The indefinite strike has delayed most international and
domestic flights, leaving thousands of passengers stranded in
Manila and other cities in the country.

<HEADLINE> 3,625 People Kidnapped in Jammu, Kashmir in 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 3,625 people
including 21 foreigners and 128 politicians were kidnapped by the
militants in Jammu and Kashmir in the past 10 years, Indian Home
Ministry said in a report released Wednesday in Jammu.
</P>
<P>
Among the victims from abroad, the Press Trust of India (PTI)
reported from Jammu, 7 were Israeli, 4 British, 2 Swedish, 2
American, 2 Dutch, 1 Japanese, 1 French, 1 German and 1 Norwegian.
</P>
<P>
The fate of 4 foreigners, abducted in July 1995, remained
unknown despite government efforts to trace them, said the report
which recorded incidents since 1989 to the end of March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The victims included 145 women and 307 government officers, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
In about 2,183 incidents in the valley during the period, 1,076
were killed by militants and the year 1996 saw the death of 345
people, the highest number of victims in a single year.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, militants also released 862 people
after keeping them as hostages for varying periods.
</P>
<P>
In most of the cases, it added, those abducted were released by
their captors after extortion, torture, rape and exchange of
militants.
</P>
<P>
The highest number of 759 cases of kidnapping took place in
1996, followed by 657 in 1995 and 521 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Militants destroyed 13,563 structures in 4,763 incidents by
setting them ablaze during the period, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Home Minister L. K. Advani said Wednesday in a
written reply in the Upper House of Parliament that 310 militants
were killed in security forces operations in Jammu and Kashmir
from January to June this year.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Backtracks as Japanese Yen Stumbles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar was forced
to backtrack Wednesday by further weakness in the Japanese yen
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the close here, the local currency was trading at 62.37 U.S.
cents, from 62.93 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A dealer from the ANZ Bank said the unit had looked heavy since
the morning, when it opened at 62.68 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
"Once the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen exchange rate started
looking bid and broke through on the topside it gave the market a
bit of momentum to go for stops at 62.40 U.S. cents," she said.
</P>
<P>
Citibank chief economist Stephen Koukoulas said the wait for
meaningful Japanese policy reform would guide the Australian
dollar in the short-term.
</P>
<P>
"We would not be surprised to see spikes lower in the
Australian dollar, but a broad 61.00 U.S. cents to 63.00 range is
expected to hold in the near term, with a gentle appreciation to
65.00 U.S. cents by year end as cyclical factors start to turn
positive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Such policy reform could be a step closer by the weekend with
the first ballot by lawmakers for the position of Japanese prime
minister being held Friday.
</P>
<P>
News on the future of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra
caused the Australian market to end weaker.
</P>
<P>
The federal government announced it would not sell the entirety
of its remaining stake in Telstra and would cap the sell-off at 49
percent.
</P>
<P>
The federal government sold 33 percent of Telstra in a public
float in November last year and will look to sell the next 16
percent in one hit, if it is returned to government after the next
national election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local currency was buying 87.81 Japanese yen
from 87.57 late Tuesday and 1.1138 German marks from 1.1216.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find No Evidence of Antimatter During Space Flight (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Scientists so far found no
evidence of antimatter during experiments carried on the American
shuttle "Discovery" on a ten-day space mission.
</P>
<P>
Experiments to detect antimatter and missing matter in space
were conducted by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, a 3.5-ton
particle detector was carried into space by the Discovery on June
2. The shuttle wound up a successful mission and returned to the
Kennedy Space Center on the evening of June 12.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to draw any conclusions on the existence of
antimatter in space during such a short mission," according to
Chinese scientist Prof. Chen Hesheng.
</P>
<P>
"However, the detector did find some antiprotons which are
often produced during collisions of cosmic rays, but not
antimatter, said Prof. Chen, a researcher with the Institute of
High-Energy Physics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),
who directed China's participation in the experiments.
</P>
<P>
The detector also found protons and various atomic nuclei
during the trip, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
The research was an international cooperation effort led by
Chinese-American scientist and Nobel Prize Winner Dr. Samuel Ting
and involved more than 30 Chinese scientists from the Institute of
High-Energy Physics, the Institute of Electrical Engineering and
the Chinese Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.
</P>
<P>
China produced the permanent magnet which was the key component
for the detector and produced some of the unit's mechanical
structure, according to Chen. Related components functioned as
expected during the flight.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund's
(IMF) director for the Asia Pacific Hubert Neiss arrived here
Wednesday afternoon to review use of the IMF funds already
disbursed to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters upon arrival at the Soekarno-Hatta
international airport, Neiss said during his two-week visit he
will discuss three issues concerning the country's economic
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
The three issues are availability of the basic requirements by
the common people, examination program of banking restructuring
and solving private debts problem, he added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF agreed to resume loan payments to Indonesia last week,
after suspending payments following the May riots which led to the
resignation of former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting in Washington, the IMF board of directors
approved the release of one billion U.S. dollars as part of its 43
billion U.S. dollars rescue package for Indonesia.

<P>
The permanent magnet retrieved more than 220 hours of data and
200 million samples, some 80 percent of which were protons and 20
percent nuclei.

used a large magnetic detector to observe cosmic ray particles in
outer space," Chen noted. "The mission propelled the science of
physics into a brand-new unknown world."
</P>
<P>
The Institute of High-Energy Physics has obtained data
collected during the flight through the Internet, and numerous
Chinese physicists are attempting to download even more extensive
data to carry out related studies.
</P>
<P>
The magnetic detector will be placed aboard the American Alpha

<HEADLINE> UNEP Calls for Urgent Action on Climate Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Following scientific reports that
1998 is shaping up to be the hottest year on record, the U.N.
Environment Program (UNEP) Wednesday urged policy-makers to take
urgent action to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
"Record warming and severe summer heat waves in the U.S.,
India, China, and elsewhere are a wake-up call," said Klaus
Topfer, UNEP's Executive Director.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to wait several years for the Kyoto Protocol
to enter into force before making significant emissions cuts," he
stressed at the UNEP headquarters in the Kenyan capital.
</P>
<P>
Scientists confirmed in 1995 that the global climate might
have already started responding to past emissions and predicted
that the global temperature will rise by one to 3.5 centigrade
degrees by 2100.
</P>
<P>
The increase will also cause sea levels to rise by 15 to 95 cm
and climatic zones (including ecosystems and agricultural zones)
to shift towards the poles by 150 to 550 kilometers in the
mid-latitude regions, said the Inter-governmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC).
</P>
<P>
The IPCC, a network of over 2,000 scientists and experts, is
sponsored by UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization.
</P>
<P>
"There is still uncertainty about how the climate will change
at the regional or national level, and it is still not possible
to prove that individual heat waves or extreme events are caused
by global warming," said Topfer.
</P>
<P>
"But, we have more than enough credible evidence to know that
global climate change poses tremendous risks. We must take out
insurance now against future catastrophic climate change by
urgently adopting energy efficiency and other win-win measures,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Solar cells which currently produce less than one percent of
global power supplies, as well as other renewable energy
technology sources will be an essential part of the solution, the
UNEP noted in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Regulatory standards, tradable emissions permits, information
and public awareness programs, voluntary programs for business,
better urban transport planning, and the phase-out of
counterproductive subsidies can also play a role, the UNEP added.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries are responsible for the bulk of past and
present emissions and must take the lead in limiting emissions,
the UNEP urged.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. environment authority said that at the same time,
cleaner energy technologies should also be promoted in developing
countries through the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM).
</P>
<P>
Under the CDM, developed countries will be able to receive
credit for investments in emissions-limiting projects in
developing countries, said UNEP.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of incentive for making large-scale transfers to
developing countries of energy-efficient and renewable-energy
technologies can go a long way towards achieving both
developmental and environmental objectives," said Topfer.
</P>
<P>
He called on governments to create an economic and regulatory
framework that encourages both energy consumers and producers to
adopt the most energy-efficient technologies available so as to
cut carbon dioxide emissions.

<HEADLINE> Mordechai Asks U.S. Help on Redeployment Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai has asked the United States to help reach an agreement
between Israel and Palestinians on the further redeployment of
Israeli troops in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters Wednesday in the Knesset (parliament),
Mordechai urged U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
peace envoy Dennis Ross to send senior officials to the region to
bridge the gap between Israel and Palestinians on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said U.S. intervention could be the only way to help
reach an agreement in the shortest time, suggesting the ongoing
Israeli-Palestinian direct talks could end in failure.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai met with Palestinian peace negotiator Abu Mazen on
Sunday in Tel Aviv, kicking off the first direct peace talks in
months between the two sides. Their negotiations were stalled in
March last year when Israel decided to build a Jewish settlement
in controversial Har Homa, south of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Following Sunday's meeting, low-level discussions were also
held between the two sides on the redeployment issue, but so
specific agreement was reached so far.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side suggested a undercut version of the
U.S. proposal for a 13 percent Israeli pullback - 10 percent will
be handed over while the other 3 percent will be defined as
"natural preserves," in which no construction by either side will
be allowed.
</P>
<P>
Israel also demanded the convening of the smaller 100-member
Central Committee of the Palestinian Liberation Organization,
instead of the 460-member Palestinian National Council, to delete
the anti-Israel clauses in the Palestinian Covenant.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting all these demands, the Palestinian side said the
required changes to the Covenant have already been made in 1996 and
the question remains of which side has jurisdiction over the
so-called "natural reserves" of the 3 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side said that no progress was made in this
direct negotiations and warned the talks would break up again
unless the Israeli side endorses U.S. proposal for a 13.1 percent
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
As the peace talks moved on, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
held a series of meetings during the last two days with right wing
coalition party leaders to discuss the pullback issue.
</P>
<P>
The National Religious Party told Netanyahu Tuesday that it
will leave the coalition if he decided to accept the
U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
Another coalition partner Tsomet said the same day that any
pullback over 7 percent would lead to the party's quitting the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor Party said Wednesday that key party
members will further discuss whether to provide assistance to
Netanyahu on this issue on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side said on Tuesday that it gave another two
days for Israel to make a decision on accepting the U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
Holding direct talks with the Palestinians was Netanyahu's
idea. Mordechai's call for U.S. intervention showed it is almost
impossible for the two sides to solve such key issues without
being ready to make compromises.

<HEADLINE> China to Boost Automotive Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China's automotive output
increased by 0.6 percent and sales grew by 3.37 percent in the
first half of 1998 compared to the previous year's period.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Machinery Industry forecasts slow growth
for both sales and output through the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
An official with the National Automotive Industry Association
(NAIA) held that the flat consumption market and the existing
product mix and circulation system of the sector have hindered
the expansion of the automotive market.
</P>
<P>
The automotive industry not only accounts for 2.4 percent of
the country's total industrial output value, but also has direct
links with many other industries which involve 12 percent of the
total work force in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Economist Li Yining said expansion of the automotive market
will have immediate impact on spurring the economy to this year's
growth target of eight percent.
</P>
<P>
Recent estimates indicate that the nation's top three
automotive manufacturers earn between 20-30 billion yuan from
installment sales annually. Economists stress that the time is
ripe for banks to provide automobile loans to individual consumers.
</P>
<P>
In June this year, the Aeolus-Citroen Automobile Co. Ltd., a

<P>
According to Zeng, a marketing representative of the joint
venture, the company sold more than 10,000 automobiles in
Beijing last year, with less than ten percent of units sold
under the installment plan.

risk between manufactures, participating banks and consumers prior
to taking the major step of pushing banks into field of automotive
sales.

<HEADLINE> Australia First in Reserves of 8 Mineral Commodities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia now has the world's
largest reserves of eight key mineral commodities, according to a
report released Wednesday by the Australian Bureau of Resource
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The eight minerals are bauxite, lead, mineral sands (ilmenite,
rutile and zircon), nickel, silver, tantalum, uranium and zinc.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled Australia's Identified Mineral Resources
1998, was released by Australian federal Resources and Energy
Minister Warwick Parer.
</P>
<P>
Australia's measured and indicated bauxite resources of 8.7
billion tons rank number one in the world ahead of Guinea, Brazil,
Jamaica and India, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is the world's largest refiner of bauxite and fourth
largest producer of primary aluminum," it added.
</P>
<P>
The report said Australia's identified resource stocks of zinc,
lead and silver total 86.3 million tons, 54.6 million tons and
92,000 tons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The nation's economic demonstrated resources estimates, or
commercially exploitable deposit estimates, for zinc (36.3 million
tons), lead (17.5 million tons) and silver (41,500 tons) represent
19 percent, 27 percent and 15 percent of the world's totals
respectively, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, Australia had 24 percent, 42 percent and 37
percent of the world's economic demonstrated resources of ilmenite
(143.5 million tons), rutile (17.35 million tons) and zircon
(23.26 million tons), respectively, and produced 35 percent, 58
percent and 49 percent, respectively, of world output of these
minerals.
</P>
<P>
Australia's share of world economic demonstrated resources of
nickel was 15.6 percent in 1997, or 6.72 million tons, followed by
Russia, Cuba, and Canada. Australia produced 1.08 million tons of
nickel in 1997, about 11.5 percent of the world's total output.
</P>
<P>
Australia remains the world's premier holder of tantalum
economic demonstrated resources, accounting for 54 percent of the
world's total.
</P>
<P>
It produced about 302 tons of contained tantalum in 1997,
compared with the world's total output of 407 tons.
</P>
<P>
Australia has the world's largest resources of uranium in the
low cost Reasonably Assured Resources category, accounting for 26
percent of world resources in this category, followed by
Kazakhstan (19 percent), Canada (14 percent), and South Africa (9
percent).
</P>
<P>
Australia, which is also rich in industrial diamond, coal,
copper, iron ore and gold resources, is one of the world's major
producers and exporters of the mineral products, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Needles Sew up Broken Legs in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
( by Chen Cailin )
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Having been declared by many
to be destined to stay in bed for the rest of her life, Belaynesh
Kilil, could hardly believe herself that with needles she regards
as almost the same as the sewing needles she uses at home,
Chinese doctors have helped her to stand up again.
</P>
<P>
A middle-age Ethiopian lady, Kilil was injured by car accident
and paralyzed in bed two and a half years ago.
</P>
<P>
She has been treated with western medicine in Addis Ababa for
one year and half, with no improvement.
</P>
<P>
It was all by chance, a friend told her that Chinese
acupuncture treatment would be effective for her disease.
</P>
<P>
Desperate for standing up again, she asked her relatives to
take her to Adama Hospital for Chinese acupuncture early this
year.
</P>
<P>
It was all magic for her, for after only 10-days of treatment,
her legs, which had been out of her control for nearly 900 days,
came back to herself -- she could move her two legs on bed.
</P>
<P>
And after two months, she could, with someone's help, stand
up.
</P>
<P>
Another 80 days later, she could walk alone with a walking
stick.
</P>
<P>
Chinese acupuncture, with a history of 2,000 years ago, is now
exerting its magical functions in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Assefa Teklu, Manager of Sodore Resort Hotel, is just as lucky
as Kilil.
</P>
<P>
Teklu suffered from lumbar muscle injury when he carried a
heavy thing uncautiously. Acute lumbar muscle injury gradually
became chronic. Then the strong Teklu had to rely on his walking
sticks to manage a few slow steps forward.
</P>
<P>
He consulted some specialists in many places for about half a
year, but no improvement was found.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, before he was ready to go to Europe to continue
his search for treatment his friend suggested him to go to see
Chinese acupuncturist in Adama Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Only 40 days of treatment by Chinese doctors in the hospital,
the manager recovered from his disease and went back to his work.
He can now drive his car to the hotel the same as he did before
the nightmare injury.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Gao Zhigang, an acupuncturist, was assigned to work in
Ethiopia by the Chinese government in August of 1996 as a member
of the ninth Chinese medical team.
</P>
<P>
According to the registered record, he has treated 13,000
patients who suffered from sciatica, lumbago, arthritis,
hemiplegia, etc.
</P>
<P>
He gave acupuncture treatment for about 30 patients daily
during his first days in Adama Hospital. As more and more
patients come to the hospital, his patients increased up to 60
patients a day.
</P>
<P>
Many patients came afar to Adama Hospital from different
regions of the country on Gao's reputation. Some even came from
the neighboring countries, as Eritrea, Somalia, Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
Many Patients with difficult and complicated cases have been
cured through Chinese acupuncture in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Some who had been paralyzed find their standing-up stories go
like legends in their communities and the whole Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's governmental media, including Ethiopian News
Agency, state-run newspaper "Addis Zemen", Radio Ethiopia and
Ethiopian Television, vie with eath other to cover news of
Chinese acupuncture for curing paralyzed patients.
</P>
<P>
The media seem to have given wings to news of Chinese
Acupuncture wonders, so more and more patients are streaming to
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The medical director of the hospital has to try his best to
expand the acupuncture room from one to two, and beds from three
to eight.
</P>
<P>
Currently, doctor Gao has been treating an average of 50
patients daily. Many more have to wait for two or three months
for their turns.
</P>
<P>
A student from Addis Ababa University told Xinhua that he came
from Shashaman Town, 250 kms away from Nazareth, because he had
facial palsy for two years.
</P>
<P>
He got satisfying results only for 10-days of needle
treatment, with his facial muscle back to function.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has one desire, that is, the Chinese
government can send more acupuncturists to Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> More State-Owned Cinemas to Be Privatized in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen more state-owned cinemas
in various cities of Myanmar will be privatized in the form of
leasing out to local private entrepreneurs or government
employees' organizations for continuous business operation,
according to a notification of the Myanmar Information Ministry
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The cinemas under the ministry's Motion Picture Enterprise
including those in Yangon, Mandalay, Myitkyina, Mawlamyine,
Taungngu and Hinthada, will be allowed to run the business
beginning July 25 when related contracts are reached.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, over 100 other state-run cinemas in various
states and divisions, and some 42 factories and two livestock
breeding farms under other ministries were designated to be sold
through competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than two dozen state-owned saw mills in the
country have been reportedly privatized.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar announced privatization of 51 state-owned
economic enterprises (SEEs) in the first phase in January 1995,
the privatization process has been underway in various forms
including auctioning and leasing out the SEEs or establishing
joint ventures with local and foreign entrepreneurs or operating
either under buy-back or counter-trade system.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Egypt Need to Expand Cooperation: Iranian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said here Wednesday that Iran and Egypt, as two
important countries in the Middle East region, should expand their
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Kharrazi said that Iran and
Egypt have found the ground for mutual understanding, and need to
cooperate further, considering the important developments in the
region and Israel's expansionist policies.
</P>
<P>
He did not mention any possible upgrading of relations. But,
during past months, officials of the two countries have voiced
readiness to improve the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said on Sunday that the two
sides are in contact and the bilateral trade and economic
relations are growing.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations between Tehran and Cairo were severed in
1979 after Egypt granted asylum to the ousted Iranian shah. In
1991, they agreed to open interests offices in each other's
capital as a prelude to normalizing relations.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Iran's relations with the rest of the world based
on mutual respect, dialogue and consultation have entered a new
era since President Mohammad Khatami came to power last August.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Saudi Arabia have turned a new chapter in their
relations, particularly in the political field, as a result of
exchange of visits by senior officials, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tehran-Riyadh economic cooperation is keeping pace with warming
political climate, he said, adding Iran is content with expanding
relations with Saudi Arabia, a key country in the Gulf and the
Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a forthcoming ministerial meeting of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in Rabat, Morocco,
Kharrazi expressed hope that it would take decisive measures
against Israeli expansionist policies, particularly that of
judaization of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On June 21, the Israeli government approved a plan to expand
the municipal authority of Jerusalem over eight Jewish settlements
in the West Bank, regarded by the Muslim world as an attempt to
change the status of the holy city.
</P>
<P>
The OIC has decided to hold an emergency meeting to explore
ways of confronting the Israeli move.

<HEADLINE> China to Boost Automotive Market (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In addition to prices, quality, fees and performance also
represent the important factors consumers consider when purchasing
motor vehicles, Teng noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that some local governments have adopted various
measures beyond pricing to limit the number of automobiles
purchased by individuals.
</P>
<P>
Teng added that most Chinese manufacturers lack product lines
which fulfill the demands of middle income households hoping to
purchase medium to low cost vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The market still lack mechanisms to prevent price wars which
damage the interests of manufacturers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Recent projections indicate that individuals purchase more
automobile than institutions for the first time ever during
1998. However, reports also indicate that growing problems are
expected in terms of after-sales services.
</P>
<P>
A recent investigation conducted by the quality control
department in northwest China's Shaanxi Province revealed the
inferiority of some 60 percent of products on local automotive
parts markets.
</P>
<P>
China has addressed related problems by adopting a strategy
urging hundreds of the nation's automotive manufacturers to form
as many as five enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the automotive industry will achieve a
total output of between 1.65 million and 1.7 million units and
total sales of as many as 1.66 million unit during 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, they caution that effective measures must be adopted
to promote automotive market in order to ensure the targeted
economic growth rate of eight percent.

<HEADLINE> Australian Share Market Pushed Lower on Back of Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The overnight slump on Wall
Street rubbed off on the Australian share market Wednesday, with
banks among the blue chip stocks to suffer as the local bourse
slid into negative territory, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index dropped 20.4 points to close
2,767.5 points, with the all industrials index tumbling 25.8
points to 4,856.4 and all resources index sagging 17.5 to close at
its low for the day at 1,082.2 points.
</P>
<P>
Alan Greenspan, the United States Federal Reserve chairman,
sent Wall Street on a dive with the Dow Jones Industrial Average
sliding 105.56 points to 9,190.19 following his comments in
Washington on a potential rise in inflation and concern over the
value of equities.
</P>
<P>
Morgans dealer Neil Gynther said the Wall Street slump fueled
the downward slide in the Australian market.
</P>
<P>
"We think the (U.S.) fall was a bit of an over-reaction to
Greenspan's comments and Wall Street will probably correct itself
tonight," Gynther said.
</P>
<P>
ANZ Securities associate director Michael Sargent said the
sentiment remained cautious and nervous on the Australian market.
</P>
<P>
The bank index shed 36.7 points to 6,061.3, with the "Big 4"
all losing ground.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank slid 23.7 cents, spooked by rumors that
chief executive Don Argus was likely to leave at the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth shares fell 15 cents, ANZ dropped seven cents and
Westpac eased 0.1 cents to 10.62 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the financial sector, AMP fell 9.4 cents, News
Corp. lost 22.3 cents.
</P>
<P>
Telstra installment receipts topped turnover with 13.89 million
 receipts changing hands for 63 million Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the resources side, BHP tumbled 30 cents, while fellow
diversified miners WMC lost seven cents and Rio Tinto gained four
cents.
</P>
<P>
The gold index dropped 20.8 points to 1,113.6, as the price of
the precious metal weakened. The spot price of gold bullion in
Sydney was 294.25 U.S. dollars an ounce, compared with Tuesday's
close of 295.75.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 306.89 million stocks traded for 878.4
million Australian dollars (549 million U.S. dollars), with
falling stocks outnumbering rising stocks 605 to 378.

<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The temporary shiplock at the
Three Gorges Dam Project resumed operation at eight o'clock today
after being shut down for 11 days because of recent heavy floods.
</P>
<P>
It took about 20 minutes for the first six ships that were
blocked at Maoping Port in Yichang City, site of the Three Gorges
Dam Project, to pass through the shiplock this morning.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,098 passenger and cargo ships have been stranded
at the port for the past few days and the 165,000 passengers on
board have been moved to safety.
</P>
<P>
Ships can pass through the shiplock safely when the water flow
through the Three Gorges Dam Project drops below 45,000 cubic
meters per second, according to a spokesman for the Yangtze
Navigation Administration Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He said that the water flow was measured at 41,000 cubic meters
per seconds at 5:00 pm today, which means that the shiplock is
safe for ships to pass.
</P>
<P>
However, the river canal at the Three Gorges Dam will not be
open until the water flow drops further.
</P>
<P>
According to weather forecasts, heavy rains might fall at the
upper reaches of Yangtze River in the next few days, and the Three
Gorges Dam may have to suspend navigation for a third time if the
water flow reaches 45,000 cubic meters again.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A workshop dating back to the
Old Stone Age recently unearthed in Luoyang, Henan Province, once
again proves that central China was a melting pot for southern and
northern Chinese cultures.
</P>
<P>
The site, located in Beiyao at the foot of Mangshan Mountain,
has yielded a large cache of stone articles.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists believe the site was a workshop for producing
stone articles during the middle to late periods of the Old Stone
Age some 200,000 years ago. They point out that stone articles
with quite different characteristics provide a piece of important
evidence proving that central China was a melting pot for southern

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China's Township enterprises
recorded an incremental value of 1,016.3 billion yuan for the
first half of this year, up 14.3 percent on the previous year's
period, according to recent statistics from the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents growth of 0.8 percentage points on May,
according to the ministry's Department of Township Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses maintained rapid development with the growth
rate of 17.25 percent, or some 11 percentage points higher than
the figure for collective enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises also recorded a 5.5 percent rise in
exports to 272.5 billion yuan. The figure was 10.9 percentage
points lower than last year's same period, but 1.1 percentage
points higher than the May level.
</P>
<P>
The ministry pointed out that township enterprises continue to
face difficulties related to sluggish markets and falling
profits. The 92.4 percent sales/production ratio for township
enterprises during the period was 2.5 percentage points lower than
the national average.
</P>
<P>
Some 7.2 percent collective township enterprises sustained
losses, up 1.2 percentage points on 1997.
</P>
<P>
A ministry analysis of the overall operations of related
enterprises noted that the targeted growth rate of 18 percent will
be very difficult to achieve. It also pointed out time will be
required to realize the effectiveness of certain macroeconomic
policies designed to boost the economy, including increasing
investments and stimulating internal demand.
</P>
<P>
The ministry urged local governments to extend the greatest
possible efforts to help achieve the target set and suggested the
development of economy of scale and the introduction of
technological upgrades.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa to Have Gas-Fired Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Two gas-fired power stations
will be built in Namibia and South Africa in the next six years,
which would be the first gas-fired power plants in southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Shell Exploration and Production Namibia Tuesday
announced plans to built the two stations, the first at
Oranjemund, on the Namibian coast near the border with South
Africa, and the second in Cape Town, Business Day paper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both would use the gas from the Kudu field, 107 kilometers off
the Namibian coast, the company officials said in Windhoek.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project, which includes development of
offshore facilities, a pipeline to Oranjemund, and a 750 MW power
plant and its associated power transmission connection, requires
about 5.3 billion Rand (855 million U.S. Dollars) of capital
investment.
</P>
<P>
The company said it was expected to be in operation by 2002
and half the power would be exported to South Africa's Western
Cape Province, which lacks strong primary fuel support.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the project is to pipe the Namibian gas to
South Africa's Western Cape Province to feed a new power station
in Cape Town as well as support the province's industrial steel
production.
</P>
<P>
Shell's investment in phase two was estimated at 9 billion
Rand (1.45 billion Dollars), including that for offshore
infrastructure development, an overland pipeline to the Western
Cape, and the power station in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The company said the second phase was planned to be in
production toward the end of 2003 and it would bring about
significant benefits for Namibia and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> 1stLd Writethru: Iranian Majlis Approves Naming of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative-dominated
Majlis (parliament) on Wednesday approved the nomination by
President Mahammad Khatami of Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari as the new
interior minister.
</P>
<P>
Lari, who is vice president for legal and parliamentary
affairs, won a vote of confidence following a four-hour heated
debate at the 270-seat Majlis' opening session.
</P>
<P>
Lari won 177 votes out of a total of 266, with 67 against and
22 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Khatami nominated Lari for the post on July 15, after Adollah
Nouri, the previous interior minister who bore the brunt for
allowing pro-government political demonstrations across the
country, was impeached by the Majlis last month.
</P>
<P>
In order to convince the right-wing parliamentarians, Khatami
personally attended session and urged the lawmakers to support his
government through a vote of confidence to Lari.
</P>
<P>
He praised Lari as a "clear-sighted, rational and committed
personality" in the country, "who is fully capable of performing
his duties, and serves as a consolidating factor within the
government."
</P>
<P>
Khatami said he believed Lari's experiences in and knowledge
about the Majlis would help consolidate the relations between the
government and the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Lari, 44, once served as a Majlis member and was appointed a
vice president after Khatami was elected president May last year
in a landslide victory over the conservative candidate, Majlis
speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Before the Majlis debate, Lari attended a meeting of the
right-wing legislators Tuesday night, answering questions about
his belief in the supreme leadership, his attitude towards the
Guardians Council and the Constitution as well as his future
program.
</P>
<P>
A leading conservative lawmaker, Mohammad Reza Bahonar, said
the Majlis majority faction (conservative) decided to approve

<HEADLINE> Russian Oil Firms Blame Government for Yielding to IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Eight oil and gas conglomerates in
Russia Wednesday accused the government of yielding to the
pressure of international financial institutions and pursuing
policies "fraught with serious social consequences."
</P>
<P>
In a message sent to President Boris Yeltsin, the eight
companies -- YUKOS, LUK, Gazprom, Sidanko, Sibneft,
Surgutneftegaz, Tyumen and Eastern Oil Company -- said that the
international lending agencies' policy toward the Russian basic
industries was "irresponsible," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"It deepens the crisis, aggravates the social situation and is
fraught with bankruptcy of enterprises which are (otherwise) able
to work efficiently," the message added.
</P>
<P>
They warned of "irreversible social and economic consequences"
which could happen over the next two or three months.
</P>
<P>
They believed that the perceived social and economic disorder
ahead would be "a direct consequence of actions by the government
which had sufficient possibilities to influence the situation."
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Monday announced to
provide 11.2 billion U.S. dollars to support the Russian
government's economic program for 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Small Businesses Embrace Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Small businesses in the United
States accessing the Internet increased dramatically from 19.7
percent in 1996 to 41.2 percent in 1998, according to a new study
of the International Data Corp (IDC).
</P>
<P>
IDC's survey of 1,011 U.S. firms with fewer than 100 employees
confirmed the dramatic growth of small business online cuts across
all company size categories.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of companies with under five employees that
access the Internet more than doubled from 1996 to 1997, climbing
from 17.2 percent to 36.4 percent. However, smaller companies do
lag behind larger ones in overall online penetration.
</P>
<P>
The Internet is widely viewed as a vital business resource for
specific industry and competitive information. Small businesses
are overwhelmingly accepting the Internet as critical to the
operation and management of their business.
</P>
<P>
IDC's study shows Internet usage among U.S. small businesses is
gaining momentum, with penetration forecast to approach 4.3
million small firms by 2001.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that the professional service sector, such
as law firms, insurance agencies, real estate agencies and
accounting firms, leads in Internet usage, with 63 percent of PC
owners online.
</P>
<P>
Among the laggards are retail and health care industries.
Internet users in manufacturing companies log onto the Internet
most frequently and for the broadest range of applications.
</P>
<P>
PC-owning small business with home pages will increase from 9
percent in 1997 to 20.1 percent by 2001, according to IDC.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six percent of small businesses that plan to go online
expect to use the Internet to sell products.

<HEADLINE> Joint Year 2000 Council Has New Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. banker Roger W. Ferguson
Jr. has become chairman of the Joint Year 2000 Council, according
to a press released Tuesday by the Basel-based Bank for
International Settlements (BIS).
</P>
<P>
The Joint Year 2000 Council, formed in April 1998, is meant to
ensure a high level of attention to the Year 2000 computer problem
(Y2K) on the part of the global financial supervisory community.
</P>
<P>
The Year 2000 computer problem, also known as "millennium bug,"
will cause many computers to recognize the new millennium as the
year 1900. Many computers and programs read only two digits for
the year and cannot tell 2000 from 1900.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to have been selected to chair the Joint Year
2000 Council," said Ferguson, who is a member of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
</P>
<P>
"Preparing for the Year 2000 is of vital interest globally," he
added. "I am eager to work with the council to provide guidance
and assistance for financial supervisors and market participants
in all countries regarding the steps they need to take to meet the
challenge."
</P>
<P>
The Joint Year 2000 Council comprises senior representatives of
its four sponsoring organizations: the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, the
International Association of Insurance Supervisors and the
International Organization of Securities Commissions. Its
secretariat is provided by the BIS.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's New Transition Plan Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's new transition to civil
rule program due to end May 29, 1999 have received general
welcome from both internal and the international society.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson
welcomed the announcement of release of political prisoners,
respect for human rights and free elections, as made by Nigerian
Head of State, General Abdulsalam Abubakar in a national
broadcast Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Robinson said in Geneva Tuesday that her office was "ready to
assist Nigeria's success in its process of transition, which in
order to be successful must take full account of all human
rights."
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Secretary-General Chief Emeka Anyaoku said the
new program was further evidence of Abubakar's commitment to
national reconciliation and establishment of a credible process
to democracy in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"It is my sincere hope that the new transition program
announced by the Head of State will lead to an open transparent
political process in which Nigerians can participate," Anyaoku
said Tuesday on the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
</P>
<P>
He announced that the Commonwealth will watch closely the
implementation of the program, adding that Nigeria's suspension
from the organization will remain until the civilian government
was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom also welcomed the development. A Foreign
Office statement said Britain will persuade its European Union
partners to remove the visa ban on senior Nigerian officials,
which, it said would help the transition program and promote
constructive dialog.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd who recently visited
Nigeria said: "This is the best news we have had from Nigeria for
a long time."
</P>
<P>
U.S State Department Spokesman James Rubin said on the Voice
of America (VOA) that Abubakar's "reform goals meet U.S. concerns
and conform largely with U.S. recommendations for Abuja."
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Japan also gave their support to the new
transition program.
</P>
<P>
Within Nigeria, the program had also been well received, but
with apparent cautions.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji M.D. Yusuf, a presidential aspirant under the
transition program of General Sani Abacha said in Lagos that
Abubakar's broadcast contained some solutions to fundamental
problems facing the nation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed disappointment over the extension of military's
hand over date from October to May next year, but quickly added
that the explanations by Abubakar "are quite acceptable."
</P>
<P>
Former Supreme Court Judge Kayode Eso said the program is
excellent and prayed that it will not be hijacked.
</P>
<P>
Former Speaker of House of Representatives, Chief Agunwa
Anaekwe said he believes that the transition program is real and
achievable. As for the dissolved parties, he said the injury was
caused by the parties themselves so they should not complain.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Calls for More International Efforts on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
urged the international community to make greater efforts to stop
the escalating Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Wednesday, Kinkel described the recent
escalation of armed conflict in Yugoslavia's Serbian province of
Kosovo as "extremely alarming."
</P>
<P>
"The danger that this conflict would spin out of control is
increasing," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Under current circumstances, the world community must
strengthen its peace efforts, Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
The six-nation Contact Group, the European Union (EU) and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) must
help find a way out of the impasse of violence and military
confrontation in Kosovo, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kinkel noted that EU countries were discussing the
possibility to play a "more visible role" in dealing with the
Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
"It is now necessary to act swiftly and effectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Kinkel also reiterated that there was no
alternative to a political solution to Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
The solution must be aimed firstly to arrange a status for
Kosovo to secure the interests and rights of all ethnic groups and
to preserve territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and other
countries in the region, he added.

<HEADLINE> UK to Press EU to Lift Ban on Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain pledged Tuesday to ensure
an early lifting of the travel sanctions imposed on senior
Nigerian government officials by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The move made just as the Commonwealth assured that a return
to credible democracy will facilitate the country's return to its
fold, would promote constructive dialog as well as ensure the
success of the political transition program unveiled by Nigerian
Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar Monday night, the Daily
Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting London's view, Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd
said General Abubakar's statement committing himself to the
restoration of democratic civilian government next May after free
and fair elections and his undertaking to respect human rights
and democracy were commendable.
</P>
<P>
"This is the best news we have heard from Nigeria for a long
time," the minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Britain is ready to help General Abubakar and his new
administration with the speedy and credible implementation of
this difficult but essential program," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Britain will work to ensure that EU partners
allow Nigerian government officials to visit EU member states
where this would help General Abubakar's program and promote
constructive dialog.
</P>
<P>
In a nationally televised address Monday night, General
Abubakar announced that the date for the military to hand over
power to a civilian government was re-set on May 29 next year,
against the October 1, 1998 date fixed by his predecessor General
Sani Abacha who died of heart attack on June 8.
</P>
<P>
The extension is made for fresh elections to be held,
involving all Nigerians irrespective of their political leanings
or tribal backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar also announced the release of all political prisoners
in the country, among other things.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Britain and the Commonwealth, United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the governments of the United
States, Japan and South Africa have also expressed welcome to the
new transition program.
</P>
<P>
The positive response from the international community so far
is seen by analysts here as a major breakthrough for the present
military administration in this most populous African country.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Share prices extended their
losses on Singapore Stock Market after taking a hammering on
Tuesday when the market ended 3 percent lower from the previous
day.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) Wednesday
dropped 9.80 points to close at 1052.66 points, reacting to
overnight weakness on Wall Street and a slide in regional
currencies as well as a decline in global semiconductor prices.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover was 108.77 million shares, valued at 218.64
million Singapore dollars (about 127.93 million U.S. dollars).
Falls outstripped rises by 206 to 60, while 323 stocks remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
TAC 200 remained the most active stock as it finished on a
turnover of 7.10 million units. It was followed by UIC which had
6.53 million counters done. MBF was next with 6.23 million shares
changing hands.
</P>
<P>
CenProp was the top gainer of the day as it edged up 45 cents
to finish at 9.65 Singapore dollars. Asean inched up 20 cents to
end at 6.00 U.S. dollars. RothmansI was up 20 cents to close at
8.10 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creative 50 remained the biggest loser of the
day as it lost 60 cents to end 20.30 Singapore dollars. KepFELS
shed by 40 cents to finish at 3.86 Singapore dollars while SIA F
slipped by 40 cents to finish at 8.40 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the more than 100 points drop in DOW on Tuesday
was in part fueled by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's warning about the economy's inflationary risks.
</P>
<P>
They said market players in the U.S. liquidated stocks even
though Greenspan gave no indication of a change in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The news that global semiconductor prices fell 25 percent in
the second quarter of 1998 also contributed to the losses.

He praised Lari as a "clear-sighted, rational and committed
personality" in the country, "who is fully capable of performing
his duties, and serves as a consolidating factor within the
government."
</P>
<P>
Khatami said he believed Lari's experiences in and knowledge
about the Majlis would help consolidate the relations between the
government and the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Lari, 44, once served as a Majlis member and was appointed as
vice president for legal and parliamentary affairs after Khatami
was elected as president in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Before the Majlis debate, Lari joined a meeting of the
right-wing legislators Tuesday night, answering questions about
his belief in the supreme leadership, his attitude towards the
Guardians Council and the Constitution as well as his future plan.
</P>
<P>
A leading conservative lawmaker, Mohammad Reza Bahonar, said
the Majlis majority faction (conservative) decided to give a vote
of confidence to Lari in a bid to reduce tension between the
conservatives and the moderates, although he spoke against him at
the Majlis session, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Factional struggle has become sensitive after the former
interior minister was ousted by the conservative Majlis, and
Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, a close ally of Khatami, was
put on an open trial on embezzlement charges last month.

Despite the Majlis' approval of the new interior minister, the

<HEADLINE> Arab Nations Urged to Tighten Boycott on Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestine Wednesday urged
Arab nations to tighten their boycott on Israeli commodities and
sever whatever form of relationship they may have with Jerusalem
to protest against Israel's adamant attitude towards the
Palestine-Israel peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"We should tighten our boycott on Israeli commodities and
freeze our relations and close our liaison offices established
after the peace process was launched by the U.S.," Palestinian
Foreign Minister Farouk Khadoumi told a news conference here
Wednesday at the end of his five-day visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Arab countries had, since 1996, imposed
sanctions on Israel commodities for violating the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian foreign minister also asked other Islamic
nations to continue to stand by Palestinian side in their
struggle.
</P>
<P>
The support is vital even though the international community
has said that the peace accord was "collapsing" due to Israel's
adamant attitude, he said.
</P>
<P>
To a question on whether terrorism and tensions will re-emerge
as Israel continues to ignore the peace agreement, he said: "I
don't know how the Palestinians can be patient when their living
conditions are becoming worse and worse."
</P>
<P>
He said Israel had contained Palestinian's economy by
controlling its airport and disallowing Palestine from building a
port, among others.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian foreign minister, who called on Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad and had talks with his Malaysian
counterpart Abdullah Ahmad Badawi during the visit, thanked
Malaysia for its continuous support of the Palestinian struggle.
</P>
<P>
He said Palestine would resort to "all means" to defend its
legal national rights and free itself from foreign occupation.

PARIS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In the conflict between the Islamist regime and the southern
 separatists, famine has been used as a weapon. The French
humanitarian organization Medecins sans Frontieres said that from
50,000 to 100,000 people have died of famine in Sudan since the
beginning of this year. The United Nations has also estimated that
 1.5 million people are faced with hunger in southern Sudan and
380,000 of them are in critical conditions.
</P>
<P>
-- A small number of Algerians demonstrated this week in a
number of European capitals trying to ask Europe help them refind
their family members whom they believed have been kidnapped by
military police in Algeria. Some international organizations
estimate that from 12,000 to 20,000 people have disappeared in
Algeria over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The brutal rising of the tension between Yugoslavia and
Albania after last weekend's fighting on their border is worrying
the international community. After the European Union appealed for
 an immediate ceasefire between the Albanian separatists in Kosovo
 and the Yugoslav army, the United States is searching for ``new
ideas'' to contribute to a solution to the Kovoso problem and to
lock the logic of an escalation in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
-- The risk of an aggravation of the Asian financial crisis is
troubling the United States, whose economic slowdown is greatly
attributed to the Asian crisis, said U.S. Federal Board Reserve
President Alan Greenspan on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Nosedive in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices plunged in Tokyo
Wednesday as blue chips fell and banking issues continued their
downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 263.63 points, or 1.59
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 16,293.06.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, fell 19.32 points or 1.51 percent to
1,257.85.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up slightly to an estimated
390 million shares from 363.29 million shares Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday marked the third straight trading day of decline in
the key Nikkei index and resulted in a fall of 438.86 points, or
2.62 percent, over this period.
</P>
<P>
But traders were not worried by the fall, saying the market was
due for a correction after its 640-point, 4 percent rise last week.
</P>
<P>
Investors sold a wide variety of issues, from construction to
retailers, throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
Traders said some selling may have been sparked by news reports
that Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi has gained the initial lead in
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's presidential election as he
won support from the heavyweights of the party.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the index rose on the news that Seiroku Kajiyama
would enter the race for Japan's top political post. The former
chief cabinet secretary is seen as being more aggressive about
banking sector reform than Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,332 issues listed on the First Section, losers
overwhelmed gainers 885 to 250, with 133 issues remaining
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the U.S. dollar climbed to
140.95 yen as declining stock prices slowed purchases of yen.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency was quoted at 140.65-75 yen at 5 p.m. (local
time), up from 140.22-25 yen at 9 a.m. in Tokyo and from 140.30-40
yen late Tuesday in New York.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rainfall hit the Dongting
Lake area in central-south China's Henan Province over the past
few day, adding to problems resulting from torrential rains in
June and once again placing some dikes and dams in great danger.
</P>
<P>
The city of Yueyang recorded a rainfall of 79 mm and strong
winds over a two-hour period on July 20. A pontoon belonging to
the local armed police unit sunk during the storm, with a 600
meter crack opening in the embankment surrounding Caisang Lake.
</P>
<P>
The city has organized 230,000 people and some 140 boats to
fight heavy flooding.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the storms have also created serious problems in a
1,500 meter section of dikes in Linxiang City, with the local
government taking emergency measures to secure all local dikes. In
addition, a 3,000 meter section of recently constructed dikes have
washed away in Huarong County.
</P>
<P>
Water levels along 27 dikes in the lake area remain above the
warning marks.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains have also hit the city of Zhangjiajie and the
Western Hunan Tujia-Miao Autonomous Prefecture over the past two
days, causing damages of varying degrees in 110 villages of three
counties.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Developing Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, is engaged in an extensive effort to
encourage development of the local private sector.
</P>
<P>
The city recently adopted a regulation granting private
ventures the same legal status state-owned firms enjoy in terms of
foreign trade and land-use rights, and obtaining bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also stipulates that private businesses have the
right to determine the legal responsibility of those infringing on
their property rights.
</P>
<P>
The private sector paid 1997 taxes of over 1.37 billion yuan,
or five percent of the city's total industrial and commercial tax
revenue. The sector's work force of some 600,000 laborers
represents close to 30 percent of the total number for state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The sector has also been granted preferential policies to
attract talent people. For example, private firms are allowed to
directly select university graduates, with related firms hiring
over 200 graduates during 1997.
</P>
<P>
A labor contract and compulsory pension system has also been
introduced to guarantee the rights of people working in the
private sector in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The sector has expanded its business scope from the service
industry to wide-ranging areas, including energy, transportation
and real estate. The city has already approved some 40 private
real estate agencies.

<HEADLINE> OIC Urges to Confront Israel's Jerusalem Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Assistant Secretary General of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) Abdel Aziz Abu Ghush
Wednesday stressed the need to confront Israel's expansionist
measures in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Voice of Arabs radio here, Ghush called
for support to the Palestinian people in resisting and confronting
"Israeli plots" and in preserving the Arab and Islamic identity of
the holy city.
</P>
<P>
Ghush urged the OIC's Jerusalem Committee, which is to convene
next week in Moroccan capital Rabat, to come up with serious and
effective resolutions against Israeli high-handed policy.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the international community to shoulder its
responsibility to urge Israel to comply with relevant
U.N. resolutions and statements on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, the fate of Jerusalem will be
negotiated in the Palestinian-Israeli final status talks. Before
that, neither side should take unilateral action to change the
city's status, geographic composition and other characteristics.
</P>
<P>
But on June 21, Israeli cabinet approved a Jerusalem expansion
plan that extend the city's municipal authority to eight Jewish
settlements in the West Bank, which stirred a storm of criticism
inside and outside Israel.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council issued a presidential statement last
week to rebut the Israeli plan as a "serious and damaging
development" in the peace process and to urge Israel not to
proceed with the project.
</P>
<P>
Israel claims Jerusalem as its undivided and eternal capital
while the Palestinians want the Arab East Jerusalem as capital of
their future state.
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiations between the two sides were deadlocked in
March last year when Israel broke ground for a Jewish settlement
in East Jerusalem.

US dollars on the beginning of the year, according to a spokesman
for the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.
</P>

the past six months, in spite of certain negative effects
resultant from the Asian financial crisis, the drastic devaluation
of the Japanese yen in particular.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade surplus reached 22.6 billion US dollars
during the period, with the figure growing by 26.6 percent on the
previous year's period to 4.8 billion US dollars. Direct foreign
investment totaled 20.5 billion US dollars, remaining basically at
the same level recorded during the first half of last year.
</P>
<P>
Supply and demand on the domestic foreign exchange market
remained in balance, with a wide margin growth in foreign exchange
savings on the part of both individuals and enterprises.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tajik President Vows to Catch Murderers of U.N. Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Tajikistan's President Emomali
Rakhmonov pledged Wednesday to find the murderers who killed four
United Nations observers Monday, the Itar-Tass news agency reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov made the pledge during a meeting with Jan Kubis,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to the country.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions were believed to focus on the murder of two
U.N. military observers, a mission councillor and a Tajik driver,
Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Three of the victims were foreigners: Otaka Akino of Japan,
Ryszard Szevczek of Poland and Adolfo Siarpegu of Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
They were killed on their way from the district of Tavildara to
the town of Labidzhar, which is 170 kilometers east of the capital
Dushanbe. All bodies showed gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
The four men were reportedly going on a peace-keeping mission
when attacked.
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the assassination, Kubis said all staff
members of the U.N. mission in Tajikistan are recalled to the
capital from the regions.
</P>
<P>
Khabib Sanginov, head of the Dushanbe-based military
sub-commission of the National Reconciliation Commission, said the
murder was a premeditated act representing a stab in the back of
the whole peace process in Tajikistan and undermining the
country's prestige on the international arena.
</P>
<P>
However, he urged the media not to rush to premature
conclusions implicating some side in the crime, Itar-Tass added.

SHANTOU July 22 (Xinhua) -- A large mural made of ceramic tile
was completed recently in the city of Chaozhou in south China's
Guangdong Province and has already been recognized by the Guiness

<HEADLINE> Stimulatory Policies Will Not Affect Reform Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) - World Bank vice president and chief
economist Joseph Stiglitz today expressed confidence in China's
ability to rise above challenges posed by the financial crisis in
East Asia crisis and fulfill its long-term structural reform
program.
</P>
<P>
"China faces two economic challenges the first being the
transition from a socialist market economy with its own
characteristics, and the second the pursuit of short-term
stimulatory policies without harming the long-term agenda for
structural reform." according to Joseph Stiglitz, senior
vice-president of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's Beijing press conference, Stiglitz praised
China's sound economy and proper economic policies as two factors
enabling the nation to weather the financial storm. Stiglitz
expressed his firm belief that the government's stimulatory
policies will be effective in the short-term, and will not affect
the structural economic program in the long-term.
</P>
<P>
"The two challenges are complementary. China has the wisdom to
recognize the challenges and the capabilities to deal with them
effectively." according to Stiglitz.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the crisis in East Asia has indeed had some
effects on China and has necessitated short-term policies to
stimulate gross domestic demand to ensure sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that the Chinese economy registered a
growth of seven percent during the January-June period, or one
percent lower than the annual target of eight percent. The
economy grew 8.8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz explained that time is most often required to see the
effectiveness of economic policies, with monetary policies usually
having a lag of six to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
His view is obviously shared by Chinese economists, who point
out that increased investment is expected to boost the economy
significantly in the remainder of the year. Investment growth for
the first half year stood at 13.8 percent, up 3.5 percent on the
first quarter, with actual growth for June expected to reach 16.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz stressed the importance for China to maintain strong
growth since the economy is adapted to a high-growth scenario, and
noted that any significant slowing will have a variety of adverse
effects on both unemployment and profitability.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese government is fully aware of
the adverse effects short-term policies might have on the
long-term reform agenda and will continue to emphasize reforms
when adopting related policies to stimulate the economy.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait May Free Jordanian Prisoners: Jordan's FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Foreign Minister Jawad
Anani has said Kuwait may release the last batch of Jordanian
prisoners held in the emirate since 1991, the Jordan Times daily
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have not received anything from the Kuwaiti side on this
issue, but unofficial information indicates that something
regarding this might take place," Anani, who is also a deputy
prime minister for development affairs, said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a step in the right direction towards normalizing
ties between the two countries," the foreign minister said. But he
did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Scores of Jordanians were jailed in Kuwait in 1991 for alleged
collaboration with Iraqi troops during their occupation of the
small Gulf state from August, 1990 to February, 1991.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait set free most of those prisoners in the past two years
except eight who have been sentenced to life imprisonment. Anani's
remarks came amid signs that Kuwait intended to warm up bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
On July 16, Kuwait's Crown Prince Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah
Al-Salem Al-Sabah sent a message to his Jordanian counterpart
Hassan expressing willingness to restore rapprochement and
cooperation with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait froze ties with Jordan after accusing it of siding with
Iraq during the 1990-91 Gulf crisis. It closed the Jordanian
embassy in Kuwait and recalled its ambassador.
</P>
<P>
They normalized relations in 1996, and in July 1997 resumed
commercial flights between each other's capital as an indication
of improved ties.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Following are major news items in
leading Nigerian newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
New Nigerian:
</P>
<P>
-- The new policy measures designed to move Nigeria forward
announced by the military government Monday night have been
welcomed by a cross section of Nigerians, along with the U.S.,
the Commonwealth, Japan and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Daily Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain Tuesday pledged an early lifting of the travel
restrictions imposed on Nigerian government officials by the
European Union in response to the commitment of the head of
state, General Abdulsalam Abubakar, to the restoration of
democratic government by May next year.
</P>
<P>
The Post Express:
</P>
<P>
-- Barely 14 hours after the announcement of the military
government's new transition agenda, a Lagos lawyer and
presidential aspirant Tunji Braithwarte launched a new party
Tuesday, while politicians across the country were gearing subtle
steps toward the formation of more parties.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Ondo State police commissioner Tuesday warned of a possible
escalation of violent crimes in the southern state following the
release at the weekend of 138 convicts from prisons by a mob
after a bloody clash between the police and commercial drivers.
</P>
<P>
The Punch:
</P>
<P>
-- Nigerian leader General Abubakar approved the appointment
of administrators Tuesday "to take charge of the affairs of the
dissolved five political parties until further notice".

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Admission Depends on Poll Results: ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Whether Cambodia can join the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year will be
decided by the results of its elections later this month, an ASEAN
official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The question of the membership of Cambodia in the ASEAN will
depend on the results of the elections of July 26," Lauro Baja,
undersecretary of foreign affairs of the Philippines, told a press
briefing here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Baja, whose country is the chairman of this year's ASEAN annual
meetings, said an ASEAN Senior Officials Meeting, which ended here
earlier Wednesday, discussed regional and international issues,
mainly on Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the ASEAN foreign ministers, who are scheduled to
start meeting here Friday, may decide on Cambodia's membership
depending on the results as assessed by a joint international
observer group, which is already in the country to see if the
polls are free and fair.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN had earlier last year decided to admit Cambodia into the
regional grouping together with Laos and Myanmar, but it later
deferred the admission owing to political turmoil in the country.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The two-day SOM, together with a meeting of the ASEAN Standing
Committee, was held to make preparations for the AMM, including
the consideration of the political part of a joint communique to
be issued by the AMM.
</P>
<P>
Baja said the situation in the region will be one of the main
topics of the AMM, but the senior officials at the meeting had not
reached any decision on whether to issue a separate statement on
the financial situation in the region because most of them had not
received instructions from their countries.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis, which broke out in July last year, has
caused serious problems to some ASEAN member countries, including
drastic currency devaluation and high unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of an ASEAN shift in its policy from
non-intervention in member countries' internal affairs to
"flexible engagement" as proposed by the Philippines and Thailand,
Baja said the SOM had discussed the matter, but it will be up to
the foreign ministers to discuss and make a decision on it.
</P>
<P>
However, according to ASEAN official sources, other members are
not keen on the proposal.

<HEADLINE> IBM to Release Copper Chip This Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 21 (Xinhua) -- IBM's first copper processor,
which uses copper wire rather than aluminum to connect
transistors, will come out later this summer, a computer
information provider reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Code-named Lone Star, the copper processor will run at speeds
of 400 MHz and lower, the Computer Net (CNET) quoted sources close
to the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report added that versions running at 333 MHz and 366 MHz
are expected to be available not later than this september.
</P>
<P>
While the first versions of the chip will only slightly boost
performance over current aluminum microprocessors, future copper
processors are expected to reach speeds up to 1 GHz (1,000 MHz),
experts said.
</P>
<P>
IBM's microprocessor operations often go unnoticed due to the
large shadow cast by chip-giant, the Intel Corporation. But the
release of the copper processors will highlight the Big Blue's
efforts to take the lead in one of the most critical new chip
technologies for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Beyond the shift in metals, IBM will use a 0.18-micron
manufacturing process to produce these chips, a more advanced
technique than Intel currently uses on its production lines.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Strike Hits Philippine Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of members of the
Philippine Airlines Employees Association (PALEA) staged a wildcat
strike early Wednesday morning which may finally sink the
debt-ridden national flag carrier.
</P>
<P>
Labeling the strike as a "reckless and ill-advised action," the
management of the Philippine Airlines (PAL) said in a statement
that the walkout was "illegal" since it was expressly prohibited
by the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
The walkout of ground crew and flight attendants came less than
seven weeks after 625 pilots went on strike in protest of the
implementation of an alleged unfair early retirement policy,
forcing the airline to fire all striking pilots and massively
downsize its operations.
</P>
<P>
The PAL management said it failed to convince PALEA leaders not
to push through with their long-planned wildcat strike after
several weeks of fruitless marathon negotiations under the
auspices of the labor department.
</P>
<P>
The union was protesting the retrenchment of some 2,000 of
their members in line with the PAL's downsizing program under
which about 5,000 of the 13,500-strong workforce of the company
will be laid off in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma assumed
jurisdiction over the latest labor dispute at the PAL and ordered
the PALEA and the PAL management not to exacerbate the situation.
</P>
<P>
The PAL management said earlier that the airline, which is
already under the receivership of the Philippine Securities and
Exchange Commission, would be forced to shut down if its employees
stage another crippling strike.
</P>
<P>
The pilots' strike caused a total of 2 billion pesos (48.9
million U.S. dollars) in lost revenues, according to the PAL which
has incurred huge financial losses annually over the past 12
years. The strike has further aggravated the PAL's financial
situation.
</P>
<P>
In the last fiscal year ending in March 1998, PAL registered
8.1 billion pesos (198 million dollars) in financial losses, the
largest in a single fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the pilots' strike, PAL, controlled by
Filipino-Chinese tycoon Lucio Tan, submitted a rehabilitation plan
to the Securities and Exchange Commission and asked the commission
to help it rehabilitate.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which has yet to be approved by the commission,
includes the layoff of one-third of its workforce, disposal of 40
of its 54 airplanes and suspension of many international and
domestic flight routes.
</P>
<P>
The PAL management said it will try to maintain limited
operations after the walkout of its ground crews and flight
attendants.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Buy 50 U.S. Choppers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is to buy from the United
States Sikorsky Company 50 S-70 Black Hawk helicopters and eight
CH-53E Super Stallion heavy-lift platforms worth 700 million
U.S. dollars, the Daily News newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish government and Sikorsky are close to an agreement
for the utility and heavy-lift helicopter transfers, although
modalities of the possible deal are still under discussion," said
a senior government official, who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
"Recently there has been a need for urgent acquisition of
utility helicopters that would be met through the Black Hawk
deal," he said.
</P>
<P>
If done, the deal would mark a major blow to the Franco-German
consortium Eurocopter, which always aims to expand their share on
the Turkish military jet market, defense sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sikorsky's intention regarding the copters came in early June
shortly after the French National Assembly officially passed a
motion condemning the alleged massacre of Armenians during the
rule of the Ottoman Empire early this century.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military has warned that the Turkish-French defense
cooperation would be undermined if the French legislature
continued debating the motion.
</P>
<P>
As a military power in the region, Turkey can only meet 20
percent of its defense equipment and has to purchase large amounts
of weapons and other equipments from the U.S. and other Western
countries.

<HEADLINE> Bank Interest Rates Decline in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Interest rates in Kenya continued
falling in the money market for the second week running,
according to a weekly update of the Central Bank of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The interbank borrowing declined to 15.88 percent in the week
to July 17, from 16.87 percent in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The 91-day Treasury Bill rate fell from 24.74 percent in the
auction dated July 13 to 24.57 percent in July 20 auction.
</P>
<P>
The average base lending rate for commercial banks also fell
from 27.78 percent to 27.76 percent in the week to Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the down trend is a result of a general decline
in interest rates by a number of commercial banks in the wake of
the budget reading in June.
</P>
<P>
However, 1998 marks the seventh year since interest rates on
lending rose to well above 15 percent, according to an Optimum
Research report.
</P>
<P>
Over these seven years, Kenya has witnessed some of the lowest
levels of economic growth, and the highest levels of unemployment
and economic retrogression.
</P>
<P>
If the interest rates don't go below the 15 percent mark this
year, 1998 will be another tough year for the Kenyan economy as
the high rate constrains growth in investment, and causes
consumption in the economy to contract demand to fall, the
analysts warn.

<HEADLINE> 671 Kony Rebels Captured in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Uganda People's Defense Forces
(UPDF) have captured 671 rebels of Lord Resistance Army (LRA)
spearheaded by Joseph Kony in its recent incursion into Uganda
from Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The UPDF also killed 179 LRA rebels and recovered 180 rifles
during different clashes between April and June this year, the
army's information director Captain Shaban Bantariza was quoted
by Wednesday's New Vision daily as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Out of 671 captives, 300 were accomplished rebels.
Those are people who qualify to die without going home but they
are with us. The others were captives still going under
training."
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made in response to a statement by a ruling
party delegate at the national conference that the military
commanders in northern districts have abandoned war for private
business.
</P>
<P>
On July 15, 16 and 17, two rebels surrendered and two others
killed. Some 27 abductees were rescued.
</P>
<P>
On July 18, about 100 rebels of the Uganda National Salvage
Front II attacked a UPDF detachment at Medigo, West Nile. The
government army killed nine rebels and their leader Alidiga
Kelili.
</P>
<P>
"You can't abandon war for riches and at the same time get
these achievements," the army spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, President Yoweri Museveni told a press
conference that Kony lost some 600 rebels in clashes with the
UPDF over the last two months.
</P>
<P>
He said only when the rebels stop wrongdoing and confine
themselves to their base in southern Sudan can a real cease-fire
be possibly realized.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Takes Steps to Promote Labor Manpower Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh authority has decided
to open labor wings at Bangladeshi embassies in Dubai, Seoul and
Singapore to explore new labor markets and ensure welfare of the
expatriate workers there, press reports here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting of the cabinet committee on
employment of Bangladeshi nationals in foreign countries held here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Bangladesh will also take initiatives to explore new
labor markets in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Malawi, Labor
and Manpower Secretary Ali Sarkar was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Committee of the Bangladesh's National Economic
Council on July 20 approved a proposed target of manpower export
for the year 1998, according to which the country will export some
222,500 Bangladeshi workers to different countries.
</P>
<P>
About 119,000 workers have already been sent abroad in the six
months to June this year.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh exports manpower mainly to such countries as Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain,
Singapore, Malaysia, Libya and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Manpower export is a major foreign exchange earner for the
country. Remittance from the expatriate wage earners in the July
1997-June 1998 fiscal year rose to 65.4 billion taka (about 1.39
billion U.S. dollars), up 3.61 percent from the previous fiscal
year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Set up More HIV Testing Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Five more voluntary HIV
counseling and testing centers will be set up in Zimbabwe this
year as the government tries to encourage people to open up about
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Evidence from around the world has shown that infection levels
go down where voluntary counseling and testing is provided, the
daily Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, which in the late 1980s had infection levels at 30
percent, infection levels have gone down and this has been partly
attributed to availability of counseling and testing services.
</P>
<P>
Most people who turned out to be HIV positive are known to
have changed their behavior and this helped in keeping the
infection rate down.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Herald Tuesday, Zimbabwean Deputy
Minister of Health and Child Welfare David Parirenyatwa said the
walk-in centers were meant to give easy access to people wanting
to have their sero-status checked.
</P>
<P>
"These centers will offer quick counseling and testing
services free of unnecessary protocols and bureaucracies. The
centers will strive to be as patient-friendly as possible," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.5 million Zimbabweans are estimated to be infected
with HIV. This means that one in every four people has the HIV
virus.

SHENYANG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Yingkou Economic and
Technological Development Zone in northeast China's Liaoning
Province approved 10 foreign-funded projects with investments of
over 10 million US dollars during the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The projects, valued at over 234 million US dollars, were
mostly funded by American and European investors. The majority of
the projects involve industrial production in areas such as solar
energy equipment, zinc plates, new types of bricks and kitchen
equipment, with approximately half of the projects in operation.
</P>
<P>
The state-level development zone, established in 1988 in the
coastal city of Yingkou, has amassed well over eight billion yuan
in fixed assets investment, and has introduced 1.1 billion US
dollars in foreign investments from 22 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The zone plans to place priority on the use of funds from
Europe and America rather that Southeast Asia, and will extend
great effort to further improve the local investment environment.

ZHENGZHOU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
had approved 1,005 Taiwan-financed companies by this May, with 996
million U.S. dollars worth of investment.
</P>
<P>
About 600 million dollars of that came from Taiwan, according
to the provincial government's Taiwan Affairs Office. The
companies are mainly in the chemical, light industry, textiles,
power, pharmaceutical, and building materials sectors.
</P>
<P>
Henan has plenty of natural resources and an economy that is
complementary with Taiwan, whose investors first came here in 1988.
</P>
<P>
For the past several years, the government has had a policy of
encouraging overseas investment in central and western parts of
the country and an increasing number of Taiwan investors have
begun shifting investment from coastal areas to inland areas.
</P>
<P>
To attract more investors from Taiwan, the province has been
improving investment conditions and policies that protect the
rights and interests of investors.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Up 66 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan's trade surplus from January
through June rose 66 percent from the same period last year due to
a decline in imports and depreciation of the yen against the
U.S. dollar, the Finance Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus stood at 6,566.7 billion yen (about 48.8
billion dollars), up for the third consecutive six-month period,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Exports edged up 2.2 percent to 25,267.7 billion yen (about
187.7 billion dollars), up for the eighth straight half-year term,
while imports marked the first fall since 1994, coming to 18,701
billion yen (about 138.9 billion dollars), down 9.9 percent from
the year-earlier level, it said.
</P>
<P>
The average foreign exchange rate used for the six-month report
was 134.6 yen to the dollar, compared with 120.41 yen a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
In trade with the United States, Japan's surplus grew 37.7
percent from the same period last year to 3,073.7 billion yen
(about 22.8 billion dollars), up for the fourth straight half-year
period.
</P>
<P>
The surplus with the European Union (EU) jumped 89.7 percent to
2,015.3 billion yen (about 15 billion dollars), while that with
the financially troubled Asian countries, fell to 2,078.3 billion
yen (about 15.4 billion dollars), down 26.8 percent from the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
"Exports to the U.S. and EU remained favorable, reflecting the
sound state of the economies in these regions, but those to Asian
countries were stagnant," a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
"Expanding tempo of the trade surplus is expected to slow, as
the government's comprehensive economic stimulus package will
bring about positive impacts on the Japanese economy soon," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
An economist at a private financial institution, however,
expressed doubt about the effect of the stimulus package, saying
that it is unlikely to boost Japan's imports dramatically.

<HEADLINE> Spain Signs Two Accords With Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria and Spain signed two
agreements here on Tuesday to cooperate in combatting organized
crime and developing tourism.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference following the signing ceremony,
visiting Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar stressed the
significance of the agreement on issues relating to Bulgaria's
debt to Spain, the main obstacle to improving bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Aznar said the Bulgarian government plans to come up with a
final solution to the problem in 2.5 months.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's privatization program provides solid ground for
promoting trade and economic relations between the two countries,
Aznar said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov said the problems will be
settled through a debt for equity swap.
</P>
<P>
Apart from tourism and combatting organized crime, priorities
in future bilateral relations include inviting Spanish investment
to Bulgaria and boosting the commercial exchange.
</P>
<P>
Spain has already taken steps to relax the visa requirements
for Bulgarians, Aznar said. He stressed the need for tighter
controls in Bulgaria on visas for citizens from other countries
because of the problems of illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Aznar reiterated the support of Spain for
Bulgaria's efforts to join the European Union and NATO. He also
described the efforts of the Bulgarian government on reform as "a
real revolution that should be supported by all EU member states."
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov met with Spanish Prime
Minister Aznar the same day.
</P>
<P>
Aznar conveyed to President Stoyanov and Prime Minister Kostov
an invitation from Spanish King Juan Carlos to visit Spain next
year.

ROME, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government, led by Prime
Minister Romano Prodi, won a confidence vote by 176 to 119 with
one abstention in the Senate on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The government is very likely to win confidence vote of the
Chamber with the support of the Senate, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech before the vote, Prodi said that the country was in
a new round of great reform, and called for "strong, decisive and
determined" support from all parties.
</P>
<P>
The confidence vote was conducted because of the differences
between the government and the Communist Refoundation Party (CR)
on the new economic policy and system reform.
</P>
<P>
The CR urged the government to give first priority to the
problems of unemployment and the great gap between the rich and
the poor in the southern area.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on development of the country's economy, the
government promised to consider appropriating money to that
region.

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese Financial Institutions Prevent Unjust Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Some provincial level financial
institutions in China's Guangdong Province have reached an
agreement on foreign exchange practices and dealing with unfair
competition.
</P>
<P>
The financial institutions have agreed to act in line with the
"rules for foreign exchange-related financial institutions in
Guangdong" to make a more favorable competitive environment for
the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Lu Nanping, the deputy director of the State Foreign Exchange
Administration, says that the self-imposed rules are an attempt by
local financial institutions to eliminate chaos in the foreign
exchange business and to reduce risks.
</P>
<P>
Some financial institutions didn't follow government
restrictions in their business in the past and the resulting chaos
not only harms them but also endangers the state by causing
financial turmoil, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The self-emposed rules call for the heads of 18 financial
institutions to meet regularly to review business practices. The
18 institutions involved have called for their business colleagues
to follow central bank regulations and to prepare sufficient
reserves to cover foreign exchange deposits.

<HEADLINE> India, U.S. Want to See Pakistan Stable, Secure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- India and the United States have
agreed that it is in their respective national interests to see
Pakistan as a stable and secure country, the Times of India
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is said to be the most important agreement arrived at
during the third round of talks between India and the U.S.
concluded here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day talks primarily on nuclear non-proliferation and
disarmament between U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
and the Indian Prime Minister's special envoy Jaswant Singh ended
without tangible results though both sides described them as
"constructive and ongoing".
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, India had conveyed three messages to
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
First, India is not an adversary of the U.S. and there are only
two issues which are not negotiable between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has insisted that India should roll back or freeze
its nuclear weaponisation and missile programs while India has
made it clear that this is not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
Second, India asked Talbott to make it clear to his Pakistani
hosts that it would be self-defeating for Pakistan to link its
nuclear status with the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
And the third, India has spared no effort to make the U.S. into
believing that a nuclear India is a responsible power and its
foreign policy is not Pakistan-centric.
</P>
<P>
"We tried to dispel Washington's faulty impression that our
foreign and security policies would lead to war with Pakistan,"
the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Earnings From Agriculture on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka earned 338.46 million
U.S. dollars from agricultural exports during the first five
months this year, an increase of 26 percent over the corresponding
period last year, according to Agricultural Ministry sources
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A major share of the total agricultural earnings reflects the
earnings from tea during the period, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to available statistics tea fetched 261.5 million
dollars, showing a 37 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tea production increased from 76.6 million kilograms
during the same period last year to 81.3 million kilograms this
year, with an increase of six percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Sri Lanka's other two major traditional items coconut
and rubber showed a negative growth so far this year, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1998 rubber production declined from
42.2 million kilograms in the previous year to 32.1 million
kilograms this year.

<HEADLINE> 29 Districts Flooded, 6.4 Mln Affected in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's 29 districts out of the
total of 64 had been flooded, with 6.4 million people affected
till Tuesday, press reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official death toll caused by flood rose to 48, but
unofficial sources put the figure at about 100, the reports added.
</P>
<P>
The flood situation deteriorated again Tuesday with fresh
floods in the north and northwestern districts and inundation of
new areas in central districts following incessant rain in the
past few days, according to a bulletin of the Flood Information
Center (FIC).
</P>
<P>
All the major rivers in the country's four basins were still
flowing well above the danger level, the FIC said.
</P>
<P>
The Brahmaputra river was flowing 20 cm and 33 cm above danger
mark at two places, while the Ganges was running 30-57 cm above
danger level at three places.
</P>
<P>
The center forecast that the flood situation in the
Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna basins might aggravate further with
rise of water levels in most of the rivers while the situation in
the southeastern hill basin would improve in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Various flood-borne diseases like diarrhea and dysentery have
broken out in many flood-hit districts as acute crisis of drinking
water was prevailing in those areas, reports noted.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief has already
allocated over 2.2 million taka (about 46,800 U.S. dollars) and
2,175 tons of rice and other relief materials to the flood-hit
people.
</P>
<P>
The relief work is going on as the flood situation aggravates
further in many places of the country.
</P>
<P>
There are frequent heavy rains in the July-October monsoon
season in this South Asian country.

<P>
HANOI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has officially revised its
major 1998 economic targets downward, including a projected gross
domestic product (GDP) growth from nine percent to between six and
seven percent.
</P>
<P>
The standing committee of Vietnam's National Assembly (NA)
passed a resolution revising a number of major economic targets
set for 1998 at its meeting in Hanoi last Friday, the country's
major newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The industrial growth rate was cut from 13.5 percent to
between 10 and 11 percent and the agricultural growth target was
reset at 3.0 to 3.5 percent, down from the original 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The export turnover growth target will be lowered from 25-26
percent to 10 percent with a trade deficit equal to 19 percent of
the total export value.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate will be kept under 10 percent against the
previous seven percent, and the budget deficit should not exceed

<HEADLINE> Johnson Rises, Bubka Falls, and Sang Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Michael Johnson
rose in the men's 400 meters while five-time world champion Sergei
Bubka no-heighted again in the men's pole vault at the Goodwill
Games here Tuesday, which saw a shocking injury to Chinese girl
gymnast Sang Lan who broke her spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
Russia won three golds from gymnastics and hauled one from
track and field to boost its title tally to 15, still one more
than the host United States. The host claimed three athletics gold
and one gymnastic laural.
</P>
<P>
One world record was surpassed, two meet records fell, and
Nigeria, Romania, Algeria, Australia, Kenya and Britain each
snatched one gold in the track and field competition.
</P>
<P>
Sang Lan, 17, fell on the ground head first during the warm-up
to the women's vaulting contest, suffering a serious spinal cord
injury.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Brock Schnebel, Goodwill Games chief medical officer,
claimed in an official statement:"She has a fractured-dislocation
of C-6 or C-7. This has resulted in an injury to her spinal cord.
At this time, she cannot move her legs. She has minimal motion of
her arms. She cannot feel from her mid-chest down. At present she
is receiving a MRI and treatment plans will be made based on the
results."
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who has been plagued by consistent injury and
unfitness in the past two years, made a strong comeback to win the
men's 400meters with a year's best 43.76, a new meet record. It
was his first sub-44 second run after the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
However, it was not a good day for Bubka, who opened at
5.70meters, and failed to clear it with his first two efforts
before he ruined the third chance by quitting mid-way during his
run-in.
</P>
<P>
The world pole vault king, who beat the world indoor and
outdoor records 35 times during his career, had a similar
no-height failure at the world championships in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hartwig of the United States soared over 6.01 meters to
win the title, equalling the meet record.
</P>
<P>
World champion Maurice Greene of the United States proved that
he is the fastest man in the world when he beat almost all the
world big names in the men's 100 meters with a time of 9.96
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tabago, who ran the year's best of
9.86early this season and won the 200 meter crown yesterday,
failed to bring out his best tonight, finishing second in 10.00
sharp to Brian Lewis of the United States' 10.25.
</P>
<P>
Mihaela Melinte of Romania bettered the listed world record in
the unfancied women's hammer with a 72.64 meter toss. Olga
Kuzenkova of Russia, who threw 73.80 last May in Russia, wound up
runner-up at 70.98. The organiser announced that Melinte's 72.64
effort beat the previous world record of 69.46.
</P>
<P>
Another meet record was set by Falilat Ogunkoya of Nigeria in
the women's 400 meters when she clocked 49.89 second, beating the
old mark of 49.96.
</P>
<P>
The men's mile race witnessed that defending champion
Noureddine Morceli of Algeria outkicked other big names with a
time of 3:53.39. William Tanui of Kenya burst over world 3,000 and
5,000 meters record holder Daniel Komen, also a Kenyan, on the
final box to take the silver.
</P>
<P>
Kenya made a clean sweep of the medals in the men's
10,000meters, with Julius Gitahi first in 27:49.26, Simon Maina
second in 27:49.65, and James Koskei third in 28:51.02.
</P>
<P>
Britain's world record holder Jonathan Edwards easily beat his
rivals in the men's triple jump with a 17.65 leap, and Joanna
Stone of Australia took the women's javelin gold with an awesome
heave of 66.29 meters. Another title went to Yelena Nikolayeva of
Russia, who cruised home 43:51.97 to win the women's 10km walk.
</P>
<P>
Russia almost swept three out of four individual titles in the
gymnastics competition, leaving the remaining one for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Alexei Nemov, bronze medal winner in the men's all around, won
the floor exercises with 9.725 points. Nikolay Krukov scored 9.650
to win the men's pommel horse, while Svetlana Khorkina accumulated
9.825 points to take the women's unevenbars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vanessa Atler edged Russia's Elena Dolgopolova to claim
the women's vaulting with 9.662 points.
</P>
<P>
In today's basketball competition, Australia beat Lithuania
82-64, and Argentina downed Russia 69-65 in group A, while the
United States defeated Brazil 106-75, and Puerto Rico edged China
74-73.
</P>
<P>
In the water polo competition, Russia beat Italy 7-4, Spain
overpowered the United States 10-5, Italy edged Spain 6-5, and
Russia hammered the United States 10-5.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Closes ASC, SOM Meetings With Stress on Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) closed its two-day ASEAN Standing Committee (ASC)
meeting and Senior Officials Meeting (SOM) here Wednesday with a
pledge to build the ASEAN into a "community of the region's
peoples."
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN seeks to be a region unburdened by hunger, malnutrition
and poverty," said Domingo Siazon, secretary of foreign affairs of
the Philippines, which is this year's rotating chairman of ASEAN
annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
In his closing statement at the ASC meeting, Siazon noted that
there are greater challenges ahead that need to be faced. "But for
now, it is enough that ASEAN has inched closer as a community."
</P>
<P>
According to Siazon, the ASC meeting, also attended by the
ASEAN secretary-general and directors-general of the ASEAN
national secretariats, reviewed the work of the ASC in the past
year and approved the agenda of the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting
(AMM) to take place here later this week and a report on the ASC's
work to be presented to the AMM.
</P>
<P>
Siazon pointed out that Southeast Asia has changed in the past
year. "ASEAN member countries felt the painful crunch of the
financial crisis. Growth targets fell, unemployment indices rose
and our respective governments were hard-pressed to live up to
expectations."
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN, however, made efforts toward correcting this problem by
establishing monitoring mechanisms through the assistance of the
Asian Development Bank, prompting transparency and pursuing
national internal readjustments," he declared.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ASEAN is being transformed because over the
past 12 months, it is "moving closer toward building a community.
An ASEAN community."
</P>
<P>
He cited the adoption last December of the ASEAN Vision 2020,
which he said "will guide us into the next century." "It outlines
our goals and plans for uplifting the welfare of the peoples of
Southeast Asia and achieving the dream of a cohesive ASEAN
community."
</P>
<P>
In a bid to realize the ASEAN founding fathers' dream of
including all nations in the regional grouping, ASEAN admitted
Laos and Myanmar into its ranks in July last year. But the
membership of Cambodia was deferred owing to political turmoil in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said ASEAN members have extended their "full
cooperation" to the two new members in facilitating their
integration into ASEAN activities."
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN also expanded its cooperation in other areas such as
transboundary haze caused by fires in Indonesia, prevention of
forest fires in the region and eradication of transnational
crimes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ASC and SOM meetings were held to make preparations for the
31st ASEAN Ministerial Meeting, which is scheduled to open here on
Friday and discuss questions including the financial crisis which
has been affecting the region since July last year, measures to
deal with the crisis and its effects, Cambodia, nuclear
proliferation in South Asia and transnational crimes and a
proposed shift in the ASEAN's policy from "non-intervention" in
member countries' internal affairs to "flexible engagement."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Appropriations
Committee approved 18 billion U.S. dollars as additional funding
for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But the move could likely set up a battle with House lawmakers
who oppose giving more money to the international organization.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Ted Stevens said replenishing the
International Monetary Fund is necessary to help it save troubled
economies across Asia and in Russia, and a refusal to approve the
Clinton administration's 18-billion-dollar IMF request could
damage the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
"If the global economy goes sour, our economy will go sour,"
Stevens warned.

This funding was attached to a 12.6-billion-dollar foreign
operations bill the Senate Appropriations Committee sent to the
full Senate for approval. The Senate approved a separate IMF
measure in March, but that has languished in the House.
</P>
<P>
The House Appropriations Subcommittee set aside only 3.4
billion dollars for the IMF. The full committee is expected to
take up the measure Wednesday. Differences between the House and
Senate versions would be resolved by a conference committee.
</P>
<P>
The latest IMF bailout came Monday when Russia agreed to
economic reforms as a condition for receiving an
11.2-billion-dollar loan.
</P>
<P>
The 12.6-billion-dollar foreign operations bill sent to the
Senate for approval for fiscal year 1999, beginning October 1,
maintains nearly the same level of funding as last year, but is
one billion dollars less than President Bill Clinton requested.

<HEADLINE> China, Guyana Pledge to Continue Good Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GEORGETOWN, Guyana, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Guyana's Prime Minister
Samuel Hinds and visiting Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen pledged
on Tuesday to continue the good relations between their two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who arrived here on Monday, said the Chinese government
is willing to build a long-term stable cooperative relationship,
while Hinds said the Guyanese people and government would like to
extend existing cooperation to different sectors.
</P>
<P>
Qian told Hinds that common views have increased, friendship
has deepened and good results have been achieved through his
meeting with President Janet Jagan on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after his arrival, Qian and Jagan met at the
president's office. They exchanged views on bilateral relations
and issues of common concern, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Jagan said that Guyana will continue to make efforts to
strengthen its ties with China and consolidate the achievements of
cooperation. She expressed the hope that her country would be
China's good friend in all areas, the spokesman told Chinese
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that relations between China and Guyana have
developed smoothly. The number of high-level visits is increasing
and cooperation in all areas has been effective since the two
countries set up diplomatic ties 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Guyana is an important country in the Caribbean, said Qian,
adding that the purpose of his visit was to promote good relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier expressed his belief that bilateral
relations will be further strengthened in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of economic and trade relations, Qian said the Chinese
government would like to facilitate their development through
joint efforts based on equality and mutual benefits so that
cooperation can be a model for South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Qian expressed his gratitude to the Guyanese
government for its support of China in international affairs and
its active effort in helping to develop relations between China
and other Caribbean nations.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and
Guyanese Foreign Minister Clement Rohee signed an agreement on
mutual exemption of visas for officials between the two countries
and a separate agreement on economic and technology cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Guyana is the second stop of Qian's five Caribbean nation
tour. He will also visit Trinidad and Tobago, Cuba and Jamaica.

<HEADLINE> Italy Continues to Suffer From Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Italy spends an average of 1 trillion
lire (about 570 million U.S. dollars) each year in the last five
years to fight forest fires, yet flames continue to ravage its
woodlands, said a report released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The combined size of the fire-damaged areas in the past five
years is equal to two percent of the Italian territory, the report
drawn up by the Forestry Corps said.
</P>
<P>
Destruction by fires was at its worst in 1993 when 203,143
hectares of woodlands went up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, after the relatively uneventful first six months when
19,019 hectares were burned, fires in the first five days of July
alone caused a loss of 16,950 hectares.
</P>
<P>
July and August are the months with the highest risk of fire,
and the latest high rate of fires once more confirms the growing
inability of the responsible authorities to meet the summer
challenge.
</P>
<P>
Humans are responsible for 95 percent of fires in Italy and the
Forestry Corps has filed 8,664 charges of arson but 95 percent of
these are against persons unknown.
</P>
<P>
"One third of Italy is covered by forest and 70 percent of it
risks being attacked by fire," head of the Forestry Corps Fausto
Martinelli said, adding "It is imperative to improve intervention,
acting effectively and rapidly with the help of a public authority
to coordinate operations."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Girl Gymnast Suffers Spinal Cord Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China's Sang Lan, 17, suffered a
severely fractured-dislocation of her spinal cord when she fell on
the ground head first from a vaulting action during the warm-up to
the women's gymnastics competition at the Goodwill Games here
tonight.
</P>
<P>
The girl ran to the vaulting horse and jumped off with her
head hit the floor first.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Brock Schnebel, Goodwill Games chief medical officer, said
in an official statement:"I have been able to evaluate and speak
with Sang Lan through an interpreter, and evaluate her x-rays and
CAT scan. Unfortunately, she has a fractured-dislocation of C-6 on
C-7. This has resulted in an injury to her spinal cord."
</P>
<P>
Schnebel said:"At this time, she cannot move her legs. She has
minimal motion of her arms. She cannot feel from her mid-chest
down. This is consistent with a spinal cord injury at the level of
C-6,C-7. At present she is receiving an MRI and treatment plans
will be made based on the results."
</P>
<P>
Sang, who was born in China's Hunan province in 1981, won the
vaulting gold medal in the Chinese national gymnastics
championships last year. She didn't take part in the women's all
around competition at the current Games.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Interested in Buying Thai Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors have shown
interest in purchasing assets of 56 failed finance companies in
Thailand, the Thai Financial Sector Restructuring Authority (FRA)
said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has launched roadshows in the past few months at major
financial centers to find buyers of the assets of the finance
firms closed down by the Thai government late last year after the
economy nose-dived following the floating of the baht in July
1997.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of the roadshow in London had attracted foreign
interest in the closed companies' core assets, which consisted
mostly of loans, FRA Secretary-General Vicharat Vichitvadakan said
in a statement received Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Thus far the feedback we are receiving from investors
indicates that there is significant investor interest in Thailand
and in the FRA sales process," Vicharat said.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, the 56
finance firms should be sold by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The FRA team met potential investors in London as well as
stock-exchange officials and media representatives. They will go
to New York before ending the roadshow in Boston.
</P>
<P>
Although the FRA is confident of selling non-core assets such
as computers, autos and other movable property to local buyers,
the authority needs to find big foreign capital to buy core assets
nominally valued at 770 billion baht (19.25 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Last week, the authority said it had earmarked 60 percent of
total core assets for sale to foreign investors through the
roadshows.
</P>
<P>
But it predicts that major core assets such as corporate and
real-estate loans will only fetch around 50 percent of their
nominal value in the current economic climate.

COLOMBO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A Sri Lankan government
Information Department official Wednesday said the international
media were showing a keen interest in the upcoming summit of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
Already over 150 foreign media personnel have applied for

</P>
<P>
All leaders of the seven countries of the SAARC will go to

summit, he said.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first top level meeting of the two countries
after the nuclear tests conducted by them in May this year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Trades More with Asian Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar traded more with Asian
countries as compared with other parts of the world in the 1997-98
fiscal year which ended in March, with these countries accounting
for about 80 percent of its total export value and about 86
percent of its total import value.
</P>
<P>
The country's major trading partners in Asia including
Southeast Asia are China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea,
Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Despite less export of rice, export of other commodities such
as cotton, jute, beans and pulses, silver and tin, petroleum
products, timber, fish and prawn, and sugar, increased in the year
especially through the border trade with neighboring Bangladesh,
China, India and Thailand, said another latest official report of
the country's financial, economic and social conditions.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar imported 14 percent more of the value of goods in the
1997-98 than the previous year. Major import items are capital
goods, industrial raw materials, spare parts and consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's foreign trade including the border trade increased by
12.8 percent in the 1997-98 over the year earlier, but a trade
deficit of 1.32 billion dollars still occurred.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has also adjusted its border trade policy in an effort
to turn the border trade into normal trade by applying regular
trade procedures based on U.S. dollar in place of neighboring
currencies beginning November last year.
</P>
<P>
The country also promulgated later in April this year new
regulations for import and export, designating 22 goods items as
priorities for import.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, means for export promotion are being sought from the
private sector which contributed 76.5 percent to the export in the
1997-98 year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes Legislation on School Voucher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday vetoed legislation that would have given tax breaks to
parents sending their children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he vetoed the Education Savings and School
Excellence Act because it would use three billion dollars to fund
tax benefits for richer families while doing virtually nothing for
average families.
</P>
<P>
He said the money could be better used to improve overall
public education.
</P>
<P>
"By sending me this bill, the Congress has instead chosen to
weaken public education and to shortchange our children," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
"Just as we have an obligation to repair our transportation
system, we also have an obligation to invest in the infrastructure
needs of our public schools," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bill Archer, a Republican and chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee of the House of Representatives, said Clinton caved in
to special interests.
</P>
<P>
Archer said, "Republicans intend to continue pushing for new
ways to improve education in America. The education of our
children is a vital priority and I regret the president's action."
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich's spokeswoman, Christina Martin,
said Clinton had "sacrificed our children's future on the mantle
of union money" and accused him of bowing to the "influence of the
labor union bosses and the education bureaucrats."
</P>
<P>
The education bill cleared the Senate last month by too narrow
a margin to overcome Clinton's veto, and the president immediately
said he would not sign it. It was offered as an alternative to
Clinton's 12 billion-dollar, five-year proposal to build schools,
hire teachers and expand after-school programs, and Clinton
renewed his call for lawmakers to approve his plan.
</P>
<P>
The vetoed legislation would have expanded education savings
accounts so that tax-free withdrawals could be used for education
expenses from kindergarten through college. Covered expenses
included private tutors, home computers, supplies and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the bulk of those benefits would flow to families
at the top 20 percent of income distribution.
</P>
<P>
"It would instead reward families, particularly those with
substantial incomes, for what they already do," Clinton said.
"Families struggling to make ends meet would never see a penny of
the benefits."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Rebels Issued Weapons From Grocery Store </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had been using a Colombo
grocery store as an issuing point of lethal material for their
operatives in the city.
</P>
<P>
According to Police sources Wednesday, the Terrorism
Investigation Division had unearthed such material from the
grocery store after a raid recently in the city.
</P>
<P>
Police have recovered three suicide jackets packed with four
kilograms of explosives each and cyanide capsules.
</P>
<P>
The shop, located opposite a Colombo police station at
Jampettah and owned by a Sinhalese, had been rented by a Tamil
shop keeper since 1990. The shop keeper had been funded by the
LTTE, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Five arrests including that of the shop keeper and a relative
of his have been made so far in this connection.
</P>
<P>
Police and armed forces have tightened security in the capital
city in a bid to prevent possible rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, over 4,000 police personnel will be deployed in
the city during the summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation from July 29 to 31.

ROME, July 21 (Xinhua) -- During the two-year period of
1998-1999, employment rate in Italy will increase by only 0.4
percent, predicted the Organization for Cooperation and Security
in Europe (OCSE) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its 1998 Report on Employment Prospects, OCSE said that the
rise in employment in Italy will be lower than the average for the
industrialized nations that it put at 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
It said the number of unemployed in Italy would remain stable
at 2.7 million, 11.9 percent of the work force.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, Italian Labor Minister Tiziano Treu
said, "the data shows just how complex employment policies are"
and "the government must still do a lot more than it has so far."
</P>
<P>
The OCSE report added that, over the same two-year period,
Italy's GDP would grow by 2.5 percent, in line with other
industrialized nations.

SHANGHAI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The city of Shanghai increased
its container transport services at Yangpu Port and Jungonglu Port
on Tuesday to increase efficiency and speed in getting cargo to
other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
All formalities of container freight transiting the two ports
will be done just as soon as the containers land by one office and
they will be moved directly to rail service.
</P>
<P>
The ports' customs procedures have been simplified a great deal
from the previous mixture of communications office, railway
bureau, port administration, and customs office documents.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has the country's largest container cargo handling
capacity and 71 container shipping companies operating nationally
and internationally. Its 12 overseas routes go to at least 110
ports abroad.
</P>
<P>
However, its rail service, which is the most effective means of
moving container cargo to distant inland areas at a comparatively
low cost, is still insufficient.

MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will soon
get 30 million to 40 million U.S. dollars from the World Bank (WB)
to fund a 10 to 12 year program to boost agricultural productivity
as well as reduce poverty in the southern island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Vinay Bhargava, WB country director for the Philippines, was
quoted Wednesday by the newspaper Business World as saying the
loan is for the first three to five years of the program which
will initially cover two provinces in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The first phase will begin within a year after the World Bank
completes consultations with targeted communities on needed
projects, Bhargava said.
</P>
<P>
Rahul Raturi, senior economist for WB's rural development and
natural resources unit, said the WB loan will primarily
concentrate on rural infrastructure and small- to medium-scale
irrigation systems.
</P>
<P>
The WB program will also introduce sustainable agricultural
production systems as well as diversified cropping systems through
better land and water management.
</P>
<P>
Access to credit, the country's agricultural inputs and more
effective technical services will also be improved.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Capital City Air Getting Worse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian capital city's air
quality is on the decline as many motorists can no longer afford
to maintain their vehicle's exhaust systems, the Indonesian
Observer reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Many motorists are only spending their money on food and fuel,
and vehicle maintenance is a low priority.
</P>
<P>
The cost of spare parts has soared, meaning that vehicles are
now belching out more toxic fumes, putting the city's Blue Sky
program up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta and other parts of the country also suffered severe air
pollution as a result of forest fires that commenced last year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been the worst hit by the regional currency
turmoil with the rupiah losing over 80 percent of its value
against the U.S. dollar since July last year.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis has resulted in soaring prices and
unemployment rate, hitting the poor people.
</P>
<P>
According to the Jakarta Statistics Office for Population
Statistics, more than 860,900 Jakarta residents lived in poverty
until June this year, accounting for 8.95 percent of the capital's
population.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented a 372 percent increase compared to 1996
when the number of Jakarta residents living in poverty reached
nearly 231,300.
</P>
<P>
The office attributed the drastic increase in the number of
Jakarta poor people to inflation which soared to 40.92 percent at
the start of last month from 11.70 percent in 1997.

sang stories about their national heroes on the prairie.
</P>
<P>
Today, Lobsang, descendent of the ancient artists, tells and
sings stories in the Mongolian language on the stage, his head and
shoulder shaking to the rhythm of the fiddle in his hands.
</P>
<P>
His stories and other Mongolian programs performed today in
Hohhot, capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, by
artists from a folk arts troupe have won the applause of both
Mongolian and Han audiences.
</P>
<P>
"I live in city, but their performance brought me back to the
prairie," said one Mongolian viewer.
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand what they are talking and singing about
without the explanations on the captions beside the stage," said a
Han viewer, "But I like their performance because it's full of
Mongolian flavor."
</P>
<P>
"The ancient Mongolian artists roamed on the prairie. And when
they came to the yurts of the herdsmen, they sat on the ground and
told and sang stories about what they had seen, while playing the
matouqin, the four-stringed instrument of the Mongol nationality,"
said Zhangxi, head of the troop.
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old Lobsang was a student of Baja and Moyihan, two
Mongolian artists who performed for the late Chairman Mao Zedong
nearly 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Lobsang recalled that it took Baja and Moyihan decades of
effort to revive Mongol storytelling and singing and other
folk-art genres, and to move these arts from the Mongolian yurt to
the modern stage, thereby developing the complete art form called
Mongol Quyi.
</P>
<P>
Zhangxi said Mongolian Quyi on stage is greatly changed, from a
single singer to many, and the performance is now usually
accompanied by many unique instruments including the matouqin, wooden
clapper, dulcimer and drum.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of special melodies handed down from ancient
times, much of Mongol folk music has been absorbed into Mongolian
Quyi to give full play to its unique flavor.
</P>
<P>
So far, Mongolian Quyi has developed into more than 30 forms
including those adapted from Han Quyi such as comic
dialogues. "Pilgrimage To The West," "Romance Of The Three
Kingdoms" and other famous ancient books of the Han ethnic group
have been translated into the Mongolian language and are performed
in Mongolian Quyi.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Reduce Orange Juice Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Brazil, one of the largest
producers of orange juice in the world, will see a reduction in
juice production this year, the Brazilian Citric Exporters
Association said.
</P>
<P>
The association said the country expected to process 203
million boxes of oranges, each weighing about 48 kilograms,
compared with 1997's 318 million boxes. Orange juice production
will amount to about 820 million tons, which is also less than
last year.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian orange juice industry still has 236 million tons
of processed juice from the last harvest, which will be sold this
year to maintain its world exporting position.
</P>
<P>
The drop of juice production in the country this year is a
result of a 30 percent reduction in the orange harvest.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Brazilian orange production amounted to 405 million
boxes, while the export of orange juice was 1.3 million tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia's net international
reserves increased slightly by 35 million U.S. dollars last week,
local press Wednesday quoted the central bank's statement as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Bank Indonesia's international
reserves increased to 14.439 billion U.S. dollars as of July 17
compared to 14.404 billion U.S. dollars the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The increase resulted from a loan disbursement by the Asian
Development Bank and foreign exchange revenue from the export of
oil and natural gas, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the reserve level was above the 13.8 billion U.S.
dollar minimum level allowed by the International Monetary Fund.

year's best in the world, to beat the old meet record of 44.79.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Sector Improving on Southern Chinese Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The real estate business in Haikou,
the capital of China's Hainan Province, improved in the first half
of the year after several consecutive years of negative growth.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months the land requisitioneded by the local
government from farmers increased 183 percent, and land sales were
up 790 percent on a year-on-year basis. Housing sales also
increased rapidly, with the number of households involved going up
100 percent, the floor space 90 percent, and the value 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Haikou real estate market overheated in the first few years
after Hainan was granted provincial status in 1988, but the
central government put the brakes on it in 1993 and the situation
improved, although it put a damper on business.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts attribute the improvement in the first half of
the year to improvements in the local economy. Haikou's GDP was up
8.1 percent, the first time since 1993 that it was higher than the
national average.
</P>
<P>
Another reason is simplified procedures of trading and increased
bank loans.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation is still far from good because the city
has a surplus of more than 3 million square meters of housing,
worth 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Bill Preserving Sites of Slave Escape Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday signed a bill into law that will help preserve the slave
escape route known as the Underground Railroad.
</P>
<P>
The law authorizes the National Park Service to spend 500,000
U.S. dollars a year to link the sites of the Underground Railroad,
produce educational materials and enter partnerships to
commemorate the 19th century escape route.
</P>
<P>
The bill was sponsored by Republican Bob Portman and Democrat
Louis Stokes from the House, and Democrat Carol Moseley Braun and
Republican Mike DeWine from the Senate.
</P>
<P>
"Today is a proud moment in the history of the Congress and
this nation," said Stokes, the former head of the Congressional
Black Caucus. "We can now begin the exciting task of officially
documenting the historical significance of the Underground
Railroad."
</P>
<P>
"This law will help us to preserve and commemorate the
important, but often overlooked, history of the Underground
Railroad," said Portman, whose great-great-grandparents were
Quakers and abolitionists who lived in a farmhouse near West
Milton, Ohio, that harbored freedom-seeking slaves.
</P>
<P>
Moseley Braun said the new network will be significant not just
for blacks, but for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
DeWine said the law will help future generations relive the
experience of escaping slaves.
</P>
<P>
A 1995 park service survey documented nearly 400 sites
associated with the Underground Railroad in 29 U.S. states,
Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean islands. But it also found that
many were in danger of being lost or destroyed.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of
Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, will set
up a foreign investment joint office this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a recently revealed plan to improve the investment
environment and expand funding channels, the office will be
operated by the city's Development Planning Commission, the
Industrial and Commercial Administrative Bureau, and Customs, and
aims at a more efficient and transparent working style.
</P>
<P>
The Chengdu government will continue to lower charges on
foreign investors, and foreign-funded enterprises will not be
charged for items that are not included in the official policy
worked out last year.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the measures were designed to narrow the
investment-environment gap between Chengdu and more developed
areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Chengdu accounted for only 0.2 percent of the international
funds flowing into China last year.
</P>
<P>
The city will make the most out of the opportunity as overseas
investment now moves to central and western China, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign businesses such as the World Bank Investment Corp. and
Sumitomo Corp. are now discussing possible joint ventures with
local companies.
</P>
<P>
Toyota Motor Corp. has recently signed a 99-million-U.S. dollar
agreement with a local tour bus manufacturer.

further, keeping the scope of devaluation against the U.S. dollar
within this year's 18 percent limit, the Cabinet said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Calls for Blood Tests to Fight Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 21 (Xinhua ) -- The Association of Italian
Professional Cyclists (ACCPI) called in Milan on Tuesday for blood
tests, rather than urine tests, to fight doping in the sport.
</P>
<P>
"It is vitally important for everyone in cycling...to realise
how indispensable such a step is," ACCPI said, adding it would
raise the matter with international cycling bodies and push for
the change as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The current Tour de France has been marred by a major doping
scandal involving three riders from Pestina team.
</P>
<P>
Its riders, including Richard Virenque, Alex Zuelle and
Laurent Dufaux, were expelled after Festina boss Bruno Roussel
admitted making banned drugs available to his riders in a
"deliberate management" of doping products.
</P>
<P>
The International Cycling Union (UCI) introduced blood tests
last year to protect riders against the effects of the banned
hormone erythropoietin (EPO) which enhances oxygen in the blood.

Lidio knew what happened to his teammate and super star Ronaldo

Roberto Carlos was Ronaldo's room mate when he suffered a 30

</P>
<P>
"I don't know the name of what Ronaldo had. All I know is that
it was serious, very serious," Carlos said.

<P>
Carlos added that they were chatting in the hotel room before
the final when Ronaldo stopped talking, went pale and started to
sweat heavily.
</P>
<P>
As the convulsions started, his arms went crooked and his
hands looked deformed because of nervous tension. Other players
say he foamed at the mouth and swallowed his tongue.

<HEADLINE> Britain Reaffirms Policy on Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The British government Tuesday
reaffirmed its policy on the Lockerbie trial, saying it still
wants the two Libyans accused of bombing the Pan Am flight 103 in
1988 to be tried in Scotland or the United States.
</P>
<P>
A report in Britain's Guardian newspaper published Tuesday said
that Britain and the United States have agreed the two Libyan
agents can face trial in The Hague under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for Britain's Foreign Office dismissed
such it speculation, saying: "Our policy remains unchanged, and
that is Libya must surrender the suspects for trial in Scotland or
the U.S."
</P>
<P>
The Libyan government has repeatedly made clear it would not
hand over the two suspects unless the trial was held in a neutral
venue, while London and Washington insist that the trial could
only be held in Scotland or the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed strict sanctions on Libya in
1992 for failing to hand over the two suspects, who were accused
of killing 270 passengers aboard Pan Am airliner over the Scottish
village of Lockerbie.

<HEADLINE> Canada Sees Labor Productivity Increased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian business sector recorded
in 1997 its best performance in labor productivity since 1984,
Statistics Canada said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Labor productivity in the business sector increased 2.9 percent
on the heels of strong economic growth and surging business
investment," the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
This performance was the strongest since 1984 when the country's
labor productivity grew 3.3 percent as the economy recovered from the
1982 recession.
</P>
<P>
Productivity is a measure of production efficiency that most
economists regard as the foundation of growth in a country's standard
of living.
</P>
<P>
It usually grows when businesses become more efficient and when
they increase the amount of machinery and equipment and advanced
technologies that workers use.
</P>
<P>
Until 1996, Canada's productivity gains were far less impressive
than they were during the mid-1980s, when the economy was recovering
more rapidly from a recession.
</P>
<P>
However, when the good performance in 1997 is taken into account,
the country's average productivity gains since 1991 have grown at
almost the same pace as during the previous economic cycle in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Labor productivity increased an average of 1.1 percent a year
between 1982 and 1991, while it increased an average of 1.2 percent
a year between 1991 and 1997, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the past seven years, the United States recorded an average of
1.3 percent a year in its labor productivity, 0.1 percent higher than
that of Canada, agency added.

<HEADLINE> French NGOs Call on U.N. to Be Firm Toward Afghan  Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Seven French non-governmental
organizations which were recently driven out of Afghanistan by the
Taliban Tuesday called on the United Nations to adopt a very clear
stand toward the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by the representatives of the Action contre
la Faim, Acted, Medecins du Monde, Medecins sans Frontieres, Aide
Medicale Internationale, Pharmaciens sans Frontieres and
Solidarity, all of which were recently forced to leave the Afghan
capital Kabul.
</P>
<P>
They criticized the United Nations for signing an agreement
with Taliban in May, under which the U.N. was allowed to open
humanitarian agencies in Kabul but was subjected to restrictions
in recruiting women and local employees.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of this protocol has opened the door for a
discriminatory policy (by Taliban). We ask the United Nations to
stay but make sure that the access by the people to the aid will
be made in conformity with the ethics," said Jacky Mamou,
president of the Medecins sans Frontieres.
</P>
<P>
These NGOs, which left Kabul after the Taliban gave them an
ultimatum asking all their foreign personnel to regroup in a
ruined district of Kabul, held the U.N. responsible for the
present situation.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the departure of NGOs from Kabul would
lead to "a rise of epidemics, the problems of malnutrition and
the displacement of people."
</P>
<P>
They also expressed readiness to hold direct dialogue with the
Taliban on the basis of humanitarian principles for a resumption
of their activities in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
These NGOs expect the United Nations humanitarian agencies and
the donating countries to take a very clear stand when the latters
meet in New York on Tuesday to seek a common stand on Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Welder's Sparks Might have Sparked Cruise Ship Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A welder's spark in a laundry
room might have ignited lint and touched off a fire aboard the
giant cruise ship Ecstasy Monday, the president of Carnival Cruise
Lines said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fire on the second deck quickly spread two decks above
Monday to the outside mooring area, where nylon rope fed the
flames, cruise line president Bob Dickinson said at a news
conference in Miami, Florida.
</P>
<P>
"There was welding going on in an area of the laundry room" and
alarms sounded there, The Associated Press quoted Dickson as
saying. "Perhaps a spark from the laundry room ignited some lint
in the vent tubes which caused a very high explosive-type fire,
which ended up in the mooring deck."
</P>
<P>
Plumes of smoke shot out the back of the ship shortly after it
left port.
</P>
<P>
Soon, flames were pouring out the back and many of the 2,575
passengers assembled on the main deck, wearing orange life vests.
The 10-deck Carnival Cruise Lines ship, which also had more than
900 crew members, was bound for Key West and then Cozumel, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
A National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) team toured the
fire scene Tuesday morning. After Dickinson raised the welder
theory, Robert Francis, NTSB vice chairman, said it was too early
to draw any conclusions.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-four people were treated, most for smoke inhalation and
one with an undisclosed heart problem. Of the 54, 20 were taken to
hospitals and at least four people were admitted overnight.
</P>
<P>
A tugboat pulled the 70,367-ton ship back to the Port of Miami,
trailed by three boats spraying water on the lower levels. Crews
worked on cooling down hot spots before the ship got to shore.
</P>
<P>
Carnival Corp., the world's largest cruise lines, operates
ships under the Carnival, Holland America and Windstar brands. .
</P>
<P>
The Ecstasy, which entered service in June 1991, is in
Carnival's second-largest class of ships.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Tighter Regulation on Nursing Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced on Tuesday measures to crack down on nursing homes that
fail to give high-quality care to their patients, and to prod
states to do a better job in regulating them.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would ask Congress to pass legislation that
would require nursing homes to conduct a criminal background check
on workers and would set up a national registry of nursing home
employees convicted of abusing residents.
</P>
<P>
The legislation also would allow more employees to receive
training in preventing malnutrition and dehydration and
reauthorize the nursing home ombudsman program under the
Administration on Aging. The ombudsman provides information of
records of abuse and neglect at poorly run nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
But the Clinton administration said it would reject Congress'
suggestion that state inspectors can be replaced by inspectors
from private, accredited agencies. After experimenting with that
idea, administration officials have found it would not work.
</P>
<P>
Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, said
"They actually put nursing home residents in jeopardy. We are
concluding, based on that experience, that we should continue with
well-trained state inspectors."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration also was taking several steps on its
own, such as directing state enforcement agencies to impose
immediate penalties on nursing homes that repeat serious
violations.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health and Human Services was submitting a
900-page report to Congress making recommendations on nursing home
care improvement.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Expects 2.5 Percent Growth for Years until </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The German government said Tuesday
that it is expecting an average economic growth rate of about 2.5
percent every year between now and 2002 in Germany.
</P>
<P>
In a medium-term economic projection issued Tuesday, the German
Economics Ministry said that the brighter economic outlook, which
compares with an average expansion rate of around 1.5 percent over
the past five years, was expected to bring about a gradual
improvement on the job market.
</P>
<P>
The jobless total could be reduced to about 3.5 million by 2002
from an estimated 4.3 million for 1998, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The report also predicted that with an annual growth of about
6.5 percent, exports would continue to be the main driving force
behind Germany's economic upturn by 2002. Domestic consumption was
expected to remain weak with an average growth rate of just 2.0
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the ministry also predicted that the eastern German
economy would still fail to close the gap with the richer western
German economy. By 2002, productivity in eastern Germany was
expected to reach just 61 percent of that in the West compared
with 60.4 percent registered in 1997.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Vice President Al Gore will
take a trip to Russia and Ukraine next week to discuss the shaky
state of economic reform in both countries and to make a quick
visit to Chernobyl, site of the 1986 nuclear disaster, U.S.
officials said. on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said Russia's efforts to cope with its
financial crisis and its plans to carry out economic reforms that
it has pledged in exchange for 22.6 billion U.S. dollars in new
international loans will be high on Gore's agenda.
</P>
<P>
"This really comes at a time when economic reform issues and
financial crises are the key issues both for Russia and
Ukraine," said one of the officials.
</P>
<P>
"The point is to hear from the Russians what their strategy
and plan is for the implementation because it needs to be a
Russian program," another official said. "There needs to be
Russian leadership to make it happen."
</P>
<P>
Gore's visit will also help to prepare for U.S. President Bill
Clinton's September summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
which is expected to be dominated also by the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Ukraine, expected next Wednesday, Gore
will hold talks with President Leonid Kuchma, which will also be
focused on economic reform.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Party Still Trails in Opinion Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A large majority of German political
and business elites now expect that Germany's main opposition
Social Democratic Party (SPD) would win the country's next general
elections on September 27 this year, an opinion poll issued
Tuesday showed.
</P>
<P>
According to the opinion poll conducted by the German
Allensbach research institute, about 67 percent of the 602
questioned political and business leaders said that the leftist
SPD party would emerge as the strongest party after the general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, only 28 percent still believed that German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservatives would remain as the
strongest party after the national vote.
</P>
<P>
Despite the finding that about 59 percent of those questioned
personally want Kohl to remain in office, 70 percent of them said
Kohl's SPD challenger Gerhard Schroeder was expected to be the
eventual winner.
</P>
<P>
A majority of them did not believe that the current economic
upturn in Germany would help Kohl to win the election.
</P>
<P>
The Allensbach poll, commissioned by the German economic weekly
Capital, also showed that the number of German political and
business leaders who expect a grand coalition between Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party and the SPD had increased
to 34 percent from just 23 percent registered three months ago.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador Qin on Extending Mandate of UNPREDEP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China supports assisting in
the maintenance of Macedonia's stability and security, and the
international community should respect its political independence
and sovereignty, Chinese Permanent Representative to the United
Nations Qin Huasun said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Security Council which met to vote on
extending the mandate of the United Nations Preventive
Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in Macedonia, Ambassador Qin said
United Nations peacekeeping operations should have a proper
beginning and a proper end.
</P>
<P>
Qin said however, taking into account the request of the
Macedonian Government, as well as the concern expressed by
regional countries, China will not object to a further extension
of UNPREDEP's mandate.
</P>
<P>
Qin said China hoped that the adjustment of the mission's
mandate enabling it to assume monitoring responsibilities along
border areas would effectively contain illicit arms flows and
terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
He said in the light of the overall intent of the
international community to maintain peace and stability, China
would vote in favor of extending the mandate of UNPREDEP.
</P>
<P>
Qin stressed that that vote, however, did not constitute any
change in China's principled position with regard to Security
Council resolutions 1101(1997), 1114(1997) and 1160(1998).
