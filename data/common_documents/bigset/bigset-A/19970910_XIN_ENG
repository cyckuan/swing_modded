<HEADLINE> France Confident About Spain Joining Euro on Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Finance and
Economy Dominique Strauss-Kahn today expressed his confidence that
Spain will be able to join the European single currency euro in
the first wave in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
"In regard to the performance of the Spanish economy in the
past several years, it seems to me that the process of convergence
predicted by the (Maastricht) treaty is perfectly fulfilled,
better than others," said Strauss-Kahn at a joint press
conference with his Spanish counterpart, Rodrigo de Rato.
</P>
<P>
He said that the will of the Spanish government to be one of
the original members of the monetary union is justified by the
"very concrete" economic performance of the country.
</P>
<P>
Rato said that there is "almost a unanimity" of agreement in
Spain to the country's joining the euro as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers agreed that the economic growth of their
countries is "accelerating" and that the economic situation will
be better in 1998 than this year for both countries.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Raps SADC Political Parties on Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has taken a swipe at some political parties in the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) region who only
respect the results of elections if they are winners.
</P>
<P>
At a banquet hosted by Malawian President Bakili Muluzi last
night in Malawi's commercial city Blantyre, Chiluba told the
heads of state and government who gathered for the 17th SADC
summit that such party leaders think there is no democracy until
they come into power, the official Zambia News Agency ZANA
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president did not name those political parties or
their leaders.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, a former trade union leader who succeeded Zambia's
veteran statesman Kenneth Kaunda as president in the 1991
multia-party elections and was re-elected in 1996, cautioned his
counterparts that the danger of some people in Africa is that
they have tourist impressions about democracy.
</P>
<P>
"They go for a few weeks abroad. They come back as experts and
they want to tell you: you are actually not democratic enough,"
said the president.
</P>
<P>
He said that an interesting aspect about such leaders is that
they compare their countries to Britain and yet they do not know
when the Briton's uncodified constitution began or when the U.S.
got its independence from Britain.
</P>
<P>
Africa is going through a democratic process, which can be
evidenced by the recorded growth rate in the SADC members'
economies, concluded the president.

<HEADLINE> EU Conducts Study on Tourism Among Member Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's
executive agency today called on small and medium-sized tourism
operators in EU member countries to improve awareness of "yield
management" in their business.
</P>
<P>
They were adviced to pay more attention to business statistics,
training, improved flow of information on the best methods and
practices, the need to build partnerships and enhancing
cooperation in marketing.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations were made after the European Commission
conducted a close study on yield management and profit
maximization in small and medium-sized enterprises in the tourism
sector.
</P>
<P>
The study found that the levels of awareness of yield
management vary greatly among the 17-member countries of the
European Economic Area.
</P>
<P>
Countries with limited knowledge of yield management are
Greece, Iceland, Luxembourg and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, Finland, Britain, Austria, Ireland, Italy and Spain
are countries with moderate knowledge, while Denmark, France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden are found to possess
broad awareness of yield management practices.
</P>
<P>
As a way of strengthening competitiveness in Europe's tourism
industry, yield management as a systematic approach to profit
maximization has emerged in the last few years among larger
tourism-oriented enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Chritos Papoutsis, European commissioner in charge of tourism,
said the study showed yield management can contribute to the
competitiveness of European tourism by strengthening and
supporting the performance of its enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism, being one of the biggest industries, contributes
significantly to employment," he said. "We must encourage tourism
enterprises to use profit maximization practices in their business.
</P>
<P>
"Yield management should be encouraged and supported through
action in the areas that have been identified," he added.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that despite the fact that Europe's
tourism industry continues to grow in terms of volume and
receipts, it is facing increasing competition from other
continents.

<P>
LAUSANNE, Switzerland, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Boxer Roy Jones
Jr. never got the Olympic gold medal he felt he deserved, but he
was awarded the Olympic Order, one of the IOC's highest honors
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee said in its weekly
newsletter Tuesday that the American fighter had been awarded the
Olympic Order. The decision came three months after the IOC ruled
against Jones' bid to claim the gold medal from the 1988 Seoul
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The IOC said it had found no evidence to support bribery
allegations against the judges who voted 3-2 in favor of South
Korea's Park Si-Hun against Jones in the final of the 156-pound
(71-kgs) light-middleweight division.
</P>
<P>
Jones, who reclaimed the WBC light-heavyweight title last month
by stopping Montell Griffin in the first round, was one of 12
people awarded the Olympic Order at the close of the IOC session
Sunday in Lausanne, Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> UK Government to Challenge Fishing Quota Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
considering to challenge a British High Court ruling that Spanish
fishermen are entitled to claim millions of pounds of compensation
because of being barred from using British fishing quotas.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Fisheries Minister Ellliot Morley was quoted by the
Financial Times as saying Monday that the government would argue
in court that the previous administration had followed proper
advice and acted reasonably in excluding quota-hoppers.
</P>
<P>
Quota-hoppers are referred to those Spanish and Dutch-owned
vessels that register in Britain to gain access to British
national fishing quotas.
</P>
<P>
Britain is also planning to seek permission from Spain later
next week for spot checks on Spanish ships fishing British waters
but landing the catch in Spanish ports, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The British government will also present proposals to the
European Commission within the next few weeks on measures to force
quota-hoppers to share the economic benefits of their catches with
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, London promised to launch a further crackdown on
illegal fishing by British fishing vessels by outlawing purchases
of "black fish," fish caught in excess of quotas, by processors.

<P>
PARIS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Comoran President Mohamed
Abdoulkarim Taki today took control of the government and said he
would form a new government of national union within three weeks,
after the situation on the island of Anjouan becomes normal.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoras has been troubled
by separatists on Anjouan Island -- one of three islands which
make up the nation -- for more than one month.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a Comoran army intervention last week in Anjouan
resulted in a fiasco and the death of more than 50 people,
including 40 Comoran government soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Taki announced earlier today the dissolution of the civil and
military government of the country, and said that he would be
personally in charge of the Interior Ministry, according to Agence
France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
Taki said the Arab League, the United Nations and the
Organization of African Unity are all helping Comoros end the
separatism of Anjouan and establish a government of national union
with a national program.
</P>
<P>
"The events in Anjouan should be prevented from every happening
again," he said. "After the situation becomes normal, in Anjouan
in particular, I will establish a government of national
union... so that peace, fraternity and democracy will be
re-established," said Taki.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the National Assembly of the country
would begin holding an extraordinary session today "in full
power."

The function of the gyroscopic devices, which keep the
station's solar panels in line with the sun to enable them to
generate power, was resumed. The devices failed Monday after the
computer failure.

The cosmonauts are expected to gradually restart the equipment,
which had been switched off, and examine and repair parts of the
system they depend on for life.
</P>
<P>
Accidents have frequently occurred on the Mir space station
which was established in 1986. It has lasted longer than its
expected five-year term, and a lack of funds has prevented Russia
from setting up new space stations.
</P>

About 1,450 failures have reportedly occurred on the Mir in the

<HEADLINE> Investors Urged to Invest in Zambia's Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's water supply sector
has appealed to local and foreign investors to invest in the
sector which needs about 800 million U.S. Dollars for water
supply improvement.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Mwanza, head of the water sector development group
which has been put in place to spearhead the commercialization of
the sector, made this appeal in Lusaka Monday, an
English-language newspaper Zambia Daily Mail said today.
</P>
<P>
Private involvement is vital if the sector has to improve its
services, Mwanza stated, while disclosing that the Zambian
government would create regulators to ensure that there is
efficiency after the water sector is commercialized.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Mwanza as saying that the water sector has
not been able to meet its obligations due to poor funding and
lack of skilled human resources.
</P>
<P>
He said government investment in the sector has been declining,
making it difficult for the people responsible to maintain and
replace infrastructure which has deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
Mwanza added that poor financial resources have also made it
impossible for the sector to meet the costs of extending water
services to all parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is rich in water resources. It has 40 percent of the
water resources of southern Africa which, if properly utilized,
would contribute effectively to its national development.

LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Eric Cantona has written a
"pleasant" letter to his former club Manchester United, politely
turning down an invitation to a celebration dinner, a United
spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The French star, who quit United after deciding to retire at
the end of last season, had been invited back to Old Trafford
this weekend to celebrate the 1996-97 Championship victory.
</P>
<P>
But club secretary Ken Merrett said that the club had received
a letter from Cantona and his wife Isobel saying they were unable
to attend.
</P>
<P>
It was hoped that he could have taken a final bow before the
Premiership match against West Ham and then been guest of honour
on Sunday at a dinner for players and staff to mark the title win.
</P>
<P>
United hadn't received any reply from Cantona for weeks and
didn't know if he would be there or if he would snub the club
after a row over profits from merchandising sold in his name.
</P>
<P>
But Merrett said: "We have at last received a letter from Eric
and his wife. It was a very pleasent one.
</P>
<P>
"The tone was good, but he said he would be unable to
attend. He just said he was unavailable but that it had been a
kind invitation."

<HEADLINE> Mandela on Mobutu's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Former Zairean President
Mobutu Sese Seko was "snubbed" in his last days by countries
which had benefited from a long association with him, South
African President Nelson Mandela said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at his residence, Mandela
criticized Mobutu's former western allies without naming them.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said Mobutu's friends deserted him when he was in need
of humanitarian assistance and described how he tried to persuade
these countries to offer medical treatment to this ailing man.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu died of prostate cancer in Morocco Sunday. His three
decades of power in Zaire ended in May this year when he was
ousted by rebel leader Laurent Kabila, who renamed the country
the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
"As you know, I met Mobutu in his capital and at the United
Nations. I had the opportunity of interacting with him. After he
stepped down, I tried to get him medical treatment in Morocco and
other places," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
"But his former friends for 30 years and who benefited from
their association with him, on his last days on earth, they did
not want to know him," claimed the South African leader.
</P>
<P>
"No matter what he did in the past, he required humanitarian
treatment. Whatever his politics, his passing away was a
tragedy," he added.

Xie accused the Liberian government of brazenly creating "two
Chinas," saying that the wrong move by Liberia has seriously
harmed China's sovereignty and constituted interference in China's
internal affairs and undermined the foundation of normal
diplomatic relations between China and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government strongly protests at the
Liberian government and has decided to sever diplomatic ties with
Liberia as of today and the implementation of all agreements
between the two countries ceases with immediate effect.

<HEADLINE> Demirel's Egypt Trip to Allay Arab Fear: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish ambassador to Egypt
said today that Turkish President Suleyman Demirel's planned
one-day visit to Egypt next Tuesday will help allay Arabs' concern
over growing Israeli-Turkish cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Yacar Yakic said Arab-Turkish ties, Mideast affairs
and several other issues of mutual interest would figure high on
the agenda of Demirel's talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, according to the Egyptian Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Demirel's visit falls within the context of continued
consultations between the Egyptian and Turkish leaderships, the
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
"The trip would help lessen the Arabs' fears over Turkey's
possible estrangement from the Arab world and its rapprochement
with Israel," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has always used its open channels with Israel to serve
the Palestinian cause, he said, citing an example how Ankara
voiced its condemnation of the Israeli settlement policy during
the recent visit paid by Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Yakis said that Demirel's visit is aimed at
"dispelling fears of Turkey's likely distancing itself from the
Arab world and getting closer to Israel."
</P>
<P>
He dismissed that the relations between Ankara and Tel Aviv are
"of any dimensions causing anxiety."
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel signed a military cooperation accord in
February 1996. They have announced that they would stage joint
naval exercises together with the United States in the eastern
Mediterranean on November 15-25.
</P>
<P>
The planned maneuvers provoked outcries from Arab countries,
especially Syria, which sees itself as the target of the
Turkish-Israeli alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Turkish summit, which was originally set for May,
was postponed in the wake of the planned naval war games.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said that Turkey and
Israel sent a "negative message" to the region by planning the
exercises.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said earlier that the Egyptian-Turkish
talks would focus on means to enhance relations between the two
countries and increase the volume of trade exchange to one billion
dollars annually, the situation in northern Iraq, as well as the
Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Move Toward Opposition Stronghold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Islamic Taliban
militia today advanced toward the main opposition stronghold of
Mazar-e-Sharif, around 300 km north of Kabul, reports monitored
here said.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross and United Nations suspended flights to the city,
stronghold of anti-Taliban strongman Uzbek warlord Abdul Malik,
and aid workers there were told to stay in shelters, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban claimed today in a radio broadcast to have captured
the Mazar-e-Sharif airport, which is eight kilometers east of the
city, but Malik's forces said they still had control of the
airport.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban advance, which cut off the two main roads into
Mazar-e-Sharif, came as fighting erupted inside the city itself
between soldiers loyal to Malik and those loyal to their former
boss Rashid Dostum who was deposed by Malik in May.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Environment Workshop Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A three-day workshop on
Zimbabwe's environment started here today to assess its
requirements and projects.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the workshop, Mines, Environment and
Tourism Deputy Minister Chindori Chininga said, ''environmental
assessment is a basic tool for project planning and
implementation to ensure environmental and socio-economic costs
and benefits of the projects and avoid unwarranted negative
impacts.''
</P>
<P>
He said the primary objective of the workshop is to explore
opportunities to harmonize the zimbabwean environmental impact
assessment procedures and requirements.
</P>
<P>
Of major concern to Zimbabwe was the need to identify ways and
means to enhance environmental assessment preparation within the
processing of projects proposed for financing by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Chininga said for many years now Zimbabwe had placed emphasis
on the economic costs and benefits of developmental projects with
little regard being put on environmental impacts. The government
and most organizations had come to appreciate environmental
costs.
</P>
<P>
He added his ministry is working on incorporating
environmental impact assessment into a legislative proposal being
drafted.
</P>
<P>
The government, said Chininga, will soon start environmental
impact assessment training which is to be conducted across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's environmental impact assessment policy, which
intergrates environmental assessment into every phase of the
project cycle, was designed in 1994 to encourage development
proponents to identify and minimize negative environmental
benefits.

<HEADLINE> S. Africans Asked Not to Be Losers in Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
today urged his fellow South Africans to show sportsmanship and
accept the failure of Cape Town's bid to host the 2004 Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
Those who thought South Africa would sail to victory in its
Olympic Games bid were people who lived in a fool's paradise,
Mandela told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
"I have congratulated (winning city) Athens. Greece is a great
country," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee on September 5 named
Athens the winner of the 2004 Olympics bid, beating Cape Town,
Stockholm, Buenos Aires and Rome.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said: "it is regrettable of course that Africa could
not host the games for the first time, but we must reflect the
spirit of sportsmanship."
</P>
<P>
Cape Town was biding on behalf of the African continent under
the support of the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said there was fair play in the choice of Athens
because the International Olympic Committee was composed of
fair-minded people.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has said a few days ago that his country will discuss
the possibility of South Africa's continuation of biding for 2008
Olympic Games.

BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China issued a notice today
asking local governments to encourage women to join the anti-drug
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The notice, issued by the National Narcotics Control Commission
and the All-China Women's Federation, asked women's federations at
all levels to publicize the state's policies, laws and regulations
against drugs, and the threat that drugs posed to the country
in the modern history.
</P>
<P>
Women should be aware of the serious physical and psychological
damages caused by drugs, the notice said, adding that they should
improve their anti-drug knowledge and have a better understanding
of the state's anti-drug policies, laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Stress should be put on families with addicts, the notice
said.
</P>
<P>
It also asked women's federations to organize activities such
as lectures and consultative services to make the anti-drug
program known in every family.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the notice asked women to inform authorities about
illegal drug-related activities.
</P>
<P>
Women's federations should set up educational networks to
prevent the emergence of new addicts and drug-traffickers, the
notice said, asking the federations to care for and help women
addicts, especially the young, to break from their past.
</P>
<P>
The notice said that the women's federations should build a
line of defense among women and their families in the battle
against drugs.
</P>
<P>
People should be appointed to take charge of the work in
federations at all levels, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also be made to guarantee drug-free families, it
said.

<HEADLINE> CPC Congress Deputies Selected Through Democratic Process (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Wang Jingxia, a 37-year old
woman from a textile mill in eastern Shandong Province, arrived in
Beijing by train today along with other delegates from her home
province to attend the upcoming congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Wang, a technician in the Jinan Chengtong Textile Co. Ltd, is
one of the 2,048 delegates to participate in the 15th CPC National
Congress, which is to open Friday.
</P>
<P>
Official sources noted that all delegates to the CPC congress
have been chosen through a democratic process: they were first
nominated by the Party's grassroots bodies; later subjected to a
comprehensive questioning by the higher authorities; and finally
elected at the local Party congresses.
</P>
<P>
"The CPC Central Committee has asked that democracy be brought
into full play within the Party regarding election of the
delegates, and we have practiced democracy throughout the whole
selection process," said Wang Keyu, head of the Organizational
Department of the Provincial CPC Committee of Shandong.
</P>
<P>
A Party official from Wang Jingxia's mill explained how Wang
became a delegate, pointing out that the higher Party
organizations did not name any candidates for the national Party
congress this year.
</P>
<P>
CPC members in his factory had been urged to elect whomever
they deemed qualified to be a delegate, he said, and the mill's
Party committee prepared a namelist of candidates for the
committee at the next higher level, based on the will of the
majority of the CPC members in the factory.

The city Party committee selected six people from over 140
candidates from all local units as the city's candidates, and
reported the list to the Shandong Provincial Party committee.
</P>
<P>
On June 13, the CPC provincial committee appointed 70 people to
be the members of the provincial delegation to join the Party
congress.
</P>
<P>
During the months of selection, 4.42 million CPC members from
241,000 grassroots Party branch committees took part, 93.9 percent
and 99.2 percent of the total in this east China province,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Party members have exercised the highest degree of democracy
this time and the election of candidates has had involved so many
party organizations and their members," said Wang Keyu.
</P>
<P>
According to the CPC Central Committee's Organizational
Department, more than half a million candidates emerged in the
first round of selections nationwide, and over 3.2 million Party
branches, 95 percent of the total, and some 50 million Party
members, over 85 percent of the total, recommended their own
candidates.
</P>
<P>
After Wang was made a delegate, she has spent her spare time
visiting and talking with her fellow workers and soliciting their
opinions about the job ahead.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very honored to be elected a delegate to the National
Party Congress and also feel a tremendous sense of
responsibility," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she said, "as a representative of the 4.5 million CPC
members in Shandong province, I will express the will, proposals
and opinions of industrial workers in the factories, mines and
other indutrial enterprises."

<HEADLINE> SADC Commends Zambia for Democratization: Chiluba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba
said here today that the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) has commended Zambia for its democratization process,
according to the official Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
On his return to the Lusaka international airport from
Malawi's southern city Blantyre, where he attended the 17th SADC
summit, Chiluba told journalists that the commendation made in
writing praised Zambia for putting in place institutional
arrangements necessary in any democratic process.
</P>
<P>
"Zambia has been commended for the democratization process. We
are one of the those countries with democratic institutional
arrangements and I am extremely happy," said the Zambian
president.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiluba did not give further details.
</P>
<P>
Last night, at a banquet given by Malawian President Bakili
Muluzi in Blantyre for the heads of state and government
attending the SADC summit, Chiluba took a swipe at some political
parties in the region who only respect the results of elections
if they are winners.
</P>
<P>
He criticized such unnamed parties for their liking to compare
the democracy in their countries with that in some western
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the airport, Chiluba warned that Zambians should
not be complacent, saying the achievements scored so far should
be used as a basis for further progress.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that there is need to keep the rule of law in
his country, claiming Zambia's democratic record is "so good"
that some non-governmental organizations and "selfish"
individuals are taking advantages and are going round playing
tricks.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba did not say who those bodies and individuals are.
</P>
<P>
While in a recent development in Zambia, it is believed that
police fired live ammunition to disperse an Opposition rally,
during which former President Kenneth Kaunda, now President of
the United National Independence Party (UNIP) and another
opposition leader were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Zambia began its democratic process in the early 1990s with
the introduction of a multi-party system. It is democratization
that has brought Chiluba, a former trade union leader, came into
power.

JOHANNESBURG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said here today that "autonomy should be given to

However, Mandela also added that a solution to the problem of

Mandela said he had expressed this idea to his Indonesian

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- German Interior Minister Manfred
Kanther today ordered an increase in the police force guarding the
borders with the Czech Republic and Poland in a bid to block
illegal immigrants into Germany.
</P>
<P>
Kanther said he was ordering a further 1,500 border troops to
be permanently stationed on the eastern borders, adding to 5,800
officers of the Bundesgrenzschutz -- Germany's Federal Border
Guard -- currently deployed there.
</P>
<P>
The move was also partly directed at the rising crime rate in
that region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kanther said 15,397 illegal immigrants were stopped while
trying to sneak into Germany in the first half of this year, up
from 11,779 in the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of illegal foreigners caught after
entering Germany rose to 3,622, compared with 3,089 a year before.
</P>
<P>
"Germany's eastern borders remain the focal point for illegal
immigration and smuggling of foreigners," said Kanther. He noted
that the German-Czech border was becoming more important as a
transit route.
</P>
<P>
The largest group trying to enter Germany illegally is from
Romania, which was followed by Iraq, Bulgaria and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesgrenzschutz has been strengthening its force on the
eastern borders over recent years in efforts to reduce the number
of illegal immigrants. It has a total of some 34,000 officers,
which controls the country's borders and also plays a big role in
combating organized crime and drug smuggling.

<HEADLINE> UK Poor People Have Shorter Life Expectancy: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Life expectancy for people at
the bottom end of the social and economic ladder in Britain tends
to be shorter than those at the top, according to an official
study published today.
</P>
<P>
The study, titled Health Inequality, by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) found that men at the bottom end of the social
scale had trebled the rate of mortality in 1991-93 compared with
those at the top. The rate for women during the same time was one
and a half times.
</P>
<P>
Mortality rates for poor men from lung cancer during the period
were five times greater than for those at the top end of the
social scale. For women, the rates were three times higher at the
bottom than at the top.
</P>
<P>
Men at the bottom of the social ladder tended to live five
years shorter than those at the top while for women at the bottom,
life expectancy was three years less than for those at the top.
</P>
<P>
The government welcomed the report's exposure of what it called
"two Britains divided by ever-widening health inequality."
</P>
<P>
However, it said such entrenched inequality would not be
reversed overnight. "To make a real difference, we need long term
policies," it said.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Financial Times Launches US Edition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain's leading business
newspaper The Financial Times (FT) launched today a U.S. edition
in an effort to boost its international circulation.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was part of the newspaper's pledge of injecting
some 100 million pounds (about 160 million U.S. dollars) over the
next five years to lift its international sales to 430,000 from
300,000.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. edition, to be published in New Jersey and California,
is aimed at boosting U.S. circulation from some 37,000 to around
100,000 over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
FT editor Richard Lambert was quoted as saying in today's
London FT edition, "In the U.S., we will not be seeking to
replicate existing newspapers."
</P>
<P>
"Instead we plan to offer a broader view of the world than is
currently available," Lambert said. "Our aim is to win the battle
for a little time on the daily schedule of busy and influential
people."
</P>
<P>
The FT has published two versions, its main British edition and

<HEADLINE> Cyprus-Greece War Games to Go Ahead: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has lifted the air ban
on Greek warplanes to facilitate an annual joint military
exercises with Greece scheduled for later this year, Defense
Minister Costas Eliades said here today.
</P>
<P>
The decision to suspend Greek warplanes' flights over Cyprus
was taken last April to create a positive climate for the
U.N.-sponsored direct peace talks between Greek and Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' National Guard military exercises with the Greek air
force, code-named "Nikiforos 97," will take place later this year
as planned, the minister told the press, but stopping short of
giving further details.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have a close military link with a joint
defense pact signed in 1993, under which Greece pledges to join
Cyprus in resisting any possible military attack.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus, which was
declared by the Turkish Cypriot in 1983 as "The Turkish Republic
of Northern Cyprus", recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The two rounds of direct peace talks between Cypriot President
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in July and
August have ended in a failure.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Volume of Eurotunnel Keeps Rising in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Channel Tunnel operator
Eurotunnel's recovery from last November's fire continued last
month as traffic on Le Shuttle trains rose 25 percent following a
29.5 percent rise in July.
</P>
<P>
Figures released today by the company showed that so far this
year, Le Shuttle has carried more than 1.34 million vehicles,
little changed from the same period last year when it carried 1.39
million, despite the reduced service due to the fire.
</P>
<P>
The company said that a new daily record was set on August 29
when it carried 10,986 vehicles in a single day. And the company's
cross-Channel market share is now more than 40 percent, compared
with last year's peak of 45 percent before the fire.
</P>
<P>
The number of passengers carried on Eurostar grew by 4.5
percent last month compared with July and was up 20 percent from a
year ago to a record 681,663.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Le shuttle's freight service has recaptured 67
percent of its previous market in only two months as the service
did not start again after the fire until June although freight
traffic is usually lower during August.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Rampant in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaria is taking the death
toll of many Somalis in many regions of southern Somalia due to
the rainy season which still continues.
</P>
<P>
According to the health authorities of Merca town, 100 KM
south of the capital, more than 30 patients suffering from severe
malaria reach the outdoor patient clinic of the COSV, or Italian
aid agency-run hospital of the town every day.
</P>
<P>
Dr Omar Osman Ahmed, a pediatrician at the hospital said six
people, mainly children, have died of the disease since the past
week in the region. "The last was a nine-year-old girl who died
in the hospital three days ago."
</P>
<P>
There are nine mother and child health care posts throughout
the nine districts of the region. Dr Ahmed said these posts offer
free chloroquine tablets to mild cases of the malaria victims
while quinine is treated with those severe and complicated cases.
</P>
<P>
"We can't provide mosquito nets, but we give them public
awareness lessons," said Dr Ahmed, "We tell them to burn the
residue of the maize in their huts to make smoke which rebels the
anopheles."
</P>
<P>
Severe cases of malaria is also being reported from the Lower
Jubba and Middle Shabelle regions where more than seven death
cases were registered by the local treatment centers since last
month.
</P>
<P>
In Jowhar town, the capital of Middle Shabelle region, 40 to
50 people suffering from cerebral malaria reach the hospital of
the town every day, according to Mr Mohamed Mohamud Bishar, the
director of the main hospital there.
</P>
<P>
The malaria cases are not confined to the regions alone, but
the capital city of the country is also being affected by the
disease. Dr Osman Mohamud Dufle, the coordinator of the Joint
Health Authority of Mogadishu, confirmed to journalists that
there are sporadic deaths of malaria victims.
</P>
<P>
"The current major killer diseases are malaria and
tuberculosis," said Dr Dufle, the only internist of the war torn
capital.
</P>
<P>
One of the largest private hospitals in South Mogadishu had
received 65 malaria cases since the beginning of the month with
three deaths. Among the patients were 15 wounded militiamen who
were hit by malaria while receiving dressing treatments.
</P>
<P>
Dr Abdi Mohamed Hangul, the director of Dr Hassan Jiis
Memorial hospital, said the malaria germ seems to be gaining
resistance to the chloroquine tablets.
</P>
<P>
The people of Somalia are not only missing adequate medical
care, but also lack laboratories and x-rays for diagnosing
varieties of deadly diseases including malaria and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
The few available facilities of this kind are very expensive
so that the common people cannot afford, as there is no single
aid agency that provides such help, observers here say.

<HEADLINE> Albright Takes Difficult Trip Into Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Madeleine Albright started
her first trip to the Middle East as secretary of state today with
a very difficult mission to revive the already tattered peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. officials said they saw little chance for Albright to
make an improvement in terms of relations between Israel and the
Palestinians with such an entrenched crisis of confidence.
</P>
<P>
"When you begin to see the kind of erosion (in the peace
process) that we have, you have to re-establish the basics to be
able to move forward," a senior State Department official told
reporters on the eve of Albright's departure this morning.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Lewis, former U.S. ambassador to Israel, even said
Albright's long-delayed visit to the region "has made the trip
more vulnerable to failure."
</P>
<P>
Yahya Sadowski of Brookings Institution, a Middle East analyst,
agreed to Lewis' remarks. He said that the whole peace process is
rapidly unraveling and Albright is going out with no new ideas for
the resolving of the crisis of confidence.
</P>
<P>
"She only has the rather desperate hope that a renewed
expression of American interest will keep hope alive," Sadowski
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
During her stay in the Middle East, Albright will ask
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to step up crackdown of
militants, rupture the terrorism infrastructure and make good on
the promise to safeguard Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
She will also tell Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:
Israel should not use safety as a pretext to side track
indefinitely the commitments his labor predecessors had made to
the Palestinian Authority for phased withdrawal on the West Bank.
And she will also try to persuade the Israeli prime minister to
suspend the extension of Jewish settlements in Arab residential
areas.
</P>
<P>
But the stances of Israel and the Palestinians are so polarized
that Albright could hardly make any advance in bridging their
differences through just one visit.
</P>
<P>
The White House said Monday that Albright will not make any
pressures on both sides. "Is is not wise for someone attempting to
facilitate a dialogue to play the role of a heavy hand," it said.
</P>
<P>
Albright's travel to some other Arab nations shows that apart
from trying to revive the moribund peace process, the United
States is exerting its effort to maintain a loose coalition
between Arab states and Israel, built after the Persian Gulf war
to contain Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But, with the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians
in tatters and the chance of a comprehensive Middle East peace
fading, the prospect of that coalition is also fraying.
</P>
<P>
The possible abortion of an American-sponsored Middle East
economic summit meeting, scheduled to be held in mid-November in
Doha, Qatar, signals that fraying, as Saudi Arabia and some other
Gulf states have made it clear they might not attend the meeting,
in which Israel would take part.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said success on her trip has not been precooked,
and it will be hard even to define. And Albright's aides have
already said: "She is not a magician."

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Agrees to Mitchell Principles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political party
of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), formally agreed today to the
so-called Mitchell Principles of democracy and non-violence.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland, quoted
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams as saying, "It is a defining
moment."
</P>
<P>
Adams, whose party has been excluded from the all-party peace
talks on Northern Ireland, said, "Sinn Fein's attitude... is to
get all of the guns out of Irish politics."
</P>
<P>
The pledge came as Sinn Fein attended the first session of the
Stormont talks which have made slow progress since their launch in
June 1996.
</P>
<P>
But Protestant Unionist parties boycotted today's preliminary
session, expressing scepticism over Sinn Fein's commitment to
peace.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the boycott, political analysts here said that it
was an ominous portent for the opening of the talks due to taking
place next week.
</P>
<P>
Unionist politicians, speaking for the majority Protestants who
are determined to remain under British rule, regard the IRA
cease-fire as bogus and are angry that Sinn Fein has been given a
seat while its guerrilla wing retains vast arsenals.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair said that the government would hold
Sinn Fein to its commitment to the Mitchell Principles with "total
determination."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Blair would meet Unionist leader David
Trimble in London Wednesday to urge him to join the all-party
talks.
</P>
<P>
The government has also promised to set up an international
body to oversee the issue by the time negotiations start next
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Diana's Chauffeur Definitely Drunk: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Henri Paul, the 41-year-old
security chief of the Hotel Ritz who crashed the Mercedes S-280
carrying Princess Diana, was definitely drunk when the accident
took place.
</P>
<P>
A third examination of the bloodstream of Paul showed that the
rate of alcohol containment in his blood was 1.8 grams per liter,
more than three times higher than the 0.5 gram per liter legal
limit, said Agence France-Presse quoting reliable sources.
</P>
<P>
The previous two examinations of Paul's bloodstream showed that
the alcohol containment rate in his blood was 1.75 grams per liter
and 1.82 grams per liter.
</P>
<P>
This over-high rate means that a man of 65 to 75 kilograms
heavy has drunk eight to nine cups of alcohol drink containing 81
to 94 grams of pure alcohol.
</P>
<P>
The third examination was ordered by an investigation judge at
the demand of the family of Paul.
</P>
<P>
All three examinations were conducted by different experts from
different institutions appointed by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The previous two examinations were conducted above the level of
his heart, while the last one was made on the level of his legs.
</P>
<P>
Paul's employer, the Hotel Ritz of Paris which is owned by the
family of Dodi al Fayed, who was also killed in the August 30
mid-night crash, had presented security video tapes showing Paul
talking and walking "normally" that night.
</P>
<P>
French police investigators are now inclined to the hypothesis
that the fatal crash which killed Princess Diana was directly
caused by over-speeding of her car and drunkenness of the
chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
If this hypothesis is established finally, the 10 photographers
under inquiry will not be found guilty for having pursued Diana.

<HEADLINE> Gas Turbine Generator In Dar es Salaam Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 9 (Xinhua) -- One of the
power-generating gas turbines in the Tanzanian capital has broken
down, which adds more difficulty to power supply in the city.
</P>
<P>
After Tanzania experienced power rationing four years ago it
imported from the United States gas turbines and installed them
at Ubungo in Dar es Salaam, which injected about 40 megawatts to
the national power grid.
</P>
<P>
The Acting Managing Director of Tanzania Electric Supply
Company (TANESC), Kiyaro Iranga, told the local press today that
this was the second time that the generator had developed a
mishap but he said an expert had been dispatched from the
suppliers to come to repair it.
</P>
<P>
Iranga also said that there was not enough stocks in the fuel
tanks at the Ubungo power station and TANESCO had no funds to
afford fuel to run the four gas turbines there for 24 hours in
the light of dropping water levels at two dams which support the
country's major generators.
</P>
<P>
Power rationing started on Monday in Dar es Salaam and other
regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Even if our customers paid their bills, it would still be
difficult for TANESCO to run the generators and break even. The
weather-lack of rain since 1992 to 1996 and this year has
contributed a lot to the company's problem," Irango said, adding,
"We need about three years of good rain in order to stabilize the
power problem."

<HEADLINE> Date of Somali Reconciliation Conference Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Somali former foreign minister
Mohamed Ali Hamed said today Somali faction leaders will hold a
national reconciliation congress in Bosaso, south of the Somali
capital of Mogadishu, on November 1.
</P>
<P>
Hamed informed Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid
of the decision during a meeting here today, which he said tackled
ways to render the expected congress a success, according to the
Egyptian Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Somali factions have agreed to put an end to the
fierce crisis in the country which has been going on for seven
years in order to restore stability and security, Hamed said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be attended by leader of the Somali Salvation
Alliance Ali Mahdi Mohamed and leader of the Somali Congress Party
Hussein Farah Aideed, together with a number of Somali National
Salvation Council leaders.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders signed a reconciliation agreement in the
Egyptian capital of Cairo on May 29 on holding peace talks to end
the civil war that has ravaged the country since 1991. Egypt has
been involved in mediating an end to the six-year-old Somali
crisis in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
As for the Cairo agreement, Hamed said such an important treaty
is still in force and all the factions endeavor to implement it.
</P>
<P>
The projected meeting is to discuss means of pushing forward
efforts that are aimed at holding an overall and expanded national
reconciliation conference including all Somali conflicting
factions.
</P>
<P>
Hamed and other members of the Somali National Salvation
Council are making a tour of a number of Arab countries to gain
support for their plan that is aimed at achieving Somali
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League is currently coordinating efforts with the U.N.
and the Organization of African Unity as well as major countries
in the area such as Egypt and Ethiopia to activate the Somali
reconciliation process.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 ouster of the late president Mohamed Siad Barre,
Somalia has been fragmented into fiefdoms protected by faction
leaders, who continued to fight to expand their turfs despite
several unsuccessful peace conferences.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS to Sum Up Peace Keeping in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A full set of documentation
will be produced to review how west African countries worked to
restore peace to Liberia after a seven-year bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is to
launch the special documentation project along with a
commemorative stamp during next year's ECOWAS summit, the News
Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The project and stamps will be launched in Abuja, capital of
Nigeria, to generate funds for the cash-strapped 16-member
organization.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the project is necessitated by the
need to produce an authentic documentation on the justification
for the intervention and foster the application of the lessons of
the initiative in advancing ECOWAS' objectives.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to maintain stability in the sub-region, ECOWAS
leaders in 1990 sent a peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG to
Liberia to help end the factional fightings ignited by the battle
launched by the current President Charles Taylor in 1989 against
the previous administration.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has successfully disarmed and demobilized the warring
factions, paving the way for the country's election in July which
led Taylor to the top seat he had fought for.
</P>
<P>
The planned documentation project, according to the report,
will also determine how the sub-regional body's success could be
developed as a model of west African response to regional
stability.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will highlight the special role played by
ECOWAS in anchoring the peace process, will involve a review of
the agreements preceeding the last one signed in Abuja last
August, as well as interviews with key players in the process
within and outside the country.
</P>
<P>
It will also involve the review of academic publications,
video documentation and other materials, in addition to
organizing seminars to collect expert opinions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the issuance of the commemorative stamps throughout
the sub-region is aimed to foster African brotherfood, highlight
the role of ECOMOG for prosperity and cement the solidarity of
west African troops, the report said.

while the minority Tutsis think they can remain in power through
force and denial of democracy must be all dropped in order to
create a harmonious situation under which the two can live
together.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The chief U.N. weapons
inspector today described his negotiations with the Iraqi
authorities on dismantling Iraq's mass-destruction weapons as
open, candid and very fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of dismantling Iraqi mass-destruction weapons, said at a
news conference here before leaving for New York that he
and the Iraqi side focussed in their discussions on the program
agreed upon last July, particularly in the missile and chemical
fields.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that further talks in these two fields would take
place in the future.
</P>
<P>
Butler arrived here last Friday, leading a seven-man team of
arms experts. This is his second visit to Iraq after his
appointment as head of the UNSCOM on July 1.
</P>
<P>
During his first visit to Iraq, Butler reached an agreement
with the Iraqi authorities on the working plan for the removal of
the Iraqi ballistic, chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Butler said that Iraq had communicated
to the UNSCOM a full and comprehensive statement on biological
weapons, and would provide further clarifications and information
about them within the next two days.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the results of laboratory analysis of the

LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe

unsteady start and a weak dollar.
</P>
<P>
In London, the FTSE 100 index ended down 0.7 percent or 34.7

<P>
German shares in Frankfurt ended 0.65 percent higher on the

<HEADLINE> Cuba Supports Iraq's Efforts to Lift Sanctions: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Deputy Minister of
Foreign Affairs Aiomilio Cabajero today expressed Cuba's support
for the Iraqi efforts to lift the U.N. sanctions imposed since
1990 for its invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Cabajero made the statement here at the meeting with Iraqi
Finance Minister Hikmat Azawi, during which they also exchanged
views on the prospects of promoting economic cooperation between
Cuba and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban deputy foreign minister denounced the U.S. policies
to obstruct the implementation of the oil-for-food accord, which
was signed between U.N. and Iraq in May last year and went into
effect last December.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars
of oil within six months to buy food and badly needed medicine,
was renewed last June.
</P>
<P>
Cabajero has also had a meeting with Senior Undersecretary of
the Iraqi Ministry of Health Shawki Morcos on promoting
cooperation in the field of health, as well as Cuba's
participation in providing Iraq with medical drugs and supplies
under the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Cabajero arrived in Baghdad Sunday evening on a two-day visit
to Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Economy in Slowing-down Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus' economy is
apparently locked in a slowing-down trend as the growth rate for
1998 was budgeted at 2 percent today.
</P>
<P>
The economy's growing pace, which was at around 5 percent in
1995, slowed down to 3 percent last year and is expected to keep
a 3.5 percent this year. A flagging tourism has been put on blame.
</P>
<P>
But emerging from the cabinet meeting which approved the 1998
budget, Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou said the 2
percent growth rate would appear favorable when compared with
those of the European Union (EU) member states.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for a full membership of the EU in 1990 and has
adjusted its statistics system to make figures comparable with
those of the EU.
</P>
<P>
The budget envisages an expenditure of 1,629.9 million Cyprus
pounds (3,064.2 million U.S. dollars) and a deficit of 550 million
pounds (1,034 million dollars). The deficit represents a 41.5
percent increase over that expected for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry said in a statement that large
infrastructure projects concerning water and road enjoy priorities
in the development sector of the budget.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the budget is aimed at achieving
government's goal of "economic stability, expansion of production
capacity and a fairer distribution of the national revenue."

ANKARA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Thirty rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed by the Turkish troops in
southeastern Turkey, Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels were killed in recent military operations in the
provinces of Bingol, Siirt and Sirnak, a statement issued by the
Emergency Regional Governor's Office said.
</P>
<P>
No casualties of the government troops were reported.
</P>
<P>
The PKK began in 1984 a separatist war against the Turkish
authorities in eastern and southeastern Turkey in an attempt to
establish an independent Kurdish state. More than 27,000 rebels,

<HEADLINE> Canadian Province Sues US in Salmon War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian province of
British Columbia (B.C.) has launched its lawsuit against the
United States for failing to curb overfishing by Alaska and other
states in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian province plans to seek 325 million dollars (230
million US dollars) in damages for alleged U.S. overfishing, said
reports today.
</P>
<P>
"This is not about an attempt to get money for American
overfishing," B.C. Premier Glen Clark was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This is about using the American court system to force the
states to comply with the principles of salmon treaty, conserve
the resource and force them to get back to the table and negotiate
a treaty in both our interests."
</P>
<P>
The B.C. suit alleges that intensive Alaskan interception of
Canadian-bound fish this summer violated the basic principles of
conservation and share in the Pacific Salmon Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. federal government signed the treaty in 1985 and
remains responsible for enforcing it in individual states.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the damages, the suit also seeks a court order
certifying that the U.S. violated its international obligations,
and directing Washington to compel compliance by individual
states.
</P>
<P>
The B.C. latest move reinvigorates the Pacific fish war that
has raged between Canada and the U.S. for months.
</P>
<P>
Yet, a memo leaked later Monday in Ottawa casts doubt on the
province's chance of success.
</P>
<P>
The memo, prepared by Canada's federal government, concludes
that a U.S. court would not likely side with Canadian interests in
such a dispute.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa said it had considered its own lawsuit, but ruled out
the option for various reasons including an interest in focusing
on diplomacy.

ATHENS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The annual consumer price
inflation in Greece increased from 5.4 percent in July to 5.6
percent in August, the National Statistics Service (NSS) announced

</P>
<P>
Electricity and petrol prices burdened the consumer price index
by 0.07 percent and 0.8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The NSS expected the inflation rate to ease this month.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that there was
a slight deviation from this year's inflation target, but he
stressed that it was a temporary phenomenon.
</P>

In August last year, the country's consumer price inflation was
8.0 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Around two tonnes of narcotics
has been seized in Turkey so far this year, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,300 people, including 183 foreigners, were
arrested in the 1,180 anti-drugs operations launched by the police
throughout the country during the period, Security Department
officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
This represents a significant drop in the volume of the drugs
seized by the police because of a change in the smuggling routes
in Turkey, they said.
</P>
<P>
The "Balkan route" has been replaced by the "norther Black Sea
route," they added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long been known as an important route for
trafficking drugs into the European markets from Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish police seized 4.4 tonnes of heroin in 1996,
accounting for 40 percent of the world's total haul, and 12 tonnes
of hashish, official figures show.

<HEADLINE> "Big Five" to Re-draw Future Economic Map: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The next 25 years will
witness an unprecedented boost in the prominence of developing
countries in the world economy, and five of those nations are
likely to change the world economic map, the World Bank predicted.
</P>
<P>
In its 114-page report "Global Economic Prospects and the
Developing Countries 1997" released here today, the World Bank
said policy reforms and a broadly favorable international economic
environment could allow developing countries to grow between 5 to
6 percent between now and 2020, raising their share of world
output from around one-sixth to nearly one third over the period.
</P>
<P>
The growing importance of developing economies will be
reflected in, and driven by, the emergence of the "Big Five" --
China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and Russia -- which now account
for half of the world's labor force but only 8 to 10 percent of
its output and trade. Given continued policy reforms and the
strengthening of an open world trade and investment regime, the
report projected, these figures could double by 2020, with
substantial repercussions for global resource allocation,
production, trade and also pricing.
</P>
<P>
Trade relationships will be transformed, the report said. The
current Big Five nations' share of world trade is only a third of
that of the European Union, but by 2020, it could surge to 50
percent higher than that of the EU. The rapid growth of developing
countries will have far-reaching effects, with substantial
benefits for most regions and countries in the world. Developing
countries will provide an ever more important market for
industrial country exports, the share going to developing
countries being expected to rise from 25 to 40 percent between
1992 and 2020.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report noted that the international economic
environment for developing countries remains favorable, which is
characterized by broadly stable world macroeconomic conditions,
expanding flows of private capital to developing countries, and
expected world trade growth at a solid 6 to 7 percent annually.
Last year, the private capital flows to developing countries
surged to a record 245 billion U.S. dollars with foreign direct
investment exceeding 100 billion dollars for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's current projects put the East Asian GDP annual
growth at 7.6 percent from 1997 to 2006, despite the fact that the
recent currency turmoil in some Southeast Asian nations may slow
down their economic growth. For developing countries as a whole,
the GDP annual growth could reach 5.4 percent in 1997-2006, more
than twice the 2.6 percent rate in the past decade. In sub-Saharan
Africa, where some 25 countries are undertaking structural
adjustment and economic reform, recent growth has exceeded 4
percent in the past two years, about two percentage points higher
than in the previous decade. In India, home to the largest number
of the world's poor, economic growth was nearly 7 percent for the
third year in a row.
</P>
<P>
The report also underlined the expansion of cross border or
global production by multinational enterprises which is among the
most important channels through which developing countries are
becoming more integrated in the world economy. Today, some
one-fifth of the world GDP is produced by the parents and foreign
affiliates of multinational enterprises. One-fifth of world
manufacturing output is produced by multinational affiliates
alone. One-third of total world trade is conducted within
different operations of the same multinational firm. In the 1990s,
developing countries have become the fastest growing location for
cross-border production by multinationals.

<HEADLINE> Information Security Risks Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Information security risks
have increased and a major threat came from "computer terrorists,"
a survey found.
</P>
<P>
Covering 4,226 information services executives from 24
countries, the survey was done by the New York-based service
company Ernst &AMP; Young.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the findings today, the company said 74 percent
of the respondents say their information security risks have risen
in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the respondents (55 percent) have expressed a
lack of confidence that their systems could withstand internal
attacks, while over a third (36 percent) lacked confidence that
their networks could weather external assault.
</P>
<P>
When identifying perceived threats to their security, the
executives put computer terrorists at the top of their lists,
followed by authorized users, former employees and unauthorized
users.
</P>
<P>
The trend toward global connectivity is creating new avenues
of opportunity for Internet terrorism, said an Ernst &AMP; Young
official who warned that monitoring the security of their networks
for breaks-ins should be an important part of their technology
investments.

<HEADLINE> Extraordinary Session of National Assembly Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The first extraordinary
session of parliament of Cameroun has ended in Yaounde on
September 8 after adopting a series of bills.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians started their work on August 26 when the
session convened.
</P>
<P>
The first bill to be passed is the validation of mandates of
seven newly elected parliamentarians who won the August 3
legislative elections re-run in the three constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The second bill tabled by the government to amend and
supplement certain provinsions of the law to lay down conditions
governing the election of the president is also adopted at a
plenary session in the absence of the Scocial Democratic Front
(SDF) party parliamentarian group and other opposition parties in
the assembly.
</P>
<P>
The bill was examined by the constitutional laws committee.
Top on the new provisions of the law, a presidential term of
office would be seven years renewable once.
</P>
<P>
Another aspect worth noting is the cfa 1500000 francs
enrolment fee each candidate will pay to run the elections.
</P>
<P>
The last bill adopted is one on private security agencies
aimed at providing legal framework to the service. The new law
sets the limits of the private security companies and lays down
sanctions for the non-respect of the rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
According to the new law, only Camerounians from the age of 20
and above will be authorized to establish security agencies. But
they are no longer expected to render their services in the
transportation of funds and the guarding of some state
infrastrutures, security installations and equipment. They are
not allowed to carry conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
Now existing security agencies will have three months to abide
by the new dispositions of the law when the president of the
republic of Cameroun promulgated it into law.
</P>
<P>
With the curtain drawing over the first extraordinary session
yesterday, the next appointment for the Camerounian
parliamentarians is in November for the second ordinary session
of the national assembly.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Outlining a familiar agenda
for the rest of 1997, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Tuesday
despite today's sound economy and generally peaceful climate, more
remains to be done.
</P>
<P>
Addressing students at American University, Clinton said that
he will pursue an activist agenda on several fronts, including
education, the environment and racial relations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "The news is good today. And in the face of good
news, the easiest thing to do is to rest, to take a vacation...But
complacency is not an option."
</P>
<P>
He added, "There is in fact a lot more to do...and the time to
start is now, this fall, with a series of concrete actions we can
take to cap a year of real progress for America."
</P>
<P>
White House officials had billed the speech as Clinton's effort
to better define his priorities, but he offered familiar
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reiterated calls for standardized testing in reading
and math, and the negotiating authority from Congress to craft
more trade pacts.
</P>
<P>
He referred again to protecting children from smoking and
promised to commit to specific international guidelines for
reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iranian Revolution Guards Commander Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Yehya Rahim Safavi today was
named as the new commander of Iran's Islamic Revolution's Guards
Corps (IRGC).
</P>
<P>
State-run radio and television reported that Iran's Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei issued a decree to replace Mohsen Rezaie with
Safavi, who had been deputy commander, as head of the IRGC.
</P>
<P>
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's former president and now
chairman of the State Expediency Council (SEC), has appointed
Rezaie as SEC secretary.
</P>
<P>
But the reports gave no reason for the removal of the former
IRGC commander.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a well-informed source told Xinhua that Rezaie
was removed from the IRGC because he is against the liberal
faction including new President Mohammad Khatami and interfered in
the presidential election in May.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that Rezaie carried out political activities
in the presidential elections in the interests of hardliner
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Before the announcement of the removal, unofficial reports said
that Rezaie had submitted his resignation to Khamenei in June and
that the latter had accepted the resignation.
</P>
<P>
But Rezaie denied any resignation move later.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC is an elite force in the Islamic Republic and
directly controlled by Khamenei. It has about 170,000 forces in
ground forces, naval forces and marines.

<HEADLINE> AL Urged to Discuss Growing Turkish-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Syria today expressed concern
over growing Israeli-Turkish military ties and urged the Arab
League (AL) to deal with their potential dangers, the Middle East
News Agency (MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Damascus will ask the AL Council's coming session slated for
September 21 to table an additional item to discuss the dangers
imposed by the Turkish-Israeli-U.S. manoeuvres to security and
peace in the region, said Eissa Darwish, Syrian ambassador in
Cairo and its permanent delegate to the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian ambassador told MENA that the Arab national
security is exposed to danger emanating from the Turkish-Israeli
military cooperation agreement that covers armament, training and
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel signed the military cooperation accord in
February 1996 and announced that they would stage joint naval
exercises together with the U.S. forces in the eastern
Mediterranean on November 15-25.
</P>
<P>
The planned maneuvers provoked outcries from Arab countries,
especially Syria, which sees itself as the target of the
Turkish-Israeli alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian diplomat said Arab countries had asked Turkey to
abrogate this agreement and to work for fostering ties with Arabs
as they are linked with historical ties and joint interests.
</P>
<P>
"However, Turkey insists on maintaining its alliance with
Israel defying Arab feelings as well as those of the Turkish
people, the majority of whom strongly support setting up deep and
distinguished ties with Arab and Islamic peoples and firmly oppose
Israeli expansionist and aggressive policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Darwish made the statement a week before Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel's planned one-day visit to Egypt, which is
supposed to allay Arab concern over the Israeli-Turkish
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Turkish summit, which was originally set for May,
was postponed in the wake of the planned naval war games.

LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair today called for a "new trade unionism" which will see
unions working in partnership with business.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the Trade Union Congress held in the coastal

The Prime Minister urged the unions to get involved with skills

program, to help the unemployed and play a central part on the
debate on the future of pensions.
</P>
<P>
"We will not go back to the days of industrial warfare, strikes
without ballots, mass and flying pickets, secondary action and all
the rest," Blair told delegates to the congress.
</P>
<P>
"You don't want it and I won't let it happen. And I will watch
very carefully to see how the culture of modern trade unionism
develops," he said.

<P>
CAIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Tourist arrivals in Cyprus in July reached 337,000,
an increase by 7.9 percent compared to that of a year before.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics released here today, 64.4
percent of the visitors came from European Union member
countries, and another 18.8 percent from the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The increase indicates a recovery of the country's tourism,
which showed a decrease of tourist arrivals in 1996.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Saudi Arabia has emerged as the largest soft
drinks market in the Middle East region with an estimated annual
consumption of more than 1.28 billion liters, Saudi newspapers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has also become a major supplier of canned
beverage to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member countries
who consume annually an estimated 3.8 billion cans, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Since a new Saudi can company named United Arab Can
Manufacturing Company was opened last April, Saudi Arabia has
already exported 50 million cans to other GCC states and other
Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
The company which is a joint venture with Coca Cola company of
the United States produced in three months of operation nearly 300
million cans and 500 million can ends.
</P>
<P>
It is producing a complete range of can sizes to suit the needs
of both the local and international market, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Cyprus' economy is apparently locked in a
slowing-down trend as the growth rate for 1998 was budgeted at 2
percent today.
</P>
<P>
The economy's growing pace, which was at around 5 percent in
1995, slowed down to 3 percent last year and is expected to keep
a 3.5 percent this year. A flagging tourism has been put on blame.
</P>
<P>
The budget envisages an expenditure of 1,629.9 million Cyprus
pounds (3,064.2 million U.S. dollars) and a deficit of 550 million
pounds (1,034 million dollars). The deficit represents a 41.5
percent increase over that expected for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry said in a statement that large
infrastructure projects concerning water and road enjoy priorities
in the development sector of the budget.

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes Dini's Statements on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece today criticized Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's statements on Cyprus, saying that
they had been made for reasons of "expediency."
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that the
European Union (EU) had a policy on the Cyprus issue which had
been expressed officially by the president of the council of
ministers Jacques Poos.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the EU will not change its stance towards
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Dini reportedly said in Washington on Monday that there were
"two governments, two entities and borderlines" in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Undersecretary Yiannos Kranidiotis today also
described Dini's statements as "incorrigible."
</P>
<P>
"There are two communities on Cyprus," he said, "but these find
themselves under the same legal international entity, the Republic
of Cyprus, which is represented by the Cypriot government."
</P>
<P>
Greece strongly protested statements by Dini in Rome last month
after a meeting with his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem, that
"there are two republics, two governments and two entities in
Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
pro- Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot side declared unilaterally a
breakaway state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", which
has only been recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Agrees Red Cross as Sole Mediator for Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri agreed today that the International Committee of Red Cross
(ICRC) be the sole mediator in a proposed exchange of the remains
of Israelis for Lebanese held in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister agreed that ICRC should be the only contact
channel in the suggested swap, maintaining that involvement of
many sides would make things complicated, John Jack Ferzer, ICRC
representative in Lebanon, told the press following a meeting with
Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese guerrillas of Hezbollah and Amal ambushed last Friday
an Israeli commando at Ansariyah village in south Lebanon, killing
12 Israeli marines and wounding four others.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah fighters offered to swap the remains of the Israelis
for 75 Lebanese held in Israeli jails, including its former
leaders Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid and Mustafa Dirani kidnaped from
their homes several years ago.
</P>
<P>
Ferzer disclosed that Israel had approached the ICRC and asked
it to transfer to the Lebanese government a message over the swap,
which he refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
He said he would convey Lebanese government's reply to Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to Lebanese reports, Israel refused to release Obeid
and Dirani at the moment, saying it was too early to talk about
it.
</P>
<P>
Asked when the mediation will take place, Ferzer said it would
need a long time, probably one week, one month, or even several
years.
</P>
<P>
The previous swap in which 45 Lebanese and the bodies of 123
Hezbollah guerrillas were exchanged for the bodies of two Israelis
took place on July 21 last year after nearly six months of
mediation by the ICRC.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Small Business Optimism Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Small Business Optimism
Index rose a half point in August in the United States, said
the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB).
</P>
<P>
The Index at 104.0 represents the highest level since November
1994, it said in a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Sales figures continued to strengthen and the general sentiment
was that things would get even better over the next six months,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Owners expecting economic conditions to improve outnumbered
pessimists by eight percentage points, an even greater margin of
optimism than last month's, it added.
</P>
<P>
The August survey found a net 20 percent of small firms
planning to expand employment in the next three months, the
highest reading in the 24 year history of the NFIB.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found tighter labor market, higher wages,
modestly higher prices and strong capital spending in August.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1973, the Small Business Optimism Index covered 677
business owners this year. It was believed to be a reliable
predictor of domestic economic activity, according to the
Washington-based NFIB.

<HEADLINE> US Productivity Increases Quickly in 2nd quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The productivity of
American workers grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.7
percent in the second quarter, the fastest rate in three and an
half years, U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The gain was much faster than the initially estimated 0.6
percent reported last month and nearly double the 1.4 percent rate
of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Non-farm business productivity -- output per hour worked -- is
the key to how fast living standard can rise in the country.
</P>
<P>
The department reported that labor costs per unit of output --
a key ingredient in price pressures -- also slowed in the second
quarter. They rose at an annual rate of just 0.5 percent, compared
to an initial estimate of 2.4 percent and a rate of 3.1 percent in
the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
It was the slowest rate of increase in three years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that it should help reassure the U.S. Federal
Reserve that wage pressures aren't accelerating even though the
unemployment rate in the U.S. is hovering just above a 24-year
low.
</P>
<P>
Economists have speculated that strong productivity has
allowed corporations to pay higher wages and earn high profits
without boosting prices.
</P>
<P>
Rapid productivity advances in the U.S. -- in excess of 3
percent a year -- supported the economic boom and low inflation of
the 1960s. But since the early 1970s, productivity growth has
averaged only about 1 percent a year. It was 1.3 percent last
year.

<HEADLINE> Delegations to 15th Party Congress Arrive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The 36 delegations to the
upcoming 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) have arrived in Beijing and reported to the secretariat of
the congress this evening.
</P>
<P>
The delegations are from 31 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities, including those from the departments directly
under the central authorities, the People's Liberation Army, the
Armed Police Force, and one whose members are of Taiwanese origin.
</P>
<P>
The delegates have brought with them latest news on reform and
opening-up. They said that since the 14th Congress in 1992, the
Party Central Committee has promoted the principle of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, furthered reform and
opening-up, and made gratifying achievements in economic
development and cultural and ethic progress.
</P>
<P>
The delegates expressed the hope that the upcoming 15th
Congress will become one that links the past with the future, and
serves as a new milestone on China's path of progress.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of the socialist market economy has promoted
the development of the rural economy," said Wu Jinyin, a delegate
from central China's Henan Province, who added that active
participation by local farmers in market economy has help boost
the per capita income to 2,300 yuan last year, double the figure
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We have just initiated a new route to Australia," Yu Yan'en,
president of China Southern Airlines, said enthusiastically. Since
1992, he added, the carrier has brought in a large number of
airplanes from abroad, and has become one of chief airlines in
China, with 91 airplanes in operation and assets worth 25.9
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Hu Yongqing, a delegate from northern Anhui Province, east
China, said the colliery where he works has lost money for 12
consecutive years. "Since the 14th CPC Congress, the colliery has
actively participated in market competition. Now, its annual coal
production reaches 1.5 million tons, and it reports more than 100
million yuan in pre-tax profits each year," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Beijing, many delegates have visited grassroots
units to hear the opinions of ordinary Party members and the
people.
</P>
<P>
Wang Dazhong, a delegate from east China Shaanxi Province who
has been a director of state-owned enterprises for 14 years,
called several meetings with staff members and Party members after
he was elected a delegate of the 15th CPC Congress.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he believes that when the state-owned enterprises are
in the red, they will wriggle out of difficulty once they are
operated in accordance with Deng Xiaoping's principle of "doing
everything on the premise of improving productivity, benefiting
national strength and people's living standards, liberating their
minds and furthering reform."
</P>
<P>
Wang Guixiang, a delegate the Women's Federation of
northermost Heilongjiang Province, said she was very proud to
attend the 15th Congress as a representative of women.
</P>
<P>
"I have made some investigations in grassroots units and
collected the opinions of my co-workers before coming to Beijing,"
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
She added, "I will voice the heartfelt wishes of women during
panel discussions at the congress."
</P>
<P>
Leg Qog, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of the Tibet
Autonomous Region, and vice-chairman of the regional government,
expressed the common aspirations of people of all ethnic groups in
Tibet when he said, "I must bring the heartfelt wishes of the more
than 90,000 Party members in Tibet Beijing, to the Party Central
Committee."
</P>
<P>
Yang Xushun, director of the Financial Department of Guizhou
province, southwest China, said he will loyally perform his duty
as a delegate so that he will live up to the expectations of the
1.08 million Party members in his province.

<HEADLINE> Albanian PM Visits NATO Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister
Fatos Nano signed a new partnership program with the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization during his visit to the NATO
headquarters today.
</P>
<P>
Nano told the North Atlantic Council that he would extend
gratitude for the alliance's assistance in the Balkan nation's
recovery from a recent civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
Nano said that he would thank NATO member states for their
support during his country's difficult times.
</P>
<P>
"Your effort has not gone in vain," the prime minister said.
"NATO principles, expertise and operational records in Bosnia will
be born in the minds of the Albanian population and you will
hardly find an anti-NATO sensativity among the Albanians or the
country's political parties."
</P>
<P>
Nano said that his visit was to upgrade the relations between
Albania and the 15-nation alliance.
</P>
<P>
He said that within reasonable times his country that was now
seeking NATO assistance would be able to belong to those which
were among the nations which were qualified security producers and
distributors.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana described Nano's first
visit to the alliance as coming at a very important time when
Albania is recovering from political upheaval.
</P>
<P>
"Your presence here today," said the NATO chief, "is an
indication that your country is on the road of recovery."
</P>
<P>
Albania was among the first countries to sign the NATO
Partnership for Peace program in 1994 and has required NATO to
open a liaison office in its Defense Ministry to ensure permanent
assistance to its army.
</P>
<P>
A NATO delegation visited Albania last month and promised to
help the Balkan country to reconstruct its army which had been
dismantled during the country's recent riots.
</P>
<P>
NATO assistance includes recovery from the population heavy and
light weapons taken from the military depots during the riots.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Clear Backing for Scottish Devolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- An overwhelming majority of
voters in Scotland gave support to Scottish devolution, according
to a poll today in Glasgow's The Herald newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The results of the poll, which came out just one day before
Thursday's Scottish devolution referendum, showed that 61 percent
of voters are in support of a Scottish Parliament, with only 20
percent opposed and 19 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
As to the question of whether they want the parliament to have
tax-raising powers, the Scots are less sure, but still there were
45 percent in favor. Those against accounted for 32 percent, with
24 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
The governing Labor Party, the Liberal Democrats and the
pro-independence Scottish National Party have been campaigning for
the same platform in support of a new Scottish Parliament with
tax-raising powers.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition Conservative Party has been urging
Scots to vote "no," saying what was at stake was the whole future
of the United Kingdom and the devolution would put Scotland on a
slippery slope to independence from Britain.
</P>
<P>
Scotland was united with England in 1707, but so far it still
keeps many of the characteristics of a nation state, with its own
legal and education systems.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- France rejected accusations
today by the Afghan Muslim student movement Taliban that it is
providing support to the forces of another Afghan faction led by
Ahmed Shah Massud.
</P>
<P>
"France does not provide financial aid, arms, spare parts or
military materials to the protagonists (of Afghanistan)," said
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
The French government knows nothing about the presence of
French engineers in Afghanistan, the spokesman added.

"France continues to observe strict neutrality in the crisis,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said France and its European Union partners have called on
Afghans to renounce the option of force and "engage sincerely in
the process of dialogue, which will lead to the establishment of a
government of vast union."
</P>
<P>
The chief of Taliban, Mollah Mohammed Rabbani, denounced French
engineers on Tuesday as supporting the forces of Massud by
teaching them to use weapons and pilot planes on bombing raids in
the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
He also accused France of providing financial aid, arms spare
parts "at international instances" to the opposition forces of

<HEADLINE> International Economic Forum Opens in Seoul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A two-day international forum
on global economic issues, particularly South Korea's role in the
world economy, opened here today.
</P>
<P>
In an opening address to the Korea Summit '97, South Korean
Minister of Finance and Economy Kang Kyung-shik said the
government, business and general public should strive to become
consumer-oriented with minimum bureaucratic control.
</P>
<P>
He then presented five major directions to be pursued by the
South Korean economy: re-establishment of governmental and public
sector roles in forming a consumer-oriented pattern; promotion of
fair competition and corporate transparency; enhancing flexibility
in economic and social systems; improving infrastructure for
social systems as rules and practices; and facilitating
information processing and technology innovation.
</P>
<P>
The forum, organized by the International Herald Tribune and
cosponsored by Samsung, Hyundai and Daewoo groups, is being
attended by 800 Korean and foreign dignitaries representing
political, business, academic and journalistic circles.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the South Korean government, Minister of
Trade, Industry and Energy Lim Chang-yuel said South Korea will
actively participate in additional rounds of multilateral free
trade negotiations while advancing the domestic economic systems.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the importance of co-prosperity of developed and
developing blocs, Lim said, "Industrial countries need to take
into account the situations of industrializing countries while
strengthening technological cooperation to help the latter's
smooth industrial restructuring."
</P>
<P>
Alvin Toffler, a U.S. futurologist, who took the rostrum as a
foreign speaker, said that South Korea's current economic
difficulties are due to the fact that the country has not fully
dropped its economic structure based on the "second-wave"
industrial strategy of mass production and export drive.
</P>
<P>
"In order for South Korea to tide over these difficulties, the
nation needs to develop high value-added knowledge products that
fit the era of information, ensure labor market flexibility and
renovate educational systems," he said.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, vice minister of China's Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Ministry, also delivered a speech today on
China's external economic policies and Sino-South Korean economic
relations.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Young-sam will deliver his keynote
speech tomorrow, followed by other government officials including
Minister of Foreign Affairs Yoo Chong-ha and Minister of
Construction and Transportation Lee Hwan-kyun.
</P>
<P>
Major South Korean business leaders, including Hyundai Group
chairman Chung Mong-koo, and Daewoo Group chairman Kim Woo-choong,
will also address the meeting.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Leaders' Instructions on Soil-Erosion Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Instructions by President
Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng on dealing with the issue of
soil-erosion have won strong support from across the country,
especially from the agricultural and educational sectors.
</P>
<P>
A group of experts, scholars and government officials gathered
here this afternoon to discuss the two leaders' instructions made
after reading a report by Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun on
tackling soil erosion in northern Shaanxi Province in
north China.
</P>

The participants concluded that the instructions have provided
a plan for dealing with the problem and developing
environmentally-friendly agriculture in the country.
</P>

Some of the participants proposed that an educational campaign
be carried out throughout the country on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Every Chinese should be made aware of that there is no way out
for a style of development which improves the economy by
sacrificing the environment, and the country must follow a path
which produces economic, ecological and social results
simultaneously, so as to realize sustained growth, they said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Criticizes Iran on Pilgrims' Visit to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Baghdad today criticized Iran
for barring its citizens from visiting Iraq by creating pretexts
on the country's reception capabilities.
</P>
<P>
All the necessary services, including security and health, for
Iranian visitors are well in place in spite of the seven-year-long
U.N. sanctions against the country, the foreign ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Iran's justifications for not permitting its citizens to visit
holy sites in Iraq are mere pretexts to deny the Iranians the
right to visit Iraq, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Department Director of the Iranian Foreign Ministry
Mohamed Jalal Fayrouznia said in a statement on September 4 that
the health and security conditions in Iraq would not afford the
normal performance of the proper rites by Iranian citizens.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced on August 18 that it decided to lift a ban on
Iranian travelers to Iraq, imposed in 1980 when the Iraq-Iran War
broke out, and to allow the Iranians to visit the holy sites in
Iraq from September 4.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the government's decision was final and
irrevocable and needed no negotiations as demanded by Iran on
arrangements for its visitors.
</P>
<P>
Iran has said the Iraqi offer to admit Iranian pilgrims is
aimed at diverting attention from unresolved issues between the
two countries, such as the one of prisoners from the 1980-88
Iran-Iraqi war.

<HEADLINE> Italy Stresses EU's Role in Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi said today that the European Union (EU) will play a key
role in restarting the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that Italy was concerned about the recent worsening of
Israel-Palestine relations
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press conference after meeting
visiting Saudi Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Prince
Sultan Ibn Abdul Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that the first step to revive the Middle East peace
process is to bring the two parties back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Prodi and Prince Sultan discussed the
prospects of U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright's
first visit to Middle East
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that the visit is "extremely important."
</P>
<P>
However, Prodi warned that nobody should expect immediate
results because "with so many problems in the area, it is very
difficult to find solutions overnight."
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that the EU has an "enormous" role to play in the
Middle East peace process if given enough time.
</P>
<P>
EU will send its special envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos to the
region after Albright's mission, he said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi and Prince Sultan also discussed bilateral relations and
trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They said they were pleased with the expansion of their trade
links and wished to strengthen their ties in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan, who arrived here today to kick off his official
visit to Italy, is also scheduled to meet Italian Defence Minister
Beniamino Andreatta.

<HEADLINE> Currency Turbulence in HK, Inland China Unlikely: WB Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A currency crisis such as the
one which occurred in Thailand earlier this year will not happen
in either Hong Kong or China's interior area, a World Bank
official said here.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Hong Kong and China's interior area is very
different from that of Thailand," Austin Hu, acting chief of the
Bank's resident mission in China, said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The recent currency crisis of Thailand was largely due to
failure in economic restructuring, declining economic
competitiveness, lingering deficits in the current account,
swelling foreign-exchange debts of enterprises, and limited
foreign exchange reserves, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed the Thai crisis on excessive speculative
investment in real estate and stocks, which eventually resulted in
a surge in non-performing credits and runaway foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, Hu said, the economy is stable, both the hardware
and software of the financial sector are perfect, and hard
currency reserves are strong.
</P>
<P>
All these factors, plus upbeat market attitudes, indicate that
financial turbulence will not occur in Hong Kong, the World Bank
official said.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed the possibility of currency volatility in
China, saying that the Chinese yuan is still inconvertible under
the capital account and the Chinese government exercises strict
control on borrowing from overseas.
</P>
<P>
China also has strong foreign exchange reserves, which stood at
126 billion US dollars by the end of June and may reach 135
billion US dollars by the end of this year, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, said earlier that China has learned a lesson from
the Thai crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We will adhere to a moderately tight monetary policy, ensure
the rational use of foreign funds, restrain from relying
excessively on foreign debts, and guard against the possibility of
a bubble economy resulting from overheated real estate and stock
markets," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has no problem in balance of payments in
foreign exchange since 64 percent of the foreign capital in the
country is direct foreign investment and 80 percent of the 120
billion US dollars in foreign debts is of long terms.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China has had a key period of
reform and development in its defense industry over the past five
years, especially in developing the aerospace sector, new weapons
research, and products for civilian use.
</P>
<P>
The country launched 17 Chinese and foreign satellites in the
past five years. In the first half of this year, it sent up the
Dongfanghong-3 communications satellite, the Fengyun-2
meteorological satellite, and the Long March-3B rocket. This shows
that the aerospace technology of China has matured, said officials
with the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for
National Defense.
</P>
<P>
China's one-billion-byte-per-second supercomputer, the Yinhe-2,
was developed in November of 1992, and the country reported
success last June with its Yinhe-3, which can do 13 billion
calculations per second. The country has the technology for even
more complicated computers, according to a source.
</P>
<P>
A number of high-tech developments have helped the
modernization of national defense andy economic expansion.

</P>
<P>
The product structure of the defense industry has also
changed. The output value of civilian products has been increasing
at an annual rate of 20 percent over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The commission says that it has large-scale enterprise groups
with more than 100 million yuan in revenues and per capita income
above 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Military enterprises now produce 60 percent of the country's
motorbikes, 26 percent of railway wagons, and nine percent of
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Sciences and technologies for national defense have been widely
applied for civil aeronautics, environmental protection,
agricultural development, and medicine, greatly helping economic,

<P>
HONG KONG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) is fully prepared for the World Bank
and International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meetings scheduled to
 take place later this month, a senior local official said today.
</P>
<P>
Donald Tsang, financial secretary of the SAR government and
chairman of a steering committee to guide the preparation work,
expressed the hope that the forthcoming conference, the first
major international event in Hong Kong after the July 1 return to
China, would be the best ever annual meetings of the World Bank
and IMF.
</P>
<P>
Touring the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center (HKCEC)
Phase II, the venue of this major international conference, this
afternoon, Tsang was pleased that preparatory work at the venue
had been completed on time.
</P>
<P>
During the tour, he told reporters that he was delighted that
"everything would be ready by the time when pre-meeting events
begin in the middle of this month."
</P>
<P>
"We have put a great deal of effort and resources into making a
successful event," he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to him, about 14,000 delegates including top bankers,
central bank governors and finance ministers will attend the
annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
The meetings will present "a golden opportunity for us to show
them the modern city of Hong Kong, the efficient and modern
working environment of Hong Kong, and most importantly the
stability and financial strength of Hong Kong immediately
following the transition," Tsang pointed out.

<HEADLINE> HK Provisional Legislature Considers Court of Final Appeal-related Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Legislative
 Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) today went through the second reading of an amended bill on
the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the legislature, Administrative Secretary Anson
Chan said that the bill proposed by the SAR government aims to
amend the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance to improve its
provisions in respect of the constitution of the Appeal Committee.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (Amendment) (No.
3) Bill 1997 is "essential" to the normal operation of the Court
of Final Appeal, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to the existing ordinance, an Appeal Committee shall
consist of either the Chief Justice and two permanent judges
nominated by the Chief Justice, or three permanent judges
nominated by the Chief Justice.
</P>
<P>
"However," Chan said, "there is no express prohibition against
bias by pre-determination in this section". "As in the case of
substantive hearings of appeals, it would be inappropriate for a
judge to sit on an Appeal Committee if he has previously rejected
the application, or if the judgment or order at issue was made by
him or by a court of which he was a member," she added.
</P>
<P>
As the proposed exclusion from the Appeal Committee of judges
who have had a previous involvement with the case may mean that
there are insufficient permanent judges to sit on that committee,
the amended bill provides that where a sufficient number of
permanent judges is not available for any cause to sit on the
Appeal Committee, the Chief Justice shall nominate a non-permanent
Hong Kong judge to sit in place of a permanent judge, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
The bill also aims to clear doubts as to the powers of the
Appeal Committee, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The PLC members also discussed a number of issues concerning
the forthcoming legislative elections, housing, designation of
Teachers' Day and women's care.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Help Indonesia in Cloud Seeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today pledged
to extend technical assistance to Indonesia including providing
the aircraft to carry out cloud seeding to improve the haze
condition caused by forest fires in that country.
</P>
<P>
Science, Technology and Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding
said here today he had directed the Meteorological Services
Department to provide the expertise and negotiate with the Pan
Malaysian Air Transport to get a suitable aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government was prepared to carry out cloud
seeding from the Riau archipelago and its Environment Minister
Sarwono Kusumaatmadja has written to him two days ago seeking
Malaysia's help to carry out the cloud seeding, Law Hieng Ding was
quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
Law said several air transport companies would be asked to
provide a suitable plane as the aircraft of the Pan Malaysian Air
Transport would be involved in air surveillance for a private
company next week.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft would also be deployed for cloud seeding in Kedah,
northern Malaysia, next month, he said.
</P>
<P>
The haze, which, according to the Indonesian minister in his
letter to Law, was caused by five major agricultural companies
which were found to be involved in the burning of forests covering
8,000 hectares in Kalimantan, Sumatra and Riau, has blanketed the
region since May and Malaysia has been enveloped by the haze since
mid July.
</P>
<P>
Law is scheduled to attend the ASEAN Environment Ministers'

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has approved a 150,000 U.S. dollar loan to help fund a Metro
Manila Air Quality Improvement Project, the Philippine Environment
and Natural Resources Department said today.
</P>
<P>
As an initiative of the Philippine government, the project aims
to examine and determine the elements of an urban air quality
management strategy developed earlier by an inter-agency group
that includes experts from non-government and international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The ADB grant will fund the review of proposals for introducing
a motor vehicle inspection system, assessing the governance and
human resources issues associated with air quality and
environmental management, and enforcement of air quality
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The project will also include monitoring of public health,
assessment of public awareness needs, traffic engineering and road
rehabilitation requirements, and undertake an economic analysis of
various strategies in mitigating air quality deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that air quality in Metro Manila is deteriorating
rapidly as the country's economy surges ahead, the department
said.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Stick to One-China Policy: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said today Australia will stick to one-China
policy and urged other Western countries to deal with China on
human rights issue in a constructive way.
</P>
<P>
"We will stick to our one-China policy ... and under our
one-China policy, which goes back to 1972, we don't recognize
Taiwan as a separate political entity," Downer told the
Asia-Australia Institute in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"They (China) of course understand that we are going to have
economic contacts with Taiwan," the foreign minister was quoted by
the Australian Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Participating in a discussion organized by the institute on
"How should Australia's foreign policy-makers deal with China's
growing influence", the foreign minister rejected the assertion
that China might splinter into separate entities.
</P>
<P>
"To understand China includes understanding their absolute
determination to remain a united country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The sensitivity about Taiwan, and for that matter Tibet, is
born very much out of concern for the fragmentation of China," he
added.
</P>
<P>
On human rights issue, Downer urged other Western countries to
follow Australia's suit in dealing with China in a constructive
way.
</P>
<P>
Australia has been the first Western country that has conducted
a dialogue on human rights with China recently on the basis of
mutual respect and in a constructive way.
</P>
<P>
Grabbing headlines by criticizing China's record on human
rights had proven unproductive, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Downer said that since the recent handover of power in Hong
Kong, the government was receiving message of "business as usual"
from Australian firms operating there.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting at the State Library of New South Wales
that for China, as for Australia, a stable and peaceful region
provided that necessary climate for continued growth in trade and
economic activity generally.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kuala Lumpur Stock Shares Face Resistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Wu Dingbao)
</P>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Shares on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) suffered from a setback today on
profit-taking after a sharp rebound for three successive days.
</P>
<P>
At the close today, the 100-quality stocks Composite Index (CI)
fell 25.67 points or by 2.88 percent to 863.08, the all-share Emas
index dropped 6.20 points to 244.96, the Industrial Index was
60.31 points lower at 1,746.89 while the Second Board Index lost
4.46 points to 451.36.
</P>
<P>
The KLSE started recovery on September 5 when the benchmark CI,
which once retreated to 675.15 low on persistent selling pressure
by foreign investors, surged 90.47 points or 12.37 percent to
close at 821.59 last week following the aggressive buying by local
funds.
</P>
<P>
It continued its upward trend during the following two days
with the CI ending at 879.71 points on September 8 and closing at
888.75 points Tuesday respectively.
</P>
<P>
The recovery was seen to be triggered by Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's announcement on September 4 of the
lifting of designated securities status on the 100-stock index
components and of the deferment in the implementation of several
projects, which analysts said restored confidence in market
players.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Mahathir also announced the setting-up of a 60-billion
ringgit (20.69 billion U.S. dollars) fund, with the government
itself advancing 30 billion ringgit (10.34 billion dollars)
towards the fund, to shore up the bourse.
</P>
<P>
A market analyst said today, "There is no reason not to sell as
prices had gone up sharply in the past few days." And foreign
funds were also selling blue chips, he added.
</P>
<P>
Today, losers thumped gainers by 612 to 124 while 71 counters
were unchanged and 78 untraded, with total turnover being 325.633
million shares worth 1.716 billion ringgit (about 591.7 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The main board volume dropped to 267.923 million shares worth
1.216 billion ringgit (about 419.3 million U.S. dollars) from
511.910 million shares valued at 2.197 billion ringgit (about
757.5 million U.S. dollars) Tuesday. The second board turnover was
57.710 million shares worth 500.747 million ringgit (about 172.6
million U.S. dollars) against Tuesday's 88.458 million shares
valued at 722.612 million ringgit (about 249.1 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Direct business deals were reduced to 15.692 million shares
worth 911.094 million ringgit (about 314.1 million U.S. dollars)
against Tuesday's 34.280 million shares valued at 220.267 million
ringgit (about 75.9 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the analysts maintained that there should not be
anymore "panicking" as the market sentiment had strengthened with
the above measures taken by the government restoring confidence in
market players.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some recent government forecasts, such as this year's
current account deficit at 5.2 percent from 5.5 percent of Gross
National Products and Gross Domestic Product growth at over 8
percent this financial year, also helped restore confidence in
market players.
</P>
<P>
They are confident that the 900-level would be breached later
this week or next week.

<HEADLINE> Dates for Pak-Indian Talks Not Confirmed: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is still awaiting
a response from India about the third round of foreign secretary
level talks between the two countries, a Foreign Office spokesman
said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are still awaiting the response from India," the spokesman
said when referring to an Indian report that talks will begin in
New Delhi from September 15.
</P>
<P>
"We have not received anything on it yet," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The last round of foreign secretary level talks between
Pakistan and India was held here in June.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two sides agreed to set up working groups
to resolve all outstanding issues including Kashmir between the
two countries. They also agreed to resume their talks some time
this month in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed Tuesday expressed
his hope that Pakistan will not be forced out of the process of
dialogue for resolving outstanding issues including the core issue
of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
While stressing Pakistan's keen desire for the dialogue with
India, he said the Kashmir issue is a stumbling block between the
two countries for having good neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India have resumed their foreign secretary level
talks in March in New Delhi after a suspense of more than three
years. The talks had broken down in January 1994 due to their
differences on the Kashmir issue.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Reportedly Enter Opposition Stronghold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Islamic Taliban
forces today have reportedly entered the main opposition
stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif, around 300 km north of Kabul,
Pakistan Television (PTV) reported.
</P>
<P>
Armed clashes have erupted as the Taliban fighters entered this
morning the Afghanistan's second largest city, stronghold of
anti-Taliban strongman Uzbek warlord Abdul Malik, and they were
joined by some defected local commanders, PTV quoted a report by
private Afghan Islamic Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting was continuing to rage at some parts of the
city between Taliban fighters and forces loyal to Malik, whose
brief alliance with Taliban has led the student militia to a
humiliating defeat in May in northern Afghanistan, PTV said.
</P>
<P>
However, no independent confirmation of the report was
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
As conflicting reports kept pouring in here from Afghanistan,
no one knows exactly how close the Taliban positions from
Mazar-e-Sharif, the only major Afghan city not in Taliban's hand.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports of an apparent internal coup against Malik met
with a strong denial from a spokesman for the ousted Afghan
government, who dismissed the information as "baseless."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also denied the report that General Malik has
already fled abroad from Mazar-e-Sharif, saying "these are just
rumors, the alliance forces are in full control of the situation."
</P>
<P>
Malik, who is now allied with forces led by Afghanistan's
former military chief Ahmad Masood and Shiite faction
Hezb-e-Wahdat, took control of Mazar-e-Sharif late May after
turning against this former boss Rashid Dostum who had been the
main ethnic Uzbek commander.
</P>
<P>
He defected to the Taliban side on May 19, helping the
hard-line Islamic militia sweep across key northern provinces and
take Mazar-e-Sharif. But he then turned on his new allies after
disagreements surfaced over power-sharing and forced the Taliban
out of the city.
</P>
<P>
The alliance factions now defending Mazar-e-Sharif are
Hezb-e-Wadhat, another Shiite group Harakat-e-Islami and former
president Burhanuddin Rabbani's Jamiat-e-Islami.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who now control about two-thirds of the Afghan
territory and the capital of Kabul, have vowed to impose a strict
Islamic rule in the war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Forges Action Plan to Spur Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
today came up with an 11-point action plan to save its economy
which has slowed down after being hit by a protracted currency
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The strategies were drawn during a joint meeting of the
departments of trade and industry, finance, agriculture, and the
National Economic and Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
Trade Secretary Cesar Bautista said among the 11 proposals, the
development of the country's infrastructure was deemed crucial in
stimulating economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include cutting transaction costs in banks,
reducing government bureaucracy, improving trade balance to
increase foreign reserves, increasing domestic savings and
ensuring sustainable agriculture growth.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said these action plans can be implemented in the
"meantime" to mitigate the impact of the peso depreciation and
rising interest rate on the growth of the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the business sector believes that the Philippines can
be better off after this temporary currency turmoil, compared with
its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine economy, which has been viewed as a new tiger
economy, showed signs of slowdown during the first half of this
year. In the first semester, the country recorded a
lower-than-expected 5.9 percent gross national product growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
Because of the current currency turmoil and high interest
rates, the economy is expected to further slow down in the second
half, making the government difficult to meet growth targets.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Import Corn, Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today approved the importation of 300,000 tons of corn to
prevent a corn shortage in the country due to the effects of the
coming El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
This volume of corn, to be imported at a 35 percent low tariff,
is expected to ease a projected severe corn shortage in 1997-98
crop year.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Department estimated there will be a
1.4-million-ton corn shortage in this crop year because of an
expected fall in local corn production caused by El Nino-triggered
severe drought.
</P>
<P>
El Nino, a kind of weather phenomenon which can cause
catastrophic effects including storm and drought, is expected to
hit the Philippines in the last quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Ramos today also endorsed the importation of 29,000 tons of
frozen beef to meet the increasing demand for beef by the domestic
meat processing industry.

<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- People around China have
written to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) wishing success to the upcoming 15th CPC National Congress.
</P>
<P>
The nearly 1,000 letters all expressed the hope that the
congress will accelerate the reform and opening-up pace of China,
and become a new milestone in the history of the CPC and China's
socialist modernization, according to an official of the General
Office of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
A bank employee in Hubei Province said in his letter that
China's socialist construction has made remarkable achievements
since the 14th National Congress five years ago, and China has
been the strongest, its people the most prosperous, and its
international status the highest in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
"It is of great significance and has far-reaching influence
for the Party to convene the 15th National Congress at this
historic movent to summarize the successful experience since China
adopted the reform and opening-up policy and explain the principles
and policies in the near future," the man wrote.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
(RBZ) today said it has embarked on a restructuring exercise to
streamline its management and service delivery structures with a
view to improving efficiency and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, under which the bank would install a new
information technology system, was intended to re-position the
central bank to meet the ever-growing needs of an economy that
has undergone massive changes over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for the bank said the changes transformed the
functions and role of the central bank from one of being an
administrator to that of supervising, facilitating and
monitoring, thereby allowing the RBZ to play a more
interventionist role in the market.
</P>
<P>
''This exercise should result in new management and service
delivery cost structures and a culture that are both relevant and
responsive to the changing needs of the country,'' the
spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
A committee had been created to spearhead the process and was
expected to complete its work before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Economic changes since 1991, when the country embarked on a
donor-backed reform program, have seen the opening of the economy
and the removal of most controls.
</P>
<P>
Among the changes was the relaxation of exchange controls and
the liberalization of the marketing of agricultural products.

ABU DHABI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Oman has not yet decided to
attend the fourth Middle East and North Africa Economic
Conference, which is scheduled to be held in the Qatari capital of
Doha in November, an Omani minister of state said today.
</P>
<P>
Oman is awaiting a joint stand by most of other Arab states
toward the conference and Oman will be in keeping with it, said
Oman's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yousef Ben-Alawi in
the Omani capital of Muscat.
</P>
<P>
"Oman will be in keeping with other Arab states who have not
made decisions to attend the conference with regard to the current
situation in the Middle East process," he told the Omani news
agency.
</P>
<P>
In protest against the deadlock in the Arab-Israeli peace
process, some Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, Syria and Lebanon have decided to boycott the November
conference which Israel is expected to be invited.
</P>
<P>
However, most of other Arab countries adopt a wait-and-see
stand and await an Arab League foreign ministers' meeting in
Cairo on September 20-21.
</P>
<P>
Qatar remains determined to host the conference. Qatari
officials said Qatar is going ahead with preparations for
the conference and invitations will be sent out at the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
The conference, launched in 1994 and held last year in Egypt,
is traditionally attended by Arab states, Israel and their major
trade partners in the industrialized world. Israel has attended
all the three previous ones.

BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Bell Laboratories and the
Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJU), a renowned institution of
higher learning in China, today declared the opening here of a
joint lab for communications and network development.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, the initial research of the lab
will focus on technology for computer processing of the Chinese
language.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the lab's opening, the first group of Chinese

Jersey, where the Bell headquarters is located.
</P>
<P>
Present at the opening ceremony of the joint lab were Dr. Tse
Lin (Jack) Wang, who leads Bell Labs' research and development
efforts in China, and Prof. Xie Shengwu, president of the Shanghai
Jiaotong University.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts considered that only by strengthening technical
transfer and exchanges with Chinese partners could foreign telecom
companies gain a better position in China's ever-intensifying
telecom competition.
</P>
<P>
Bell Labs has given birth to such innovations as the
transistor, laser, digital computer, communications satellite,
solar energy battery and cellular telephone that have had
significant impact on the 20th century's technological development.

<HEADLINE> CPC Career over the Past Five Years (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A Xinhua special report today
records the glorious achievements of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) from its 14th National Congress in October 1992 to the
coming 15th Congress, which is scheduled to open on September 12.
</P>
<P>
In the autumn five years ago, it says, the 14th CPC National
Congress adopted Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics as its guiding principle, and declared to
the whole world that the goal of China's economic reform is to
establish a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the third-generation of central
leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core have held Deng's theory
high, and guided the whole nation to seize opportunities and
accelerate development. Remarkable accomplishments have since been
made in a broad range of fields.
</P>
<P>
"Looking back to reform and opening-up and modernization over
the past five years," the report says, "we have concluded that the
Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is a
mature, strong, and promising leadership, which has won the
support and trust of the whole Party, the whole army and people of
all ethnic groups."
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, members of the third generation of
the collective Party leadership have made inspections and
investigations around the country to bring the ties between the
Party and the masses closer, and to make the Party's policies more
in line with the people's basic interests.
</P>
<P>
"They have derived wisdom and sustenance from the people, while
people have seen the future and hope because of them," the report
says.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture has been one issue that most deeply concerns
General Secretary Jiang Zemin and other central leaders.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Jiang was talking with farmers on matters
ranging from how to lessen their workloads and boost their income,
to how to fortify the status of agriculture, Premier Li Peng was
visiting people in flood-stricken areas and offering the support
and concern of the Party and the government. Meanwhile,
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji was working to formulate policies to
protect the production of grain and cotton.
</P>
<P>
During the five years, the CPC Central Committee has drafted
several important policies concerning agriculture, which laid the
foundation for the sustained, stable and healthy development of
the sector.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of reform and opening-up, state-owned
enterprises are facing a grave challenge. How to revitalize
state-owned enterprises, a pillar of the national economy, has
become an issue of greatest importance to the CPC Central
Committee, says the report.
</P>
<P>
During the five years, Jiang Zemin has visited state-owned
enterprises in a number of provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions, and made important speeches on reform of
state-owned enterprises to boost morale.
</P>
<P>
His speeches set the guidelines for further revitalization of
the state-owned enterprises.

<P>
Wherever they went, the leaders of CPC Central Committee
visited local families, chatting with them and asking for their
opinions. They did their utmost to solve the difficulties of the
people.
</P>
<P>
When President Jiang came to Baise in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region in 1990, he was greatly distressed by the
sight of shanty houses and the impoverished local residents. Six
years later, when he paid the second visit, the local people, who
now lived new houses, surrounded him to say thank you.
</P>
<P>
Facing tens of millions of people who are still in need,
Chinese leaders frequently visited backward regions to send their
warm regards. Premier Li Peng, for instance, went to Yan'an of
Shaanxi Province in northwest China, and Xingguo County of east
China's Jiangxi Province respectively during the spring festivals
of 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
"During my trips to southwest and northwest China, I found that
some families even have difficulty in obtaining salt and drinkable
water," Jiang said with feelings.
</P>
<P>
"No matter how hard the campaign to wipe out poverty is, we
will go all out to win it," Jiang declared on behalf of the CPC
Central Committee and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, in his surveys across the country,
repeatedly called on people's congresses at all levels to adhere
to the central task of economic development, while at the same
time emphasizing the construction of a socialist democracy and
legal system.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, agreed with
Qiao that building socialist democracy serves an indispensable
role in carrying out economic construction in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Jiang had made over 40 inspections trips
in various places in the country. Another six members of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee made more than 150 surveys in all. Pragmatic and
enthusiastic as their working styles are, they have won hearty
support and trust from people nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The year 1992, marked by late leader Deng Xiaoping's important
remarks in his trip to southern China and the convocation of the 14th
CPC National Congress, unveiled a new era for the advance of the
cause of socialism in China.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, the seven plena convened by the
Party Central Committee have basically mapped out the strategy
that will lead China into the next century. The strategy, in turn,
is testimony to the capability of the third generation leadship to
handle the country's reforms and opening up.
</P>
<P>
The Party Central Committee has deemed the coming 15 years to
be a crucial period when a comparatively sound socialist market
economy will be established.

Democratic Party led by its deputy leader Kunio Hatoyama.
</P>

current visit to China will help promote the Sino-Japanese
relations in a stable and sound manner.
</P>
<P>

its friendly relations with the Communist Party of China (CPC),
and is interested in further developing such relations.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Issue Benchmark Bond to Support Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
is to issue next week its benchmark bonds with a tenure of three
years to be used to support the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
(KLSE) which came under severe selling pressure recently.
</P>
<P>
The bonds, to be issued by Khazanah Nasional Bhd, the
government's investment arm, were launched here by Malaysian
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim tonight at a dinner hosted by
the Association of Banks in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The bonds with the first issue worth one billion ringgit (about
345 million U.S. dollars) on September 18, 1997, will be opened
for tender on State Bank's Fully Automated System for Tendering
(FAST) from September 11, 1997, Khazanah Nasional said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The bonds, as announced by Malaysia Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad last week, will be used as part of a 60 billion ringgit
(about 20.69 billion U.S. dollars) fund to support the KLSE.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the Khazanah benchmark bond would also, in
time, assist in the development of bond futures and options to add
breadth to the financial derivatives market, it said.
</P>
<P>
"And in line with the government's efforts to encourage greater
savings among the public, unit trust companies and banking
institutions would now be able to offer additional investment
instruments in the form of bond funds and bond-related savings
schemes," Khazanah Nasional said.
</P>
<P>
Khazanah Nasional, wholly-owned by the Ministry of Finance
(Incorporated) which manages the government's assets to optimize
returns, pledged that it would be well placed to ensure that the
proceeds of the benchmark issues are prudently reinvested so as to
uphold and improve the risk rating of Khazanah Nasional at all
times.
</P>
<P>
Among the main features of the Khazanah benchmark bond issuance
program, is that it would be a zero-coupon based on the concept of
murabahah, fully guaranteed by the government, and would be issued
on a quarterly basis with maturities of three, five, seven and 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the issue size would not be less than 500 million
ringgit (about 172 million U.S. dollars) per issue and that it
would not qualify for liquid assets status but they would be
included in determining the volume of trading for purposes of
netting off against eligible liability base.
</P>
<P>
There would be competitive bidding on the basis of price
through the Principal Dealers on State Bank's FAST and would be
traded on the Scripless Securities Trading System (SSTS).

<HEADLINE> China Puts on New Look in World: Friend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China has experienced
world-shaking changes in the past years and is now standing in
the world with a totally new look, Secretary-general of the
Angola-China Friendship Association Gentil Viana has said.
</P>
<P>
Viana, a witness of China's changes, made the remarks in a
special interview here recently with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Things have completely changed," said Viana. It is "beyond
belief" that since China adopted the policy of reforms and
opening to the outside world in the 1980s, China has registered
such rapid changes both in the rural and urban areas, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Viana went to China with his parents when he was a child,
lived and studied there. Two decades later he returned as a
grown-up and visited China twice a year since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the changes China has undergone, he could not
help pouring out words in broken Chinese, saying that in
present-day China, modern buildings have mushroomed; wide roads
are seen here and there; and goods abound in the markets.
</P>
<P>
"Gone are the days when coupons on food and a lot of daily
necessities were issued in China," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Viana spoke highly of Deng Xiaoping, the late Chinese leader
and general architect of China's reforms. He attributed China's
achievements to Deng's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics as well as to a series of correct policies
formulated by the veteran statesman.
</P>
<P>
He concluded the interview with full conviction that the
policies to be worked out at the upcoming congress of the Chinese
Communist Party scheduled for September 12 will further push
forward China's reforms and promote its economy.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that China will become a strong socialist country in
the near future and contribute more to the stability and
development of the world.

<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Stephen Mak, Assistant Chief
Director of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, said recently
that he thought the forthcoming 15th CPC National Congress would
draw up a development plan for the next century.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Mak, who has worked in Beijing for many years and is
quite familiar with the interior, said the majority of people
in Hong Kong knew that interior China and Hong Kong had achieved
rapid development in the past 18 years, mainly due to the reform
and opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
The people have benefited from the policy formulated at the
Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1978, and are interested in the
15th CPC National Congress after Hong Kong has returned to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese people had accepted the idea of the
socialist market economy and achieved great successes in economic
development in the past five years, thus laying a solid
foundation for drafting development plans for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"I think that whatever the strategy is, the state
policy of reform and opening-up of China will not be changed," he
said. "This is the common wish of the whole Chinese people
including those in Hong Kong."

He expressed his hope that the Party leaders chosen at the 15th
CPC National Congress would continue to pursue the reform and
opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
He said China would accelerate the pace of reform and opening
up to the outside world, thus providing new opportunities for Hong
Kong investors to invest in the interior.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Trade Development Council would contribute to the
development of Hong Kong and the interior, he added.
</P>
<P>
William W. Y. Huang, Chairman of the Hong Kong Chamber of
Commerce in China, said he believed that the new generation of CPC
leaders with Jiang Zemin at the core would reiterate the reform
and opening-up policy at the 15th CPC National Congress.
</P>
<P>
"This will increase our confidence in business in the Chinese
interior," said William W.Y. Huang. The Hong Kong Chamber of
Commerce in China was founded in Beijing in 1993, and now has
hundreds of Hong Kong companies and individuals as its members.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that after the congress, the state will further explain
the direction and sphere for foreign investment and announce
policies on time," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that being a special administrative region of China,
Hong Kong should use its own advantages to make a bigger
contribution to the motherland, which will in turn benefit Hong
Kong.

<HEADLINE> General Course of Sino-Japanese Relations Sound: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that the general course of Sino-Japanese relations
has always been sound because of the joints efforts from both
sides.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, met this afternoon with the ninth
Japanese delegation of the "Great Wall" program to come to China.
The program was founded nine years ago with an objective of
promoting Sino-Japanese, non-governmental friendly exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which arrived here earlier today, was led by
former Japanese Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki and included dozens
of parliament members from the New Frontier Party.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the present good relationship, which was hard-won,
reflects the painstaking efforts from statesmen of the former
generations and the insightful personnel of both countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the present visit in of great significance in
that the delegation comes at a time when both countries are
celebrating the 25th anniversary of the normalization of their
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
The president also spoke highly of Toshiki's efforts in
promoting bilateral relations, calling him an "old friend" of
China. The Chinese people will never forget those old friends who
have made positive efforts for the advancement of Sino-Japanese
ties, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The successful implementation of the "Great Wall" program
reflects the solid basis of bilateral relations, and demonstrates
the good wishes of both sides to expand their friendly
cooperation, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
During the past nine years, since the start of the "Great Wall"
program, which is non-governmental, Japan has sent more than 100
parliament members to China.
</P>
<P>
Toshiki said that the improvement of Japan-China relations is
of importance not only to Japan but also to the maintenance of
peace and stability in Asia and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said he will spare no efforts to increase dialogue and
expand common understanding between the two countries through
different means and to actively promote the contacts between the
younger statesmen in a bid to pass on the friendship from
generation to generation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Ding Hongbo has worked as a
salesman and a legal affairs consultant at three different firms
since graduating from Beijing University with a bachelor's degree
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Now, the 27-year-old Beijing resident wants to get a master's
degree in order to apply for his fourth job: a university law
teacher.
</P>
<P>
"I've come to find that I'm fit for this profession much more
than the former ones, though I did work well at those firms," said
Ding, who is planning to enroll in the graduate school at the
Chinese University of Political Science and Law next summer.
</P>
<P>
Ding's experience in hunting and switching jobs reflects a
rising trend among young people in China, who have more latitude
in choosing their own careers than ever before.
</P>
<P>
"Market economy creates opportunities, so people can make more
choices to realize individual values by seeking jobs that are
fit for them," said economist Fan Gang.
</P>
<P>
Only ten years ago, zigzagging down the career path was
unimaginable in China.
</P>
<P>
Under the traditional planned economy structure, most Chinese
people's professions were assigned by the country, and most people
spent their whole life at one job, Fan said.
</P>
<P>
"People were so deeply restricted by the outdated way of
thinking that in the mid-1980s, few people dared to find a new job
at our center," said Zhang Yuquan, head of the Beijing Personnel
Service Center.
</P>
<P>
But his business grew several times over, especially after the
Communist Party of China outlined the establishment of a socialist
market economic structure at its 14th National Congress in
1992. The center has become the largest personnel market in
Beijing.

Fan attributed the great change to the socialist market economy
that is being established in China following the country's
decade-long reform and opening-up efforts.
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old economist himself gave up a job at the official
Economic Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Social
Science two years ago to work at the non-governmental China Reform
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
"More and more people and businesses, even government organs,
are realizing how important a flow of trained personnel is to the
development of not only individuals, but also the country," Zhang
Yuquan stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The country's personnel affairs departments have published a
series of policies to encourage personnel flow since 1992, and the
general public is also becoming more aware of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Personnel show that about 5.71
million people applied for jobs at personnel markets nationwide in
1995, and the figure jumped to 10.4 million last year.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by Horizon Market Survey and
Analysis Company in five major Chinese cities in 1996, people
under the age of 35 have switched jobs for an average of 1.11
times in the past five years, while those over 35 changed an
average 1.07 times.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 percent of those who took different jobs said they
were satisfied with their new occupations.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Scale Down Economic Growth Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
revise downward its growth targets for 1997 due to high interest
rates and a weak currency, President Fidel Ramos confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
At his weekly press conference, Ramos said there will be a
"moderate" revise on this year's economic growth targets, and the
country's economic managers are now computing the new targets.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos, who has been confident that the economy will meet
its ambitious growth target of 7 to 8 percent, insisted there will
be no "slump" in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, both Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo and
Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito said it would be
difficult to achieve the original growth targets this year.
</P>
<P>
This year, the gross national product (GNP) growth target is
set between 7 and 8 percent while the gross domestic product (GDP)
growth is targeted at 6.3 to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the GNP posted a
lower-than-expected growth of 5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the GNP target could be met unless it records an
impossible 8.3 percent growth during the second half this year.
They predicted a further slowdown in the economy in the second
half.

<HEADLINE> Santer Confident of Euro Timetable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Jacques Santer today stressed that there is no return from the
movement toward the European single currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
"I will not make apologies for saying it again," said Santer,
"that the single currency will be a reality on January 1, 1999,
and there will a substantial number of member states taking part
right from the beginning."
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that the end is in sight and it is
not the time to frighten off the public about the solidity of the
new currency.
</P>
<P>
Santer said that the EU confidence and conviction will not be
put off by speculation, pessimism or even hostility.
</P>
<P>
"We have to concentrate our efforts on just one thing and that
is to deliver," said the commission president who cited as proof
that all the conditions have been fulfilled and all the necessary
elements are in place to be successful in meeting the challenge.
</P>
<P>
All the major decisions have been made except for the decision
on who will be in the first wave of joining the single currency,
said the commission president.
</P>
<P>
"In the spring of 1998, in April or May, this decision will be
taken as well," Santer added.
</P>
<P>
He explained that spring was chosen as only by then will the
real financial and economic data of EU countries become available.
</P>
<P>
There is in the European Council a political will, added
Santer, to respect the deadline and criteria set for the
inauguration of the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Two of the five criteria set in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty are
that the budget deficit of an applicant country cannot exceed 3
percent of its annual gross domestic product while its debt cannot
exceed 60 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Right now, only Luxembourg has met both criteria while Ireland,
the Netherlands and Denmark are closing gap to meeting the
criteria.
</P>
<P>
Santer, however, promised that the negotiation for joining the
single currency will include and not exclude countries though
negotiation is expected to begin with a limited number of
countries.
</P>
<P>
When asked if a return from the materialization of euro is now
legally and technically impossible, Santer said that the EU has
reached an irreversible point on the route toward the euro and all
the indicators are moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that on the first of January 1999 we shall have the
euro on the basis of the convergence of the criteria as defined by
the Maastricht Treaty with a substantive number of member states
being involved," Santer concluded.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Deficit-GDP Ratio to Decline Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Italy's prospects for bringing
its deficit-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio under control are
much better than those of Germany and France, a report by the
International Monetary Fund (IFM) said today.
</P>
<P>
The deficit-GDP ratios of Italy, Germany and France are all
slightly above the 3 percent parameter mandated by the Masstricht
Treaty for entry into the European single currency system in 1999,
but Italy will achieve the most in lowering the ratio, the IMF's
World Economic Outlook said.
</P>
<P>
Italy's deficit-GDP ratio is estimated to stand at 3.2 percent
by the end of 1997, compared with 3.1 percent in Germany, said the
report, which will be released next week at the IMF's annual
meeting in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It says that Italy's deficit-GDP ratio is expected to drop to 3
percent in 1998, compared with Germany's 2.9 percent and France's
3.2 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The report said Italy will enjoy a much stronger growth -- 1.2
percent of the GDP -- than expected by the end of this year, with
the inflation rate of 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said the Italian economy will recover since the
government has made serious efforts to reform the fiscal system
and curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
However, unemployment in Italy, Germany and France, predicted
to be 12.2 percent, 12.6 percent and 11.3 percent respectively in
1997, remains a serious problem. The three countries have the
highest jobless rates among the G-7, ahead of Japan's 3.5 percent,
the United States' 5.1 percent, Britain's 5.8 percent and Canada's
9.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> HK Telecom To Introduce Asia's 1st Name Display Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Over 170,000 Hongkong
Telecom Caller Display service subscribers will be able to see the
name of the caller before answering a call starting mid-October
when the company launches Asia's first Name Display service.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong Telecom, a leading telecom services provider, was
recently given the go ahead to launch the new feature of the
Caller Display service. The Name Display feature will allow both
the caller and the called party to more efficiently manage their
communication.
</P>
<P>
An independent market research conducted in June on the Caller
Display service showed that the majority of the over 1,000
business and residential users interviewed found the service
useful and convenient to use. Over 95 percent of the interviewees
said they knew about the line blocking function, yet over 70
percent never thought of using it.
</P>
<P>
This finding matched customer response gauged in mid-1995
before the service was launched. Seventy percent of the
respondents indicated then that they did not mind releasing their
numbers to the called parties.
</P>
<P>
Interviewees also said the service is an effective device for
screening calls and logging unattended calls.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Name Display would be a useful enhancement
to the service, 80 percent of the interviewees said "yes". This
positive customer response is what prompted the company to
introduce the new feature.
</P>
<P>
Prudence Chan, director of Hongkong Telecom, said: "The new
Name Display feature is just like an electronic business card. It
enables the caller to introduce or identify himself or his company
to the called party even before the call is answered. For the
called party, the function helps him know who exactly is calling
and therefore enables him to prepare to answer the call."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Hosts Biggest Watch, Clock Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A watch and clock fair, the
world's largest in terms of number of exhibitors, opened today in
Hong Kong, known as the center for mass production of medium and
lower-end watches.
</P>
<P>
About 770 timepiece manufacturers from 17 countries and regions
displayed their latest designs in an exhibition area of more than
25,000 square meters at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center.
</P>
<P>
Despite pressing market challenges, Hong Kong's watch and clock
industry remains in excellent shape, said Donald Tsang, Financial
Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) at
the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the world's second largest exporter of watches,
both in value and in quantity; It is the world's top exporter of
clocks in value and comes to the second in quantity. Besides, the
watch and clock industry is the third manufacturing sector in the
city.
</P>
<P>
To ensure competitive pricing by lowering production costs,
Hong Kong watch manufacturers have shifted their workshops to
areas where labor and land costs are lower, notably inland areas
of China and Southeast Asia, according to the official. Hong Kong
has turned out to be a strategic center, focusing on product
design, quality control, marketing and trade.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is a leading trader of watches, clocks and timepiece
components. It exported nearly 48 billion HK dollars (6.1 billion
US dollars) worth of such products in 1996, mainly to the United
States, the Chinese inland areas, Japan, Germany, the United
Kingdom and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Hong Kong imported almost 40 billion HK dollars (5.1
billion US dollars) worth of timepieces, with the Chinese inland
areas, Japan, Switzerland, Thailand, Singapore and Taiwan as the
leading supplier.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Wong, co-chairman of the fair said today Hong Kong, as
an important market and trading hub of timepieces in Asia, has
become an ideal location for the fair.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: China Bids Farewell to Insufficient Supply of Goods (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, September 10 (Xinhua) -- "Fortnightly Chat", China's
largest circulated publication, recently carried a commentary on
China's economic success putting an end to the nation's
decades-long short supply of goods.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, a famous Hungarian Economist rocked the world with a
prediction that insufficient supplies of goods were an ineluctable
derivative of socialism. His prediction has failed to apply to
today's China, a country in which shops are filled with wide
variety of goods, and where short supplies remain only in the
memory of the people.
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that a rapidly developing economy has
enabled Chinese to bid farewell to destitution resulting from a
short supply of goods, a headache which haunted the country for
almost three decades.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the 1980s, people used coupons to purchase a kilogram
of flour or a piece of cloth. Visiting foreigners humorously
labeled China as a sea of blue and grey, a reference to the
clothing worn by people nationwide.
</P>
<P>
It was true that China was far from extricating itself from
supply shortages under the former planned economic systems.
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese now wear colorful stylish clothing. Estimates
indicate that China's 1996 aggregate sales for clothing topped 320
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that less than two decades of reform and
opening have enabled the Chinese people to enjoy the blessings of
a bumper supply of merchandise.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Leader Meets Australian Defense Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- General Chi Haotian,
vice-chairman of the Chinese Central Military Commission and
defense minister, meeting today with Tony Ayers, visiting
secretary of Australia's Department of Defense, said China
attaches importance to its friendly relations with Australia and
hopes that the development trend between the two countries and
their armed forces will be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Ayers said the Australian government will continue to pursue
its "one China" policy and will not have any official relations
with Taiwan, and said he hopes that China's peaceful reunification
will go smoothly because it will benefit China, the region, and
the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also state councillor, said the Taiwan issue is an
internal affair that can be settled if foreign countries do not
interfere and he expressed his appreciation for the Australian
government's "one China" stand.
</P>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" and "peaceful reunification"
policies initiated by Deng Xiaoping remain China's policy for
Taiwan, he noted. The smooth return of Hong Kong proved that the
"one country, two systems" policy is correct, and China is fully
confident in national reunification.
</P>
<P>
Chi briefed his guest on China's foreign policy of peace and
its national defense and noted that building up China's defense
forces will serve its central task of economic construction.
</P>
<P>
The reforms and opening to the outside world are the only way
out for China, he said, noting that the 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China will take the country's reforms and
opening-up drive further.

<HEADLINE> Program to Help Blind Tibetans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 5,000 blind people in
the Tibet Autonomous Region are expected to regain their eyesight
thanks to a special medical program which will be launched soon.
</P>
<P>
The program, launched jointly by the China Red Cross
Foundation, the China Central Television Station and the Guangming
Enterprise Group, a major Chinese furniture manufacturer, will
organize groups of volunteer opthalmologists to perform free
cataract surgery on about 5,000 blind Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held by the organizers today to see off the
first group of volunteers, who are leaving for Tibet on
Friday. The volunteers will perform 600 surgical procedures
within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
At least 5,000 Tibetans have lost their eyesight due to
cataract caused by excessive exposure to the strong ultraviolet
rays characteristic in the high altitude region. Limited local
medical conditions and financial resources prevented cataract
sufferers from receiving timely treatment.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: China Bids Farewell to Insufficient Supply of Goods (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1996, China reaped a record 490 million ton grain harvest.
</P>
<P>
The most significant improvement centers on the dramatic change
in the living standards of the Chinese people. China invested 1.15
trillion yuan in housing construction in cities between 1991-1996,
with the average per capita living space rising to 8.47 sq.m. in
1996, a substantial rise of 4.6 sq.m. when compared to
1980. Nearly half of all farmers moved into new houses.
</P>
<P>
Modern appliances, such as stereos, video-cameras, telephones,
air-conditioners and mobile phones are entering ordinary family
homes at at a startling rate. Today, every 100 households in urban
China owns 70 refrigerators, 90 washing machines and 93.5 color
TVs.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said the country has also recorded rapid
progress in infrastructure development, an area once bottlenecked
economic development. China currently ranks second in the world in
power generation, with the nation's annual steel production
exceeding 100 million tons, and coal production of well over 300
million tons setting a new world record. Highways cover the
country, and civil aviation has witnessed speedy development.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that achievements should be attributed to
the Communist Party of China which has acted in accordance with
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and has perfected the route of reform and
opening. The approach well fits China's unique situation.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of the CPC, according to the commentary,
china has extricated itself from the shackles of the planned
economy and shifted to market economy in attempt to pursue the
full development of productive forces.

<HEADLINE> France Warns Bosnians Against Boycotting Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- France today warned Bosnian
Croats and Serbs against boycotting the municipal elections due to
be held in Bosnia on September 13-14.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said today
that France will withdraw its aid for the Bosnian cities which
boycott the election.
</P>
<P>
"We will be in favor of a freeze of all new aid projects or
assistance destinated for the cities which refuse to play the game
of democracy and thus are responsible for the blocking of the
functioning of the institutions (of the country)," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France "categorically" rejects the proposal
to delay the holding of the municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the Serbian Democratic
Party (SDS) have asked for a delay of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Originally scheduled for September 1996, the elections have
already been delayed four times.
</P>
<P>
"This proximity polling makes up an essential step of the peace
process and offers a new chance to the process of democratization
in Bosnia-Herzegovina," said Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is in the interests of Bosnians themselves to
cooperate in good faith in applying the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
is in charge of supervising the elections, which will cost 14
million U.S. dollars in preparation work and will draw 2,500
international observers, including 207 French observers, said the
spokesman.

<TEXT>
<P>
We have adhered to economic development based on multiple forms
of ownership which centers primarily on public ownership. Efforts
to revitalize the national economy have been accompanied by the
rapid growth of the nonstate sector. For example, despite holding
only 20 percent of total assets, township enterprises have
produced nearly half of the nation's total industrial value-added,
profits and output value.
</P>
<P>
We have strived to deepen the country's opening over the past
decade, with total imports and exports hitting 290 billion US
dollars in 1996 alone.
</P>
<P>
According to the commentary, these facts alone eloquently speak
for the remarkable steps we have taken over the past two decades,
especially since 1992.
</P>
<P>
China serves as an inspiring example for developing countries
around the world, according to Secretary General of the United
Nations, Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The farewell to inadequate supply marks the beginning of a new
era which will emphasize economic restructuring and high quality
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The days when factories exhibited little interest in whether or
not their products were sold are long gone. Today, they are faced
with heated struggles to lure consumers. "Everything we do should
center on the market," according to the manager of a major Chinese
washing-machine manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
It is essential to make breakthroughs in the reform of
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"We should make every effort to explore effective patterns of
public ownership, and modes of management and forms of
organizations which reflect the law of socialized production",
according to Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Jiang made the
comments in an important speech delivered on May 29 at the Party
School of the CPC Central Committee.

<P>
At the reception, the two spokesmen for the congress -- Xu
Guangchun, deputy head of the Propaganda Department of the CPC
Central Committee, and Li Bing, deputy director of the Information
Office of the State Council, and other leading members of the

that the convening of the 15th National Congress of the CPC has
attracted both Chinese and overseas wide attention.
</P>
<P>
By noon today, a total of 1,043 journalists had registered to
cover the congress, a notable increase over the number of those
who covered the 14th CPC National Congress in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Among the journalists, 156 came from the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, 72 from Taiwan and Macao regions, and 410
from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The Press Center, based in the Media Hotel, will help arrange
reporters to cover the opening session of the congress, and help
arrange press briefings, press conferences and collective
interviews. Panel discussions of some delegations will also be
open to the press during the congress. The center will also help
contact some delegates for press interviews, and it will also
provide the reporters with background information and telecom
service.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that so many Chinese and overseas journalists have
come to cover the forthcoming 15th CPC National Congress shows
that the congress not only is of great historical significance to
the development of our country and the Chinese nation, but also
has a vital bearing on world peace and development," a leading
official of the Press Center said, adding that the event has drawn
the close attention of the world media.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials of the Press Center also answered some
questions raised by the journalists present.

<HEADLINE> UEFA to Take no Act over Anderlecht Bribes Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- UEFA will take no action over
an bribe scandal involving Anderlecht whose former chairman
admitted they paid a 30,000 U.S. dollars bribe to the referee of a
1984 UEFA Cup match against Nottingham Forest.
</P>
<P>
UEFA spokesman Frits Ahlstrom said UEFA had decided not to seek
sanctions against the club on the basis of a ten-year statute of
limitations.
</P>
<P>
Anderlecht chairman Roger Vaden Stock admitted last week his
father Constant, the club's chairman, had paid the Spanish
refereee, Guruceta Muro, "a loan" of one million francs (30,000
U.S. dollars) the day after the second leg of the tie.
</P>
<P>
Anderlecht won the match 3-0 for a 3-2 aggregate victory but
only after a Forest goal, which television replays showed to have
been legitimate, was disallowed.

<HEADLINE> Indian Finance Minister Pushes For New Economic Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram said today that India's outdated laws had inhibited
the country's economic growth and needed drastic overhaul.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a three-day economic editors' conference here
organized by the Press Information Bureau, the finance minister
said, "We cannot have a 21st century economic superstructure in
the country with outdated laws."
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the legislation, such as those relating to
the companies or income tax, were drafted in the 1940s or 1950s.
There was an urgent need to overhaul them now, especially in the
wake of economic liberalization. At least five new legislation
needed to be passed urgently by the parliament to keep
liberalization on track and help sustain GDP growth rate of 7
percent or more.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said the government would introduce the
amended Income Tax Bill in the winter session of the parliament
and the Sick Industries Companies' Act had been referred to a
standing committee.
</P>
<P>
The Money Laundering Bill would be ready in a few days and it
would be brought before the parliament along with the Foreign
Exchange Management Act. The Companies Bill was also being
referred to a standing committee, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would try to get these legislation adopted
before the end of next March.

CANBERRA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
finished lower today as market participants focused their
attention on the employment figures to be released tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The markets are watching for the August labor force data to be
released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which will give
them a clearer picture on where official interest rates are
headed.
</P>
<P>
Forecasts for the unempolyment rate center on 8.6 percent with
expectations ranging from 8.5 to 8.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 72.70 U.S. cents down from
72.90 late yesterday.

The jobs figures are expected to show a return to employment
growth, economists said, adding that a strong outcome would cement

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Takes Measures to Avoid Monetary Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has taken measures to
prevent its economy from being affected by the monetary crisis
that has been damaging the economies of some countries in
Southeast Asia for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
A four-point plan has been recommended by State Bank
Director-General Cao Si Kiem, according to today's "Vietnam News."
</P>
<P>
The measures would help stem imports of unnecessary foreign
goods and promote exports with prompt and flexible banking and
incentive policies.
</P>
<P>
They include encouraging exporters and producers to cooperate
more closely, putting tighter controls on imports and smuggling,
tightening budgetary provisions and putting the commercial banking
system on a sounder financial footing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Vietnamese government has managed to increase
foreign reserves and to boost domestic production.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese officials said the prime reason for Vietnam not
being affected directly by the current regional financial crisis
was that the country had not really opened up its financial market
to a regional setting and that national controls over foreign
currency exchange remained very strict.
</P>
<P>
However, the officials said that some indirect impact could
occur.
</P>
<P>
The main worry was about the higher competitive edge of imports
from Thailand and other neighboring nations against domestic
products in Vietnam's market.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's exports to these countries would be challenged by
low-priced goods with devalued Thai baht and other foreign
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The loss of competitive edge would prompt more demand for hard
currency in Vietnam.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The western French port city of Rochelle Tuesday banned for
one day the movement of automobiles and motorcycles to the warm
welcoming of its residents. But this symbolic initiative to fight
pollution, the first of its kind in France, should be followed by
bigger and lasting measures aimed at fighting air pollution in the
country.
</P>
<P>
-- The exiled leadership of the Islamic Salvation Front of
Algeria Tuesday denounced the Algerian authorities for refusing to

civilians.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Abacha Won't Succeed Himself, Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The military administrator of
Ogun State in west Nigeria has turned down the country-wide
speculation that Head of State General Abacha is planning to
succeed himself as civilian president.
</P>
<P>
Wing Commander Sam Ewang disclosed on Tuesday that General
Abacha had personnaly assured him he had no such ambition to
become a president at the end of the current transition program
next year.
</P>
<P>
"The head of state has never said he is going to succeed
himself," the commander said, quoted by the Nigerian Tribune
today.
</P>
<P>
"I have met the head of state personally...and moreover he has
told me that he will hand over the reins of power to a
democratically elected government come October 1998, and not to
succeed himself" he said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to Nigerians to stop spreading the rumor or
speculation as it is counter-productive.
</P>
<P>
Ewang's words came after two of his colleagues had said they
would support the presidency of Abacha, who is reported to be
seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the military administrator of Kano State in north
Nigeria, Colonel Dominic Oneya, asserted Abacha was free to
aspire to the presidency of the nation.
</P>
<P>
"If he desires to contest any elective office, I will give him
my support being a citizen of Kano," Oneya said.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Mohammed Marwa, military administrator of Lagos State,
expressed the same view a month ago.
</P>
<P>
They are currently the only two out of the 36 administrators
that have declared support to Abacha's candidancy if he chooses
to contest in next year's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
A recent research done by scholars from a group of Nigerian
universities in the north, where almost all high-ranking military
officers come from, claimed that 72 percent of Nigerians support
Abacha's presidency.

<HEADLINE> Indian Senior Officials on Rupee-U.S. dollar Band </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 10 (Xinhua)-- Indian Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram said today that no decision had been taken on fixing a
band in which the rupee could move freely against U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the three-day economic editors' conference here, the
finance minister said that the rupee-dollar band was one of the
ideas thrown up by the Tarapre Committee on capital account
convertibility, which was still being studied and no decision on
it had been made by the government.
</P>
<P>
India's currency rupee has for the last one month been
fluctuating wildly against the U.S. dollar in volatile trading in
the foreign exchange markets in Mumbai (Bombay), forcing the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to pump in more than 600 million U.S.
dollars during the period to arrest the slump of rupee. RBI
governor today declared the bank's intention to continue
intervention in the foreign exchange markets in the country.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Dr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia said here today
that the exchange rate would be determined by the market and RBI
would intervene only to correct aberrations.
</P>
<P>
"We are neither operating on a fixed exchange rate system nor
do we have a real effective exchange rate target. But RBI will
intervene when rupee fluctuates beyond the underlying
fundamentals," he told the economic editors' conference.

BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua)-- A total of 1,043 Chinese and

<HEADLINE> World's Sixth Largest City Group in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has become a major
part of a city group on the Yangtze River Delta that is similar to
London, Paris, Chicago, New York, and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The delta is one of China's most developed areas, covering a
50,000-sq.km. area with over 80 million people. These are only one
percent and six percent of China's total, respectively, but the
area's GDP accounts for a fifth of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Shanghai, Wuxi, Yangzhou, Changzhou, Zhenjiang,
and Ningbo are industrial bases with large chemical, electronics,
textile, machinery, and metallurgical industries. Shanghai is
China's largest port and Ningbo is the deepest.
</P>
<P>
The area is also a major grain producer and a leader in
township and village-based industries that have made workers out
of millions of farmers. In recent years, it has also become a
pilot area for the country's economic reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
It has 55,000 overseas-funded firms and half of the world's top
100 companies have branches here. There are also 17 state-approved
economic and technological development zones and two bonded zones.
</P>
<P>
All major cities in the area have ports that are open to
foreign vessels. There are navigations by water and air to link
the area with more than 100 countries and regions. In the 21st
century, the world will focus on Asia, while Asia focuses on China
and China on the Yangtze River Delta.

<HEADLINE> Dinosaur Eggs Discovered in South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Local people and
archaeologists have discovered 363 fossilized dinosaur eggs in
Heyuan City in south China's Guangdong province in about past two
years.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Zikui, an expert on dinosaur egg research at the Institute
of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese
Academy of Science, says he believes they date back more than 65
million years and predicts that skeletal fossils may be unearthed
in the area.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say that Heyuan ranks second in China in number
of discovered fossilized dinosaur eggs, after Xishan Prefecture in
Henan province.
</P>
<P>
On March 4, 1996, two round "stone eggs" were confirmed by
archaeologists in the area as being dinosaur egg fossils.
</P>
<P>
Huang Dong, head of the Heyuan Museum, says the local
government is interested in the discovery and has listed the area
as a protected one, with all projects to be built in the area
requiring the approval from local cultural relics protection
department.
</P>
<P>
Many local people have given dinosaur eggs they have discovered
to the museum.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto will hold talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
November 1-2 in Krasnoyarsk, eastern Siberia, the top government
spokesman announced today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was arranged in accordance with an agreement between
Hashimoto and Yeltsin when they met in Denver in June, Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto and Yeltsin have agreed on regular reciprocal visits
to improve bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hashimoto is expected to seek Yeltsin's
understanding on Japan's diplomatic policy toward Russia so as to
pave the way for resolving a long-standing bilateral territorial
dispute over four Russian-held islands off Japan's northernmost
main island of Hokkaidao, government sources said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto has already set forth three policy principles toward
Russia -- trust, mutual benefit and a long-term perspective -- to
improve bilateral relations which have been marred by the
territorial row.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will also exchange views on bilateral economic
cooperation in such fields as energy development in Siberia and
the Russian Far East, according to the sources.

<HEADLINE> Crime Rate in South Africa Stabilized: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Crime levels have
stabilised in South Africa and in some categories are decreasing,
Sydney Mufamadi, Minister of Safety and Security said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But the country is still facing high levels of violent crime,
the minister was quoted by today's local media as saying.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the third quarterly crime report for 1977, Mufamadi
said none of the 20 most serious crime tendencies had shown an
increase.
</P>
<P>
"It appears that we have halted the deterioration, crime
levels are stabilizing and decreasing," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the police forces would open a new detective
academy in Pretoria next month which would inject fresh blood
into the detective service and enhance police's capacity to clear
cases.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern about large increases in the number of
escapees from detention or lawful custody, and the murder of
police officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the security chief, a total of 3,386 detainees
escaped from police custody between January 1996 and March 1997,
and more than 70 percent of them were detained in connection with
charges of murder, rape and armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
The murder of police officials alos increased by almost 30
percent during the past 12 months, Mufamadi said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ethnic Minority Groups Secure Education Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Wang Wanhui, a member of the
Primi ethnic group who spent her childhood in a mountainous area
of southwest China's Yunnan province, is now an animal husbandry
engineer, a much-admired profession in this part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Wang's backward life changed when she entered Yunnan
Agricultural University as one of the small number of young people
in her village to study at college.
</P>
<P>
40 years ago, most of the ethnic minority people had no access
to education.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, getting an education is no longer so strange to the
people of her village. There are 2.2 million minority students in
the province studying at universities or schools, accounting for
35 percent of all the province's students. The province has 10
million people from 25 ethnic minority groups, about one third of
the province's total population.
</P>
<P>
There were only five middle schools, 45 primary schools, and 75
missionary schools in Yunnan 40 years ago, with a total number of
ethnic minority students of just about 20,000. At that time few of
the ethnic minorities could go to primary schools. 10 ethnic
minority groups, including Derung, Va, and Lisu, were still using
beans as calculators and had no written language.
</P>
<P>
Things changed after the founding of the People's Republic of
China in 1949. Because of the central government policies, the
number of people with an education among ethnic minority groups
increased rapidly.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some 600 million yuan (about 72 million US
dollars) has been spent by the provincial government on building
3,000 primary schools and special middle schools for ethnic
minority students.
</P>
<P>
People of the nation's ethnic minorities have been encouraged
to send their children to school, and 97 percent of the children
of ethnic minorities now attend school.
</P>
<P>
In the fierce college admission competition, ethnic minority
students benefit from the government's preferential policies,
especially those from under-developed areas.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 million yuan will be added to education funds for
minority areas in Yunnan to help people there complete their
nine-year compulsory education.

<HEADLINE> Albright Confers With Israeli President Weizman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, on her first Middle East visit since
taking office, stressed the U.S. commitment to Israel in achieving
peace with security.
</P>
<P>
Albright conferred this morning with Israeli President Ezer
Weizman at the presidential residence in Jerusalem after arriving
from Ben-Gurion Airport, where she was welcomed by Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
She told a press conference after the meeting that the U.S. is
with Israel in its battle against terrorism and in the struggle to
apprehend those who orchesrated terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the U.S. supports Israel's insistence on the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to "fulfill its
responsibilities and obligations it has undertaken."
</P>
<P>
"We are with you in the determination that those committed
terror will not succeed, now or ever, in preventing the
possibilities of peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and
throughout the Middle East region from becoming a reality," she
added.
</P>
<P>
Albright stressed that during her three-day visit here she
will focus on the security issue in discussions with Israeli and
PNA leaders, adding that both sides should take on "mutual
responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
However, she admitted that real security was inseparable from
the path of real peace.
</P>
<P>
In a large part of her speech, Albright stressed the special
and important relations between the U.S. and Israel, which she
described as "deeply-rooted in history and shared values" in
various areas.
</P>
<P>
She reaffirmed that the U.S. "is absolutely committed to
maintaining Israel's military qualitative edge" in the region.
</P>
<P>
She said that the U.S., joined by Israel and its Arab
partners, would strive to achieve not only peace between Israel
and the Palestinians, but also a comprehensive peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Albright added that U.S. President has extended an invitation
to President Weizman, the nominal head of state in Israel, to
visit Washington in early October.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting and the breakfast with Weizman, Albright
is to be accompanied by the president to visit the people wounded
in last Thursday's triple suicide bombing in Jerusalem's Ben
Yehuda pedestrian mall.
</P>
<P>
The terror attack, the second in five weeks, killed eight
people including three suicide bombers and wounded over 190
others.
</P>
<P>
This, together with the previous one on July 30 in which 17
people including two suicide bombers were killed and 170 others
wounded, was claimed by the militant Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas).
</P>
<P>
Following the wave of attacks, Israel has imposed tough
sanctions against the Palestinians, and conditioned a resumption
of peace talks on the PNA's actions to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The terror attacks have cast dark shadows over Albright's
first trip to the region, which is designed to revive the
deeply-troubled Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the two sides have been frozen since last
March when Israel began building the Har Homa settlement in the
disputed East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Late today, Albright will hold formal talks with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition Labor party leader Ehud
Barak. On Thursday, she is expected to meet with PNA President
Yasser Arafat and with Netanyahu for the second time in a bid to
narrow the gap between the two sides so to get the peace process
back on track.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, she will hold another meeting with Arafat before
leaving for Syria at the second leg of her Middle East trip, which
will also take her to Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Lithuania Praises Close Relations With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VILNIUS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Lithuania is proud of and
sincerely values the close economic relations with China,
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Algirdas Suadargas said today in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua news agency.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania congratulates China on the successful economic
reform, which has guaranteed the country a position among the
major economic powers in the world, Suadargas said.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1978, starting with the 'opening up policy' initiated by
Deng Xiaoping," the minister said, "China's economic system has
changed dramatically and this can be expressed by the significant
achievements in all fields of national economy."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese reform strategy "to embark on
far-reaching economic liberalization and to integrate China into
the world economy is bearing fruits and could serve as a good
example for many developing countries."
</P>
<P>
On the bilateral relations, Suadargas pointed out Lithuania
recognized the government of the People's Republic of China as the
sole legitimate government of China. This principle constitutes
the basis for good relations between the two countries at present
and for the years to come.
</P>
<P>
Suadargas said that in recent years numerous high level visits
between the two countries resulted in eight state agreements,
which had founded firm legal basis for the economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Acts to Strengthen Energy Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has announced the
separation of the power generation function in the energy sector
from that of distribution and transmission to enhance the
efficiency of the sector, Kenya Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Energy Minister Kirugi 'Mukindia said the state-owned
Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) was divided into two
companies responsible for power distribution and transmission,
and power generation respectively in a bid to enhance the sector.
</P>
<P>
The separation of the two functions in the power sector was
aimed at paving way for entry of private sector players into the
sector, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The separation of functions is in accordance with the reform
timetable of the energy sector agreed upon by the Kenyan
government and the World Bank, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan minister said legislation to facilitate independent
private sector players in the power generation industry was
underway and the Electric Power bill published recently would be
discussed in Kenyan parliament soon.
</P>
<P>
Late July, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suspended a
three-year loan package to kenya worth 215 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government held a week-long discussions with the
IMF and the World Bank over the suspended loan package and
promised to take actions to meet the conditions set by the two
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The conditions include strengthening of the energy sector,
establishing an independent anti-corruption authority and
ensuring autonomy of the Kenya Revenue Authority.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Blames Foreign Sabotage in Ties with S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria said Tuesday it would
working together with South Africa to check any further
machinations by countries that do not wish Africa well by creating
rift between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The reported strain in the relations between Nigeria and South
Africa was orchestrated by some foreign government, said Alhaji
Idrisu Alhassan Kpaki, minister of state for foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, belonging to similar international
organizations, were working towards improving existing bilateral
relations and promoting the cause of Africans, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Nigeria's move towards Asia for economic cooperation, the
minister said, "Nigeria is not changing its friends but is making
new friends", the official newspaper New Nigerian reported today.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks one week before a two-day visit
to Nigeria by South Africa's Vice-President Thambo Mbeki from
September 17 to 18.
</P>
<P>
It is noted increasing diplomatic moves between the two
countries recently indicated a warm-up in bilateral relations
which became frosty since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two leading African countries fell to an
all-time low in late 1995, when South Africa led the campaign in
the Commonwealth that suspended Nigeria's membership for
executing Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Foreign Ministry Chief Tom Ikimi visited South Africa
last week to deliver a special message from Head of State Abacha to
President Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Reports say South Africa has agreed not to oppose Nigeria "in
any way" at the October Commonwealth Summit in Edinburgh,
Scotland, which will take the final decision on Nigeria's
membership.
</P>
<P>
South Africa also reportedly agreed to cooperate with the
Economic Community of West African States, in which Nigeria is a
key player, in its effort to restore the legitimate government of
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in Sierra Leone, who was ousted in a
coup on May 25.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Cut One Third of Defense Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is planning to
reduce one third of its defense force over the next five years to save
expenditure for purchase of advanced military hardware, local daily
the citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the disarmament is that 50 percent of the military
budget should been spent on military personnel, making it very difficult
to upgrade and renew military equipment, Defense Department spokesman
Jack Grundlig was quoted as reporting.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's current military budget is 9.58 billion Rand (two
billion U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Grundlig said the reduction of military personnel would enable the
department to set aside about one billion Rand (213 million U.S.
Dollars) a year towards buying new military hardware and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Some western countries, including Britain, Germany and Spain, have
been trying to sell packages of weapons to the South African military,
which complains that the key arms in use are either obsolete or in
poor condition.
</P>
<P>
The weapons offered by western countries include aircraft, warships
and submarines.

<HEADLINE> Boeing to Relocate Australian Headquarters to Brisbane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Australia Limited
will move its Australian headquarters from Sydney to Brisbane, a
city in east Australia's Queensland state, Queensland Premier Rob
Borbidge said today.
</P>
<P>
Queensland had been negotiating with the company since May and
the deal was sealed earlier this week, the premier was quoted by
the Australian Associated Press (AAP) as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Significantly, having Boeing in Brisbane will mean, that in
terms of aerospace defense industries, we will have the world's
leading corporation making Brisbane home for everything that it
does in Australia," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has been established in Australia for 60 years and
employs 1,700 people. A subsidiary company, AeroSpace
Technologies, is a major exporter of aerospace structures for the
world's leading aircraft manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, 1,027 kilometers away from Brisbane, Boeing
Australia Managing Director David Gray confirmed the premier's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
"We have made no secret over the last few months that we
intended to move," Gray said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Boeing Australia Limited is part of the Boeing Company which
last year booked more than 49 billion US dollars in world sales.
</P>
<P>
Boeing had held discussions with government representatives
from Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland states as well as
Canberra before deciding to relocate, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a competitive business environment compared to the
other states, certainly in terms of lower state taxes and
charges...," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Borbidge declined to disclose some of the sweeteners, or
incentives, his government offered Boeing, saying they were
confidential.
</P>
<P>
Ron Phillips, deputy leader of the opposition in New South
Wales state where Sydney is located, said higher taxes were behind
Boeing's move.
</P>
<P>
Phillips said the move was a direct result of state tax hikes
in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Both Borbidge and Gray did not say when the relocation will
begin.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A regional investment
promotion conference is scheduled to be held in Nairobi in
November this year, the "Kenya Times" reported today.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Banks' Operation Normal in Philippines: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The governor of the Philippine
Central Bank said today that operations of the country's banks
have remained normal despite rumors of an impending bank run.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Singson said his statement was based on the findings of
the agents of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) who
reported to the central bank that no bank run is taking place
right now.
</P>
<P>
Singson admitted that there was a time when one of the banks
sought the financial help of the central bank because of an
unusual volume of withdrawals by its depositors.
</P>
<P>
But the governor said he did not consider this as some kind of
a panic withdrawal as far as the central bank is concerned.
</P>
<P>
Singson did not disclose the name of the bank which borrowed
money from the central bank in order to beef up its financial
resources in the midst of the peso depreciation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Singson was alarmed over the rumors that the country's
banks were experiencing troubles as a result of the peso
depreciation that started haunting the banking industry since July
11.
</P>
<P>
This prompted the central bank to seek the help of the NBI to
find the veracity of these rumors and take action against those
who are spreading the rumors which may have caused panic
withdrawals.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Cotton Production Below Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 10 (Xinhua) --About 278,000 tons of cotton
were produced this year by Zimbabwe's cotton growers, which are below
the forecast production of between 285,000 and 300,000 tons, the
daily The Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Cotton Managing Director Sylvester Nguni said Tuesday the
production of cotton was affected by excessive rains which caused
waterlogging and leaching.
</P>
<P>
Peasants and small-scale commercial cotton growers shared
around one billion Zimbabwe Dollars (about 87 million US Dollars)
from the 190,000 tons of raw cotton they sold to the cotton
company so far this season.
</P>
<P>
Cotton has been a profitable cash crop for Zimbabwe's rural
communities. Over 800 million Zimbabwe Dollars (approximate 70
US Dollars) had gone to peasant farmers in the communal lands.
</P>
<P>
The cotton company, set for privatisation next month, buys
cotton through 16 depots in the major cotton growing areas and
the overhelming bulk of its suppliers are peasant and small-scale
growers producing high-quality hand-picked cotton.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The State Planning
Commission recently gave the nod of approval for the building of
the Tonggu Waterway between Shenzhen and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Local officials call it an important step to link transport
facilities between Shenzhen and neighboring Hong Kong. The Tonggu
project is the first such work okayed by the central government
this year.
</P>
<P>
The work is primarily a deep-water exiting channel for the
western part of the Shenzhen Harbor. In the first phase, the
waterway will be able to accomodate new type of container-carriers.
</P>
<P>
The new waterway will be 200 meters in width at its bottom and
13.5 meters in depth. Total cost of the work is estimated to reach
about 680 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
There are now 85 berths in western port area, handling a total
of 27.5 million tons of goods last year, including 236,000 TEUs.
</P>
<P>
However, up to now, all huge vessels have had to enter the port
through Hong Kong's waterway, which is unsafe due to its speedy
water-flow and a number of submerged reefs.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Agriculture Attracts Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan's agriculture sector,
which features ideal natural and geographical conditions, has
emerged as a preferred investment choice for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Chinese urbanites are gradually abandoning the habit of buying
live chickens, and are instead opting for Chai Tai packaged
chicken cooperatively produced by the city and the Chai Tai Group
from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the group invested 194 million US dollars to construct
the largest chicken processing enterprise in central China's Wuhan
City.
</P>
<P>
The company provides hatchlings and feed, and teaches farmers
epidemic prevention techniques. The farmers then supply the
company with mature chickens.
</P>
<P>
The group's annual processing capacity stands at three million
packaged chickens which are sold at home and overseas.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors had opened 15 agriculture-related
enterprises valued at 500 million US dollars in the city by the
end of August. The enterprises are engaged in wide-ranging areas
such as aquatic products, flower cultivation, cultivation,
beverages, and livestock products processing.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Israel established Asia's largest dehydrated
vegetable processing enterprise in Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
The city, located at the juncture of east and west China,
features convenient water, land and air transportation. Some 255
frost-free days annually provide ideal conditions for farming,
especially for growing vegetables and fruit.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan's 118,000 ha of water coverage also offer great potential
for the development of aquatic products.

<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey revealed that
most packaged moon cakes fulfill quality standards expected by
shoppers purchasing the festive food for the coming Mid-Autumn
Festival.
</P>
<P>
The traditional Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 16 this

examination centers, examined 102 varieties of moon cakes
producted by 93 factories in cities, including Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Suzhou and Shenzhen.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Life's Not Bad For Teachers in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- More Shanghai citizens
believe that despite the low pay and occasional lack of respect,
being a teacher isn't such a bad deal.
</P>
<P>
Xiang Jiaxiang, deputy president of Shanghai Normal College,
said that 7,000 applicants had competed for some 1,200 positions
available at the school this semester.
</P>
<P>
"That is, only one out of every six could be enrolled. But several
years ago, the ratio was one out of every two or three," he told
Xinhua prior to Teachers' Day, which falls on September 10.
</P>
<P>
In early June, He recalled, as more as 40 thousand prospective
students once rushed to the college's conference hall for
information on enrollment procedures. The hall can hold only
several thousand people.
</P>
<P>
Many high school headmasters came to his office to make
teaching offers to graduates, Xiang said. At present, an opening
for a high school teacher in Shanghai draws as more as 30 applicants.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is China's biggest commercial and trade center. Nearly
160,000 teachers work in the city.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, teachers colleges in Shanghai, and throughout
China as well, have suffered from two major problems: few
high school students registered to take entrance examinations to
study at teachers colleges, and many graduates from teachers
colleges were reluctant to work in high schools.
</P>
<P>
Low pay is one of the main reasons.
</P>
<P>
But things now have been somewhat changed. Salaries for
teachers in the municipality have doubled from 1992 and are 10
percent higher than those for government servants. according to
figures provided by the Shanghai Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the money spent by the government on building
housing for teachers increased by 465.7 percent in the 1991-95
period over the 1986-90 period.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody can witness the improvement in teachers' conditions,
thanks to the overall development of the national economy" said Li
Mingyang, an official from the Shanghai Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
China has a time-honored tradition of respecting teachers and
intellectuals. But in the chaotic Culture Revolution (1966-76),
educators were reviled and some even tortured.
</P>
<P>
After the reform and opening up policy was introduced in the
late 1970s, they again received their due respect.
</P>
<P>
The central government has convened meetings every year calling
on local officials to deal seriously with teachers' low pay. Some
regulations hint that if officials continue to ignore the
situation, they will have difficulties being promoted.
</P>
<P>
These methods have proved effective. Official figures show
that between 1985 and 1990, 25 percent of Shanghai's college
teachers had opted for more lucrative jobs. But the rate had been
brought down to four percent by 1995.
</P>
<P>
In primary and high schools, where the work was usually more
difficult, 3,200 teachers quit their jobs in 1993. However, the
number dropped to 1,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Many people think that time is still needed before teachers can
improve their overall social status. But there is no doubt the
profession will become increasingly attractive.
</P>
<P>
"At least the income is stable," Li Mingyang said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka's Per Capita Debt Burden Stands at 133 Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The present per capita debt
burden of Bangladesh is about 133 U.S. dollars, according to a
local news report today.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh may land up in debt-trap within the next 10 years
unless steps are taken to stem the rising trend of debt burden,
the report quoted a senior official from the Ministry of planning
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The total national debt, as a percentage of the GDP is 54
percent and debt service liability is 18 percent as percentage of
exports," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that with about 50 percent of the population living
below the poverty line and a population growth rate of about 2
percent, management of this South Asian country is extremely
difficult.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh with a population of over 120 million and over 800
persons per square kilometer, is one of the most densely populated
country in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the population of Bangladesh will be
doubled within the next 35 years if the present rate of population
growth continues.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that poverty, as a situation of
deprivation of the basic needs, affects the majority of the
population, 80 percent of whom, still live in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
About 65 percent of the population are landless and about 10
million people are completely assetless and rootless, he noted,
adding that about 50 percent of mothers in the rural areas get
less than 1,200 calories a day against the minimum requirement of
about 2,300 calories, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the percentage of underweight children under five
years in this debt-burdened country is 66, the official added.

government officials.
</P>
<P>
The 142-km railway will be built at a cost of some 3.4 billion
yuan. First phase will involve laying a double-track foundation

<HEADLINE> Family Planning Film Launched in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A documentary film on
family planning services in Tanzania has been launched in this east
African country.
</P>
<P>
The film, based on a research on familiy planning from October
to November, 1995, will be shown on the four TV stations who will
play a major role in enlightening the people on family planning
matters, said Deborah Mwenda, Chairperson of the Tanzania Media
Women Association (TAMWA) while launching the film on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Two pamphlets on the research will be also available to the
public.
</P>
<P>
Deborah said that although family planning activities started in
the country in 1959, so far less than 10 percent of the people are
practising it because of "myths surrounding family planning" and
"family planning and Islam".
</P>
<P>
She urged, "Much more work, therefore, needs to be done by
non-governrmental organizations including TAMWA to raise people's
awareness of family planning.
</P>
<P>
The film was sponsored by Pathfinder International whose
president Dan Pellegrum said at the launching of the film that
family planning is very important in creating a better society.
</P>
<P>
Between 2,000 and 4,000 women die every year in Tanzania due to
complications from pregnancy and during child birth, the figures
translate that more than 10 women die every day because of pregnant
related problems and during delivery, according to TAMWA.

<HEADLINE> Albright Confers With Israeli President Weizman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, on her first Middle East visit since
taking office, stressed the U.S. commitment to Israel in achieving
peace with security.
</P>
<P>
Albright conferred this morning with Israeli President Ezer
Weizman at the presidential residence in Jerusalem after arriving
from Ben-Gurion Airport, where she was welcomed by Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
She told a press conference after the meeting that the U.S. is
with Israel in its battle against terrorism and in the struggle to
apprehend those who orchesrated terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the U.S. supports Israel's insistence on the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to "fulfill its
responsibilities and obligations it has undertaken."
</P>
<P>
"We are with you in the determination that those committed
terror will not succeed, now or ever, in preventing the
possibilities of peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and
throughout the Middle East region from becoming a reality," she
added.
</P>
<P>
Albright stressed that during her three-day visit here she
will focus on the security issue in discussions with Israeli and
PNA leaders, adding that both sides should take on "mutual
responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
However, she admitted that real security was inseparable from
the path of real peace.
</P>
<P>
In a large part of her speech, Albright stressed the special
and important relations between the U.S. and Israel, which she
described as "deeply-rooted in history and shared values" in
various areas.
</P>
<P>
She reaffirmed that the U.S. "is absolutely committed to
maintaining Israel's military qualitative edge" in the region.
</P>
<P>
She said that the U.S., joined by Israel and its Arab
partners, would strive to achieve not only peace between Israel
and the Palestinians, but also a comprehensive peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Albright added that U.S. President has extended an invitation
to President Weizman, the nominal head of state in Israel, to
visit Washington in early October.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting and the breakfast with Weizman, Albright
is to be accompanied by the president to visit the people wounded
in last Thursday's triple suicide bombing in Jerusalem's Ben
Yehuda pedestrian mall.
</P>
<P>
The terror attack, the second in five weeks, killed eight
people including three suicide bombers and wounded over 190
others.
</P>
<P>
This, together with the previous one on July 30 in which 17
people including two suicide bombers were killed and 170 others
wounded, was claimed by the militant Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas).
</P>
<P>
Following the wave of attacks, Israel has imposed tough
sanctions against the Palestinians, and conditioned a resumption
of peace talks on the PNA's actions to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The terror attacks have cast dark shadows over Albright's
first trip to the region, which is designed to revive the
deeply-troubled Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the two sides have been frozen since last
March when Israel began building the Har Homa settlement in the
disputed East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Late today, Albright will hold formal talks with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition Labor party leader Ehud
Barak. On Thursday, she is expected to meet with PNA President
Yasser Arafat and with Netanyahu for the second time in a bid to
narrow the gap between the two sides so to get the peace process
back on track.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, she will hold another meeting with Arafat before
leaving for Syria at the second leg of her Middle East trip, which
will also take her to Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

DAR ES SALAAM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Harmonization of the
cultural and educational policies in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
has been urged for faster regional integration.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by the Deputy Executive Secretary of the
East African Cooperation (EAC), Fulgence Kazaura, in Arusha,
northern Tanzania Tuesday, while opening a three-day meeting of
senior officials of culture and education sector from the three
countries, according to a news dispatch available here today.
</P>
<P>
"The people of east Africa share common heritage in language
and traditional values," said Kazaura, adding "These are the
factors which can be utilized for the mutual benefit of the
member states within the framework of the EAC."
</P>
<P>
He noted that culture and education are crucial for promoting
fraternal relations and enhancing social integration of peoples
of the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Kazaura asked the delegates to the meeting to identity
constraints that confront EAC member states in the area and make
recommendations which will be followed by relevant authorities.

<HEADLINE> Australia Freezes Textile Tariff Cut During 2000-2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard announced in Sydney today the federal government's
decision to impose a five-year freeze from 2000 on slashing
tariffs on the textile, clothing and footwear (TCF).
</P>
<P>
Howard said the five-year freeze would enable Australian TCF
firms to strengthen their competitive positions after a period of
significant change, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation
reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision was apparently made by the government under the
pressure from local TCF industries. The industries, which employ
96,000 workers, have been lobbying intensively against the
proposals on TCF tariff cuts.
</P>
<P>
The planned reductions of TCF tariffs would continue through to
the year 2000 and would then be maintained at the same level from
July 1, 2000 until January 1, 2005, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tariffs on clothing and finished textiles would move from
current levels of 34 percent before being frozen at 25 percent on
July 1, 2000 until January 1, 2005, when they would move to 17.5
percent, the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Footwear, carpets and cotton fabric tariffs would be frozen at
15 percent in 2000 before moving to 10 percent in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The decision is almost identical to that adopted by the
government earlier this year for the car manufacturing industry,
with the government responding to wide-spread community concern
about the loss of blue-collar jobs in traditional manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from four domestic car makers, the Howard
government on July 5 accepted a four-year freeze on car tariffs
from 2000 to 2004.
</P>
<P>
With a jobless rate of 8.7, unemployment has been one of the
several issues high on the agenda of the Howard government.

<HEADLINE> State-Owned Textile Mills May Be transferred to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh government is
considering a proposal to transfer the ownership of some
state-owned textile mills to workers and employees as part of its
privatization program, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ownership will be transferred according to the existing
Company Law, the newspaper the Independent said, adding that the
Bangladesh prime minister has directed the authorities concerned
to explore avenues for handling over the ownership of the
state-owned enterprises (SOE) to workers and employees.
</P>
<P>
Recommendations have been made in this regard by a committee
set up on June 9,1997 to determine the terms and conditions for
handling over the ownership of public sector textile mills, the
newspaper stated.
</P>
<P>
According to the recommendations, the workers and employees will
have to clear the long-term loans of the state-owned textile
mills, if they take over their ownership while the government will
transfer its shares to them free of cost, the Independent said.
</P>
<P>
The workers and employees will buy these mills in open tender,
the paper reported, adding that these mills will not be allowed to
change over to any other business and could be permitted to run as
textile mills only.
</P>
<P>
Beside, the government will establish some regulatory
authorities to ensure the smooth running of these mills and
provide some extra facilities to these enterprises, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
As facilities, interests on outstanding loans at the time of
transfer will be written-off, the paper stated.
</P>
<P>
There will be exemption from taxes on the import of spare parts
and machinery, the paper said. Besides, banks will be also
encouraged to provide soft loans at low and simple interest.
</P>
<P>
According to the recommendations, a mill can be transferred to
its workers and employees if a majority or 65 percent of them
express a desire to own the mill and run it as a public limited
company, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
This action taken by the government aims at alleviating the
government's financial burden caused by the SOE sector. The public
sector corporations have been sustaining a lost of around 25
billion taka (about 568 million U.S. dollars) a year causing a
huge drain on the national exchequer, the newspaper added.

<HEADLINE> NZ Treasurer Hints at Rate Cut for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Treasurer
Winston Peters said today that he planned to lower the current
business tax rates next year, a local press report said.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement in response to questions at an economic
meeting in Masterton, 100 km northeast of Wellington,
</P>
<P>
He said he planned to bring the corporate rate into line with
the personal tax rates, raising the possibility of two rates for
businesses.
</P>
<P>
At present, companies pay a flat rate of 33 cents for each
dollar on profit while individuals are taxed at 21.5 percent on
incomes up to 34,000 NZ dollars and 33 percent on incomes over
that amount.
</P>
<P>
"The work is going into it now. Hopefully we will complete it
as soon as possible. We will be announcing it in the Budget next
year, or sooner," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's good for business, it's good for the country, it's good
for production, it's good for growth," he stated.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for Peters' office later downplayed the
significance of Peters' statement, saying all tax rates were being
 examined to help lower business running costs.
</P>
<P>
"The Government would be in a position to make decisions about
that around Budget time next year," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Currency Falls 18-month Low Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali currency of
rupee depreciated for the third time in two weeks and hit an
18-month low, forcing the central bank to intervene again.
</P>
<P>
To meet the pressing market demand, the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB)
on Monday evening sold 16.5 million U.S. dollars to commercial
banks at the rate of 58.70 rupee at the request of the Foreign
Exchange Dealers Association.
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday and Wednesday, the NRB has refixed the buying
and selling rates of the greenback at rupee 58.50 and rupee 59.05
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The NRB intervened first on August 27 when the Nepali rupee
fell by 50 paisa and was sold at 58.05 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
From September 4, the Nepali currency fell down further to
58.30 per dollar, and the buying rate of the dollar was reset at
57.75 rupee from 57.50 rupee.
</P>
<P>
Since the Indian rupee keeps falling against the dollar
recently and hit a 19-month low of 36.70 Tuesday, the Nepali
currency, pegged to the Indian currency at a fixed rate of 1:1.6,
has no other way but to follow.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Chinese Economic Development is a Miracle: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The reform and opening policy,
launched by the Communist Party of China in the late 1970s, has
brought miraculous economic development to the country, said Anwar
Hossain, who just returned from China last month.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Hossain, general secretary
of the Bangladesh-China Friendship Center, said China has set an
example in the world of magnificent economic development while
keeping the social and moral values intact.
</P>
<P>
Noting that over the past 19 years, China's GDP has registered
an average annual growth of 9.9 percent, he said, "the economic
development taken place in China can only be compared with dreams
come true."
</P>
<P>
Anwarul Amin, who was a chief executive of an international
bank in Beijing in the 1980s, said in a separate interview with
Xinhua that he had witnessed the great development since 1978 when
the reform and opening policy came into effect.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his seven-year stay in Beijing, he said: "I saw
visibly the gradual evolution of the Chinese open policy and also
the Chinese emphasis on having market economy orientation along
with Socialist characteristics, which I think was a unique way of
thinking."
</P>
<P>
"When I had a chance to go again to China in this July, I was
really astonished by the speed of the progress during the last few
years," said Amin, who attributed all these achievements to the
correct policy taken by the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Jainul Jamal of Diot Corporation, one of the leading
Bangladeshi importers of Chinese agricultural and industrial
machinery and electric motors, told Xinhua that his company's
yearly trade volume with China had gone up to 20 million U.S.
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
"For the considerable price and quality, Chinese products
exported to our country are acceptable in all quarters. In fact,
almost all Bangladesh workshops are using the exported machinery
goods of China," said Jamal.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, I took very often business trips to China and
I was deeply impressed by the unprecedented economic reform and
social development taken by the Chinese government. In my opinion,
the policy progress of China in every respect is encouraging," he
added.
</P>
<P>
As for the forthcoming 15th Congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), Amin believed that the congress will come up with a
better and more progressive reform package following evaluation of
the experience in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
"With many young, energetic and dynamic people entering the
party leadership, the CPC is fully geared up to take the challenge
of the 21st century. I will say the party is on the right track
and the people are very happy seeing this reforms working in their
own life," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hossain is also confident of the new leadership in China,
"President Jiang Zemin is already leading the country toward right
direction. The successful reunification of Hong Kong has
manifested the achievement of new leaders."
</P>
<P>
"We hope the Chinese new leadership will be able to face any
challenge in achieving economic and social development in the
coming days," he said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon and Romania to Enhance Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon wishes to strengthen
its economic and trade ties with Romania, Lebanese Parliament
President Nabih Berri told a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Berri, who is now on a four-day official visit to Romania, held
talks with Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea, Chairman of the

During their talks, the two sides mainly discussed ways to
enhance bilateral trade ties. Berri pointed out that so far the

tourism and other fields. However, there was great potential for
further cooperation in bilateral trade and investment.

They also exchanged views on the Middle East peace
process. Berri expressed appreciation for Romania's support for
Lebanon in upholding its independence. He hoped that Romania would

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Keep Rising in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Motor fuel prices in Thailand
are still on the rise as a result of the Thai currency's
floatation since July 2.
</P>
<P>
Service stations operated by the two major
government-controlled oil firms raised oil prices across the board
on Tuesday by 30 satang a liter, the 10th round of oil price
hikes since the baht's floatation.
</P>
<P>
Up until now the value of the baht has depreciated about 40
percent against the U.S. dollar, which is used by the country in
the import of oil.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have gone up about once a week since mid-July, each
time by a margin of between 20-30 satang.
</P>
<P>
The accumulated increase in domestic oil prices since July 16,
when oil companies first began to boost pump prices, is in the
range of 1.6-1.7 baht a liter.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's price hike by the two government-controlled oil
firms, Petroleum Authority of Thailand and Bangchuk Petroleum Plc,
followed decisions last Saturday by the other major oil companies
to raise prices by the same margin.
</P>
<P>
A liter of super gasoline now costs about 11.3 baht while
premium gasoline is about 11.2 baht a liter.
</P>
<P>
Domestic pump prices are now the highest over the past several
years.
</P>
<P>
Given the volatile situation, local pump prices will likely
jump again by the same amount on Saturday as major firms seek to
cover the actual increase in their costs.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Push Floriculture Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has decided to
develop its floriculture industry and make it competitive in the
world market.
</P>
<P>
A six-member committee has been appointed by the government to
study all aspects of the industry and make recommendations.
</P>
<P>
At present only a few Sri Lankan companies are exporting a
small quantity of cut flowers, ornamental plants and foliage
plants to the European Union and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The government believes that if the industry is well organized
and coordinated, it could compete with India, Thailand and
Malaysia for a larger market share.
</P>
<P>
Floriculture is a booming industry in India, Thailand and
Malaysia, where it often gets support and assistance from the
government.
</P>
<P>
The committee will carry out a survey to evaluate the current
situation of the industry, such as the number of projects in
operation, extent of land cultivation, annual production and
volume of exports.
</P>
<P>
It will also make recommendations on the development of the
floriculture industry and the extent of state assistance to such
development efforts.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Sheila Widnall, the first
woman secretary of the United States Air Force, said today she
would step down from her four-year tenure on October 31.
</P>
<P>
Widnall, who was named Air Force secretary in 1993, formally
announced her intention in a letter to President Bill Clinton and
Secretary of Defense William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
Widnall said she would go back to the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, where she had been associate provost and a faculty
member for more than 28 years before being named Air Force
secretary. She is an expert on aeronautics and astronautics.
</P>
<P>
Widnall's resignation came just weeks after the Air Force's
Chief of Staff, General Ronald Fogleman, quit his post over a
controversy about a terrorist attack on U.S. troops in Saudi
Arabia in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Fogleman quit in July, saying he felt the air commander at the
scene was being unfairly blamed after the terrorist bombing on a
U.S. military housing complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killed 19
Americans.

<HEADLINE> Helms Refuses to Consider Weld Nomination as Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms today refused to put the
nomination of William Weld as U.S. ambassador to Mexico on the
agenda of a special committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Senator Richard Lugar and three others who
requested the meeting, Helms said he alone has authority to set
the agenda of the meeting of the Committee scheduled on September
12.
</P>
<P>
"The Weld nomination will not be on the agenda of this
meeting," Helms said.
</P>
<P>
Weld, former governor of Massachusetts, was nominated by
President Bill Clinton in July to be ambassador to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Helms, who accused Weld of being too lenient on illegal drugs,
insisted that he will not consider Weld as a candidate for the
post.
</P>
<P>
But Weld denies he is soft on drugs and has demanded a public
hearing on his record.
</P>
<P>
Lugar and other members of the 15-member Foreign Relations
Committee uphold that Helms should not be permitted to block a
confirmation hearing for Weld.
</P>
<P>
An approval of the nomination by the Committee is needed before
the nomination goes to the full Senate for a vote.

<HEADLINE> Half-Year Tourist Arrivals Edge Up in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in Thailand
in the first half of this year grew by only 1.8 percent over the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The number is much lower than expected by the Tourism Authority
of Thailand (TAT), which had targeted a 7.4-percent growth to a
total of 7.84 million arrivals for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
In fact there may be only a 4-percent growth by the end of the
year, The Bangkok Post today quoted TAT Deputy Governor Juthamas
Siriwan as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the first four months, arrivals from ASEAN countries,
which supply more than half of all Thailand's tourists, dropped
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Economic problems and depreciation of currencies in the region
are deterring people from making overseas trips.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is promoting an "Amazing Thailand" campaign for 1998
and 1999 to attract 17 million foreigners in the two years.
</P>
<P>
Last week TAT Governor Seree Wangpaichitr admitted that it
would be difficult to attain the target, but he said the country
can still meet the revenue target of 600 billion baht (about 16
billion U.S. dollars) set for the two-year campaign.
</P>
<P>
Juthamas said the TAT will set sight on the 2 million transit
passengers per year and allure them to do shopping at airports or
nearby areas. Besides, she plans to form some promotion groups to
do direct marketing on roadshows to major markets.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Ethnic Group Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- United States President
Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore today met with 12 people
of various ethnic groups, including Polish, Hungarian and Irish,
who were worried they would be left out of a racial reconciliation
effort now focused more on skin color.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced his year-long drive to improve race relations
in June.
</P>
<P>
"Ethnic Americans in particular were very supportive of what
the president was doing, but were concerned that the initiative
was being put in black-versus-white-versus-Latino perspectives,"
said Brian O'Dwyer, who represented the New York-based Irish
American Immigration Coalition.
</P>
<P>
He said the president and vice president were "extraordinarily
sympathetic to our viewpoint" after each group presented its
concerns.
</P>
<P>
A major dilemma for Clinton's initiative has been determining
how much attention to give black-white relations without giving
short shrift to other races and ethnic groups. At its first
meeting in July, the president's seven-member race advisory board
split over this issue.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the meeting was part of
an continuing outreach effort to prevent the feelings of exclusion
voiced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fred Rotondaro, executive director of the National Italian
American Foundation, said several ethnic organizations planned to
gather here Wednesday to plan ways to work with Clinton's
initiative.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Suspends Deportation of Six Irish Nationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
today it suspended deportation proceedings for six Irish nationals
who have completed their prison sentences for various crimes
involving the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
The move was described as a gesture to encourage the peace
process in Northern Ireland as the Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican
Army's political wing, formally signed a declaration renouncing
violence earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno said she acted on a formal request
from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and suspended the
deportation of the six individuals "who have engaged in activity
on behalf" of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
The six Irish people, who had completed their prison sentences,
had been convicted of various crimes involving the IRA. They were
facing deportation for making untrue statements to immigration
officials.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Reno, Albright said the measure was taken to
advance the ongoing peace process and the talks in Northern
Ireland.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Leading Thai commercial banks
 raised their lending rates by a significant margin Tuesday as the
country's economy remained under the pressure of tight liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Bank, Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) and Bank of Ayudhya
also boosted their lending rates by half a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Bank's minimum lending rate (MLR) now stands at 14.25
percent while its minimum overdraft rate (MOR) is at 14.75 percent
and its minimum retail rate (MRR) 14.5 percent, according to The
Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
At SCB and Bank of Ayudhya, the increase leaves their MLR at
14.25 percent and their MOR and MRR at 14.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thai Military Bank also raised its rates. Now its MLR stands at
13.50 percent and its MOR and MRR, 14.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the state-owned Krung Thai Bank did not adjust its
rates this time, in line with government policy.
</P>
<P>
Some bank executives said the hike is in accordance with higher
costs and the changed situation in the money market.

BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing municipal
government hosted a conference on Tuesday to mark China's Teachers
Day, which will be celebrated today.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhijian, deputy secretary of the Beijing municipal committee
of the Chinese Communist Party, expressed support and
congratulations for teachers working in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Li said that teachers working in the capital must work hard to
contribute to the city's education program.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the city has invested 800 million yuan (100
million US dollars) over the past two years to either construct or
renovate schools and housing for teachers.
</P>
<P>
Despite China's time-honored tradition of respecting teachers,
the income level for teachers was amongst the lowest in the nation
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have launched intensive campaigns over the past
few years to improve the conditions of teachers and improve the
quality of education as a means of fulfilling the nation's
modernization dream.
</P>
<P>
Officials presented awards to more than 1,000 outstanding
teachers attending yesterday's conference.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fire Threatens Peru Historical Treasure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A huge forest fire Tuesday came
as close as 200 meters to Peru's Inca citadel of Machu Picchu, a
UNESCO-proclaimed World Heritage Site.
</P>
<P>
Peru's civil defense chief, Hector Nurena, said it was very
difficult to control the fire, which had destroyed 1,500 acres of
vegetation, because dense smoke and heat hampered hundreds of
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
The smoke caused poor visibility and worry about asphyxiation,
Nurena said. Four helicopters carrying water from nearby rivers
also had no option but wait on the ground.
</P>
<P>
"But there has been no damage to the citadel," Nurena noted.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters, policemen, soldiers and volunteers cut down trees
around the citadel and poured water on the earth to prevent flames
licking the ancient center.
</P>
<P>
Now the major threat comes from winds which have carried embers
across the forest to spark fresh fires all over the area which is
about 1,150 kilometers southeast of Lima.
</P>
<P>
The area was sealed off to visitors and will not be reopened
for at least a week. Hundreds of people who stayed in nearby
hotels and villages were evacuated by civil defense workers.
</P>
<P>
Machu Picchu, one of Latin America's most famous tourist
attractions, was discovered by a United States archeologist, Hiram
Bingham, in 1912. Archeologists believe the ruins were a key
religious center of the pre-Columbian Inca empire.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Imposes National Ban on Land Clearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
has imposed a national cessation to land clearance activities in a
bid to curb forest fires which have caused smoke and haze
problems, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"The president has ordered plantations, timber companies and
settler farmers to stop all land clearing activities," Environment
Minister Sarwono Kusumaatmadja said here last night after meeting
with President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Smoke and haze caused by fires have affected millions of lives
in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that about 1,053 fires have razed approximately
300,000 hectares of forest in South Sumatra, Jambi, Riau and West
Kalimantan, causing health problems, flights cancellations and air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of fires have produced a thick pall of smoke over many
parts of Indonesia and neighboring Malaysia and Singapore. At
least three airports in Indonesia have been shut down since the
weekend because of low visibility and cars have been forced to
drive with lights on during daytime in some areas.
</P>
<P>
The smoke has worsened already chronic air pollution over
Jakarta, and a thick haze has enveloped Malaysia's capital, Kuala
Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Sarwono estimated that as many as 20 million people
could suffer respiratory, eye and other health problems because of
the smoke.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia and Singapore have provided information from
satellites to help track the progress of fires. Malaysia also has
started a cloud-seeding program to trigger rainfall to clear the
air.
</P>
<P>
Sarwono said Indonesia would begin a similar artificial rain
project immediately. Officials have said the fires will continue
to burn until extinguished by seasonal monsoon rain.
</P>
<P>
However, meteorologists predict that the rain might be delayed
by months this year because of the El Nino weather phenomenon over
the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
El Nino occurs every three to five years and produces climate
abnormalities around the world, including droughts in Indonesia,
other parts of Asia and Australia. The dry spell so far has
devastated harvests of rice, coffee and other crops in Indonesia.

Within just a year, Chen has become one of the best pupils in his
primary school class. He gives all the credit for his
transformation to Wu Penghua, whom he calls "Teacher Mother."
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old Wu, who teaches primary school in a remote area
of east China's Anhui Province, thinks of her job as a reflection of
her life values rather than just a way of making a living.
</P>
<P>
She has taught there for 30 years, abandoning her chances of
living in Taiwan or the United States and being transferred to a
job in the city.
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to dedicate all I have to foster talent for our
country," she said.
</P>
<P>
China has more than ten million teachers, most of whom view the
teaching profession as their life's work. In 1988, the Chinese
Government set September 10 as national Teacher's Day.
</P>
<P>
Lu Binglun, who teaches in the Dabie mountainous area in East
China, is one of the many dedicated teachers. At one point in his
life as a businessman, he could earn more money in a couple of
weeks than he can now as a teacher for several months. But he
refuses to quit teaching.
</P>
<P>
"My biggest aspiration is to give these country kids brighter
futures through my work," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
One of Lu's student, Yu Yimei, is now a teacher herself. She
said with appreciation, "Without Teacher Lu's help, I would have
been illiterate."
</P>
<P>
Yu's family was poor, and as a primary school pupil she was
forced to drop out of school. Lu made five visits to Yu's home to
persuade her parents to send her back to the school and he paid
Yu's tuition for several years running.
</P>
<P>
Though living in poverty himself, Lu has helped more than 100
pupils from poor families finish their studies. Many of his
students came back to their hometown after graduation from senior
secondary schools and became wealthy.
</P>
<P>
"The development of education is the basis of modernization of
our country. Students of today are masters of the next century,"
Lu noted.
</P>
<P>
Another teacher in the region, Hu Yonghua, has been teaching in
a middle school for 33 years. "We see the value of our life from
our students," said Hu, who volunteered to give up the chance to
work in Shanghai and teach in the poor mountainous area upon
graduation from university.
</P>
<P>
Despite a lame leg, Hu has spent nearly all his holidays
tutoring his students for free. Thanks to his efforts, the school
became renowned in the province and even in the country. More than
450 university graduates are his students and many of them made
remarkable achievements.
</P>
<P>
"The contribution of teachers to society is being increasingly
admired by more and more people," said Chen Xianzhong, director of
Anhui Provincial Educational Commission.
</P>
<P>
China has a long tradition of respecting teachers, but the
tradition was forsaken during the 10-year Cultural Revolution
(1966-1976), when teachers were reviled and sometimes tortured.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has taken considerable efforts to
improve teachers' living conditions since late 1970s, Chen said,
"We have a lot to do to raise their social and economic
status. And the spirit of utter devotion to teaching and
respecting teachers is yet to be further fostered," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Foreign Minister Says Army United Behind Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Algerian Foreign Minister
Ahmed Attaf said here today the Algerian army stood united behind
the government, adding terrorism in Algeria was doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
Attaf said the Algerian army is "serving the state and its
institutions." He also dismissed the possibility of a military
coup.
</P>
<P>
"We have heard about the army being divided between those who
plead reconciliation and those who plead eradication. Those are,
believe me, speculations," Attaf, on a two-day visit to Finland,
told a news conference held after meeting his Finnish counterpart
Tarja Halonen.
</P>
<P>
Attaf added that terrorism had no future in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Muslim fundamentalists have been battling the authorities since
early 1992 when the government cancelled a general election in
which radical Islamists were on the verge of a victory.
</P>
<P>
Some 60,000 people have been killed in Algeria's violence.
</P>
<P>
Attaf also denied that the United Nations had offered to
mediate in the conflict and said his country would reject the
world body's intention, if any, to intervene.
</P>
<P>
Attaf is on his first visit to Finland. He visited the
Netherlands early this week and also Denmark early this year. All
of the three European countries are members of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The EU, set to build a free trade bloc with the Mediterranean
countries, is keen to develop relations with Algeria, an African
country in the Mediterranean.

<HEADLINE> Maldives Bans "Hate Book" on National Heroes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Maldivian government has
banned a local history book on the grounds that it defames past
national heroes.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Ministry of Information, Arts and Culture
said the 284-page book was banned under a Maldivian law that
prohibits the publication of libelous material.
</P>
<P>
The recently published book was written in the Maldivian
language, Dhivehi, by 83-year-old Abdul Hakeem Hussain Maniku.
</P>
<P>
The book, entitled "Lyye" (Yesterday), had created a storm
which initially led to the withdrawal of all copies put on sale as
many claimed that the book was not based on scholarship but on
malicious intent.
</P>
<P>
It has been described by elderly Maldivians as a "hate book."
</P>
<P>
The statement said continued public outcry about its contents
eventually prompted the government to ban the book which contains
slanderous material as well as false allegations and derogatory
language defaming past national heroes.
</P>
<P>
The book spoke about, among others, Sultan Hassan Izzuddin or
Dhon Bandarain, a national hero whose prestige had remained
untarnished for centuries.
</P>
<P>
He liberated the country from the rule of Malabaris in the 18th
century.
</P>
<P>
Others covered in the book include the first president of the
Republic of Maldives, the late Mohamed Amin Didi, and the late
former Prime Minister Abdul Majeed Didi.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Chinese President's Visit Important Opportunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said here today that the upcoming visit to the United States by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin will provide an important
opportunity for constructive work.
</P>
<P>
"President Jiang's visit is an important opportunity, not so
much for grand statements and dramatic gestures, as for
constructive work on common challenges," he told students and
faculty members at American University.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton specified such issues like easing tension on
the Korean Peninsula, stopping the spread of nuclear weapons,
protecting the environment and ending trade barriers, for the two
countries to work together.
</P>
<P>
"We want a China that works with us to build a secure and
prosperous future," he stressed, adding "America has a profound
interest in seeing that China is stable, open, at peace with its
neighbors."
</P>
<P>
The visit, scheduled for late October, will also offer a chance
"for us to address candidly and face to face our differences on
issues like human rights and religious freedom," President Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
"Sitting down together across the table is far more likely to
produce progress than pointing fingers across the Pacific," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"China is home to a quarter of the world's people. In less than
two decades, its economy may be the largest on earth," President
Clinton said, believing that if the peoples of the United States
and China can find a way to forge the future together, they both
will be better off.

<HEADLINE> Russia Encourages Bold Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia is encouraging foreign
enterprises to invest more boldly in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian First Vice-Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov made the point
Tuesday while meeting with Belgium Minister of Foreign Affairs
Eric Derycke.
</P>
<P>
During their discussion on bilateral economic and trade
relations, Nemtsov assured Derycke that Russian laws can safeguard
the security of foreign investments. So foreign enterprises had no
need to worry about their investments in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov disclosed that Russia will take further steps to draw
foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Belgium is now among the countries having the most investments
in eastern Europe. Earlier, in meeting with Gennady Seleznev, the
chairman of Russia's State Duma, Derycke said that Belgium is
optimistic about the future of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Derycke, who arrived in Moscow Monday, also exchanged views
with his Russian counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov, today about
relations between Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), and the situation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Primakov reiterated Russia's opposition to NATO's enlargement,
especially the admission of former Soviet republics. But this did
not mean Russia was also against the European Union having new
members, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Inflation Rate Estimated at 8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's inflation rate
throughout the 1997/98 fiscal year is expected not to exceed 8
percent, despite the present currency turmoil, a government
official said.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) Sugito said
here today that the ongoing currency problem, which began with the
depreciation of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar, will affect
the consumer index price. But it will not be the biggest
contributor to the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the rate for the current fiscal year
will be higher than that in the 1996/97 period.
</P>
<P>
He said the long drought, which started three months ago, will
push up the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
On the tight money policy that followed the problem of the
weakening rupiah, he said it has led to an increase in interest
rates for time deposits.
</P>
<P>
But he said it is unlikely that the ongoing monetary problems
will contribute too much to the inflation rate in the current
fiscal year, he added.

<HEADLINE> Dispute Continues Over Montenegro's Presidential Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The dispute over who should
represent the ruling party in the presidential election in
Yugoslavia's republic of Montenegro has developed into a veto game
between federal and regional authorities.
</P>
<P>
The election is scheduled for October 5, but the leadership of
the republic's ruling Socialist Democratic Party has been deeply
divided over who should be nominated to represent the party in the
election.
</P>
<P>
While one faction nominated the incumbent President Momir
Bulatovic, the other preferred the current Prime Minister Milo
Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
As the republic's election law allows only one candidate for
one party, its Constitutional Court ruled on August 14 that
Bulatovic's candidacy be disqualified.
</P>
<P>
But the federal Constitutional Court overruled the regional
court on August 27, insisting that Bulatovic's candidacy be
reinstated. The federal institution also threatened to determine
if the republic's "one candidate for one party" legal provision is
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
However, the republic's National Assembly ruled this evening
that the ruling of the federal constitutional court has no legal
force and the federal institution has no right to determine
whether the republic's legal provision concerning presidential
candidacy is constitutional.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's Capital Turned Into Modern Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Those who have never visited
Lhasa might think that the capital city of the Tibet Autonomous
Region is home to nothing but temples, religious pilgrims and
narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
But upon arrival in the city, visitors may well be taken aback
by the magnificence of the Potala Palace, as well as numerous
modern buildings, 30 m-wide streets and a TV-broadcasting tower.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, Lhasa was a small town of three
sq km in 1951, when the autonomous region was liberated
peacefully. Now, it has been built into a modern city covering 51
sq km with many modern factories, banks, hotels, shops and
apartment complexes.
</P>
<P>
Of Lhasa's 200,000 population, over 20,000 people are engaged
in private business, and several thousands of shops have opened in
the city.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the central government and other parts of the
country, Lhasa has erected modern facilities such as the Lhasa
Holiday Inn Hotel, the Tibet Guesthouse, the Foreign Trade
Building, the Tibet Stadium, and the Post and Telecom Building.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, over 28,400 sq m of residential buildings have
been built or renovated, which has increased the per-capita
housing space to over nine sq m. The running water supply now
covers 70 percent of local residents.
</P>
<P>
"Lhasa is changing too fast," said a retired Tibetan man. "Now
I cannot find many of the old places from my past."
</P>
<P>
According to Mayor Losang Jamcan, Lhasa plans to expand its
urban infrastructures even further.
</P>
<P>
This year, the city will complete a number of projects,
including low-cost apartments, the Lhasa section of the highway to
link Tibet with Sichuan Province, a large trade building, and the
renovation of a local park.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Ports Become Regional Shipping Hub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- After years of intensified
construction, a large group of ports have been built up in Xiamen,
Zhangzhou and Quanzhou cities in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The ports have emerged as a regional shipping center between
harbors in the Yangtze River Delta and the Zhujiang River Delta,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The coastline along the three cities extends 1,335 km,
including an over 100 km-long section where deepwater ports could
be built.
</P>
<P>
In ancient times, local ports played an important role in
promoting trade and economic relations with foreign countries.
The Quanzhou Port was the starting point of the Silk Road, while
Xiamen Port was one of five largest ports in old China.
</P>
<P>
Since China launched its reform and opening drive in the late
1970s, many new ports have been constructed.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the ports have a combined 151 berths, which handled
24.87 million tons of goods and 414,000 TEUs in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The ports have opened dozens of domestic and international
shipping routes including those connecting with Japan, Singapore,
the United States and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The three cities continue to make port building a key economic
task in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province is making every possible effort to build its Pearl River
Delta into one of the world's largest electronics and computer
production bases in the next five to ten years.
</P>
<P>
A team of businessmen from Guangdong, who were attending the
ongoing '97 China Investment and Trade Talks which opened Monday
in Xiamen, east China's Fujian, gave details of Guangdong's future
economic development plans.
</P>
<P>
They said that during the 1996-2000 period, a total of 48.5
billion US dollars in overseas investment is expected to be used,
19.3 percent more than that in the Eighth Five-Year Plan Period
(1991-1995), and priority will be given to a group of hi-tech
projects.
</P>
<P>
As early as in 1993, Guangdong shifted its economic focus to
hi-tech industry development, including electronic information,
bio-engineering, new materials development, mechanical and
electronical integration and energy, and now the Pearl River Delta
has become a production base of electronic products and computers,
</P>
<P>
Last year, the output value of 1,850 hi-tech products reached
95 billion yuan, amounting for 8.6 percent of the region's gross
value of industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong now has six state-level hi-tech development regions,
including Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, Foshan and
Huizhou, which have been among the country's top 18, said the
business delegation.
</P>
<P>
And of the country's first group of key hi-tech programs and
leading enterprises, about 20 percent are from Guangdong, the
State Scientific Commission has announced.

Minister Fatos Nano said here today that his government is
launching a "new diplomatic offensive" which will focus on
promoting cooperation between Albania and European organizations.
</P>
<P>
Nano, who arrived here earlier today on a visit to Austria and
the Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), told a press conference that the new coalition
government of Albania will work closely with the OSCE and the
European Union to guarantee human rights and civil freedoms in the
chaos-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government will also cooperate with the European
bodies to ensure that power can no longer be abused in this Balkan
nation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Later, Nano conferred Albania's highest honor, the Skanderbeg
award, on former Austrian chancellor Franz Vranitzky who acted as
the OSCE special envoy to Albania and made great contributions to
the restoration of peace in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Albania began sinking into chaos earlier this year, which was
triggered by the collapse of pyramid investment schemes in which
hundreds of thousands people lost money.
</P>
<P>
Nano became new prime minister of a five-party coalition
government at the end of June in a general election organized in
large part by the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
Nano held talks with Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel later in the day but no details are available so far.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian prime minister will meet Austrian National Council
President Heinz Fischer on Wednesday before leaving for Brussels
to continue his European tour.

</P>
<P>

The Manila Times

WASHINGTON -- The productivity of American workers grew at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.7 percent in the second
quarter, the fastest rate in three and an half years, U.S. Labor
Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The gain was much faster than the initially estimated 0.6
percent reported last month and nearly double the 1.4 percent rate
of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
LUANDA -- The opposition National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) has pledged to continue observing
the Lusaka peace agreement to bring final peace to Angola, a UN
envoy said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Returning from Andulo, a central Angolan city, where he met
UNITA leaders, the United Nations special envoy based in Angola
Blondin Beye told reporters that he formally presented the UN
Security Council Resolution No. 1127 on economic sanctions against
UNITA to its leadership.
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- The next 25 years will witness an unprecedented
boost in the prominence of developing countries in the world
economy, and five of those nations are likely to change the world
economic map, the World Bank predicted.
</P>
<P>
In its 114-page report "Global Economic Prospects and the
Developing Countries 1997" released here today, the World Bank
said policy reforms and a broadly favorable international economic
environment could allow developing countries to grow between 5 to
6 percent between now and 2020, raising their share of world
output from around one-sixth to nearly one third over the period.
</P>
<P>
The growing importance of developing economies will be
reflected in, and driven by, the emergence of the "Big Five" --
China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and Russia -- which now account
for half of the world's labor force but only 8 to 10 percent of
its output and trade. Given continued policy reforms and the
strengthening of an open world trade and investment regime, the
report projected, these figures could double by 2020, with
substantial repercussions for global resource allocation,
production, trade and also pricing.
</P>
<P>
ISLAMABAD -- Pakistani President Farooq Leghari said here
Wednesday that his country fully supported the ongoing UN efforts
for bringing about durable peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was keenly interested in the cessation of hostilities
and restoration of peace and stability in the war-torn country,
Leghari told visiting Omani Foreign Minister Yousef bin Alawi, who
 called on him at the presidential palace Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
MOSCOW -- A Russian space official said Wednesday the crew of
the Mir space station has repaired the main on-board computer
which failed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The function of the gyroscopic devices, which keep the
station's solar panels in line with the sun to enable them to
generate power, was resumed. The devices failed Monday after the
computer failure.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Strengthens Quality Control on Products, Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of
Shanghai plans to upgrade the quality of major homemade industrial
products to international standards and to form several
technology-intensive transnational corporations by 2010.
</P>
<P>
In a recently-issued long-term plan on improvement of products
and service quality, the city government has decided to put more
efforts on quality control rather than merely increasing outputs
in a bid to hone the competitive edge of major industries in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Take cars and elevators, for example. The warrantied
trouble-free driving distance for Shanghai-made cars in 2000
should reach 60,000 km, yet elevators by that year are only
allowed two breakdowns in 60,000 operations.
</P>
<P>
For other products shown to have high consumer interest, the
plan said that 99 percent of major durable electrical appliances
should be operate smoothly as soon as they are removed from the
box, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
As the second step, the long-term plan stipulates that all
major products manufactured by local industries in 2010 should
meet the international criteria.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the quality of local cars should reach the
internationally-acknowledged standards in terms of gas consumption
and emission reduction.
</P>
<P>
The functions and power consumption of Shanghai-made electrical
appliances were also required to meet the needs of the overseas
consumers.

<HEADLINE> Smooth Sailing in Hong Kong, Says U.S. Senator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- United States Senator Craig
Thomas said today that things have gone smoothly in Hong Kong
since China resumed the exercise of its sovereignty in July.
</P>
<P>
Thomas made the remarks after a meeting between nine members of
the 15-member Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Tung Chee
Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
"I was very impressed with his observations with regard to what
has happened since the changeover," Thomas told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Things have gone smoothly."
</P>
<P>
Thomas chairs the Subcommittee of East Asian and Pacific
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the briefing, Tung said they had "a very
useful discussion, where we all understand each other's position."
</P>
<P>
Tung, who is on a four-day visit to the U.S., told reporters
that he explained to the senators about "the transition, about
what happened since the transition."
</P>
<P>
Some legislators were concerned that there might be a change of
course following China's resumption of the exercise of Hong Kong's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In a luncheon speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Tung said
that the political structure in Hong Kong is functioning normally
and effectively while the lifestyle has been maintained since the
transition.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Tung and the senators also discussed the
election next year in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"I have explained to them that we are moving forward in
accordance to the basic law, and we are moving forward in what we
think is very important to Hong Kong, and is in the long-term
interest of Hong Kong," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that there are differences between him and the
senators. "Obviously you can understand that given the different
history, different culture, we all have different beliefs," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tung, who arrived here on Monday, will leave for New York on
Thursday following meetings with U.S. congressmen on Wednesday and
a luncheon sponsored by the Asian Society. He will return on
Friday for a meeting with President Bill Clinton at the White
House.

<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and China
have signed up to a project to reduce health hazards for Chinese
women workers, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The project, involving a grant of 960,000 US dollars from the
UN Development Program (UNDP) and one million yuan (120,000 US
dollars) from the Chinese government, will last from 1997 to 2000,
the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women leaders, including mayors and managers of
township and village enterprises at municipal and county level
will be the main beneficiaries of the projects, the paper reveals.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women workers have been exposed to production hazards
for a long time. Reports have poured in recently on the death or
injury of women workers across the country, especially in the
south where the economy is developing briskly, the paper says.

NEW YORK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Smaller-company stocks on
Wall Street advanced to another record high on Tuesday, but
efforts to revive the blue-chip sector failed again.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-7 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 502.11 million shares
as against Monday's modest tally of 466.44 million.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Second Annual Arrangement Under ESAF for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved the second annual arrangement for
Burkina Faso under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF), in an amount of 18 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The funding is provided in a support of the government's
economic program covering July 1, 1997 to June 30, 1998. The loan
is made available in two equal semiannual installments, the first
of which can be drawn on September 15, this year.
</P>
<P>
The economic program for 1997-98 focuses on achieving a further
increase in the budgetary revenue to GDP ratio and an acceleration
of structural reforms. The major objectives include a real GDP
growth rate above 6 percent, contain the inflation rate at 3
percent and reduce the external current account deficit to 10.5
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting member
countries that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments and improve their growth
prospects. The loans carry an interest rate of 0.5 percent a year
and are repayable over 10 years, with a 5.5 year grace period.
</P>
<P>
Burkina Faso joined the IMF in May 1963. Its quota is about 60
million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF financing currently
totals about 85 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Hits Two-week Low Against yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar suffered its
worst one-day drop against the yen in a month on Tuesday, but rose
against the mark as prospects for higher German interest rates
dimmed.
</P>
<P>
The dollar sharply reversed its recent rally against the yen
after U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers was quoted
as saying Washington is worried Japan will rely too heavily on
exports to revive its economy, which would further widen its trade
surplus.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 118.93 yen,
down 2 percent from 121.17 late Monday. It was the biggest drop
since a 3 percent slide on August 9.
</P>
<P>
Also in New York, the dollar settled at 1.8135 marks, up from
1.8068.
</P>
<P>
The British pound was quoted at 1.5881 U.S. dollars, up from
1.5820 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Against the mark, the dollar was bolstered by German
unemployment unexpectedly hitting its highest level for August
since World War II. The report was seen as evidence that Germany's
economy is not growing fast enough to call for an interest-rate
hike by its central bank.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday:
1.4885 Swiss francs, up from 1.4840; 6.0965 French francs, up from
6.0760; 1,766.00 Italian lire, up from 1,759.00; and 1.3839
Canadian dollars, up from 1.3827.

<P>
OTTAWA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A young Canadian sprinter has
been banned for four years for testing positive for steroids, the
Athletics Canada announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Derek Dueck, who finished sixth in the 100
meters at the Canada Summer Games last month, was tested positive
for testosterone and epitestosterone, the Canadian national
governing body of track and field said.
</P>
<P>
But Dueck said he didn't take any banned substances and would
appeal to the decision.
</P>
<P>
Dueck argued that the abnormal levels of testosterone were "due
to a (legal) drug I was taking for medical purposes".
</P>
<P>
Dueck said he and his specialist consulted the banned substance
list before a prescription was written.

<P>
NEW YORK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A leading U.S. superconductor
company today announced the first sale of its superconducting
magnetic energy storage device to a foreign customer.
</P>
<P>
The power quality system was produced by American Superconductor
Corp. (AMSC) and purchased by Eskom, Africa's largest electricity
supplier and one of the five largest utilities in the world, AMSC
said in a press release from Baltimore, Md.
</P>
<P>
The device was installed at the South Africa Pulp and Paper
Industry paper mill located in Stanger, South Africa, it said.
</P>
<P>
The sale came after the first commercial launch of the
superconductor product sold to a U.S. customer in June.
</P>
<P>
The products protect industrial manufacturing operations from
the momentary voltage dips common to electric power systems.
</P>
<P>
"The cost of downtime associated with momentary outages and
voltage dips lasting less than one second is more than 12 billion
U.S. dollars per year in the United States alone, and accounts for
80 and 90 percent of all plant shutdowns related to power
quality," AMSC president Greg Yurek was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
AMSC, based in Westborough, Mass. and founded in 1987, leads
superconductor research and development for commercial use in the
global electric power industry.

<HEADLINE> 7-Up Change Flavor to Challenge Sprite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The maker of 7-Up is changing
its flavor to make it less sweet and give it a crisper taste --
that is, more like market leader Sprite, according to the reports
of local press here.
</P>
<P>
Marketed in the late 60s as "the Uncola," 7-Up rocketed in
sales. But in the past decade, 7-Up has been losing market share
to Coca-Cola Co.-owned Sprite and now holds only 40 percent of the
lemon-lime drink category.
</P>
<P>
Dr Pepper/Seven Up, the beverage maker, will announce the
flavor change next Monday in San Antonio, a source close to the
company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mike Martin, a spokesman for Dr Pepper/Seven Up in Dallas, said
the company had no comment.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported that one person who has tasted
the drink said the product "is a nice improvement and has more of
a lemon-lime taste." Others familiar with the plans said the
product received a positive response from consumers and 7-Up
bottlers during taste testing.
</P>
<P>
Reformulating soft drinks can be risky. Coca-Cola fooled with
Coke in 1985 and protests quickly forced it to bring back the old
flavor under the name Coca-Coca Classic.
</P>
<P>
7-Up has been around for nearly 70 years, starting out in 1929
in St. Louis. Its maker, the Howdy Corp., soon shortened the name
to 7UP Lithiated Lemon Soda.
</P>
<P>
Howdy changed its name to The Seven-Up Co. in 1936, and by the
late 1940s 7-Up had become the world's third best-selling soft
drink. Prior to the early 1980s, 7-Up was the unquestioned leader
in the lemon-lime beverage segment.
</P>
<P>
However, Coca-Cola has been aggressively pushing Sprite for the
last several years, and gaining much of the market shares. 7-Up's
market share declined to 2.4 percent in 1996 from 3.2 percent in
1987.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, Sprite captured a 5.8 percent share of the 54
billion U.S. dollar soft-drink market, according to the report.

WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
approved a 45 million U.S. dollar equivalent of a Structural
Adjustment Credit and a 55 million dollar Structural Adjustment
Loan to back Moldova's economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
The financing will be used to support government reforms
necessary to create conditions for a resumption of growth and an
improvement in living standards in Moldova.
</P>
<P>
It will also provide necessary foreign exchange to purchase
imports critical for the country's economic activity. The reform
program supported by the World Bank credit and loan will address
key bottlenecks and enhance the prospects of long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be channeled through the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary
lending arm for developing countries, on standard IDA terms and
will be payable in 35 years, including a 10 year grace period.
</P>
<P>
Since Moldova joined the World Bank in 1992, the Bank
commitments have totaled some 257 million dollars for 9 projects in
the country.

<HEADLINE> US Government to Allow Electronic Tax Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Seeking to boost electronic
filing of tax returns, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
said today it also plans to allow Americans to pay the taxes they
owe electronically in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Acting IRS Commissioner Michael Dolan said that taxpayers could
permit the Automated Clearing House, a computerized bank payments
system, to transfer money from their checking accounts to pay
their tax bills. The IRS now allows direct deposit of tax refunds
through a similar electronic payment system.
</P>
<P>
Dolan made the announcement at a hearing of the Ways and Means
oversight subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives. The
hearing was held on ways to improve electronic filing of tax
returns, which a recent IRS study commission said was a key
element of reform for the tax collection agency.
</P>
<P>
Of the 118 million individual tax returns filed this year, only
19.1 million were filed either through computers or a special
touch-tone telephone filing program, the U.S. Treasury Department
said.
</P>
<P>
And despite the explosive growth of personal computers and
online services, just 366,000 taxpayers filed their taxes
electronically using their home computers and tax preparation
software.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Treasury Department said more than 60 million
taxpayers could have had their returns filed electronically this
year because they were prepared on computers by tax preparers but
filed on paper, not through computer modems.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Asian Americans Incidents Rising, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Hate crimes against Asian
Americans rose 17 percent last year despite a drop in overall
violence in the United States, according to a report released
today by a national civil rights group.
</P>
<P>
The report, by the National Asian Pacific American Legal
Consortium, said there were 534 suspected and confirmed anti-Asian
incidents in 1996, up from 458 in 1995. They included two murders,
two bomb threats, an arson attack and many types of harassment.
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, California, last year, a Vietnamese American
was stabbed repeatedly while in-line skating on a high school
tennis court. Two assailants affiliated with white supremacist
group were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Racial motivation was confirmed in 90 percent of the cases and
suspected in the rest, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The consortium said the social environment was hostile toward
Asian Americans, who number 9.7 million, about 3.7 percent of the
overall population.
</P>
<P>
"Asian Pacific Americans remained the 'perpetual foreigner' and
were denied fair political access, social acceptance and equal
opportunity in American life," it said.
</P>
<P>
It cited many cases of racist slogans, hate mail and abusive
telephone calls directed at Asian Americans seeking political
office.
</P>
<P>
After a leader of the Organization of Chinese Americans
appeared on NBC's "Today Show," she received a hate message from
an unknown caller: "You know you people are lucky we let you stay
in this country. You dumb gooks should all be sent back to China."
</P>
<P>
The group attributed the increase in anti-Asian incidents to a
general anti-immigrant atmosphere spurred by last year's passage
of a restrictive immigration reform bill, welfare legislation
denying benefits to legal immigrants, and a "general anti-minority
rhetoric" that intensified during the 1996 election year.
</P>
<P>
Executives of the organization are scheduled to meet Attorney
General Janet Reno today to discuss ways to address the issue as
part of a White House conference on hate crimes in November.
</P>
<P>
The report called for tougher federal action to deter, monitor
and prosecute hate crimes.

<HEADLINE> IMF Considers Adding Capital Account Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Against the background of a
recovery in world economic growth and of increasing globalization,
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says to consider adding the
capital account liberalization as a goal.
</P>
<P>
In its 284-page Annual Report 1997, which is released here
today, the IMF noted that a great progress has been made by many
industrial and developing countries as well as transition
economies within the context of an increasingly close integration
of markets for goods, services and capital. The growing economic
interdependence of countries worldwide presented both new
opportunities and new challenges, accentuating the benefits of
good policies and the costs of bad policies.
</P>
<P>
In facing the challenges posed by growing economic integration,
the report said, the IMF acted to review further its surveillance
operations, including in the areas of banking soundness, data
dissemination, and good governance, to adapt its financial
instruments and procedures, and to examine the adequacy of its
quota resources.
</P>
<P>
In another significant development, the Interim Committee of
the IMF's Board of Governors, meeting in April 1997, endorsed the
concept of an amendment to the Articles of Agreement that would
make the promotion of capital account liberalization one of the
purposes of the IMF and give the IMF appropriate jurisdiction over
capital movements.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996/97 which ended on April 30, the IMF approved 28
new Stand-By, Extended and Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF) arrangements, totaling SDR 5.3 billion, which is equivalent
to more than 7.1 billion U.S. dollars in new commitments, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that this represented a big decline in the demand
for IMF resources as compared with commitments of SDR 19.7 billion
(some 27 billion dollars) in 1995/96 and SDR 16.6 billion (about
23 billion dollars) in 1994/95. Total IMF credit outstanding at
the end of the year was SDR 40.5 billion which is some 55.3
billion dollars equivalent, a slight decline from the level of SDR
42.0 billion a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Assures US on Hong Kong's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa reassured here today U.S. business leaders and political
figures that Hong Kong will maintain its momentum of development
after it returned to China's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote address to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in
Washington D.C.,Tung said:"I can assure you that Hong Kong will
continue to manage its economy with the lightest and most steady
of hands, sticking firm to free markets, small government, low
taxes and fiscal prudence."
</P>
<P>
He said that he was completely confident about Hong Kong's
future because the Basic Law has given the Special Administrative
Region (SAR)"full autonomy."
</P>
<P>
"The Basic Law gives us far more than financial autonomy. Apart
from foreign affairs and defense, it gives us full responsibility
to maintain our own economic and social systems; our own legal
system; our own system of government; our religious freedoms,
press freedom and civil liberties," said the chief executive who
arrived here Monday for a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for Tung to visit the United States since
he took office as chief executive at the end of 156 years of
British colonial rule. He said he would try to convince the
Americans of Hong Kong's continued stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong returned to China's sovereignty on July 1. It was a
"date to which we in Hong Kong had looked forward with pride and
confidence," Tung said, in an apparent effort to ease worries by
some Americans.
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to speak for Hong Kong, but how others perceive our
country, China, has quite an impact on us," said the chief
executive, commenting on American media's negative coverage of
Hong Kong and China.
</P>
<P>
speaking highly of the "one country two systems", a brainchild
of China, Tung said:"The Central Government has given us an
entirely free hand in dealing with our own affairs and developing
our economic, social and cultural relations."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that "The success of Hong Kong under
'one country two systems' will serve as a significant step toward
the greater and final objective of reunification of the entire
Chinese nation."
</P>
<P>
Apparently responding to alleged setback on democracy in Hong
Kong, Tung said:" In seven years time we will have more democracy
in Hong Kong than we did under 156 years of colonial rule."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has never had a single voice in the selection of the
Governor during 156 years of colonial rule. Under the Basic Law,
Hong Kong people will have an increasingly larger voice in the
selection of the Chief Executive," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung also highlighted the already strong economic links between
Hong Kong and America and how increased Sino-U.S. trade would also
be good for the SAR.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 U.S. citizens live in Hong Kong and 414 U.S.
companies have regional headquarters there, while 29 U.S. banks
and financial services groups manage over 100 billion U.S. dollars
in loans, debt and assets.
</P>
<P>
" A point that everyone in Hong Kong profits from is the fact
that the U.S. and China make a good economic fit," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Around 60 percent of U.S. trade with China passes through Hong
Kong, while the direct Hong Kong - U.S. trade totals 22.4 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tung is scheduled to meet some U.S. Congressmen by Wednesday.
He is going to meet with President Bill Clinton Friday before
leaving for home.

<HEADLINE> Holland to Have Bigger Population in Future: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands, which has a
population of over 15.5 million people but only an area of less
than 42,000 square kilometers, will become even more crowded in
the next few decades, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that the population will have grown to about
17.2 million by 2030, but numbers will probably start to go down
after that year, says a report published by the Dutch Ministry of
Education, Culture and Science.
</P>
<P>
Before long, international migration will be the most important
reason for the rising population, which will also mean a
strengthening of the multi-cultural character of Dutch society,
according to the report entitled Population Issues in the
Netherlands 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands has one of the youngest populations in Europe,
which means potential for further growth through births. The
report says that the growth will persist for longer than in the
rest of the European Union even though the pace has slackened off
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
By around 2020, the aging of the Dutch population will mean
that births and deaths will balance one another. After this, the
number of deaths will overtake the number of births, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
It also says that the continued growth of the population will
then be entirely due to international migration. At present,
migration accounts for more than 20 percent of the annual growth
of 0.5 percent in the population.
