<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Remittances Up, Forex Reserves Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The remittances by the
Bangladeshi expatriates increased to 1.95 billion U.S. dollars in
the financial year 1999-2000, 14.24 percent up from the previous
year, an official from the Central Bangladesh Bank said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The remittances in the 1998-1999 sent by over three million
Bangladeshis working abroad was 1.7 billion dollars, the official
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Most of the remittances come from the Middle Eastern countries,
the United States and Britain. The official hoped that the country
's foreign exchange earnings from remittance would shot up as many
more Bangladeshis are getting jobs abroad, mainly in Malaysia and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The official justified his optimism of increased remittances,
noting that the Malaysian government agreed to take more
Bangladeshis during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to the
country last month. At present 380,000 Bangladeshis are working in
Malaysia alone.
</P>
<P>
South Korean firms would soon start recruiting about 10,000
Bangladeshi workers, the official added. South Korea had sent
back home thousands of Bangladeshi workers at the time of economic
slump the country suffered due to fall in value of its currency.
</P>
<P>
Of the Bangladeshis working abroad, there are 1.27 million
unskilled workers, 0.63 million semi-skilled and 0.11 million
professionals. Saudi Arabia is the largest employer of Bangladeshi
unskilled workers.
</P>
<P>
But the official, however, said the foreign exchange reserve of
the country fell to 1.5 billion dollars at the end of August from
1.7 billion dollars a month before.
</P>
<P>
The increasing demand for foreign currencies, compounded with
the decreasing foreign exchange reserve, has forced the
Bangladeshi government to devaluate its currency last month for
six percent, from 51 taka against one dollar to 54 taka against
one dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, the exchange rate on the kerb market is more than 57
taka against one dollar, much lower than the official rate,
predicting the possibility of further devaluation of the currency.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Embassy Denies Report on Saddam's Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DHAKA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Embassy of the Republic of
Iraq in Dhaka Tuesday refuted report that President Saddam Hussein
has cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy for lymph cancer.
</P>
<P>
"The embassy would like to clarify that this news is fake,
untrue and baseless and also assured that President Saddam Hussein
is in good health now and is running his presidential duties very
well," the embassy said in a statement released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The embassy would like to assure that this fake news can be
the framework of the offensive campaign against Iraq and its
president," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The report about President Saddam Hussein's health condition
was circulated on Sunday by a western wire service from Dubai.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a London-based Arabic-language daily as
saying that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is undergoing
chemotherapy for lymph cancer and a family council led by his
younger son is ready to take control if he dies.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi-financed daily quoted an Arab doctor "with an
excellent reputation" as saying a medical team of three French
doctors, one German and one Swede were taking care of Saddam.

<HEADLINE> More Than 200,000 Child Laborers in S. Africa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 JOHANNESBURG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- There are more than
200,000 child laborers in South Africa, most of them young
Mozambican refugees working on commercial farms in Mpumalanga and
Northern Province for food and lodging.
</P>
<P>
 South African Wits University researcher Dudu Dlamini told
the 13th International Conference on Child Abuse and Neglect in
Durban Tuesday that children as young as eight were forced to work
on farms due to domestic reasons. Many were HIV/Aids orphans and
working as farm laborers offers their only hope for survival.
</P>
<P>
He said those who earn money are sometimes only paid about 12
rand (about 1.7 U.S. dollar) a day for a ten-hour shift, in which
they basically do the work of adults.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini said there has been a constant flow of children
seeking work on farms at Komatipoort, on the border between South
Africa and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
In many instances children who grow up on farms are forced to
work to earn their keep, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers do not want the children in the farms if they are not
working, even though their parents live on the farms," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini said these children are not provided with education or
health facilities and sometimes live under appalling conditions,
especially in cases where they have arrived on the farms without
adults accompanying them.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the child workers are not provided with
homes, and have to live in self-built shacks which do not protect
them from the elements. In many cases no blankets or mattresses
are provided and the children sleep on cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
According to Dlamini, the minimum wage for children is about
80 rand (about 11 U.S. dollars) per month, while the maximum wage
is just over 200 rand (about 29 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Dlamini said the main concern of the research was that child
labor is a violation of children's rights and deprives them of
their right to education and good health.
</P>
<P>
"We are also concerned about the failure by the government to
protect and promote the rights of child laborers," Dlamini said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Lawmaker Says No Concession on Sovereignty of Gulf Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- An influential member of Iran's
Majlis (parliament) here on Wednesday claimed the Gulf islands of
Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs are inseparable parts of
Iran's territory and Tehran will never make concessions on them.
</P>
<P>
Iran has a long-standing dispute with the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) over the sovereignty of the islands, which are located near
the strategic Hormuz Strait and have been controlled by Iran since
the withdrawal of British colonists from the Gulf in 1971.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has long sought support from its Gulf and Arab allies
over the islands. At its request, the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) and the Arab League expressed backing for the UAE over the
island dispute in their separate foreign ministerial meetings
recently.
</P>
<P>
In response to this, Mohsen Mirdamadi, head of the Majlis
National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, said the
statements of the GCC and AL can not change the fate of the
islands, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The status of Iran in the region and the world is so strong
that the policies adopted by the UAE would lead nowhere," the
Iranian politician claimed.
</P>
<P>
He also alleged that some Arab officials have in private
acknowledged Iran's sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
Mirdamadi reiterated Iran's stance that the "misunderstanding"
on the islands is a bilateral issue and should not be taken up at
international and regional circles. He urged the UAE to enter into
direct contacts with Iran to settle the problem.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi
also repeated Iran's claim to the complete sovereignty over the
three islands, expressing "dismay" over the stances of the GCC and
the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Iran has claimed that it is willing for direct talks to resolve
the "misunderstanding" between the two countries. But the UAE wants
a clear agenda and a specific timetable for talks, and suggests
referring the dispute to international arbitration if negotiations
fail.
</P>
<P>
After years of mutual suspicion caused by the 1979 Islamic
revolution in Iran, Iran has been trying to improve relations with
neighboring Arab countries in the GCC, namely the UAE, Saudi
Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait. But the islands issue
remains a stumbling block for a smooth development of relations.
</P>
<P>
In July 1999, a GCC committee comprising foreign ministers of
Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman was set up to mediate and help open
negotiations between the UAE and Iran. Iran pays no heed to the GCC
committee and insists on solving the dispute with the UAE through
bilateral means.
</P>
<P>
So far the committee has achieved little, which is a
disappointment to the UAE.

<HEADLINE> Over 9.5 Million Tanzanian Voters Registered for General Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 6 (Xinhua) --Over 9.5 million
Tanzanians have registered for the upcoming general elections to
be held on October 29, representing over 95 percent of the
targeted 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
A senior official in the National Electoral Commission (NEC),
who declined to be named, said here on Wednesday that the
registration was a big success compared with the first multi party
elections in 1995 for which only 8.9 million people, representing
81 percent of the targeted population were registered.
</P>
<P>
The 9.5 million is the total number of registered voters on the
Tanzanian mainland and the semi-autonomous Zanzibar Region. Voter
registration in the mainland was conducted between August 8 and 28,
while in the Zanzibar Isles, it was held between August 8 and 21.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar Electoral Commission announced last week that 446,727
people, out of the expected 455,145 were registered, making the
Indian Ocean Isles attain a record 98.2 percent voter registration
rate.
</P>
<P>
The would-be voters are expected to elect the Tanzanian Union
President, members of parliament and councilors. In Zanzibar, they
will have additional task of electing Zanzibar President and
members of the House of Representatives in the Isles.
</P>
<P>
All the 13 fully-registered political parties are expected to
participate in the second multi-party elections.
</P>
<P>
The four contestants to join the presidential race are Benjamin
Mkapa, of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), Augustine Mrema of
the Tanzanian Labor Party (TLP), Professor Ibrahim Lipumba of
Civic United Front (CUF) and John Cheyo of the United Democratic
Party (UDP).
</P>
<P>
They are the same contestants for the 1995 elections, the first
under the multiparty system in which Mkapa won by collecting 61
percent of the votes.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Asserts Palestinian Rights to East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat told the world leaders on Wednesday that he is
committed to establishing a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem
as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the U.N. Millennium Summit which opened this
morning at the U.N. headquarters in New York, Arafat said "We
remain committed to our national rights over East Jerusalem,
capital of our state and shelter of our sacred sites, as well as
our rights on the Christian and Islamic holy sites."
</P>
<P>
Arafat said Palestinians had already made painful compromises
for peace by agreeing to establish a state "on less than a quarter
of the historical territory of Palestine."
</P>
<P>
"We have made a strategic decision committing ourselves to the
peace process, offering significant and painful concessions in
order to arrive at a reasonable compromise acceptable to both
sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian Central Council will determine this matter
within the next few days, taking into account U.N. resolutions and
our people's right to self-determination through the establishment
of its independent state," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
"We shall be cooperating with the U.N. and the other parties
involved at present in the 55th session of the General Assembly,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem is thought to be the biggest stumbling
block in the peace process. Palestinians want East Jerusalem,
which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War and regards as
its eternal capital, as the capital of a state they say they will
establish was early as September 13.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the summit, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
urged world leaders to oppose a unilateral declaration of a
Palestinian state which he said could "obliterate the prospects of
peace."

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Squabble Over Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Dispute between U.S.
Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush and his Democratic
rival Al Gore over debates went deeper Wednesday as they stick to
each other's schedules.
</P>
<P>
Texas Governor Bush said Wednesday that he would not change his
mind about the presidential debates while Vice President Gore
insisted that the candidates must first accept three widely
telecast debates sponsored by the bipartisan Commission on
Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who has rejected the commission's proposal for three
formal debates, is pushing his own plan for two joint appearances
on TV interview shows and one formal debate.
</P>
<P>
Bush said that he would show up on September 13 for the first
of the joint interviews hosted by NBC even if Gore would not
attend.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the hour-long forum hosted by NBC, Bush has agreed
to another joint appearance moderated by CNN talk show host Larry
King
</P>
<P>
Bush also unveiled a new ad Wednesday saying Gore's stance on
debate proved him untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
Gore, meanwhile, said that he would agree to additional joint
appearances with Bush only after Bush accepts the three formal
debates.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to play games to try to substitute a talk show
for the national bipartisan commission debates," Gore said on ABC'
s "Good Morning America."
</P>
<P>
Gore has accepted the commission's proposal for three 90-
minute debates that would be carried by all major television
networks while Bush wants only one of the three.

MOSCOW, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Slovakia discussed
the possible construction of a gas pipeline through Slovakia, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The suggested pipeline is intended to bypass Ukraine and
transport Russian gas to Europe, Interfax reported, quoting a

</P>
<P>
"Discussion of the construction of a gas pipeline to join main
pipelines crossing Slovakia and Poland was a major item," the
official said.
</P>

Russia accuses Ukraine of siphoning several billion cubic
meters of gas passing its territory each year.
</P>
<P>
The Slovakian side showed significant interest in the
construction of the pipeline and has already announced that it
will place great importance on its installation, the official said.

<HEADLINE> New Somalian President Ends Decade of Isolation at U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The new Somalian
president Wednesday was among more than 160 heads of state or
government to attend the Millennium Summit, which kicked off here
Wednesday, ending more than a decade of diplomatic isolation for
his country.
</P>
<P>
Abdiqassim Salad Hassan, elected a week ago by a parliament
operating out of the neighboring Red Sea State of Djibouti,
swiftly called on the United Nations and the global community to
let "bygones be bygones" and provide rehabilitation funds for
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The Somali flag was allowed to fly at the United Nations for
the first time in 10 years as Salad prepared for his speech before
the Millennium Summit Friday. He arrived in New York Tuesday to
attend the three-day summit.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been without a central government since 1991, when
former dictator Mohammed Siad Barre was ousted and the country
crumbled amid civil war, as clan-based factions carved out rival
fiefdoms.
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old Salad, who served as a minister in the
government of Barre, apologized to the United Nations for the
bloody clashes between U.N. peacekeepers and Somalis in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"Mistakes were made on both sides but I would like to apologize
to the United Nations and the world for the errors committed by
Somalis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Somalia was a focus of U.N. peacekeeping operations from 1992
to 1995 aimed at establishing a safe environment for humanitarian
aid for the African country ravaged by famine and civil war.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Air Defenses Hit U.S. Plane: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 6 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi military spokesman
said here that Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery shot one of the "
invading U.S. warplanes" Wednesday afternoon, but it managed to
escape.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that this happened when Iraqi air defenses
challenged the aggressing U.S. and British planes over Iraqi south
no-fly zone. The planes made 40 armed sorties from their bases in
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. he said.
</P>
<P>
The air restricted zone, along with another in northern Iraq,
were imposed by U.S.-led western alliance after the 1991 Gulf War
for a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds and Shi'ite Muslims "from
persecution of the Iraqi government."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has never recognized the two restricted zones, saying they
lack explicit authorization from the U.N. Security Council, and has
regularly fired at patrolling U.S. and British aircraft since the
joint U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Yassin Jasim, major general of the Iraqi Air Defense Command,
has said that Iraq shot down one American plane in southern Iraq on
July 26.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraq has shot down more than 10 U.S. and British
planes. "We have evidence to prove that," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Should Act on Principles of Charter: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides Wednesday night expressed the belief that the United
Nations should act on the principles of its Charter and called for
the respect and implementation of Security Council resolutions, the
Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the Millennium Assembly in New
York, Clerides cited the case of Cyprus as a "flagrant example" of
the non-implementation of General Assembly and Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He underlined this constitutes an affront to the international
community and an example of the prevalence of impunity.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriots-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island after a failed coup
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunify the island on a
bi-communal federation formula, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
Clerides also spoke of the new efforts made to solve the Cyprus
issue and reassured that he will participate in the new round of U.
N.-sponsored proximity talks "with goodwill and determination to
find a just and viable solution within the parameters established
by the U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus have
been held to find a solution. A new round is due to start on
September 12 in New York.
</P>
<P>
"While one often sees the tendency of pursuing a 'pragmatic'
approach for the settlement of disputes, nevertheless it is our
firm belief that the U.N. should always act based on the solid
foundation of the principles of its Charter," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that this kind of approach will gain the
confidence of its members with regard to its objectivity and
fairness and lead to permanent solutions, noting that the U.N.
should be a "beacon of hope for small states."
</P>
<P>
Clerides stressed that U.N. resolutions must be respected and
implemented to safeguard international legality so that "the
concept of collective security will sink deeply into our collective
consciousness and find its practical application in the full
respect of the principles of the U.N. Charter."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained a strong military presence in northern
Cyprus since 1974. It has so far refused to comply with U.N.
resolutions calling for its withdrawal from the island.

<HEADLINE> Berri to Compete for Reappointment of Lebanese Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Parliament Speaker
Nabih Berri announced Wednesday that he will pursue the
reappointment of the speaker in the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
Berri expressed in a news conference his thanks to the
electorates in south Lebanon and said, "there is no loser in the
elections".
</P>
<P>
The Amal movement, headed by Berri, and its ally Hezbollah won
all 23 seats in the South electorate in the just-concluded
parliamentary election in which ex-premier Rafik Hariri's camp won
a landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
Amal and Hezbollah had been actively fighting against the
Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon until the Israelis
totally withdrew from the area in May.
</P>
<P>
"The coalition with Hezbollah is not just in elections, but a
political cooperation in the parliament life," Berri said.
</P>
<P>
Berri vowed to accelerate the compensation issue in the southern
and western Bekaa and border areas for those who suffered damages
during Israel's occupation in a bid to begin reconstruction in
those
regions.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to compile and submit compensation files to the
U.N. against Israel for the casualties, property damage, stolen
heritage and environmental demolition.
</P>
<P>
Berri said they will consider issuing new regulations to
expedite services and public construction and enhance agriculture
and industry in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question of the line-up of the new government,
Berri said, "it is too early to talk about that and every thing
will be clear in its due time".
</P>
<P>
The speaker also ruled out the possibility of nationalization of
the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. "If we can do that, why did we

fight with Israel for two decades?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, which has taken in 367,000 Palestinian refugees,
objects to any efforts to settle them inside Lebanon. Beirut
supports the right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
The power in Lebanon is equally divided on sectarian line, with
the president coming from Maronite Christians, the speaker from
Shi'ite Muslims and the prime minister from Sunni Muslims. So is
the case in Lebanese parliament and the 128 seats are divided in
equal parts between Muslims and Christians and the shares are
further sub-divided among the 18 recognized religious sects.
</P>
<P>
The current parliament will be dismissed on October 17 and the
new speaker will elected on the same day.

the Black Sea Union held in the Turkish capital Ankara on September
5 and 6.
</P>
<P>

municipality, the participant countries submitted proposals for the
enhancement of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting adopted a proposal submitted by Ankara Mayor Melih
Gokcek to set up an Internet site for communication in this regard.
</P>
<P>

of Athens in 2001 with the subject "smuggling, and struggle against
organized crime and natural disaster."

<HEADLINE> Kabila Seeks Mkapa's Intervention in Ceasing Conflict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- President Laurent Kabila
of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) urged his Tanzanian
counterpart to search for new ways to revive the crumbling peace
process in his nation, Africa's third largest country.
</P>
<P>
This appeal was passed by a special envoy of Kabila to
President Benjamin Mkapa Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The DRC Human Rights Minister, She Okitundu, said during his
meeting with Mkapa in the State House that Kabila believed that
Mkapa could exert a powerful influence on parties involved in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"President Kabila has high hopes on you for ending the
conflict in Congo," Okitundu said, adding that DRC is very
worried about the deteriorating humanitarian situation throughout
Congo, particularly atrocities in the eastern provinces controlled
by Rwanda, Uganda and their allied rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that DRC is prepared to work with the United
Nations Security Council to ensure that the security of the
borders is improved.
</P>
<P>
In response, Mkapa accepted the request and pledged his
commitment to the Lusaka peace process."We would like to see the
war in Congo come to an end, leading to the restoration of the
country's national unity and territorial integrity," Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
"We would also like to see that all of Congo's neighbors are
satisfied that the Congolese territory is not being used by rebels
to destabilize their countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa promised that he would continue to do everything in his
power, just as he has been doing in the past, to ensure that a
quick solution is found to bring an end to the on-going Congo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tanzania would like to support DRC, Africa's third
largest country with enormous resources, to stand up on its feet
and regain its position with in the development of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in DRC began in August 1998 when rebels backed by
Rwandan and Ugandan soldiers tried to topple Kabila's government
which is supported by troops from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia.
The Rwanda-Uganda alliance later fell apart but their soldiers,
together with the rebels, still remain in the eastern part of DRC
though an agreement reached by African leaders in Lusaka, Zambia
in 1999 demanded their total withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> No Country to Stay out of Free Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Neither the Democratic Republic
of Congo(DRC), nor Namibia or Swaziland have indicated that they
will stay out of Free Trade Area (FTA) to be launched by the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) at the end
of October this year, COMESA public relations officer Mweusi
Karake said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Karake made the clarification one day after Zambia Daily Mail
reported that the three countries will stay out of FTA.
</P>
<P>
He said that in his interview with the newspaper he explained
that Tanzania has never given COMESA reasons for coming out of
COMESA.
</P>
<P>
"I further pointed out that even the issue of revenue loss,
that is often mentioned, we do get it from the media and that it
has never been given to COMESA as the reason for coming out," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said "I further pointed out that even if revenue loss had
been the cause, there are ways and means to solve the problem
rather than coming out of the organization."
</P>
<P>
"I pointed out compensatory measures, and explained that a
country with a problem could approach the COMESA Authority and
seek derogation so that the individual cases of member States are
looked into. It is in this line that DR Congo, Namibia and
Swaziland were brought in as examples," he said.
</P>
<P>
Karake said that "negotiations are still going on and we cannot
say at this point that any country that has not confirmed that it
will be a founder member of the launch of the COMESA Free Trade
Area is staying out."
</P>
<P>
There are 12 out of 20 members that have indicated so far that
they are going to be part of the founder at the launch of COMESA
FTA. the number may increase in due course and singling out DRC
and two others is not fair to these counties, to FTA and to COMESA
at large, Karake said.

UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Mya Than, the permanent
representative of Myanmar to the United Nations Office in Geneva,
was elected chairman of the First Committee for the 55th General
Assembly, which is in charge of disarmament and international
security, the United Nations said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Than, born in 1944, was elected to the new post on Tuesday
afternoon, and he has been closely associated with the work of the
United Nations in various capacities since 1984, with disarmament
and international security issues in particular.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Euro Hits Record Low Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The credibility of European
Union's single currency, the euro, failed one more test Wednesday
as anguished traders abandoned it only to push it to record lows.
</P>
<P>
At one time the euro plunged to 86.85 U.S. cents, crushing
through the day's previous lows of 88.37 and then 87.88 cents.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the panic selling was fanned by the
comments from German Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder who said
earlier this week that he was not concerned about the euro's
continued decline because it helped make German exports cheaper
overseas.
</P>
<P>
The fear that European policy-makers were at odds with the
European Central Bank (ECB) spread from one exchange market to
another, hammering the euro to plummet from one all-time low to
another in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Now that the 87-cent mark has been passed, there seemed to be
no immediate brake to stop the single currency from free-falling
until the ECB meets again in a week's time.
</P>
<P>
The ECB has consistently warned that a weak euro is fueling
inflation in the 15-nation bloc in that it makes imports relative
more expensive.
</P>
<P>
The bank has just raised its benchmark lending interest by a
quarter of a point on August 31 to help bolster the weakening
currency and it seemed to have helped until Schroeder made his
remark that also contradicted with other European leaders who have
kept saying that the euro has been vastly undervalued.
</P>
<P>
Money traders took Schroeder's comment as to indicate that the
European policy-makers were unconcerned about the slide of the
euro and that the ECB was off its balance to further prop up the
currency by intervening in money markets and by buying the euro.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has already raised interest rates five times
this year. Raising interest rates is usually a move that tends to
bolster local currency.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the market would keep testing the ECB's
threshold until real intervention takes place.
</P>
<P>
Other traders were concerned about ECB's anti-inflation policy
and they fear that higher interest rates may only choke back the
rekindled economy in the union.
</P>
<P>
The euro was launched on January 1, 1999, at a value of 1.16
dollars and now it has devalued by more than a quarter.

MOSCOW, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A Russian clergyman on
Wednesday criticized the U.S. state department for a report that

Christianity has for a thousand years been the largest Russian

citizens."
</P>
<P>
"While all traditional religions are equal before the law, they
are not equal before history," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Wednesday
called for radical changes to United Nations peacekeeping
operations so as to tackle the current brutal and volatile civil
wars.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Millennium Summit which opened this morning at
the U.N. headquarters in New York, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said that U.N. duties had moved beyond the simple monitoring
of post-conflict ceasefire lines.
</P>
<P>
Citing bloodshed in Africa, East Timor and Balkans, Blair said:
"The typical case is now fast-moving and volatile."
</P>
<P>
"We need U.N. forces composed of units appropriate for more
robust peacekeeping that can be inserted quickly," the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. must alter radically its planning, intelligence and
analysis, and develop a far more substantial professional military
staff," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When the moment comes, a field headquarters must be ready to
move, with an operational communications system up and running
immediately rather than weeks into the deployment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair said leaders attending the summit should tackle the
developed world's "dismal record of failure in Africa".
</P>
<P>
He urged developed countries to establish a partnership with
African countries.
</P>
<P>
"We should use this unique summit for a concrete purpose: to
start the process of agreeing a way forward for Africa," he added.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit, the largest-ever in the U.N. history,
will address a host of issues under the official theme "The United
Nations in the 21st Century".

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Russian, Vietnamese Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Vietnamese President
Tran Duc Luong on Wednesday on the sidelines of the current United
Nations Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's meeting with Putin, the third between the two
presidents over the past three months, began shortly before 15:30
GMT in the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, where Clinton is staying in New
York.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders posed for photos and shook hands without making
any comments to the press.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. national security adviser, Samuel Berger, said that
the two leaders would discuss regional issues including the Korean
peninsula, the Balkans, the Middle East and Afghanistan as well as
strategic cooperation, disarmament and continued nuclear weapons
nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
"Particularly alarming are the plans of militarization of outer
space," Putin said, in reference to U.S. plans for a national
missile defense shield.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's decision last week to delay decision on the
deployment of the missile shield helps to assuage some of the
Russian leader's misgivings about further space-related talks.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his arrival in New York Sunday, Putin said that
Washington and Moscow continued to hold different opinions about
the anti-ballistic missile treaty signed in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Clinton met with the Vietnamese president and the two
sides held talks on trade and visit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reaffirmed his support for a trade agreement with
Vietnam and discussed the possibility of a visit to the southeast
Asian nation during a brief chat with the Vietnamese president.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Jack Siewert said that Clinton met Luong
for some 10 minutes on the sidelines of the U.N. Millennium Summit,
the largest gathering of world leaders to discuss the U.N. role in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"It is primarily focused on the bilateral trade agreement,"
Siewert said. "We reaffirmed our commitment to that trade deal,
recognizing there is very little time left in this congressional
session," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam and the United States signed a landmark trade deal
earlier this year. The agreement needs to be ratified by the U.S.
Congress and officials have said it is unlikely this will occur in
the few weeks left in the congressional session.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Issue to Affect Turkey's EU Accession Bid: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou Wednesday said the Cyprus peace talks will
affect Turkey's relations with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
After meeting with outgoing Greek ambassador in Nicosia Kyriacos
Rodousakis, Papapetrou expressed certainty that the Cyprus issue
will be included in Turkey's EU accession process, in accordance
with decisions taken by the 15 EU members.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou was commenting on a letter recently sent by Turkish
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem to all EU member states.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Cem warned EU states that Turkey's relations with
the EU would be damaged if the EU linked the Cyprus issue as well
as Ankara's problems with Greece to its candidacy for EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
Cem praised the EU Helsinki summit held last December, in which
Turkey was granted EU candidate status, for making no linkage of
the two issues. He said that mentioning the Cyprus issue in his
country's accession partnership would be "a violation of the terms
of Helsinki."
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is trying to get away from its responsibilities,"
Papapetrou said, describing Ankara's effort as "futile" because "
the Helsinki decision is clear."
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said the dialog for a settlement in Cyprus and
Turkey's EU accession bid are two procedures which affect one
another.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Rodousakis said previous EU summits have called on
Turkey to establish satisfactory and stable relations with Greece
and to support the United Nations effort for a political settlement
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkish forces invaded and occupied the northern third of the
Cyprus island in 1974 in the wake of a failed coup seeking union
with Greece. Cyprus has since been divided into Greek Cypriots-
dominated south and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north. Greece and
Turkey support their side on the island on ethnic line.
</P>
<P>
In Helsinki, Greece has agreed not to veto Turkey's candidacy
after it was satisfied that mention would be made in the summit's
final conclusions on the improvement of Greek-Turkish relations and
the Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Tourism Recovers From Last Year's Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's tourism sector
recovered quickly from the aftermath of the two devastating
earthquakes late 1999 and was reinvigorated this year, Basaran
Ulusoy, chairman of Turkish Travel Agencies Association (TURSAB),
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ulusoy said that about 5.4 million tourists visited Turkey in
the first seven months of this year, up 35 percent as against the
same period of last year. This figure is also 8 percent higher than
that in 1998, Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkey enjoyed a revenue of 2.568 billion U.S. dollars from
tourism in the first six months of this year, 43 percent higher
than the same period of last year, but 8 percent lower than the
same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we had a heavy crisis. We expected that from the
beginning of this year we were targeting the figures of 1998. We
are hoping to reach 10 million visitors by the end of this year,"
Ulusoy said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish tourism was hit heavily by two above-7-magnitude tremors
last year. Besides, Ulusoy said that the sector has always suffered
from some problems such as heavy traffic, poor urbanization and
environmental infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He called on authorities to hold more conferences on culture,
interests, and religious beliefs in a bid to promote bigger shares
of culture and faith tours in the tourism market.
</P>
<P>
Ulusoy also urged the government to attach importance to
domestic visitors, saying that domestic tourism, a need for Turkish
people and a big economic activity, should not be neglected.

<HEADLINE> Iran Dismisses U.S. Allegations on Religious Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi here on Wednesday dismissed as "
unfounded" and "politically-motivated" the allegations made by the
United States that there is no religious freedom in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Citizen rights of Iranians including religious minorities are "
fully respected" according to Islamic beliefs and the constitution
of Iran as well as international commitments, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency quoted Asefi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The allegations made in the U.S. State Department annual report
are "unfounded and repetitive," which "emanated from a lack of
knowledge about the human rights situation in Iran," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the U.S. State Department repeats the same
unfounded allegations against Iran every year, which indicates that
the report has been politically-motivated.
</P>
<P>
Iran strongly dismisses any kind of interference in its domestic
affairs, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Ready for Interest Rates Liberalization: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Governor of Cyprus' Central
Bank Afxentis Afxentiou Wednesday expressed his confidence that
Cypriot economy is ready for the liberalization of interest rates
next year.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization of interest rates, to be introduced on
January 1, 2001, will have only positive effects on Cypriot
economy, Afxentiou told the Cyprus News Agency, saying that any
delay in the measure would have a negative effect on the island's
European Union accession course.
</P>
<P>
He added that capital liquidity will be gradually deregulated in
two or three years.
</P>
<P>
As to concerns that interest rates may go up with
liberalization, he said as rates in Cyprus are higher than those in
Europe, they will most probably fall due to the competition that
will take place after the island's market opens up to foreign
borrowing.
</P>
<P>
Afxentiou explained that despite the introduction of
liberalization, the central bank will still keep its authority on
interest rates and the right to fix them. But he said he believes
that "such a need will not come up."
</P>
<P>
A series of economic and financial reforms have been at full
steam in Cyprus since the island started substantive accession
negotiations with the EU in November 1998.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Hezbollah Says Necessary to Remain Armed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Sheikh Muhammed Hussein
Fadlallah, spiritual leader of Lebanon's guerrilla group Hezbollah,
said it is "necessary and critical" for the resistance to keep its
weapons, the National News Agency (NNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria will not give Israel peace and safety as long
as it can launch war against Arab countries, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Fadlallah claimed that the "resistance power" is the only power
with political cover to counterattack possible Israeli rivalry. "We
will hold our weapons because we do not know what the Jewish
country will do in the future."
</P>
<P>
Iran- and Syria-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, had been
spearheading a guerrilla war against Israel from 1978 till May this
year when Israel withdrew its troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's statement to
Israeli soldiers' families on a new relationship with Lebanon and
Syria, Fadlallah said Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon was a
decision made due to domestic crisis in Israel as many soldiers
came back dead or wounded.
</P>
<P>
Barak promised in his statement to make those families feel
secure for their boys in army and "sleep well" at night.
</P>
<P>
"The political and military truth reflects that the pullout from
our land was forced, not willing," Fadlallah said.
</P>
<P>
As to Israel's remarks on the advanced weapons that Hezbollah
hold, he said "Israel is living in panic and scare. This is why the
United States, some European countries and United Nations members
called for disarming Hezbollah and deploying Lebanese army along
the border."
</P>
<P>
"After studying Barak's statement, we consider it is critical
not to make Israel feel safe and stable," Fadlallah concluded, "we
will not think about renegotiation unless Israel makes concession
to Lebanon and Syria."
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, which entered the vacated south Lebanon after May,
now controls some areas of the border zone with Israel as U.N.
peacekeepers and Lebanese army were also deployed to police the
area.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes Over 1 Ton of Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran's security forces have
seized 1,330 kilograms of various narcotics in the past 15 days in
the southern province of Kerman, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The drug haul was made in armed clashes with drug traffickers,
inspection of homes and stop-and-search operations on vehicles,
according to Abass Ali Rouhi, commander of the provincial security
forces.
</P>
<P>
One drug trafficker was killed and seven other arrested during
the operations, he said, adding that 22 vehicles and a large amount
of ammunition were also confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Drug hauls have become common in Iran, which sits on a major
route for smuggling narcotics from its eastern neighbors of
Afghanistan and Pakistan to the lucrative markets in the Persian
Gulf, Europe and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
In July, Iran closed down 725 kilometers of borders with its
eastern neighbor Afghanistan as part of the stepped-up efforts to
fight drug trade. War-torn Afghanistan is the world's largest
producer of opium.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Majlis (parliament) has also earmarked 200 billion rials
(about 24.4 million U.S. dollars) in credits to block the eastern
borders from drug traffic.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, 740 drug traffickers and 174 police officers were
killed in narcotics-related clashes, according to government
reports.

<HEADLINE> 100 Turkish Companies to Attend Baghdad International Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 Turkish companies are
expected to participate in the upcoming Baghdad International Fair
which falls on November 1, local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
These companies will exhibit medical, agricultural and
construction equipment, car spare parts, detergents, carpets,
leather products, ceramics and other products.
</P>
<P>
The number of Turkish companies to take part in the fair will be
twice the number of last year, when some 50 Turkish firms attended
the annual event.
</P>
<P>
As Iraq's neighbor, Turkey has been trying to grab a bigger
share of Iraq's lucrative reconstruction market, estimated at 200
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turkish firms have won contracts worth more than 477 million
dollars from Iraq within the framework of the United Nations oil-
for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. humanitarian deal allows Iraq to export crude to
finance imports of food, medicines and other basic necessities to
help offset the crippling impact of the decade-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Turkey says that the sanctions have cost it more than 35 billion
dollars in lost earnings, and have a negative impact on its
southeastern border area with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish companies held a five-day exhibition in the Iraqi
capital Baghdad in April in a bid to promote bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition followed the "fruitful" visit to Iraq by Turkish
State Minister Edip Safter Gaydali.
</P>
<P>
However, the political relations between the two neighbors have
been soured since the 1991 Gulf War, in which Turkey was part of
the U.S.-led international coalition that drove Iraqi occupation
forces out of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Biggest Pro-Peace Group Launches Week-long Peace Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Peace Now, the
biggest movement supporting the Mideast peace process in Israel,
Wednesday afternoon launched a week-long campaign to mark the
seventh anniversary of the Oslo accords between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
At 5 p.m. (1400 GMT) Wednesday, Peace Now activists began a
special vigil at Jerusalem's Paris Square, which is close to Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's official residence, urging Barak and his
Palestinian counterpart Yasser Arafat to show more flexibility and
take the final step along the Oslo track.
</P>
<P>
The accords, which were signed by the two sides in the Norwegian
capital of Oslo on September 13 seven years ago, laid the
foundation for the Israeli-Palestinian peace track, which now
enters a moment of truth.
</P>
<P>
The Peace Now especially urged the two leaders to make brave
decisions on the issue of Jerusalem, which had been the bottleneck
in the peace process, according to a statement issued by the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat are currently in New York to attend the United
Nations' Millennium Summit, on the sidelines of which they will
meet separately with United States President Bill Clinton. The
outcome of these meetings will determinate the fate of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Their latest efforts to end the century-long conflicts between
Jews and the Palestinians, a summit at Camp David in July, failed
to reach any agreement due to significant differences over the fate
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel claims the holy city should be its "eternal and undivided
capital", while the Palestinians want at least East Jerusalem,
which Israel occupied in the 1967 Mideast war, to be the capital of
their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
However, Peace Now spokesman Didi Remez said Wednesday that the
organization's campaign is under the slogan "In Jerusalem the
conflict will come to an end -- One city, two capitals."
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday afternoon's demonstration, several dozens children
released colored balloons with the words "Jerusalem" and Al-Quds,
or the name for Jerusalem in Arabic, written on them.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration is the first part of the week-long campaign,
according to Remez.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the movement will organize a confrontation tour of
East Jerusalem with the right-wing National Religious Party.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, it will convene a conference on the future of
Jerusalem at Jerusalem's Olive Tree Hotel, with the participation
of Shulamith Aloni, former leader of the pro-peace Meretz party,
writer Meir Shalev, Ziad abu Zayyad and other famous persons who
love peace.
</P>
<P>
Next Monday, the Peace Now will launch a vigil for peace at the
grave of late Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, who reached the
landmark Oslo accords with Arafat and was assassinated by Israeli
right-wing extremists two years later.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will reach its climax next Wednesday, the seventh
anniversary of the Oslo accords and the day when Israel and the
Palestinians should reach a final peace deal according to the Sharm
el Sheikh Memorandum they signed last September.
</P>
<P>
They will launch a torchlight procession, under the banner "
Marching Towards the End of the Conflict," along the highway
between East and West Jerusalem.

HARARE, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Defense Minister
Moven Mahachi said Wednesday that Zimbabwean troops would
withdraw from the Democratic Republic the Congo (DRC) immediately
after the U.N. peacekeeping forces were deployed in the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi was responding to a question by opposition Movement for
Democratic Change parliamentarian Abednico Bhebhe who asked him
when exactly the 11,000-strong contingent would return from the
DRC where they were propping up President Laurent Kabila's
government.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said the question of withdrawing foreign troops from
the DRC had been stated in the Lusaka Protocol that they would
definitely pull out when the 5,500 U.N. peacekeeping forces were
deployed.
</P>
<P>
"Already a disengagement plan has been agreed to in Kampala,
Uganda for the U.N. forces to take over, and the U.N. has already
sent an advance team of observers," he said, adding that the U.N.
forces would coordinate a plan for withdrawal of all foreign
forces.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola have sent troops to help Kabila
fight different rebel factions backed by Ugandan and Rwandan
forces since the conflict broke out in August 1998. However, the
Lusaka ceasefire agreement signed by all warring parties last year
failed to put an end to the two-year war.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Rises 5.7 Percent in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. labor productivity, a
key measure of rising living standards, surged at a 5.7 percent
annual rate in the second quarter, higher than the previous
estimate of 5.3 percent, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest reading on second-quarter productivity, the amount
of output for per hour of work, was considerably stronger than the
first-quarter performance, which showed productivity growing at a
1.9 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
The strong gain in second-quarter productivity pushed unit
labor costs, a key gauge of inflation pressures, down by a rate of
0.4 percent, the lowest since the end of 1999. That was a big
improvement from the 1.9 percent rate of increase posted in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Gains in productivity are the key to rising living standards
because they allow wages to increase without triggering higher
inflation.
</P>
<P>
On the year-on-year basis, productivity has risen by 5.2
percent in the second quarter. That was the best showing since a 5.
3 percent increase in the third quarter of 1983.
</P>
<P>
Unit labor costs fell 0.4 percent from the second quarter of
1999, the lowest reading since a 1.3 percent drop in the fourth
quarter of 1983.
</P>
<P>
For two decades, from 1973 to 1995, U.S. productivity showed
lackluster gains of just over 1 percent. Since then, however,
productivity increases have more than doubled.

<HEADLINE> Oil Blockade by Truckers to Drag on in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The blockade of oil storehouses
and refineries by French truckers, which is causing a nation-wide
oil panic, is expected to drag on this week as only one of the
three national unions of truckers has agreed to signed an
agreement with government to end the protest.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Enterprises of Transport and Logistics of
France will sign the agreement in which the Minister of Transport
Jean-Claude Gayssot has offered to cut fuel tax by 35 centimes (
five U.S. cents) per liter this year and 25 centimes (3.5 U.S.
cents) next year.
</P>
<P>
Two other national unions of truckers, the National Union of
Syndicate Organizations of Road Haulers and the National
Federation of Road Haulers, said they consider the government
offer insufficient and would continue the blockade.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said that the government
cannot go further in conceding to the protesters and there will be
no more negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He called on the truckers to lift the blockade and take up
their responsibilities for their own enterprises and the national
economy.

Some 2,000 trucks have been blocking oil storehouses and
refineries since Monday across the country, causing grave shortage
of oil supply nationwide except in Paris region.
</P>
<P>
They are protesting the rise of fuel prices since the beginning
of this year, which apparently resulted from a reduction of oil
production by oil exporting countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Greens, who are part of the left-wing coalition
led by Jospin, sharply criticized the concession made by the
government to truckers which they said would worsen pollution.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says U.N. Reform Should Not Affect Fundamental Principles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia stressed here
Wednesday that it is imperative to renovate and improve the U.N.
mechanisms, but not at the expense of the United Nations
fundamental principles.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the three-day U.N. Millennium Summit which opened
this morning at the United Nations headquarters in New York,
Russian President Vladimir Putin said that when the world body was
being established, many of the states represented here were
simply not on the map.
</P>
<P>
But the norms of the international behavior were being formed
by taking these states also into account and these norms are
accepted by all and serve the interests of the international
community, the president said.
</P>
<P>
What seemed unattainable half a century ago today has become
the norms of international relations, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Respect for each other and the U.N. instruments helped the
countries and people to learn the art of a dialogue and look for
common decisions, and even global confrontation could not impede a
joint work in the extreme crisis and even dead-end situations,
Putin noted.
</P>
<P>
"The twentieth century will remain in history as a century of
contradictions. It has become an epoch of grandiose achievements
and terrible wars, a century of revolutionary breakthroughs and
profound disillusionment," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"But our countries and peoples managed to draw off hatred. They
managed to overcome the Cold War with its global confrontation.
These are the accomplishments of the United Nations," Putin noted.
</P>
<P>
The new century of the United Nations should prolong itself
into a millennium of effective stability, and it has to enter the
annals of history as the period of real disarmament, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
This summit is really the last one in this millennium and it
will go down in history as the Millennium Summit by a different
reason, he added.

<HEADLINE> French Oil Group's Benefit Jumps by Nearly Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The profit of the French oil
group Total-Fina-Elf jumped by 47.8 percent in the first half this
year to 22.36 billion francs (3.2 billion U.S. dollars), announced
the group's president Thierry Desmarest on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rise in profits resulted from a very favorable
environment, especially the rise of oil prices in world market.
</P>
<P>
The average oil price, which was 13.4 U.S. dollars per barrel
in the first half of 1999, has jumped to 33 U.S. dollars per
barrel today.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the rise of oil price to more than 30 dollars
per barrel is too hard for consumers and that the Organization of
Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) should decide to increase their
production when its members meet on September 10 in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
He also said that oil companies can produce normally when the
market maintains a price of 15-20 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the market is overreacting and that OPEC
still hesitates to increase production to meet the increased
demand in the world, he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges OPEC to Lower Oil Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on
Wednesday urged the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) to lower oil prices.
</P>
<P>
EU Energy Commissioner Loyola de Palacio called on the OPEC to
take appropriate measures to bring some equilibrium to the market.
</P>
<P>
"I hope there will be a decision taken that will reduce tension
on the oil markets," she said. "The present situation has
considerable undesirable effects."
</P>
<P>
The OPEC is scheduled to meet over the weekend. Yet analysts
said that the 500,000 barrels a day of additional production OPEC
is expected to approve at the Vienna meeting may not suffice to
meet the demands worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The EU wants the OPEC to cut the price of oil by increasing
production after the recent surge in crude oil prices has set off
a chain of protests and road blockades in several EU member states,
especially in France.
</P>
<P>
Early Wednesday, De Palacio sent the European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union, a special note warning that
crude oil prices have reached historical level since the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
She said that it would be necessary to analyze the long-term
impact of the oil price hike on economic growth and inflation in
the 15-nation bloc in that the recent price surge has sparked a 1-
percent increase in EU-wide inflation.
</P>
<P>
As much as 75 percent of oil consumption in EU member states
depends on imports and the percentage is projected to rise to 85
percent by 2020.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices now seem determined to fluctuate within a band
of 30 U.S. dollars a barrel and it entered that band in February
this year following an uninterrupted rise since December 1998 when
the crude oil price bottomed out at 10 dollars a barrel, the
commissioner said in her note.
</P>
<P>
Fadhil Chalabi, executive director of the Center for Global
Energy Studies, warned: "If OPEC does not increase its production,
prices will go very high until the peak of the winter. Prices may
even exceed 40 dollars a barrel."
</P>
<P>
In trading Tuesday, crude oil price for October delivery rose
as much as 0.72 dollars a barrel to 34.1 dollars on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Except for a brief high of 34.37 dollars a barrel in March, the
price Tuesday was the highest since oil prices surged in late 1990
before the Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Oil Production at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Canadian oil production reached
a record high of 2.25 million barrels a day by the end of June
largely due to the world inventory crunch, the country's National
Post newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The production, a 7.5 percent jump from the corresponding
period last year, beat the previous record of a daily 2.17 million
barrels set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite the production increase, Canadian analysts do not
expect much excess capacity inside or outside the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), fearing a cold winter or any
supply disruption could cause prices to continue to spike.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say oil could jump to 40 U.S. dollars a barrel,
from the current price of 34.10 dollars, even if OPEC decides this
weekend to increase output for the third time this year.
</P>
<P>
The oil price surged to 34.37 dollars on March 8, the highest
since November 1990 during the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
The projection of another price peak pushed the oil and gas
subindex on the Toronto Stock Exchange to a 52-week high of 7,913
points Tuesday, just shy of the 8,094 record set in October 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat ruled out flexibility on Moslem and Christian holy sites in
Jerusalem, resisting an Israeli demand that he make more
concessions in Middle East peace talks on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I will not be flexible concerning the holy places because the
holy places are not only Palestinian," Arafat told reporters in
New York, where he and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will have
separate talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"It's Palestinian, Arab, Christian and Moslem holy places, and
everybody has to respect it," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the statement as Clinton prepared to re-launch
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations Wednesday after warning that the
opportunity for a peace agreement "is fleeting and about to pass."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president has virtually abandoned hopes for convening
another summit as he did at his Camp David mountain retreat in
July and may not even attempt to bring the two leaders together in
light of their sharp differences.
</P>
<P>
In a speech prepared for the U.N. Millennium Summit that opened
at the U.N. headquarters in New York Wednesday, Barak said Israel
had shown it could make painful decisions which eluded them at
Camp David in July.
</P>
<P>
"It remains to be seen whether our counterparts (the
Palestinians and Syria) are also capable of rising to the
magnitude of the hour," he said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Confirms Deaths of U.N. Refugee Workers in West Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said here Wednesday that three United Nations refugee
workers were killed as the office of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) was attacked in Atambua, a major refugee
center near the border with the U.N.-controlled East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement just before he began to address the
opening ceremony of the Millennium Summit in New York, the largest
gathering of world leaders to discuss the U.N. role in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
"Before delivering my prepared statement, therefore, I must
inform the heads of state and government of a tragedy that has
occurred in West Timor," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
He asked more than 160 world leaders attending the opening
ceremony to observe a one minute's silence in honor of the victims.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very regretful to have to open our proceedings on a somber
note," he said. "The safety of United Nations personnel, in both
peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, is a matter of vital
concern to all of us."
</P>
<P>
"A few hours ago, the office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees in Atambua was deliberately attacked, by
a militia opposed to the independence of East Timor," Annan added.
</P>
<P>
"This tragedy underlines once again the dangers faced by
unarmed humanitarian workers serving the United Nations in
conflict or post-conflict situations," he said.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. helicopter, carrying 32 injured people from Atambua,
was heading for East Timor's capital of Dili. All foreign aid
staff in Atambua were being evacuated after the attack, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the United Nations resumed humanitarian aid in West
Timor after suspending it following brutal attacks on its staff
there.
</P>
<P>
More than 120,000 refugees remain in West Timor after the
militias forced them from their homes when they razed East Timor
after the U.N.-brokered vote in 1999. Most of the refugees are
living near Atambua.

<HEADLINE> China, Belarus Agree to Strengthen Parliamentary Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MINSK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- China and Belarus agreed here on
Wednesday to step up their efforts to expand exchanges and
cooperation between the legislative bodies of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries came to the agreement during separate
meetings between visiting Chinese leader Li Peng and Anatoli
Malofeyev, speaker of the House of Representatives (Lower House)
and Pavel Shipuk, speaker of the House of Republics (Upper House).
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Belarussian parliamentary leaders, Li
Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), said since the independence of Belarus, China has
always showed its understanding and respect for the domestic and
foreign policies of the Belarussian government.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that people of every country have the right to
choose their own path or model of development in accordance with
the specific conditions of each country," Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
On relations between the National Assembly of Belarus and
China's NPC, the two speakers expressed their hope to further
strengthen cooperation between the two legislative bodies.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with them, Li Peng said exchanges between legislative
bodies of countries constituted an important component of the
overall state-to-state relations and is an important aspect in
enhancing friendship and in expanding bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two speakers also stressed that the two houses of the
National Assembly of Belarus fully support the Belarussian
government's efforts to develop cooperation with China, and will
firmly uphold the one-China policy. They pledged that the National
Assembly would never develop any official relationship of any form
with the authorities in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng arrived here Tuesday on a three-day official visit to
Belarus, after attending the Millennium Summit of presiding
officers of national parliaments, and visiting Iceland and
Lithuania.

BRUSSELS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
imported 150.5 million tons of hard coal last year, an increase of
2.7 million tons compared with the year before, according to
European Report on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU produced 99.7 million tons of coal in 1999, a drop of 6.
8 million tons over the preceding year, said the independent
journal.
</P>
<P>
The EU imported most of the hard coal from South Africa and
Australia, which combined to account for 41 percent of the union's
total coal imports in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The United States was the third largest coal exporter to the EU,
accounting for 13 percent of the EU total imports, while Colombia
became the fourth big exporter to the EU with 19.2 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Even coal-producing countries like France and Spain within the
European Union had to increase imports of hard coal to meet their
domestic demands due to their declined coal production.
</P>
<P>
France was reported to have increased its imports by 17.3
percent, and Spain 38.1 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Coal Production dropped 700,000 tons in France and 900,000 tons

interference in its internal affairs by the United States under
the pretext of religion.
</P>
<P>
When commenting on the so-called 2000 report on international

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said that such a
report has made indiscreet and irresponsible remarks on the

Tibet Consistent with Central Government on the Dalai Lama
Issue
</P>
<P>
Xu Mingyang, vice-chairman of the Tibet autonomous regional

government on the issue of the Dalai Lama has always been
consistent with that of the central government.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Erwin Marschwski, a German parliament member

splitting the motherland has never ceased.
</P>
<P>
He said the central government's position on the issue of the
Dalai Lama is clear-cut, that is, the door for dialogues is always
open, but the precondition is that the Dalai Lama must abandon his
stand for "Tibet independence," stop his separatist activities,
and openly recognize Tibet as an inalienable part of China.

Party committee, spent 298,000 yuan (about 36,000 U.S. dollars) of
public money to buy a car and shortly afterwards, they upgraded
the car by replacing the original CD player with a TV set and a
VCD player. This is in violation of regulations on officials'
transportation means.
</P>
<P>
Local people are outraged as Anyue is a poverty-stricken county
which suffered a deficit of over 19 million yuan in local revenue
in 1999. The county has accumulated deficits exceeding 30 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shugui was dismissed from his post as secretary, member of
the Standing Committee, and member, of the CPC Committee of Anyue
County; and Zhou Silu was given a serious warning and removed from
his post as member of the Standing Committee of the Anyue County
Party Committee.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan regrets Indian allegations of harassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistan government has
expressed deep regret over the recent allegations of harassment
and intimidation of the personnel and families of the Indian High
Commission in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the statement issued by the spokesman of the
Indian External Affairs Ministry, a Pakistani Foreign Office
statement on Wednesday said: "In recent days, the Indian
Government has made a string of such allegations in an effort to
cover up the repeated acts of harassment and intimidation against
the members of the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi."
</P>
<P>
This subject was raised here at a meeting of the Pakistani
foreign secretary with the Indian high commissioner on Tuesday,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
As regards the alleged molestation of a member of the staff of
the Indian High Commission on September 2, the Pakistani foreign
secretary said to the Indian high commissioner that if true, the
incident was highly regrettable.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani foreign secretary also told the Indian high
commissioner that the matter, which had already been referred to
the concerned authorities, would be thoroughly investigated and
the Indian High Commission would be informed of the results of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"It is deplorable that instead of awaiting the completion of
these investigations and extending its cooperation, the Indian
Government continues to make unfounded accusations," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Government of Pakistan has been acting in full compliance
with its legal obligations under the Vienna Convention on
Diplomatic Relations and the Pakistan-India Code of Conduct for
the Treatment of Diplomatic Personnel and once again calls upon
the Government of India to do likewise," the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
"The Government of Pakistan also calls upon the Government of
India to desist from hostile propaganda and avoid actions that may
vitiate further the atmosphere of peace and security in the region,
" the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rate Drops in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Romania's unemployment
dropped by 39,000 to 10.5 percent in July compared to June, with 1,
028,000 jobless persons registered, the local Capital weekly
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Trade, the textile industry, hotels and restaurants, the food
industry and wood processing were growing sectors absorbing more
labor in the month.
</P>
<P>
Another factor contributing to the diminishing of unemployment
was the openness of several countries to Romanian workers. Some 6,
500 people got employment contracts in Germany, Israel and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
However, the jobless rate in the country is predicted to rise
to 12.5-13 percent late this year due to planned massive lay-offs
in the defense industry and some industrial giants, according to
the Ministry of Labor and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
The country's highest unemployment rate of 11.5 percent was
scored in 1999.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Mobile Phone Service Joint Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on
Wednesday approved a planned joint venture among three telecom
companies to provide third-generation mobile phone service.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation EU,
approved the joint venture on grounds that its operation does not
raise competitive concerns since the position of the joint venture
as a new entrant will not be significant.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, known as the Hutchison 3G UK Limited, was
established by Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa Limited, Japan's NTT
DoCoMo Inc. and KPN Mobile N.V. of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The new joint venture has been awarded one of the five third-
generation UMTS mobile service licenses auctioned in Britain,
which is the first European country to have auctioned service
licenses for the universal mobile telecommunications standard (
UMTS).
</P>
<P>
The auctions held in April netted the British government a
total of 22.5 billion pounds (34 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
UMTS, which is the latest generation of cellular phone service,
boasts of a transmission speed 40 times faster than that of the
current GSM standard.
</P>
<P>
The higher telecommunication speed makes new capabilities
possible, including mobile phone connection to the Internet and
video displays.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine welcomes U.S. Decision on NMD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on
Wednesday welcomed the U.S. decision not to deploy the National
Missile Defense (NMD) system now.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the ministry said U.S. President Bill Clinton's
decision on the NMD deployment, which caused serious concerns of
many countries including Ukraine, would help preserve strategic
stability in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The foundation stone of maintaining strategic stability in the
world is the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty (ABM) of 1972," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the U.S. decision gave more opportunities for the ABM
signatory countries to speed up consultations on the issues of
keeping global strategic stability.
</P>
<P>
Further reduction of strategic offensive arms depends on the
stands of Russia and the United States, which possess a great deal
of nuclear weapons, the statement pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Ukraine, as a party to the START and ABM treaties, which has
voluntarily abandoned the world's third biggest nuclear potential,
is not indifferent to the further destiny of the ABM treaty," it
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- In the latest sign of a continuing thaw in relations between
Washington and Tehran, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright paid a surprise visit to the United Nations Tuesday to
hear a speech by Iranian president Mohammed Khatami on the "
dialogue among civilizations."
</P>
<P>
-- Kim Yong nam, president of DPRK's presidium of the suspreme
people's assembly, and his entourage angrily flew home and refused
to attend the U.N. Millennium Summit of World Leaders, after
American Airlines security officers insisted they would have to
undergo body searches before being allowed to board a connecting
flight Monday to New York from Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan warned Tuesday that the
perennial problems of war, disease, poverty and pollution will
never be resolved unless all countries cooperate, and he stressed
that neither they nor the United Nations can accomplish the tasks
unaided.
</P>
<P>
-- As senators resumed debate on a major bill establishing
permanent trade relations with China, the Senate majority leader,
Trent Lott, said Tuesday that he would try to schedule a final
vote by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Gulf air crash investigators say pilots appear to have lost
control of the Airbus 320 before the August 23 crash off Bahrain
that killed all 143 aboard. Flight-data recorders show the plane
continued accelerating despite warning alarms during two landing
attempts.
</P>
<P>
-- American Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc. insist they will
be able to negotiate an agreement with regulators to allow their
merger to proceed, although the terms under which Time Warner's
cable systems are opened to Internet competitors are likely to be
a major sticking point.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Millennium Summit Opens in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The three-day
Millennium Summit opened Wednesday morning at the headquarters of
the United Nations in New York, attended by more than 160 heads of
state or government.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Summit is co-chaired by Namibian President Sam
Nujoma, whose country holds the presidency of the 54th session of
the U.N. General Assembly, and Finnish President Tarja Halone,
whose country holds the presidency of the 55th session of the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which is the largest-ever gathering of world
leaders in the U.N. history, will address a host of issues under
the official theme "The United Nations in the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
It will specially focus on how to pull billions of people out
of abject poverty, strengthen U.N. peace operations, and deal more
effectively with the world's environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said the summit is a unique event, a unique opportunity, and
therefore a unique responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Noting the challenges facing the international community, Annan
said these challenges cannot be met in one country alone, nor by
one government alone.
</P>
<P>
"Your people look to you for a common effort to solve their
problems. They expect you to work together, as governments. And
they expect you to work with all the other institutions, profit
and non-profit, public and private," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan urged the world leaders to consider seriously his two
reports on how to strengthen the role of the United Nations in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations needs strengthening. We must strengthen it
across the whole range of our activities. We need to decide our
priorities. We must adapt our United Nations so that in the future
those priorities are reflected in clear and prompt decisions,
leading to real change in people's lives," he added.
</P>
<P>
The summit scheduled for September 6 to 8 attracted 186 out of
the 189 U.N. member states. Chinese President Jiang Zemin is
expected to make a statement expounding China's stance on
important international issues at the opening session.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Sends Transfer Reform Proposal to EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- FIFA has sent the European
Union (EU) details of its proposals to allow soccer players
greater freedom to change clubs, the world governing body in
Zurich said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU's Executive Commission is investigating complaints that
the transfer system is illegal. In response, FIFA and European
governing body UEFA made new proposals last Thursday, including
the scrapping of transfer fees for players older than 24.
</P>
<P>
FIFA spokesman Andreas Herren said: "The response on behalf of
the joint FIFA working group has been sent.
</P>
<P>
"In the letter, it was pointed out that the football
authorities would be ready to take up the points with the European
Commission at a suitable date."
</P>
<P>
Players in the top European leagues are not required to serve
out their contracts with a club if another team is willing to pay
a transfer fee to hire them. The fees help to defray the large
sums clubs shell out to sign top players, most of whom play under
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Fees could vanish, however, because the EC, the executive arm
of the European Union, wants to bring soccer into line with
regular EU employment laws. Under those laws, any employee within
the member nations should be allowed to quit at any time even
while under contract, and employers should not have the power to
demand a fee.
</P>
<P>
To avoid players hopping from one club to another -- with no
compensation paid to the last club -- the soccer task force
suggested a minimum one-year stay with a team.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese religious leaders
delegation to the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and
Spiritual Leaders has fulfilled its mission by adhering to
principles and making friends.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Ismail Amat made the remarks today at a
workshop to welcome back the Chinese religious leaders and noted
figures who attended the conference in the United States from
August 28-31.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was presided over by Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and head of the United Front
Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Ismail Amat highlighted the efforts by the CPC
and the government in protecting human rights, implementing the
policy of freedom of religious beliefs, safeguarding the
legitimate rights and interests of religious people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to create greater public awareness about
the status of religious people in China, which has been much
misunderstood by foreigners due to massive distortions by the
western media, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation consists of seven main leaders of Buddhism,
Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Christianity, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, these religious leaders briefed other
participants on freedom of religious beliefs in China,
counterattacking western anti-China forces, and explaining a
number of issues on religions in China.
</P>
<P>

country to adhere to the principle of independently running
religious affairs in accordance with the Constitution, foster
patriotic and religious people, and increase exchanges with the
rest of the world.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A project was launched today
in south China's Guangdong Province to protect the Dongjiang River,
the major water source for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen reservoir on Dongjiang River provides 80 percent
of Hong Kong's fresh water. With the rapid economic development
and growing population and urbanization along the river, water
pollution has become a pressing issue.
</P>
<P>
The project, sponsored by the China Youth Foundation, is aimed
to raise money across China and mobilize the whole of society to
support tree planting at the middle and upper reaches of the
Dongjiang River.
</P>
<P>
According to sources here, the Guangdong provincial government
plans to invest 4.7 billion yuan (566 million U.S. dollars) to
build an 80-kilometer-long sealed water transportation pipeline on
the upper reaches of the reservoir in the coming three years to
improve the water quality in the Shenzhen reservoir.
</P>
<P>
At today's inauguration ceremony, 1.2 million yuan was donated
to plant trees along the river.

<HEADLINE> Development of Grassroots Democracy in Cities Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Chunyun, a vice
chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), has urged to promote grassroots democracy among
neighborhood committees in cities.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the remark
recently, when he led a group of lawmakers to inspect the
implementation of the Law on the Organization of Urban Residents'
Committee in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
As the head of a team of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), Jiang inspected a number of local
neighborhood committees in this metropolis in east China.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers were informed that local community committees
have carried out the law since it came into force on January 1,
1990.
</P>
<P>
Currently, democratic elections have been popular among local
grassroots authorities as some local community committees have
adopted direct elections and tried new systems in running
neighborhood affairs.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with local officials, the NPC Standing Committee
vice chairman emphasized the importance of building the grassroots
regime by quoting President Jiang Zemin as saying, "If the
foundation is not secure, then the earth will move and the
mountains will sway."
</P>
<P>
The law involves 400 million urbanites and over 70 million of
China's "floating population" in the country, said the lawmaker
who reiterated the importance of the law for developing grassroots
democracy.
</P>
<P>
He urged local community committees to study new problems which
have emerged with the development of the market economy in China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Says Macao SAR Operates Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
stationed here said Wednesday that the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) has been operating well over the past
eight months since its founding.
</P>
<P>
"The SAR has shown a good beginning in the eight months and its
remarkable achievements have been commended by the central
government and won favorable comments from various social aspects,
" said Wang Qiren, director of the Liaison Office of the Central
People's Government in the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks at a gathering of local people who
organized a preparatory committee for celebrating the 51st
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren said that the administrative, legislative and
judicial organs of the SAR are carrying out smooth work in
accordance with the Basic Law. Macao people have taken an active
part in managing their won affairs and the concept of "Macao
people governing Macao" has been realized well.
</P>
<P>
He noted that public security has been improved markedly and
local economy has shown signs of revival. With better discipline
and more cooperation with police forces in neighboring areas,
police in the SAR have succeeded in cracking a number of criminal
cases.
</P>
<P>
As a result of improving security environment, the SAR
attracted 4.3 million tourists in the first half of this year, an
increase of 20.8 percent over the same period last year. In the
meantime, export and import volumes rose by 13.8 percent and 4
percent, and the investment from outside exceeded 100 million
patacas (12.5 million U.S. dollars). It is expected that the
momentum of economic recovering will maintain in the latter half
of this year.
</P>
<P>
With regard to foreign relations, the SAR's chief executive
made official visits to France, Portugal and Singapore, which
demonstrated the new outlook of the SAR and promoted economic and
cultural cooperation with these areas, Wang Qiren said. The facts
show that Deng Xiaoping's "one country, two systems" concept and
the principles of "Macao people governing Macao" and a high degree
of autonomy in Macao are rather correct, he said.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have
located the gene responsible for insulin-dependent (type I)
diabetes for the first time in the world, which may help prevent
and cure the disease.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough was brought about by a U.S.-Israeli joint
research program participated by local researchers in Haifa and
their U.S. colleagues at the University of Colorado, according to a
press release issued on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the past seven years, the research team had been studying the
genome of a large Bedouin family living in northern Israel, 30
percent of whom had type I diabetes.
</P>
<P>
The news release sent by leading researcher Dr. Pnina Vardi,
head of the endocrinology and juvenile diabetes department at the
Lin Clinic in Haifa said that researchers found that all members
who were affected with or carriers of the disease have the same "
diabetes" gene on the number 10 chromosome.
</P>
<P>
The Human Genome Project, an international research effort to
characterize the genomes of human and selected model organisms
through complete mapping and sequencing of their DNA, had named the
gene IDDM 17 (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 17).
</P>
<P>
The team has recently obtained the data about the family's
relatives in Jordan and found them also have a high rate of type I
diabetes. The team now plans to examine blood-test data in Jordan
and identify the origin of the gene.
</P>
<P>
Type I diabetes is a hereditary, autoimmune disease, in which
the body's immune system mistakenly identifies islet cells in the
pancreas as "foreigners" and kills them. The islet cells are
responsible for making insulin, a hormone that helps cells take in
the glucose they need.
</P>
<P>
As a result, glucose builds up in the patients' blood, and they
have to get daily injections of insulin for survival.

MANILA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Deployment of Filipino workers
around the globe totaled 459,832 in the first six months of this
year compared to 459,278 in the same period in 1999, the
Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The POEA said in a report that deployment of overseas Filipino
workers (OFWs) exhibited increases in Asia, although deployment in
Taiwan declined sharply to 32,331 this year from 49,025 last year,
or by 34.05 percent.
</P>
<P>
Deployment to Europe for the first semester of 2000 rose by 28.
83 percent to 22,912 from 17,784 in the same period of 1999, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
In the Middle East, there was a decline in deployment to Saudi
Arabia, from 115,895 last year to 106,816 this year. But there
were increases in deployment to Israel, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, more OFWs found jobs in Equatorial Guinea, from 120
last year to 629 this year or an increase of 424.17 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Oceania, OFW deployment increased in Australia, Nauru, New
Zealand and Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are more than 6 million Filipinos
working or living abroad and they remit about 7 billion U.S.
dollars back to the Philippines every year.

<HEADLINE> India Sets Date for Opening IDD Sector to Private Participation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This announcement was to send "a strong signal to overseas
investors on the eve of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's
visit to the United States", said the semi-official Press Trust of
India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
The Indian Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by
Vajpayee decided to open the sector for private participation in
an attempt to attract foreign investment and bring down
international long distance call tariff.
</P>
<P>
As a compensation for ending the monopoly ahead of schedule,
VSNL, a state-owned telecom carrier, has been offered a national
long distance operations license and an "A" category license for
Internet Service Provider, Indian Communications Minister Ram
Vilas Paswan told the press here following the announcement.
</P>
<P>
According to the PTI, the Indian government had entered into a
Memorandum of Understanding with VSNL for a 10-year monopoly in
international voice traffic in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In July and August this year, the Indian government had
announced the opening of domestic long distance telephone service
to private sector and had set relevant rules.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Hands Over Rebel Bodies After Fierce Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
on Wednesday handed over the bodies of 36 Tamil Tiger rebels who
were killed in the latest round of fierce fighting to the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
Military spokesman Brigadier Sanath Karunaratne said the bodies
of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels were handed over
the ICRC in the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
He said the bodies were part of 69 bodies collected by the
troops while consolidating their newly captured positions at
Colombuturai in the eastern outskirts of Jaffna town which was the
scene of heavy fighting on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
ICRC spokesman Harsha Gunawardena confirmed that they had taken
36 bodies and would give over to the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE had said that they were holding bodies of 50
government soldiers, but there was no immediate reaction from the
rebels on the swap of bodies.
</P>
<P>
The offensive began on Sunday when thousands of troops - backed
by ground attack aircraft - advanced into Colombuturai, Sarasalai,
Maduvil and Nunavil which were lost to the rebels earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said the LTTE rebels had launched two
ferocious counter-attacks against military positions at
Colombuturai on Monday, but were repelled.
</P>
<P>
The military put its losses at 132 soldiers killed with some
800 wounded while claiming to have killed some 300 rebels of
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and wounded another 300.
</P>
<P>
Military officials and diplomats said the latest fighting was
linked with general elections on October 10 and more fighting is
expected before the elections.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE is fighting a 17-year war against majority Sinhalese
dominated government in a bid to carve out a separate state for
minority Tamils in the country's north and east. More than 60,000
people have been killed in the ethnic war.

<HEADLINE> Some Restrictions to Be Lifted on British Pigs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Experts on Wednesday proposed
lifting some of the restrictions placed on British pigs after an
outbreak of swine fever in the country.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) Standing Veterinary Committee gave a
favorable opinion to two proposals by the European Commission, the
executive body of the EU, paving the way for the lifting of some
of the bans.
</P>
<P>
The favorable opinion was given despite the fact that another
case of swine fever was confirmed on Monday in East Anglia,
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The commission is expected to adopt the proposals within the
next few days to actually lift the restrictions placed on the
movement of pigs within Britain and to elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Once adopted, the proposals will lift the restriction set on
September 15 on pig movement in Essex if veterinary controls show
the absence of the disease in the area.
</P>
<P>
The proposals will also allow the slaughter of pigs in the area
surrounding the District of Old Buckenham in Norfolk, where all
pig movements had been banned due to the outbreak of swine fever
early August.
</P>
<P>
The meat of slaughtered pigs can be marketed if they pass the
rigorous veterinary controls that have been established for this
purpose.
</P>
<P>
The commission has encouraged British pig-raising farmers to
continue their cooperation with the veterinary authorities to
successfully eradicate the disease as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
The commission warned, however, that further outbreaks of the
disease are expected in the coming days and urged continued
caution and strict controls.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Prices Reach Historical Level: EU Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official of
the European Union (EU) said on Wednesday that the crude oil
prices have reached historical levels since the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Loyola de Palacio, vice-president of the European Commission
that serves as the executive body of the 15-nation EU, said in a
special information note sent to the commission that it would be
necessary to analyze the impact of the oil price hike on economic
growth and inflation in the EU.
</P>
<P>
The big rise of oil prices posted since early 1999 has
triggered a debate in the EU on the three components of crude oil
prices including refining, distribution and taxation on oil
products.
</P>
<P>
Palacio, who is in charge of transport and energy, said that
the price hike was clearly due to the production restriction
policy adopted by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices now seemed determined to fluctuate within a
band of 30 U.S. dollars a barrel and it entered that band in
February following an uninterrupted rise since December 1998 when
the crude oil price bottomed out at 10 dollars a barrel, she said.
</P>
<P>
Fadhil Chalabi, executive director of the Center for Global
Energy Studies, also warned, "If OPEC does not increase its
production, prices will go very high until the peak of the winter.
Prices may even exceed 40 dollars a barrel."
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's trading, crude oil price for October delivery rose
as much as 0.72 dollars a barrel to 34.1 dollars on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Except for a brief high of 34.37 dollars a barrel in March, the
price on Tuesday was the highest since oil prices surged in late
1990 before the Gulf War.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Xu Mingyang, vice-chairman of
the Tibet autonomous regional people's government, said today that
the stance of the regional government on the issue of the Dalai
Lama has always been consistent with that of the central
government.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Erwin Marschwski, a German parliament member
from the Union Party, Xu said the Dalai Lama's activity of
splitting the motherland has never ceased.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama advocates Tibet's independence at one time and
offers for negotiations on the other considering changes in the
international situation, Xu said, adding, however, the Dalai Lama'
s final purpose is to split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He said the central government's position on the issue of the
Dalai Lama is clear-cut, that is, the door for dialogues is always
open, but the precondition is that the Dalai Lama must abandon his
stand for "Tibet independence," stop his separatist activities,
and openly recognize Tibet as an inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
Marschwski and his party are on a five-day visit to Tibet.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Exchanges and
Clearing Limited (HKEx) has reported an unaudited consolidated
profit after taxation of 554 million HK dollars (71 million U.S.
dollars) for the six months ended June 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Average daily turnover value on the stock market rose by 134
percent to 14.8 billion HK dollars (1.9 billion U.S. dollars) in
the period from January to June 2000, compared to the first six
months of 1999, while average daily trading volume on the futures
market fell by 36 percent to 19,223 contracts.
</P>
<P>
Group turnover for the first half of the year was 1,227 million
HK dollars (157.3 million U.S. dollars), up 50 percent from a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
"The process of integrating the businesses of the group's
subsidiaries will continue in the second half of the current
financial year," said Charles Lee, HKEx chairman.
</P>
<P>
"As a substantial part of the group's income is from
transaction levy, clearing and settlement fees and interest income
on margin funds, the results for the second six months of the
current financial year will be highly dependent on the level of
activity on the Stock Exchange and Futures Exchange," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
"HKEx made good progress during the first six months of its
financial year as Hong Kong's economy continued to improve after
some two years of recession," said Kwong Ki-chi, HKEx chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
"The economic forecasts for Hong Kong, and internationally, are
generally positive," Kwong noted. "These give cause for feeling
reasonably optimistic about HKEx's results for the whole year."

<HEADLINE> Israelis Support Peace Process, Differ in Details: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Most Israelis in general
support the peace process with Arab countries, but they differ in
details of such a peace, a survey published Wednesday by Israel's
Independent Media Review and Analysis showed.
</P>
<P>
The data, compiled by the Center for Peace Research at Tel Aviv
University, also showed that majority Israelis think that the peace
process is not the most urgent affair facing the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The survey interviewed 508 people, a representative sampling of
the adult Jewish population (including settlers in the West Bank),
by phone at the end of August, and its margin of error is about 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
It showed that a consolidating majority of 72.2 percent said
that they support peace between Israel and the Arabs in general,
while only 19.8 percent said they are opponents of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
However, when asked about opinions on the Oslo agreement, which
was signed seven years ago and began the peace process between
Israel and the Palestinians, only 36.4 percent of Israelis said
that they are "heavily in favor" or "considerably in favor" of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five percent of Israelis said they are "considerably
opposed" or "heavily opposed" such an accord, while 15.6 percent
are "in the middle".
</P>
<P>
Forty-five percent of the interviewees said that they do not
believe the Oslo accords will bring about peace between Israel and
the Palestinians in the coming years, while only 35.6 percent said
they do believe peace will come because of the accord.
</P>
<P>
The survey further showed that majority Israelis (50.4 percent)
are more pessimistic about the peace after the Camp David summit
between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to reach any
agreement in July.
</P>
<P>
Only 34.2 percent said that they are more optimistic after than
before the summit.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Palestinians' plan to declare independence, most
Israelis (56.3 percent) agree to the Palestinians' right of self-
determination in general.
</P>
<P>
However, when asked "would you agree to the establishment of a
Palestinian state whose capital is eastern Jerusalem if this
removed the last thing in the way of true peace between Israel and
the Palestinians," less than one-third (32.4 percent) of those
responded positively.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem, which hosts the holiest sites of both
Jews and Muslims, has been the stumbling block in the peace track.
Israel claims the city its "eternal and undivided capital," while
the Palestinians want at least East Jerusalem, which Israel
occupied in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of their future
state.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that most Israelis doubt Palestinians'
sincerity for peace -- 75.8 percent of them think that even if
Israel agrees to the establishment of a Palestinian state whose
capital is East Jerusalem, a peace agreement will not be easy to be
reached as the Palestinians will "come with additional demands."
</P>
<P>
Majority Israelis (54.2 percent) also prefer to close border
between Israel and a future Palestinian state if the two could
reach a peace agreement, showing a trend of isolationism.
</P>
<P>
On another peace front, Israelis who believe there will be peace
with Syria in the coming years are more than those who don't
believe ( 41.9 percent versus 37.7 percent).
</P>
<P>
However, only 23.8 percent of Israelis support a full Israeli-
Syrian peace treaty in exchange for full withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, a strategic plateau which Israel occupied in the 1967
Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks hit a snag in January due to the
differences over the withdrawal from the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the poll showed that only 18.3 percent of interviewees
think that peace is the most important problem today in Israel. In
contrast, 55.4 percent of them think that it should be the internal
tension between various parts of the nation and economic and
unemployment situation.
</P>
<P>
It would be a warning signal to Barak, who put the peace process
highly on his national agenda.
</P>
<P>
Barak now only controls one-third seats of Israel's 120-member
parliament because of a series resignations by right-wing ruling
partners, such as Shas, National Religious Party, and Yisrael
Ba'aliya, for their objection to the Camp David summit.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Airs Reserved Backing for Constitution Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Moshe
Katsav said on Wednesday that he supports enacting a constitution
for Israel which involves legislating basic laws but this must not
be done in haste while the government does not enjoy a
parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
Katsav was commenting on Prime Minister Ehud Barak's initiative
to deliver a constitution within a year's time as part of his
national civic reform agenda which he unveiled for the first time
in August.
</P>
<P>
The president, who took the largely ceremonial post in early
August, backtracked his criticism that he levied on Barak's reform
plan in a speech at an Israel Bar Association meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Would it be right to say that for 52 years we were wrong, and
now we must correct this terrible injustice, and we must hurry and
do it even when there is no broad consensus?" Katsav, formerly a
member of the opposition Likud, was quoted by The Jerusalem Post as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He told Israel Radio on Wednesday that he favors talks between
different sectors of the population to avoid split in the nation.
</P>
<P>
The president who had vowed to steer clear of politics and focus
his efforts on national unity, said that he was meeting with many
sectors of the society from left to right and stressed a dialog
between different social sectors is always legitimate.
</P>
<P>
The constitution envisaged by Barak will deal with such issues
as civil marriages, national service for all and the abolition of
the Ministry of Religious Affairs.
</P>
<P>
As the first step to implement the civil reform program, the
Israeli government Sunday unanimously endorsed the disbanding of
the Ministry of Religious Affairs which was originally under the
control of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party.
</P>
<P>
Israel has not formulated a complete constitution since its
creation 52 years ago, and has been in operation under a set of
basic laws.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Arabia is studying a list of economic sectors
that will remain off limits to foreign investors under a new
investment law, the Arab News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The recommended list bars foreigners from fully owning projects
in exploration and oil drilling, insurance, estate investment in
the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, media sectors as well as
military equipment.
</P>
<P>
It also includes telecommunications, fishing, sea and air
shipping, space projects and services related to pilgrimage, the
paper added.
</P>
<P>
"This list is not final and could be amended with sectors added
or taken out, and it is expected to be announced in the next few
weeks."
</P>
<P>
The kingdom, the world's largest oil producer, last month
announced it had identified the sectors in which foreign investors
would be allowed full ownership, but gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
The new investment law, approved in April and aimed to attract
foreign capital, for the first time allowed foreigners to fully own
projects.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The first fully Internet-operated bank opened its
service in Turkey on Tuesday, the Hurriyet daily reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank, all transactions to be made through Internet, was
named Fibank, an affiliated branch to Turk Sakura Bank which was
bought by Turkish Fiba Holding Company last November.
</P>
<P>
Cenk Tulumen, general director of Fibank, said that the Internet
will enable the bank to provide uninterrupted service to customers
24 hours a day and seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
"We are not the first bank which is offering services on the
Internet. However, other banks use Internet as a complementary
service. Fibank will be using the Internet and all Internet-related
technologies as the only means of service," he said.

<P>
TEHRAN -- Per capita fish consumption in Iran is only 4.6
kilograms, far below the average fish consumption in the third
world countries which stands at 13.5-14 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
While the amount of fish consumed in Iran's coastal provinces is
close to the average, fish has no place in the diet of Iranians
living in the central provinces, according to the country's
fisheries organization.
</P>
<P>
Currently over 412,000 tons of fish are produced yearly in Iran,
with the figure expected to increase to 695,000 tons in the next
five years, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syria's olive production this season stood at 866,
000 tons, up by 10.3 percent from 785,000 tons in the previous
season.
</P>
<P>
The country's olive-cultivated area is estimated at 470,000
hectares, while the number of olive trees at 63 million, including
38 million fruitful trees, the official Tishrin daily reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that the olive-cultivated area in 2005 is
expected to reach 600,000 hectares, and 700,000 hectares in 2010.
The total amount of olive trees will rise to 72 million by the year
2005, including 52 million fruitful trees.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's 2000-Year-Old Sculptures in Danger of Ruin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have sounded an
alarm against damages caused to Turkey's famous 2000-year-old
sculptures on Mount Nemrut, reported the Anatolia News Agency on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Sencer Sahin from Akdeniz University complained that
mass tourism had caused the damages to the ancient sculptures.
</P>
<P>
Mount Nemrut, which is in southeastern Adiyaman province, and
its environs are a National Park and have been included in the
UNESCO's list of World Cultural Heritage.
</P>
<P>
If tourism is not kept under control, the historical objects
will be completely destroyed in the next 20 years, Sahin warned.
</P>
<P>
Sahin suggested that the sculptures should be moved to a closed
place and protected indoors.
</P>
<P>
German archaeologist Professor Hans-Gert Bachmann said that he
had been coming to the Nemrut Mountain for a lot of times since
1956, adding that, unfortunately, each time he comes he finds new
damages.
</P>
<P>
Mount Nemrut National Park is one of Turkey's most attractive
tourist destinations in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
On the summit of Mount Nemrut, the highest mountain in Northern
Mesopotamia at 2,150 meters, sits the gigantic funerary sanctuary
erected in the first century B.C. by King Antiochus 1 of Commagene.
</P>
<P>
An artificial tumulus is flanked by terraces on which rest the
colossal statues of Apollo, Zeus, Hercules, Tyche and Antiochus.

<HEADLINE> 800,000 Girls Enrolled in Primary Schools in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 14,000 primary
schools for girls were opened in Pakistan and their enrollment
rose by 800,000 during the past year, the Associated Press of
Pakistan (APP) reported on Wednesday.

than 1,000 girls' schools were opened.
</P>
<P>
APP quoted Sources as saying that the government has a renewed
focus on the uplift of women with a thrust on female literacy as
education plays an important role to bring the women in the
mainstream of national development process.
</P>
<P>
The present government is giving priority to education and will
achieve the 60 percent literacy rate from the present 47 percent
by the year 2003. This has been revealed under a newly formulated
comprehensive Action Plan prepared by the Ministry of Education
which envisages priority to education at the grass-root level.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Recovers on Govt Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MANILA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso slightly
recovered against the U.S. dollar Wednesday after the central bank
provided dollar liquidity in the market.
</P>
<P>
The peso closed at 45.500 pesos to the dollar, stronger
compared with the previous close of 45.595 pesos.
</P>
<P>
Rafael Buenaventura, governor of the Central Bank of the
Philippines, said the central bank has unloaded dollars in the
currency market to arrest the peso's further fall.
</P>
<P>
"We provided some liquidity to jump start the market. We
provide liquidity from time to time," Buenaventura said. But he
declined to disclose how much the central bank unloaded to the
spot market.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that the central bank's move "will not be a
whole-scale intervention," stressing that its actions will be
meant to ensure that the currency market does not become "the
playground of speculators."
</P>
<P>
He added that monetary authorities are looking at the
possibility of raising interest rates as an option to lift the
local unit.
</P>
<P>
The peso fell to a low of 45.840 in intra-day trading
Wednesday after closing to a record low of 45.595 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Total volume reached a hefty 162.7 million dollars throughout
Tuesday's session.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno said the government is
closely monitoring the movements of other currencies in the region
and the rest of the world, in determining what course of action to
take, to prevent the peso from further sliding.
</P>
<P>
Puno also noted that the depreciation of the peso is not an
unexplainable phenomenon, noting that the economic activities in
the country could explain the great demand for dollars.
</P>
<P>
"There is an increase in dollar demand because of intensified
corporate activity. This may be correlated to the fact that the
gross national product rose by about 4.6 percent (in the second
quarter)," said Puno.

<HEADLINE> ADB Sets Up Philippine Country Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
announced Wednesday that it has established a Philippine Country
Office at its headquarters in Manila in a bid to strengthen its
relationship with the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Country Office will be dedicated to the ADB's
operations in the Philippines and its 10-strong staff will be the
contact point with the government, the private sector and civil
society for operational purposes, the ADB said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the new country office -- which will be
fully operational in a month -- will be headed by Gunter Hecker,
an German economist who has been with the ADB for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
"Our major responsibilities will be to liaise more closely with
the government to strengthen our program, to better monitor
project implementation and to ensure that loans and technical
assistance grants achieve their objectives," Hecker said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB's strategy for the Philippines focuses on governance
issues and assistance to the rural and social (education ad health)
sectors as well as finance and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Over the next three years, the ADB expects to approve projects
totaling over 1 billion U.S. dollars for these sectors. The
projects will be designed to help the poor in less developed
regions such as Mindanao, said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Ensure Trade With COMESA After Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will make
special arrangements with some members of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to ensure healthy trade
relations with them after its official retreat from the regional
group last Friday, newspapers here reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania will continue to trade with some COMESA members "
because they are either neighbors or traditional trading partners",
said the country's Minister for Industry and Trade Iddi Simba.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania will establish special bilateral agreements
with some member countries of the regional trade bloc to offset
any shortfalls that could be suffered after its withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The new bilateral arrangements will give Tanzania an
opportunity to continue trading with strategic partners in COMESA
and ensure that goods of the same value are exchanged, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania will also take into consideration rates of customs
duty to be charged in COMESA states to achieve a free trade area
effective on October 1, the minister said, adding that his country
has struck an 80 percent cut on exercise duty rates under a COMESA
initiative and will continue to implement reductions.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania will fulfill its previous obligations to COMESA such
as paying debts depending, however, on the economic situation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania opted to move out of COMESA because it did not
feel that it benefited much from the organization, noting that
Tanzania's imports from its member countries last year amounted to
some 128 million U.S. dollars but its exports only recorded 47
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Apart from this, he said, the objectives of COMESA are similar
to those of the Southern African Development Community and the
East African Community to which Tanzania is a member. Overlapped
membership obligations have become a burden to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1994, COMESA is aimed at strengthening the
market and economic cooperation in the eastern and southern Africa
region.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania announced its plan to quit COMESA early last year.

<P>
HANGZHOU, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Today is a special day for 50
Chinese middle school students in Jinhua in east China's Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
After completing their senior high school education, which
lasts three years, at the middle school attached to Zhejiang
Normal University (ZHNU), they are to receive their higher
education directly at the ZHNU without taking the national college
and university entrance examination. All the students who attend
ZHNU go there specifically to become teachers.
</P>
<P>
"Usually, all middle school students who want to receive a
higher education in colleges and universities must take the
entrance examination," said Zhang Yunsheng, principal of the
Jinhua No.2 Middle School.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in China to provide such entrance exam-
free opportunities for middle school students, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Through recommendations, exams prior to graduation, and
approval from middle school officials, the 50 students were
selected from 1,000 candidates across the province, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the three years, the middle school students will finish all
courses required by the middle school teaching system. Meanwhile,
the school will offer them diversified training programs.

<HEADLINE> Red Tide Hits South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A red tide has been spotted
in the sea waters of Daya Bay off south China's Guangdong Province
since September 3.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, it is the second and the most
severe red tide reported in the South China Sea off northeastern
Guangdong this summer.
</P>
<P>
Nanhai Branch of the State Oceanic Administration said today
that the red tide first occurred in the sea waters near Aotou Town
in Huizhou on Sunday and extended 30 square kilometers today, 1.5
times larger than the red tide area in mid August.
</P>
<P>
The russet spots mainly consists of luminous algae, which
produces no toxins.
</P>
<P>
But the outbreak of the red tide is detrimental to the survival
of fish and other marine life.
</P>
<P>
According to specialists with the Nanhai Branch, the red tide
was mainly caused by industrial waste water and sewage discharged
into Daya Bay.
</P>
<P>
However, torrential rains in the region these days also swept a
large amount of organic substances containing nitrogen and
phosphor into the offshore areas, making the marine environment
ideal for the growth of non-toxic algae, they said.
</P>
<P>
Relevant local departments were urged to pay closer attention
to red tide development in the offshore areas where hot weather
and low air pressure continue to prevail.

BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed strong

</P>
<P>
When commenting on the so-called 2000 report on international

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said that such a
report has made indiscreet and irresponsible remarks on the

It also disregarded the fact that the Chinese government
protects citizens' freedom of religion and belief as well as
normal religious activities according to the law.
</P>

The report grossly interfered in China's internal affairs, and
unreasonably attacked China's religious policies and freedom by

<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 300 discarded mini-
buses, regarded as a serious traffic hazard in the Chinese capital,
were sent to the scrap heap today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Mini-buses has become somewhat of a permanent fixture on
Beijing roads since the late 1980s. However, accidents caused by
these buses have increased in recent years, due to a combination
of poor drivers and poor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has 3,800 mini-buses owned by 33 enterprises. Although
the number of mini-buses only accounts for 0.26 percent of
automobiles in the city, violation of traffic regulations by mini-
buses makes up 2.5 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Ma Zhenchuan, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Public
Security Bureau, said today's destruction of these mini-buses
demonstrates Beijing's determination to better improve traffic on
the capital's roads.
</P>
<P>
Ma said during the first half of the year, mini-buses received
49,000 fines for violating traffic regulations.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jordan Works on Resuming Flights to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is now negotiating with
the United Nations on the resumption of flights to Iraq, Jordanian
Minister of Transport Mohammad Kalaldeh said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA),
the visiting Jordanian minister said that the U.N. is expected to
respond to the intention some time next month.
</P>
<P>
Kalaldeh said that during his "fruitful and fraternal" talks
with Iraqi Minister of Transport and Communications Ahmad Murtadha
Ahmad Khalil on Wednesday, they discussed the resumption of air
navigation between the two Arab neighbors, as well as the
possibility of running an airline between them.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Khalil stressed that there is no U.N. resolution
banning civil flights to or from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian minister, along with Minister of Trade and
Industry Wasif Azar, arrived here on Monday evening for a four-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with the Jordanian delegation, Iraqi Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan hailed Jordan's stance on calling for
lifting the decade-old U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan visited Jordan in July and met with Jordanian King
Abdullah Bin Hussein. It was the first time that Abdullah met a
senior Iraqi official since he assumed the throne in February last
year, and this has been regarded as a decisive policy shift of
Jordan toward President Saddam Hussein's regime.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Ramadan asked the Jordanian monarch to
resume flights to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
There has been disagreement over how the U.N. economic sanctions
apply to passenger flights, which are not specifically mentioned in
the sanctions resolutions which were approved in August 1990 to
punish Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the practice has been that all those wishing to
fly to Iraq must inform the U.N. Sanctions Committee in advance.
</P>
<P>
There is, however, disagreement over whether the authorization
of the U.N. committee is actually necessary. The United States and
Britain say that it is, while France says it is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Iraq rejects any interpretation of the U.N.
sanctions as implying an air embargo.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Attorney-General Raps Shas Mentor for Holocaust Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Attorney-General
Elyakim Rubinstein on Wednesday criticized the spiritual leader of
the ultra-Orthodox Shas party for his remarks about the Holocaust
last month and reminded him to be more careful.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein's words came in response to appeals to him by several
dozen citizens for bringing Rabbi Ovadia Yosef to trial.
</P>
<P>
In a weekend sermon in early August broadcast on Shas' pirate
radio, Rabbi Yosef said that the 6 million Jews that perished in
the Nazi Holocaust were reincarnated souls of those who had sinned.
</P>
<P>
The comment evoked fiery protests from across the country which
is now home to 230,000 Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein had sent a letter to Rabbi Yosef, saying he felt the
remarks might distract attention from the seriousness of the Nazis'
crimes.
</P>
<P>
The rabbi had not broken the law, he said, but he should be
careful about causing sufferings to the Holocaust survivors who
have already suffered so much.
</P>
<P>
"A broadcast to a mass audience obliges one to be extremely
careful and extremely sensitive," Rubinstein said.
</P>
<P>
The attorney-general, who is an Orthodox Jew himself, contained
a personal tone in the letter to Shas as he referred to the fact
that he was the son of Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
The letter drew a sharp response from Shas circles. The party
issued a statement charging that Rubinstein had long ago targeted
Shas and its leaders.
</P>
<P>
"Rubinstein has become the representative of those who hate the
religious, like (the secular Shinui Party leader) Tommy Lapid,"
said a Shas spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Intensive Human Activities Threaten Birds in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Intensive human activities
pose great threat to the survival of the rich bird species in
Africa, the New Vision newspaper quoted researchers as saying on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 researchers, who are attending the five-day 10th Pan
African Ornithological Congress at Makerere University in the
Ugandan capital Kampala, said land management practices and
destruction of natural forests have brought negative impact on the
large bird population.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan researcher Eric Sande told the conference that logging
and hunting in the Budongo Forest have made the Francolin birds
the second most endangered species in the country.
</P>
<P>
Francolins, like the size of chickens, are fairly large birds,
which breed in natural forest areas mainly on the buttress roots
of large mahogany trees.
</P>
<P>
Budongo is the largest tropical rain forest in Uganda, where
extensive logging is carried out to obtain mahogany, regarded as
one of the best quality of timber.
</P>
<P>
"The law in Uganda protects forests, but it allows some
exploitation," said Sande, adding that "logging is a threat to
bird breeding in Budongo."

<HEADLINE> Angola to Modernize Means of Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Angolan civil servants will
start receiving their salaries through electronic cards as from
November, which is considered as the first step toward the
modernization of the means of payment in the country, said
Director for Issuing and Credit Jorge Leao Peres of the National
Bank of Angola (BNA).
</P>
<P>
Jorge Peres was quoted on Wednesday by the official news agency
Angop as saying that high-ranking government officials, army and
police officers, holders of senior posts in the civil service are
the first beneficiaries of the new system.
</P>
<P>
With an aim to promote the modernization of the means of
payment in Angola, the government has established a Technical
Council for System of Payment, which is currently working hard for
introducing other instruments of payment.
</P>
<P>
"In most regions of the world, there are credit cards in use,
and the people are not necessary to frequent the banks to draw
money for realizing their transactions", said Jorge Peres.
</P>
<P>
But the introduction of the "electronic money" is only part of
the vast project of reforming the payment means, said the bank
official, adding that the system of payment is a conjunction of
intervenient structures that permit the circulation of money.
</P>
<P>
Given the informal component of the Angolan economy, the new
move will first concentrate on the official sectors, for the civil
service is currently the major employer in the country, and then
it will become a new credit instrument which will in future attend
to the whole public sector, according to Peres.

SYDNEY, September 6 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic Committee
(IOC) President Juan Antonio Samaranch Wednesday welcomed China's
decision to drop some athletes from its Sydney Games team.

strong Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
"I am not disappointed. I am very pleased, very happy ... that'

in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Sydney Games officials confirmed Wednesday that China had
advised them it was cutting the size of its team.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Poised to Take 19 Medals From Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Though the Dutch Olympians
were tight-lipped on what gold medals to get in Sydney, they did
trade words between themselves on how many medals to take home
from the Down Under.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen is the figure they have talked about before they set
out to the 27th version of the summer games that start on
September 15.
</P>
<P>
The figure was mentioned in that the Dutch, in their last
Olympic outing to Atlanta four years ago, got four gold, five
silver and 10 bronze to amount to that total.
</P>
<P>
Aarcel Sturkenboon, director of sports of the Sydney-bound
Dutch Olympic team, told Xinhua via telephone that though no
number of gold medals was mentioned, the Dutch athletes did talk
about what are the best medal prospects in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is expected to do extremely well in both the
men's and women's field hockey, women's water polo, judo,
equestrian, swimming and rowing, that is to say that these are the
sports from which the Dutch expect themselves to have a chance to
touch gold.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch won the gold medals in the men's field hockey, men's
eight-men rowing, mountain bike and men's volleyball in Atlanta
but Sturkenboon said that the Dutch would not bet too much on the
men's volleyball this time around.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch men spikers fared so poorly in the past year that
they merely missed the qualifying round for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
But they have been improving since, just like the rowing team
that has changed most of the rowers who competed in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is sending 240 men and women to Sydney, just
one athlete shy of its participation record posted four years ago
in Atlanta. The Dutch are to compete in 16 sports in the Sydney
games.
</P>
<P>
As far as the financial support to the team is concerned,
Sturkenboon said that the training and competition are fully
funded by the national sports lottery and the sponsorship from
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Among the 79 medal-taking countries and regions in Atlanta, the
Netherlands with 19 medals to its credit, ranked 15th overall.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Promote Asian Cup Bid in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of
Thailand (FAT) said here Wednesday that it will promote the
country's bid to host the 2004 Asian Cup while it is in Lebanon
next month for this year's tournament.
</P>
<P>
It will open a booth in Beirut, the Lebanese capital, to
conduct bidding activities during the October 12-29 tournament,
according to it.
</P>
<P>
Recently, an Asian Football Confederation (AFC) inspection team
came to Thailand and appeared to be quite impressed by the Thai
preparations, it noted.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, China and Iran are also strong competitors in
bidding to host the 2004 championships.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it said the Thai soccer team has already started
training after they returned home from Shanghai on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Head coach of the Thai soccer team Peter Withe was quoted by
FAT as saying that he is quite pleased with his team's performance
in Shanghai where Thailand came third in a four-team tournament.
</P>
<P>
He said it is important that his team steps up training if they
want to make a good performance in this year's Asian Cup.
</P>
<P>
Withe said the team will continue to train regularly in Bangkok
until September 16th when they will fly to Saudi Arabia to prepare
for the Asian Cup in the following month.
</P>
<P>
Thailand are in the same group as Lebanon, Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Withe said that although Iraq was beaten by China in the
Shanghai tournament, it had good skills and will be a strong
opponent for Thailand in the Asian Cup.

<HEADLINE> Eagle Re-appointed as Coach of S. African Olympic Tennis Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Charlton Eagle, the
former South African Tennis team coach, is expected to travel to
Sydney to join the South African Olympic tennis squad after a
written protest last week from the players in the team.
</P>
<P>
Eagle was originally part of the team to go to Sydney but, in a
series of developments that still remain something of a mystery,
he was ultimately omitted and South African Tennis Association's (
SATA's) acting chief executive officer Mohammed Sheik was named to
go as manager instead.
</P>
<P>
However, pressured by the protest from South African Olympic
tennis players, the National Olympic Committee of South Africa (
NOCSA) is now reported to have had a change of herat and Eagle,
who is now in New York at the U.S. Open, is understood to have
been asked to join the squad in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Sources have said NOCSA President Sam Ramsamy, who is in
Australia with the squad, was angered by the players' action and
hinted before he left for Sydney that they should be disciplined
for the way in which they had approached the issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the same sources also said it now appeared that
NOCSA had decided to give back the players Eagle who they believe
could make the difference to their chances of winning medals in
tennis contests in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Ferreira, Amanda Coetzer and the rest of the five-strong
squad wrote a letter last week to NOCSA and SATA requesting the
reinstatement of Eagle.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Lauds New Security Concept (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian today spoke highly of a new security concept in the Asia-
Pacific region, which gives emphasis to dialogue and consultation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the Fourth ASEAN (
Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Regional Forum (ARF)
meeting of the Heads of Defense Colleges (military schools), the
Chinese defense minister also lauded the ARF model.
</P>
<P>
"The ARF is a courageous effort in probing the ASEAN initiative
to carry out open dialogue and consultation on regional political
and security issues," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
He added that ARF members have also been able to discuss and
reconcile the different views among them in order to reduce the
risk to security.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN Regional Forum has adhered to the principles of equal
participation, seeking common ground while reserving differences,
consulted consensus and incremental approaches, according to Chi,
who is also vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and a
State Councilor.
</P>
<P>
The forum emphasizes strengthening mutual understanding and
confidence through dialogue and consultation, cementing political
security through economic exchange and cooperation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"This represents a new security concept and the multi-
polarization trend in the region," Chi said.

<P>
On the international situation, Chi said that overall the world
is becoming more relaxed, but regional flashpoints do exist.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that hegemonism and power politics have shown
new traces of development, adding that "neo-interventionism" in
the excuse of "democracy and human rights" and separatist
activities are gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
"All these will endanger or jeopardize the security and
stability of the region," he warned. "That's why we advocate that
all countries adopt the new security concept built upon equality,
dialogue, mutual confidence and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
In doing so, he further explained, nations in the world can
respect each other rather than dominate the weak, encourage
cooperation rather than confrontation, achieve consensus through
consultation rather than impose one country's will on others, and
pursue peaceful settlements to their disputes.

MACAO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Special Administrative

<P>
On behalf of the Macao SAR government, Lidia da Luz, director

departments can install computer software without official license
of utilization.
</P>
<P>
The agreement shows the Macao SAR government's respect on
intellectual property rights, and the move sets a good example for
individual firms and local residents, Lidia said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the program will benefit at least 44 departments
and save over 7 million patacas (875,000 U.S. dollars) for the

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Timepiece Industry Plays Leading Role in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The timepiece industry of
Hong Kong is playing a leading role in the world, and China's
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) will further open
up opportunities for Hong Kong's timepiece manufacturers, a Hong
Kong official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the timepiece industry of Hong Kong has
maintained the record as the world's largest exporter of watches
in terms of both value and quantity; and the largest exporter of
clocks by value and the second largest by quantity, said
Administrative Secretary Anson Chan at the opening ceremony of the
19th Hong Kong Watch and Clock Fair.
</P>
<P>
Though Hong Kong's timepiece industry has gone through two
difficult years in the way of the Asian financial turmoil, Chan
said, Hong Kong's total exports of watches and clocks picked up in
the first four months of this year, recording an increase of 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
Chan praised Hong Kong's timepiece manufacturers for their
contribution to Hong Kong's manufacturing industries. The
timepiece manufacturers "have also earned for themselves the
reputation of being flexible, diversified, timely and reliable in
delivery, and responsive to market needs and design trends," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Chan also warned that there is no room for complacency because
there are challenges from everywhere. "To hold our stake firmly in
the increasing globalized world economy, we have to stay forever
vigilant," she said.
</P>
<P>
While manufacturers are working hard on improving product
design and upgrading quality, the government is fully committed to
supporting the timepiece industry, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 million U.S. dollars has been granted under the
government's Innovation and Technology Fund to finance various
infrastructural and technological projects to facilitate the
development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Watch and Clock Technology Center, for
example, provides an environment for promoting the development,
the application and dissemination of technologies useful to the
industry, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Chan said, the opening up of the Chinese
mainland market and the likely reduction of import tariff for
timepiece items after China's accession to the WTO would offer

"Doomsayers may worry that Hong Kong's role as the middleman
will diminish once China joins the World Trade Organization. But
we see it quite differently," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Taking watch and clock industry as an example, Chan said: "
Given Hong Kong's strategic geographical location and our position
as a world renowned watch and clock production center, I am
confident that our manufacturers will be well poised for strategic
partnership with international companies to tap into the vast
markets in the Chinese mainland and in the Asia Pacific region."
</P>
<P>
The 19th Hong Kong Watch and Clock Fair, one of the world's
largest events of its kind, was opened here Wednesday to offer a
platform for timepiece manufacturers worldwide to showcase their
latest products and designs.
</P>
<P>
More than 770 timepiece manufacturers from countries and
regions, including the mainland and Taiwan of China, France, South
Korea, and India, attended the five-day annual event.

<HEADLINE> Shelve the Jerusalem Issue for Now: Israeli Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli cabinet minister
said Wednesday that in his opinion, the thorny issue of Jerusalem
should be taken out of an Israeli-Palestinian agreement for now.
</P>
<P>
Minister in Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon, who is in charge
of the Jerusalem affairs, told reporters that the issue, which had
been the bottleneck of the peace talks, should be resolved later in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The latest peace efforts between Israel and the Palestinians, a
summit between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton at Camp David
in July, collapsed mainly over significant gaps between the two
sides over the fate of Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Israel claims the holy city its "eternal and undivided" capital,
while the Palestinians want at least East Jerusalem, which Israel
occupied in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of their future
state.
</P>
<P>
Ramon, who opposed to the discussion of the issue at the current
stage even before the Camp David summit failure, argued Wednesday
that Israel will not, and can not, give up sovereignty over the
Temple Mount, which is in the stone-walled Old City in East
Jerusalem and hosts the holiest sites for Jews and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Ramon said, the Palestinians are also
expected not to move an inch back on their claims on the key issue.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the logical solution will be leaving the problem alone. If
the Jerusalem issue is no longer an issue at this point, Ramon
said, the sides could sign an agreement immediately.
</P>
<P>
Ramon made the remarks when Barak and Arafat are currently in
New York waiting for separate meetings with Clinton, which will
determinate the fate of the peace process, on the sidelines of the
United Nations Millenium Summit.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli Regional Cooperation Minister
Shimon Peres Wednesday dismissed the Palestinian proposal to make
Jerusalem an international city.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a speech made by Speaker of Palestinian
Legislative Council Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) at the European
Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday, Peres told the Israel Radio
that "Things lacking any foundation are thrown out into the air,
such as 'internationalizing' Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Qurei proposed that unless the two sides could reach an
agreement on Jerusalem, the city should be declared a unified
international city...not just the capital of Israel or Palestine,
but a capital of the world."
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, who is the most dovish minister in Barak's
cabinet, said "It's just gibberish."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Security Service's PR Plan Draws Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli General Security
Services' (Shin Bet) plan to establish a spokesman's unit to
improve its public image had drawn controversy after media revealed
it on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ya'acov Perry, former head of the Shin Bet and currently an
adviser to Prime Minister Ehud Barak, told reporters that there
is "a certain amount of danger" in appointing a spokesperson for
the security service.
</P>
<P>
Shin Bet is by nature an organization which does not want to
reveal information in advance, and such a spokesman would probably
hardly be heard after an event, said Perry. "It is problematic," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ha'aretz daily reported that the security service made
a preliminary decision to adopt a more open public relations
policy, in which a spokesman's office will be set up in two months,
and an external PR adviser will be employed.
</P>
<P>
In addition to answering questions from journalists if something
happens, the spokesman will also be responsible for initiating and
implementing ideas that would "market" the Shin Bet and enhance its
public image.
</P>
<P>
"We have to adapt ourselves to the 21st century," a senior
official of the organization said.
</P>
<P>
The move was regarded as part of a series of policy-changing
moves which are aimed to open Israel's once mysterious spy and
security service to the public in the new century and keep them
with times.
</P>
<P>
Israel's secret intelligence service Mossad began its
recruitment advertising campaign in July, a move trying to
counteract the country's flourishing hi-tech businesses'
overpowering attraction to the young talents.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Arrests 20 in Drug Bust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the operation codenamed Titan, CNB officers also recovered
Singapore currency worth 26,000 Singapore dollars (about 15,200 U.
S. dollars) as well as other currencies - ringgit, baht and rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Under Singapore law, a person convicted of illegal trafficking
heroin of more than 15 grams could be sentenced to death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The seizure was minor if compared with others scored by CNB
officers earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
In August, the Police and CNB seized 231 grams of ice, the
largest amount of the drug so far this year and the third largest
since 1998 when 460 grams were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
In July, CNB arrested two Thai nationals and seized 3,840 Yaba
tablets, making its largest ever seizure of the ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
In June, more than 500,000 Singapore dollars (about 300,000 U.S.
dollars) worth of all sorts of drugs were seized in the largest
seizure in Singapore for the last decade.

<HEADLINE> Three UNHCR Staff Killed in West Timor, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- An angry mob of pro-Jakarta
East Timorese, so-called militia, attacked and burned the
representative office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR),in Atambua, a city in Indonesia's East Nusa
Tenggara province, where three staff members were believed killed,
Antara news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place after a militiaman identified as Olivio
was found beheaded in his home Tuesday night, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The mob who brought the body of Olivio to the UNHCR, also
burned a UNHCR vehicle parked near the building, the agency quoted
witnesses as saying.
</P>
<P>
Local police chief, Superintendent S.M. Simatupang and
Commander of the Belu District Military, Let. Col. Djoko Subandrio
were in the field to pacify the mob.
</P>
<P>
"Senior pro-Jakarta East Timorese figure, Joao Tavares urged
the mob to stop their brutal actions," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as of Wednesday afternoon, the situation in Atambua
has reportedly calmed down after the body of Olivio was returned
to his residence in West Malaka sub-district.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a report said that a UNHCR staff
identified as Joseph Yeo has confirmed that his three foreign
comrades have been killed during the incident.
</P>
<P>
Following the independence of East Timor last year after 23
years of integration with Indonesia, the UNHCR has set up an
office near the border between East Nusa Tenggara and U.N.-
controlled East Timor to facilitate the return of East Timorese
refugees as well as the distribution of aid.
</P>
<P>
The pro- Jakarta East Timorese group has charged that the U.N.
body has been unfair in channeling aid to them.
</P>
<P>
They for several times launched armed attack at the U.N.
mission in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is facing mounting international criticism for
failing to rein in the militiamen, who are also entering into East
Timor to terrorize villagers.

<HEADLINE> French Parliament to Inquire on Gulf War Syndrome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A French parliament commission
will have a hearing next week with Defense Minister Alain Richard
on the possible problem of Gulf War syndrome among French veterans.
</P>
<P>
Paul Quiles, president of the French National Assembly's
Commission of Defense, said on Wednesday that his commission will
ask Richard about the existence of certain "conditions of
engagement of the French servicemen during the Gulf War which
could have brought about the specific disease."
</P>
<P>
The Gulf War syndrome has hit an estimated 100,000 veterans in
the United States, Canada and Britain, while France has not
officially reported any case among its veterans.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Figaro reported two suspected cases of Gulf War
syndrome recently, but the defense minister rejected the
allegation. He said that those veterans who fell sick after the
war all suffered from "known and clearly identified cases."
</P>
<P>
Avigolfe, a French association of "defense for the military and
civilian victims of the Gulf War," said that Gulf War syndrome has
attained France.

<HEADLINE> French Gov't to Sign Agreement With Truckers to End Oil Panic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The French government is
expected to sign on Wednesday an agreement with protesting
truckers to end two days of oil panic caused by the blockade of
oil storehouses and refineries.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Transport Jean-Claude Gayssot has agreed to
reduce fuel tax by 35 centimes (five U.S. cents) a liter this year
and 25 centimes (3.5 U.S. cents) a liter next year to compensate
for the loss of truckers and other oil-consuming workers from the
rise of fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
The three main trade unions of truckers expressed satisfaction
with the gesture of the government, and said they would consult
their members before signing the agreement at noon on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The blockade of oil storehouses and refineries has resulted in
the closure of thousands of oil stations and a general shortage of
oil supply across France except in the Paris region.
</P>
<P>
The truckers were protesting against the rise of fuel prices,
which apparently resulted from a reduction of production by oil
exporting countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Professors Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 650 professors
at Eastern Michigan University went on strike Tuesday after
contract talks broke off, causing dozens of classes to be canceled,
according to CNN late evening reports.
</P>
<P>
Lecturers not covered by the contract, who make up about 40
percent of the faculty, were expected to hold their classes as
scheduled. The fall semester began last week for the university's
23,000 students, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The contract that covers tenured and tenure-track professors
expired on Friday but was extended until midnight Monday, said
American Association of University Professors spokesman Phil
Arrington.
</P>
<P>
Some of the key issues being debated are the replacement of
full-time faculty members with part-time faculty, control over
Internet courses, and salary and benefit increases, Arrington said.
</P>
<P>
Salaries for full professors averaged 63,000 U.S. dollars in
1998-99, according to the latest figures available from the Mid-
American Conference. The average in the conference, which
represents 12 comparable public universities, was 68,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We're at the bottom of the Mid-American Conference right now,
and if you factor in the cost of living, we're even worse,"
professor Denver Severt said.
</P>
<P>
University officials said they were disappointed that faculty
broke off negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The last strike involving Eastern Michigan faculty was in 1978.

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates Anti-Doping Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- He Huixian, the spokeswoman
for the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC), said here on Wednesday
that leaving the athletes who had "suspicious blood tests"out of
the Olympic team showed China's persistent position and strong
will to fight against doping.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1998, China has introduced out-of-competition blood
tests on the athletes and kept intensifying efforts in combating
doping," He said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the COC conducted 317 out-of-competition blood
tests in 1999 on athletes from seven sports and found six samples
were above normal level.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman revealed that in the first half of 2000, the
COC conducted 167 blood tests and one was above normal level.
</P>
<P>
"For the purpose of their health and to protect the principles
of fair competition, all these athletes were disqualified from
competitions," He said.
</P>
<P>
He said China welcomes the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
's decision to check EPO in the coming Sydney Olympic Games with
both blood and urine tests.
</P>
<P>
"It is really a breakthrough for the world in combating against
doping for EPO is cancer in the sports world. The COC resolutely
supports the IOC's stand," He said.
</P>
<P>
He said that dropping the athletes who had "suspicious results
of blood tests" out of the Olympic team will support the IOC's
decision and the Sydney Olympics, which has been expected to
become a "clean" Games.
</P>
<P>
Ma Junren and six of his runners were among the athletes who
were dropped from the Chinese Olympic team. "There are multiple
reasons for Ma and his runners' disqualification," He said. "Some
of them are dropped due to suspicious blood test results."
</P>
<P>
"There's only one criteria for the COC in testing the athletes,
" He said. "Everyone is equal."
</P>
<P>
"The COC will, as always, fight doping along with the IOC and
all the other international sports organizations."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Olympic Team Leaves for Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Olympic contingent
left for Sydney in the early hours of Wednesday without its Sprint
Queen Susanthika Jayasinghe.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the contingent Sunil Gunawardena said 75 percent
of the team had been selected on merit unlike earlier when they
went as wild card entries.
</P>
<P>
World Championship silver medalist Susanthika Jayasinghe, now
based in the United States and trained by U.S. coach Tony Campbell,
will be joining the contingent after a four-day workout in Tokyo
under her coach.
</P>
<P>
She told a local newspaper: "my coach has organized a coaching
camp for all his athletes bound for Olympics, on September 7 in
Tokyo, Japan, and I too have to attend it."
</P>
<P>
The 30-member contingent, consisting of 19 competitors and 11
officials, is the largest ever to be fielded by Sri Lanka in the
Olympic Games 104-year history.
</P>
<P>
Overall captain Damayanthi Darsha said her team was determined
to perform at their brilliant best at the Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the teams departure she said: "we all are
determined to do well and bring glory to our motherland. Olympics
is not an easy task as the cream of world class sportsmen and
women vie for glory, but we are determined to do our brilliant
best."
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's 14 athletes make the major portion of the 19 member
participants which also include two swimmers, two shooters and a
yachtsman.
</P>
<P>
The last time Sri Lanka won a Olympics medal was in 1948 when
Duncan White won the silver medal in the 400 meters hurdles in the
London Olympics for Sri Lanka, then Ceylon.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Firms Urged to Expand Economic Ties with Central Asian Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 6 (Xinhua)-- Chinese enterprises, especially
those in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
should try to expand their economic and trade relations with
Central Asian nations, advised Chinese commercial counselors to
the region.
</P>
<P>
Yang Xiumin, a Chinese diplomat to Kazakhstan, said that
Xinjiang region, which boarders several Central Asian nations,
enjoys a special advantage in developing economic ties with
Central Asian nations, not just because of its geographic
proximity.
</P>
<P>
The economies in the two regions complement each other, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the trade volume from January to August
between China and Kazakhstan stands at over 800 million U.S.
dollars. China has made a total investment of some 400 million
yuan, the fifth biggest foreign investment source in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that he believes that the two sides still have
untapped potential.
</P>
<P>
Two other Chinese commercial counselors, one stationed in
Tajikistan and the other in Kyrgyzstan, hold shared Yang's view.
They also urged Chinese enterprises to do more business in Central
Asia.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak met U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Tuesday night, in preparation for his meeting
with U.S. President Bill Clinton Wednesday that is expected to go a
long way toward determining the fate of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who arrived in New York Tuesday for the U.N. Millennium
Summit amid expectations that the Middle East will be atop his
agenda, is to meet Barak for an hour Wednesday afternoon, followed
by a meeting with Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
According to officials in the Israeli delegation, Barak asked
for the meeting with Clinton first to put the ball squarely in
Arafat's court.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton will on Wednesday launch a
shuttle mission between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat in an effort
to achieve a breakthrough in the Israeli-Palestinian talks and get
the sides to sign a treaty.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's timetable has been left clear for the weekend in the
event that progress is made in New York talks and he decides to
invite Barak and Arafat to another summit meeting at Camp David,
far away from the media.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton is expected to try to persuade
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat on Wednesday
to reach a compromise regarding Jerusalem, the major stumbling
block that prevents the Israelis and Palestinians from striking a
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with leaders at the U.N. Millennium Summit, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has made it clear that he would prefer a
comprehensive permanent agreement rather than a partial one.
</P>
<P>
Barak also urged the international community to put pressure on
Arafat to show flexibility and not to support a unilateral
Palestinian declaration of an independent state slated for
September 13, if the Palestinians remain recalcitrant.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A potential fuel crisis was averted on Tuesday when the
employees of Israeli Petroleum and Energy Infrastructures Ltd.
reached an agreement with the National Infrastructure Ministry to
end an hours-long strike.
</P>
<P>
The work stoppage was initially called Tuesday afternoon to
protest the government's plan to break up and privatize the
company.

and ensure that every industry has a responsive system to upgrade skills.

encourage skills improvement through byte-sized modules at training centers established by each
sector.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is targeted at some 500,000 workers with only secondary education, those who made
up about one-third of Singapore's workforce and yet the most vulnerable to retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
The initial target is to establish 1,000 skills standards in 100 key industries and to certify
300,000 workers by 2005.

BANGKOK -- Higher oil prices and the baht 's depreciation are likely to inhibit growth in
Thailand's retail sales this year to less than 10 percent, down from the 15 percent anticipated
earlier, The Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pittaya Jear, the new president of Thai Retailers' Association,was quoted as saying the retail
business grew 10 percent in the first seven months in line with the improved economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation in the last quarter, the high season, was likely to increase no more than
5 percent if oil prices and exchange rate factors did not improve, he said.
</P>
<P>
The baht's depreciation to more than 41 baht to the U.S. dollar from 38 baht earlier this year
had raised product costs by 8 percent. The higher oil price added another 3 percent to costs,
Pittaya said.
</P>
<P>
Producers of many consumer goods such as shampoo, which are affected by higher packaging costs,
have recently asked for a 3- to 10-percent rise in prices, but retailers have asked them to postpone
 the increases for several weeks.

MANILA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Wednesday that it is hopeful the extremist Abu Sayyaf will release
the remaining batch of hostages it kidnapped from Sipadan island
in Malaysian anytime this week.

<P>
Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado said Ghalib
Andang alias Commander Robot, who leads the faction keeping the

leader Moammar Gadhafi in negotiating the release of six Western
hostages more than a week ago.

batch composed of six Europeans and a Filipino.

TIRANA -- Former Albanian President Rmiz Alija returned to
Tirana after receiving a health check-up in the United States,
thus silencing the rumor that he would apply for political asylum
in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
On arriving in Tirana, Alija told the press here that certain
media and political forces are used to starting rumors, and that
he did not "give a damn" about it. Alija went to the U.S. in July
this year for medical reasons. During his stay in the U.S., a
rumor began to circulate that "the living file for fifty years of
Albanian history" would apply for political asylum and stay in the
U.S. (Albania-Former President)

PYONGYANG -- The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
denounced the United States on Tuesday for blocking Kim Yong Nam,
president of the Presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly,
from attending the new millennium U.N. Summit scheduled in New
York from September 6 to 8.
</P>
<P>
In a public statement, the Foreign Ministry said Kim and his
party had to cancel their trip on Monday en route to New York
owing to obstructive moves of the U.S. administration authorities.
It added that the United States would have to pay a dear price for
having hurt the dignity of the Korean people. When Kim and his
party were about to board a U.S. passenger plane in Frankfurt,
Germany to travel to New York to attend the summit, American air
security agents unexpectedly showed up at the airport, claiming
that upon an order from their country, they would inspect the
members of the delegation including Kim and their belongings
because the DPRK was a "rogue nation," according to the statement.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Survey to Be Carried in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Limassol, a southern coastal
town in Cyprus, has been chosen for a World Health Organization-
funded study on AIDS (acquired immunity deficiency syndrome), local
media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, entitled "Knowledge, Perceptions and Behaviour on
AIDS, Sex and Sexually Transmitted Diseases in the Town and
District of Limassol (2000/2001)", has been classified as one of
the best proposed studies among Eastern Mediterranean countries.
</P>
<P>
The study is expected to be concluded by October among 500
Cypriots or permanent residents of the island, living in the town
and district of Limassol. Specifically, 253 women and 247 men, aged
18 to 50, have been selected to take part in the study.
</P>
<P>
It seeks to pinpoint people's sexual knowledge, beliefs and
behaviour in relation to AIDS and other sexually transmitted
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the study on Tuesday, Cyprus Health Minister Frixos
Savvides said the conclusions of the study would provide
information necessary for evaluation of the factors causing the
virus to spread in Cyprus, as well as the characteristics of
persons who may increase the risk of spreading AIDS.
</P>
<P>
He said the study will be carried out by a scientific committee,
made up of an epidemiologist, a health specialist, a psychologist
and a sociologist. Respondents will be identified only by their age
and sex.
</P>
<P>
Recent data indicates that since 1986, when the virus first
appeared in Cyprus, 680 people have been infected. Today, there are
350 AIDS virus carriers, of which 240 are Cypriots and 140
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization has congratulated Cyprus for
successfully confining the number of AIDS carriers to very low
levels, compared to international data.

<HEADLINE> Israel's EL AL Airline Should Fly on Shabbat: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Transport Minister
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak has said that Israel's state-run airline El Al
should be allowed to fly on Shabbat, or the Jewish resting days.
</P>
<P>
"A modern airline should fly every day of the week," Lipkin-
Shahak told Israel's Jerusalem Post daily, which published the
report on Wednesday edition.
</P>
<P>
According to religious laws, Jews should not fly, drive or do
anything like that on Shabbat, which lasts from Friday's sunset to
Saturday's sunset.
</P>
<P>
The national carrier reportedly suffered yearly financial loss
of 55 million U.S. dollars from this rule.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Ehud Barak had announced an ambitious
plan last month to carry out "civil reform," which may release El
Al from the problem.
</P>
<P>
The secular Meretz party, which was the left-wing in Barak's
coalition, had formally asked the prime minister to cancel a 1952
government statute, which prohibits El Al from flying on Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation of Shabbat flying ban will also help the
privatization of the national airline, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"El Al cannot be privatized without an ability to fly on
Shabbat," said Lipkin-Shahak, confirming that his ministry will
start examining the possible its privatization in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Although no specific proposals have been made so far, the
transport minister said, the airline is surely "an attractive
company for privatization."
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear whether Israel's religious society will
react harshly to the plan.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Maintain Limited Open Sky Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
maintain its limited open sky policy for foreign airline companies
whose planes are allowed to land in certain cities, an official
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"If we adopt an open sky policy, foreign aircraft will be
flying to all of Indonesia from all parts of the world and we will
lose in the competition," Director General for Air Transportation
Soenaryo Yosopratomo was quoted by Antara news agency as saying,
adding the government will in stages give the opportunity to
foreign aircraft to fly into the cities in Indonesia but by virtue
of an agreement or code sharing.
</P>
<P>
If the limited open sky policy was changed into an open one, it
would seriously affect the tourism industry, which includes hotels,
airports, travel agencies, small holder handicraft industries,
restaurants, and other transportation sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not yet ready for an open sky policy. In the next
several years we still have to improve and bolster the relevant
infrastructure, human resources, and the performance of domestic
airlines companies to become more prepared in facing competition,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
A limited open sky policy is a strategy pursued by the ministry
of transportation and telecommunications in an anticipation of
globalization in air transport and tourism. The government allows
foreign aircraft to land at the country's airports on point-to-
point basis. They are banned from domestic routes.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Tea Output Drops in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tea production in July
was 15,070 tons, a 15.7 percent drop from the same period of last
year, the Tea Board of Kenya has said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the board show that the cumulative production
for the first seven months this year stood at 123,720 tons, 12,190
tons less than the corresponding period in 1999, the People daily
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Africa Tea Brokers said cold weather and frost in some tea-
growing areas in western Kenya had inhibited the crop growth, but
it saw an improvement as warm weather sets in other key tea-
growing regions.
</P>
<P>
Tea traders in the country estimate that Kenya's tea output
this year will be 235,000 to 240,000 tons. Earlier the year,
officials forecast the output at 260,000 tons but they have
doubted that their estimate would be met due to drought and cold
weather.
</P>
<P>
Kenya tea production in 1999 was 248,000 tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government said
here Wednesday it will agree on the OPEC's (Organization Petroleum
Exporting Countries) plan to raise its oil quota production by 0.5
million barrel per day (bpd) in a bid to stabilize crude oil price
in international market.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources Purnomo Yusgiantoro
said,"We'll see whether the additional figure of 500,000 bpd will
help place the oil price at around 22 to 28 U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
"And if 500,000 bpd is successful to stabilize price as the
OPEC has targeted, there is no need to increase the production
until a half million bpd," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, director general for Oil and Gas at the ministry for
energy, Rahmat Sudibyo said of the number of the quota addition,
Indonesia will enjoy 30,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
Based on data issued by State oil and gas company Pertamina,
the country's crude oil production in April this year reached 1.4
million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia envisaged its crude oil price in international market
at around 17 to 22 U.S. dollars per barrel in the next fiscal year
of 2001.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Dips Further in Early Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso continued
to slide against the U.S. dollar early Wednesday amid lack of
fresh news to restore confidence in the local currency.
</P>
<P>
The peso averaged 45.703 pesos to the dollar, weaker compared
to the previous close of 45.595 pesos.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the peso, which has lost around 11 percent so far
this year, is also seen to test the historic low of 46.50 pesos
during the day's trading as the central bank appears reluctant to
intervene to save the peso from further weakness.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has changed from yesterday. Everybody's looking at 46
pesos already," said a dealer at a foreign bank.
</P>
<P>
The peso hit its all-time closing low on Tuesday as corporate
dollar demand soared in anticipation of a further deterioration in
the local unit.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed the peso's weakness to the weak investor
confidence amid cronyism charges in the government, budget deficit
woes and the unresolved hostage saga in the southern Mindanao
region.
</P>
<P>
"It's really a combination of everything and the government has
not done anything to sufficiently address these issues. That's why
we're already seeing a degree of panic in the market," said a
dealer at a local bank.
</P>
<P>
Total volume reached a hefty 138.2 million dollars in early
trade.

<HEADLINE> Manila Stocks End Lower on Weak Peso </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Share prices in the Philippine
Stock Exchange ended lower Wednesday on worries over the
depreciating peso and rising inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
The 30-company Phisix, the market's main index, fell 14.96
points to close at 1,527.80. The broader all-shares index also
went 2.15 points lower to 700.36.
</P>
<P>
Dealers exchanged 522.7 million shares worth some 31.2 million
U.S.dollars on Wednesday against Tuesday's 454.6 million shares
worth some 16.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said fears on the peso to cross the 46 pesos to the U.
S.dollar support level and inflation to rise in the coming months
weighed down market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
"Of course our decline is due to the peso and higher inflation
given that world oil prices are moving higher," said Lawrence de
Leon,analyst at Magnum International Securities.
</P>
<P>
The peso tumbled to its fresh low of 45.703 pesos to the dollar
early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The August inflation, on the other hand, rose to 4.6 percent
year-on-year, racked up by the delayed effect of oil price hikes.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Expresses Ignorance of Tanzania's Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) has expressed ignorance about
Tanzania's reported formal pullout from the economic group,
Zambian newspaper the Post reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Secretary-general Erastus Mwencha was quoted by the
paper as saying in an interview on Tuesday that the secretariat
had not received any formal correspondence from Tanzania regarding
its future membership in the 21-member organization.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned, they have never presented any case
to us and all they did ask us was the effects of the revenue
losses after the Free Trade Area (FTA) comes into effect," Mwencha
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the country had expressed concerns over revenue
implications of the FTA which comes into effect on October 31.
</P>
<P>
It would come as a surprise if they say they have pulled out
because only two weeks ago the private sector and the business
community in Tanzania made recommendations to the government
stating that it would be suicidal for Tanzania as a country to
pull out COMESA, Mwencha said.
</P>
<P>
"The government should withdraw its intention to pull out of
COMESA and proceed to join in October 2000," the Tanzanian
business community recommended.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the FTA, Mwencha said everything was on course
with a trade fair and a heads of state summit scheduled for
October 26-28.

<HEADLINE> EU Pumps Money Into SADC-EU Mining Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
pumped 2 million Euros (about 1.8 million U.S. dollars) in the
forthcoming EU-SADC (Southern African Development Community)
mining investment forum to be held in Lusaka next month, according
to SADC mining sector coordinator Chowa Chanda.
</P>
<P>
The forum attracting more than 200 potential investors from EU,
Canada, the United States, Australia and India, will be attended
by at least 500 participants, Times of Zambia Wednesday quoted
Chanda as saying in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
He said the basic principle for the Forum is to get serious
investors to tap other mineral resources apart from copper, which
has a great potential for exporting.
</P>
<P>
Chanda noted that at least 125 mining projects have already
been identified in the region and will be floated to the investors
at the forum.
</P>
<P>
SADC has hired a number of consultants visiting some targeted
countries around the world to attract more mining investors, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chanda explained that there has been an encouraging response
from the 15 EU member states which have pledged support in the
development of the regional mining sector.
</P>
<P>
He said the forum will be followed by a workshop on small scale
mining initiatives in the region funded by the United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa.

</P>
<P>
Electoral Commission Chairman Samuel Kivuitu said on a workshop

about 1.29 million U.S. dollars) in the current financial year to
oversee the registration, adding the computerization of voter
registration had improved efficiency and reduced errors.

<TEXT>
<P>
Yan Xuewang, deputy director of the general affairs section of
the China Merchants Bank's head office, said he feels pressure
from young people.
</P>
<P>
"Young people are quick-minded, full of energy and always score
new achievements," said Yan, "our bank encourages such benign
internal competitions and introduces a system of contractual
employment to ensure and improve overall quality of the workers."
</P>
<P>
The practice of retaining the best workers and eliminating
unqualified staff through selection has been widely introduced in
all businesses and organizations in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
"The inflow of well-educated migrant workers has made it
possible to successfully implement the system which is also an
important factor behind Shenzhen's economic miracle," said Ma
Yunchi, an expert of sociology.
</P>
<P>
Statistics prove that last year, 10,397 people out of every 100,
000 residents in Shenzhen had received education above college
level, which far exceeds levels in many other major Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
At Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd, a private high-tech business in
Shenzhen, there are more than 6,000 scientific workers engaged in
research and development with an average age of 28.
</P>
<P>
Li Jie, press secretary of the company, said, "The company has
provided them with favorable treatment and relaxed work schedules,
but when necessary, they often work overtime till late at night
exclusive of getting extra payment, or continue work for several
months without holidays."
</P>
<P>
According to Li, 12 of the products provided by his company are
considered to attain the highest technical standards in the world.
Last year, the company raked in 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in sales
earnings, up 39 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Employees' life is not always going to work," said Li, adding
that young people in his company like to spend their spare time in
bars and disco houses.
</P>
<P>
In Shenzhen, one can feel that people are devoted to work and
to entertainment alike. Chen Jiangang, a customs officer at
Shenzhen Airport, said "I like to listen to music or surf the net.
"
</P>
<P>
He said some of his friends like reading in libraries and
participating in activities organized by volunteers' federation.
</P>
<P>
Due to pressure from work, young people in Shenzhen usually
choose to establish careers before getting married. Because there
are more males than females, many young people tend to find
partners in other areas of the country before moving to Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
When asked why he stays in Shenzhen, Chen, who is from
northeast China, said "Shenzhen belongs to us young people and we
young people also belong to the city."

<P>
SHENZHEN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Li Gongzheng, an employee
with head office of China Merchants Bank in Shenzhen, neighboring
city of Hong Kong, prefers doing exercises to relax him. Li also
likes to surf the Internet in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
Li, who completed his postgraduate studies with the Chinese
People's University in Beijing, has been working for an on-job
doctorate.
</P>
<P>
Li is just one of the many young people in Shenzhen who leads a
"fast-paced lifestyle".
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that the average age of residents in
Shenzhen is 28.65 years of age and that people aged 20 to 29 make
up 35.77 percent of the city's population.
</P>
<P>
But in China's other major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou, the aging of the population has become a prominent
problem.
</P>
<P>
"A society comprised mostly of young people will surely exert a
special vitality," said Ma Yunchi, an associate professor with the
Sociology Department of Shenzhen University.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It is well demonstrated in the progressive concept of
"time is money and efficiency is life" formed in the early years
of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone."
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, as China's first special economic zone, celebrated
its 20th anniversary of founding late last month. Statistics
indicate that Shenzhen has an average annual growth rate of over
30 percent in gross domestic product (GDP) in the past two decades.
The growth has been dubbed as "Shenzhen speed".
</P>
<P>
Since Shenzhen became a special zone 20 years ago, it has been
attracting tens of thousands of young people to start up
businesses here. Its total population increased from 30,000 in
1980 to 4.05 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Li Gongzheng from Chongqing, the country's youngest
municipality in southwest China, said he chose Shenzhen, as he
believes the city has broad career opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"As a young people, I actively engage myself in busy work and
amass experiences, so that I may become qualified for senior
managerial posts in businesses in the future," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Associate professor Ma Yunchi explained that young migrants,
who were usually penniless when they first came to Shenzhen, must
work hard for their subsistence, find a foothold in their
workplaces and make progress. Migrants have therefore, naturally
developed a concept of self reliance, self support and
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who is in her early 30s, came to work in Shenzhen from
Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong, ten years ago. (

<HEADLINE> China To Launch Putonghua Promotion Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- China is to launch its third
nationwide Putonghua (standard Chinese language, also known as
Mandarin) Promotion Week in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
Putonghua promotion activities will be held in major cities
throughout China.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhan, vice-minister of education and director of the state
language work committee said that China has set a target for
making Putonghua the standard Chinese language nationwide by the
middle of the new century.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, the third week of September has been fixed as the
National Putonghua Promotion Week. This year's promotion week will
be from September 10 to 16, using the slogan: "Promoting Putonghua
into the New Century."
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the promotion of Putonghua should be a long-term
social activity, as well as a basic objective for socialist
construction.
</P>
<P>
He called for cooperation among various departments to help
make Putonghua the main language used on college campuses, in
primary and middle schools, in business and the service industry.
</P>
<P>
One of China's premier linguists, Zhou Youguang, noted that
there are two criteria for judging Putonghua promotion: how it is
used in schools and colleges, and if Putonghua is used as the
communication medium during public activities.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that the popularity of Putonghua has reached 80
percent in China's large and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
The state language work committee has recently started a
nationwide investigation into the use of Chinese language to help
the country achieve its Putonghua promotion goal.

<HEADLINE> Families Demand Release of Jordanian Prisoners from Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The family members of Jordanian
political prisoners held in Israeli jails have called on the
Jordanian government to secure their release, the semi-official
Jordan Times reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an appeal to the government, a committee representing the
families said the health conditions of the Jordanian prisoners in
Israeli jails are deteriorating, and the government should put
their release on its agenda.
</P>
<P>
Israel still holds four Jordanians for political reasons, and
their health is described as precarious. At least one of them is
suffering from mental disorder, the unnamed committee was quoted as
saying by the paper.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state released five Jordanians last December as part
of a deal with the Palestinians, in which it freed a total of 150
prisoners, including Palestinians and others of various Arab
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
The remaining Jordanian prisoners in Israel are all serving life
sentences, the paper said, without giving more details.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 as the second
Arab country after Egypt to reach such a peace deal with the Jewish
state.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Consumer Confidence Highest in Region: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has displayed
the highest consumer confidence among the Asia/Pacific markets
according to the latest MasterIndex survey by the MasterCard
International.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia registered the highest MasterIndex among the 13
markets-- Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan,
South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore,
Taiwan and Thailand, with a score of 89.6 for the December 1999 to
June 2000 period,MasterCard International said in a statement
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The score, not the highest recorded by Malaysia which
historically registered scores in the 90s range, compares
favorably with its pre-crisis average (88.9) in 1997 and is more
than twice as high as its lowest point seen during the crisis
period (40.9) in 1998,the MasterCard International said.
</P>
<P>
Measured in the survey are five economic factors -- employment,
the economy, regular income, stock market and quality of life.
</P>
<P>
The MasterIndex survey of consumer confidence, conducted
biannually since the second quarter of 1993, is calculated upon
percentage response figures, with zero as the most pessimistic,
100 as the most optimistic and 50 as neutral.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Expand Vineyard Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand is planning to
increase its producing vineyard area in order to give rise to
substantial increases in grape and wine production in the years to
come.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Wine Institute said in its latest Annual report
that the country plans to expand the producing vineyard area to 13,
000 hectares in vintage 2003, compared with 9,750 hectares in
vintage 2000.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand wine industry has enjoyed another record year,
according to the annual report for 1999/2000.
</P>
<P>
During the period from July 1999 to June 2000, the
international sales of New Zealand wine reached 19.2 million
liters and 168.6 million New Zealand dollars (73.34 million U.S.
dollars), registering an increase of 15 percent in volume and 35
percent in value on the previous year. The international sales now
represent 32 percent of total industry sales by volume.
</P>
<P>
The institute predicts that the international sales of New
Zealand wine may double over the next five years, possibly
reaching 40 million liters and 375 million NZ dollars (163.13
million U.S. dollars) in 2005. This level exports would represent
just over 50 percent of total industry sales.
</P>
<P>
Institute Chairman Peter Hubscher said in the report that there
are both opportunities and challenges arising from the increased
production.
</P>
<P>
"Higher production will enable the industry to boost exports
substantially above current levels. On the other hand the world
already has a wine surplus, competition is increasing, and we will
need to invest heavily to develop profitable niche markets," he
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Medical Schools Recruit Less Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of applicants
to the United States' 125 medical schools fell remarkably in 1999,
partly because of the booming economy and the changing face of
medicine, according to the latest issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Association (AMA).
</P>
<P>
The 38,529 applicants for last year's freshman class represent
a 6-percent decline from 1998, when there were 41,004 applicants,
according to figures contained in the studies published in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association (AMA).
</P>
<P>
The biggest drop in applicants -- 9.1 percent -- was seen among
men, while the number of female applicants fell two percent,
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Barbara Barzansky of the AMA's undergraduate medical education
division, who led the overall enrollment study, suggested the
economy has been so strong that potential applicants might be
choosing other fields.
</P>
<P>
Also, doctors are having more trouble finding practices, and
medicine has changed so much, with increased paperwork and
insurance regulations, that many doctors say they would not enter
the field again, said Barzansky, adding that the average medical
school graduate last year was 90,000 U.S. dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
While schools in the past decade have begun programs to
increase racial diversity, attacks on affirmative action programs
in some states have created a more hostile climate for minorities
in medicine, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
One study found that the number of black, Hispanic and Indian
American applicants fell by nearly seven percent last year, from 4,
487 in 1998 to 4,181. Of last year's first-year class, 7.9 percent
were black, 6.9 percent were Hispanic, 19.4 percent were Asian or
Pacific Islander and 0.7 percent were Indian American.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. population is 12 percent black, 12 percent Hispanic,
four Asian/Pacific Islander and 0.7 percent Indian American.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Hopes to Eliminate Hepatitis A in 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 6 (Xinhua) -- China is likely to eliminate
hepatitis A in the coming 20 years, according to a top Chinese
scientist.
</P>
<P>
Mao Jiangsen, a professor with the Zhejiang Provincial Academy
of Medical Science, said that in the recent ten years, more than
100 million Chinese have been inoculated with an hepatitis A
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
"The vaccine works by improving the enteric immunity," said Mao,
"patients can become lifelong immune after one or two inoculations.
"
</P>
<P>
The vaccine, which has been named the "live attenuated
hepatitis A vaccine", was developed by Mao in 1988. In 1993, Mao
gained the highest honor in Chinese medicine for the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
According to Mao, hepatitis A is dropping by an annual rate of
22 percent in China, and in areas where the vaccine is prevalent,
there has been an annual drop of 99 percent.
</P>
<P>
"In some places, hepatitis A cases have even already been
eliminated among children below 15 years old," Mao said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mao, the vaccine has been listed by the Ministry
of Health as an effective remedy for hepatitis A and will be
applied more readily.
</P>
<P>
Hepatitis A has long been a common enteric contagion in China.
The number of sufferers amounted to over one million each year
before the 1990s.

<HEADLINE> East China's Economic Giant Protects Groundwater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Exploitation of groundwater
will be banned in three cities -- Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou in
east China's Jiangsu Province, according to a recent code issued
by the standing committee of the provincial people's congress.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time China has made effort to protect its
groundwater resources by law, a local official source said.
</P>
<P>
According to the code, the exploitation of groundwater in the
three cities, all with rapid economic growth, will be limited
gradually in the coming three years, and by the end of 2005, no
groundwater will be allowed to be used.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, the use of groundwater will be completely substituted
by surface water resources, according to the code.
</P>
<P>
"Violating enterprises would be fined and ordered to stop
production," it said.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that the excessive exploitation of
groundwater has resulted from soaring water demand as the economy
has grown rapidly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Scientific figures show that the ground-level in the three
cities is sinking at an average rate of six to ten centimeters
each year. In some areas in Suzhou, the figure is as high as 160
centimeters, damaging the local buildings, infrastructure, rivers
and dykes.

<HEADLINE> Scholar: Marco Polo Did Visit China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A professor with the Beijing
University has claimed to have found new evidence proving that
Marco Polo (1254-1324), an Italian traveler, did come to China.
</P>
<P>
Dang Baohai, a history professor, disclosed this at an
international seminar on the relationship between Marco Polo and
China in the 13th century, which was held here recently.
</P>
<P>
Dang cited three examples from the travel note taken by Marco
Polo: a legend about the birth of a Khan of Ouigour, an ancient
nationality in northwest China; Mongolian authorities forced to
pull down ramparts built by Han Nationality during the Yuan
Dynasty (1271-1368); and Kublai Khan ordered to plant trees along
roads.
</P>
<P>
These records accord with the Chinese and Persian historical
documents, local chronicles and laws issued during the Yuan
Dynasty, said Dang.
</P>
<P>
These three examples are minor things that people usually
neglect, Dang said, adding it would be impossible for Marco Polo
to put them down in his travel note if he had never seen them with
his own eyes.
</P>
<P>
Frances Wood, a British scholar, has written a book in 1995
putting a question mark on Marco Polo's travel note. She doubted
that Marco Polo had ever gone to China and what he described in
the well-known travel note was a copy from some Persian travel
guide, maps and historical data.
</P>
<P>
Dang saw it as a pity that Doctor Wood did not figure out
specifically what Marco Polo had referred to. Dang is confident
that none of the existing Persian documents could surpass Marco
Polo's book in the over-all and thorough coverage of China.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- "A Close Look at China," a
free cultural exhibition offering an unprecedented look at the
beauty and diversity of China opened here Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier; Evelyn Lieberman, U.S. under
secretary of State Department, and George Pataki, governor of New
York, cut the ribbon at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which features a wide range of objects showing
the history, culture, garments and tourism resources of China,
will last 10 days and close on September 15.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony, presided over by Maurice Greenberg,
chairman and CEO of American International Group, Inc., took place
at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, which was decorated with
posters for the exhibition and two letters of congratulations from
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Qizheng, director of the Information Office of the Chinese
State Council, said mutual understanding and friendship between
the Chinese and American peoples should be the foundation of
better relations between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The cultural exhibition opened here today is aimed at this,"
Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao described the exhibition "as a gift the Chinese people
present to the American people from the other side of the Pacific
Ocean, especially to those Americans who have not yet set foot on
Chinese soil."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that "A Close Look at China" would enable more
Americans to better understand China.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of State Secretary Madeleine Albright, Mrs. Lieberman
said the exhibition "is an example of the kind of cultural
diplomacy that we should encourage as we strive to better
integrate cultural concerns into the conduct of foreign relations.
"

New York Governor Pataki also delivered a speech at the
ceremony, saying that his state will seize new opportunities to
enhance U.S.-Sino exchanges.

<P>
Top Chinese models wearing traditional Chinese costumes, or the
latest fashions by China's best designers, will show different
styles of Chinese costumes, traditional and modern, each day as
part of a spectacular display of China's splendid 2,000-year-long
fashion history.
</P>
<P>
The show will also present a rare collection of some 300
masterpieces of contemporary Chinese art, including carved jade
ware, stone and wooden sculptures, pottery, porcelain and metal

<HEADLINE> Chinese Star Marathon Swimmer Joins in Beijing's Olympics Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- "Ironman" Zhang Jian, who
became the first person to swim 124 kilometers across the Bohai
Bay off north China last month, has started his commitment in
Beijing's bid for hosting the 2008 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a household name now throughout the country following
his heroic crossing of the often stormy bay, was officially
accepted here o Wednesday a member of the Beijing 2008 Olympics
Bid Committee.
</P>
<P>
Under a banner which writes "Mobilization Meeting for Olympics
Bid", Beijing's vice mayor Liu Jingmin called on all the staff of
the Beijing bid committee to follow the example set by Zhang.
Zhang set a world record by swimming across the bay in 50 hours
and 22 minutes, without the aid of any floater.
</P>
<P>
"His feat is thought-provoking, and we should follow his
example in our bid," said Liu, who is also the executive vice-
president of the bid committee.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a teacher with the Beijing Sports University, encouraged
the bid staff to push forward the 2008 bid campaign by recalling
his awful crossing.
</P>
<P>
"Tricky problems emerged from every hour of the 50-hour swim
crossing. You need to deal with each of them by various means.
But when the hardship reaches its peak, it tails off," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
"I was barely able to continue sometime in the first night, but
a strong faith encouraged me through to the end. When the shore
came into my sight, I was filled with more power," Zhang recalled.
</P>
<P>
The excitement Zhang experienced is still premature for the
Beijing bid committee.
</P>
<P>
"Zhang Jian has savored the unspeakable joy at sight of the
shore, but we could not for more arduous tasks are lying ahead,"
Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, together with Paris, Istanbul, Toronto and Osaka, was
accepted last week by the International Olympic Committee as the
candidate cities for hosting the 2008 Olympic Games. The IOC is
scheduled to decide on the hosting city in Moscow this July.
</P>
<P>
"All the other four candidates are very competitive. Confident
though, we should keep somber-minded for more challenging tasks
ahead," Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Dearer Oil, Weaker Baht Curb Retailing Growth in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Higher oil prices and the baht
's depreciation are likely to inhibit growth in Thailand's retail
sales this year to less than 10 percent, down from the 15 percent
anticipated earlier, The Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pittaya Jear, the new president of Thai Retailers' Association,
was quoted as saying the retail business grew 10 percent in the
first seven months in line with the improved economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation in the last quarter, the high season,
was likely to increase no more than 5 percent if oil prices and
exchange rate factors did not improve, he said.
</P>
<P>
Floods in many parts of the country would also have a negative
impact on sales, Pittaya said. Consumers were more likely to
tighten their belts and buy fewer electrical appliances, clothes
and cosmetics, products that contributed most to the sharp growth
in the retail industry early this year.
</P>
<P>
The baht's depreciation to more than 41 baht to the U.S. dollar
from 38 baht earlier this year had raised product costs by 8
percent. The higher oil price added another 3 percent to costs,
Pittaya said.
</P>
<P>
Producers of many consumer goods such as shampoo, which are
affected by higher packaging costs, have recently asked for a 3-
to 10-percent rise in prices, but retailers have asked them to
postpone the increases for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
"If the baht weakens and oil prices go up further, the prices
of consumer goods will go up," Pittaya said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Public Servants, Pensioners to Get Higher Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
decided to give a 10-percent interim increase in salaries to
public servants and pensioners, the official Daily News reported
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The monthly salary of a public servant will be raised by a
minimum of 1,000 rupees (12.7 U.S. dollars) inclusive of the 600
rupees (7.6 dollars) allowance being paid now. A pensioner will
receive a 500-rupee (6.4 dollars) increase including the existing
300 rupees (3.8 dollars), said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It said these increases will be implemented from October 1,
pending the implementation of a Salaries Commission recommendation.
</P>
<P>
The decision had been taken following discussions President
Chandrika Kumaratunga had with the Joint Committee of Trade Unions
which made a request for increased wages to meet the rising cost
of living.
</P>
<P>
The president told the unionists that the government had been
saddled with a huge expenditure for the ongoing ethnic war against
Tamil Tiger rebels in the north and east but had undertaken to
grant some relief to government servants and pensioners.
</P>
<P>
The government's move is viewed as a strategy to get more votes
in the 11th general elections scheduled for October 10 after the
closing of nominations on Monday. A record number of 5,048
candidates from 29 political parties and 99 independent groups
submitted their nominations to contest the 225 seats in the
parliament.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Nine people have been killed
in floods in Thailand caused by tropical storm Kaemi while 115
others have died of flood-caused diseases, The Nation reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The storm had also caused damage estimated at 605 million baht
(15.1 million U.S. dollars), Banyat Bantadtan, Thai deputy prime
minister and interior minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
While the provinces in the north and northeast were still
recovering from the worst of Kaemi's effects, residents were being
urged to brace themselves for more flash floods from a monsoon
system now sweeping through the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Banyat said Kaemi had flooded 1.9 million rai (304,000 hectares)
of farmland, affected a total of 304,273 families and led to the
spread of leptospirosis.
</P>
<P>
He said 115 of the 3,240 people diagnosed with "swamp fever"
had already died of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Many people affected by flooding had also developed athlete's
foot, as well as stomach and respiratory ailments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the meteorological department said a monsoon system
in the Philippines is expected to send more downpours to the north
and northeast and urged the residents there to brace themselves
for possible flash floods.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Decides to Leave Key Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>

<P>
BANGKOK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Thailand (BOT), the
Thai central bank, announced here Wednesday that it will keep its
low key interest rates unchanged, in order to maintain a loose
monetary stance to support economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
At a regular meeting every six weeks late Tuesday, the BOT
Monetary Policy Board resolved to leave the benchmark 14-day
repurchase rates unchanged at 1.5 percent, the bank said in its
website.
</P>
<P>
The current low interest rates will spur domestic demand and
investment, even as the baht continues weakening, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, a higher rate is sure to stem a decline in the
baht,the Thai currency, and will also make it harder for banks and
companies to restructure about 40 billion U.S. dollars of non-
performing loans, which is crucial to Thailand's economic recovery,
according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
Although its policy on key interest rates will need a time lag
of six months before an impact is seen in the money market, the
bank said, it is working to improve mechanisms to manage market
liquidity and cut down the time lag.

<HEADLINE> Argentine President Denies Cavallo is Wanted by Authorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Argentine
President Fernando De la Rua denied Tuesday that Argentine ex-
naval officer, Miguel Angel Cavallo, who is being detained in
Mexico, is being pursued by Argentine justice.
</P>
<P>
De la Rua, who arrived here Monday evening for a two-day visit,
told the press that his government has provided Cavallo with
consular help, according to diplomatic rules.
</P>
<P>
"Argentina upholds the principle of territoriality in
application of penal laws," he said in a meeting that criticized
Cavallo's detention in Mexico because of a request by Spanish
authorities.
</P>
<P>
He said his meetings with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo on
Monday evening and later with the President-Elect Vicente Fox
didn't discuss Cavallo's situation.
</P>
<P>
Cavallo was detained on August 24 under an extradition request
by a Spanish judge who accused him of torture and murder of
political opponents during Argentina' 1976-1983 military regime.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine leader said the Cavallo case "is a judicial
matter in Mexico."
</P>
<P>
Mexico's Foreign Secretary Rosario Green said on Monday that
Cavallo will be released if Spain doesn't provide proof upholding
the detention within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
Cavallo was working in Mexico as director of National Vehicle
Registration.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Studies new Alternative Energy Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
considering developing a new source of energy, known locally as"
fuel cell," the Research and Technology Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The new energy source is needed because of dwindling supplies
of fossil fuels, such as coal and gas, The Indonesian Observer
daily Wednesday quoted the ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Agus Hartanto, head of the ministry's Technological Research
Department, said Tuesday that the new energy source is highly
efficient and environment friendly.
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that all petroleum fields here will be exhausted
by 2020 and gas fields by 2040. This is the reason why we are
trying to introduce fuel cell," he said.
</P>
<P>
Research indicates that fuel cell has a lot of competitive
advantages. It is highly efficient when converted into electric
energy, its gaseous emissions are low, which is good news for the
environment, and it is highly flexible, which means it can be used
in engines that run on fuels such as hydrogen, methanol, methane,
propane, butane and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, fuel cell is like a type of battery.
It is made from various elements and compounds, all of which can
be found in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"fuel cell has not yet been introduced in Indonesia, but new
technology has been developed in advanced countries on how to
produce it and use it in public transport. We plan to start using
it here by 2003 or 2004," said Agus.

<HEADLINE> Thai Deputy PM to Lobby OPEC on Behalf of Developing Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister and
Commerce Minister Supachai Panichpakdi will lobby members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) over the
impact of rising oil prices on the economies of developing
countries, a governmental report said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his capacity as head of the U.N. Conference on Trade And
Development (UNCTAD), Supachai is expected to visit OPEC members
including Indonesia, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia, it said.
</P>
<P>
"We will demonstrate to OPEC that high oil prices impact
developing countries more than developed countries, " Supachai was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that this problem created by OPEC will slow the
economic growth and create unemployment in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Supachai said, OPEC is a fairly cohesive body
which is able to make sure that members do not cheat on agreed
production quotas.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, has resulted in the recent surges in world oil
prices as global demand for oil is not met and has had a retarding
effect on the economic recovery of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless," he said, "I felt that OPEC will consider
increasing its oil output at its next meeting on September 10 and
that the body will bear in mind the impact of oil price hikes on
the developing economies."

<HEADLINE> Former Albanian President Returns Home From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Albanian President Rmiz
Alija returned to Tirana after receiving a health check-up in the
United States, thus silencing the rumor that he would apply for
political asylum in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
On arriving in Tirana, Alija told the press here that certain
media and political forces are used to starting rumors, and that
he did not "give a damn" about it.
</P>
<P>
Alija went to the U.S. in July this year for medical reasons.
During his stay in the U.S., a rumor began to circulate that "the
living file for fifty years of Albanian history" would apply for
political asylum and stay in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five-year old Alija was elected as the first Albanian
president in April 1991, but was forced to resign one year later.
He was placed under house arrest in September 1992 under charges
that included abuse of power. He was eventually jailed in August
1993.
</P>
<P>
Alija was released from jail in March 1997. He was also cleared
of the charges against him in October 1997.

<HEADLINE> Chile Begins to Export Oysters to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Chile sent its first shipment
of oysters to the United States from the seaside city of Tongoy
last week, the local newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said that the 30,000 frozen units of oysters were the
results of six years' work in improving the oysters processing
plants in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Pesquera Andacollo fishery, together with the National
Fishing Society of Chile (Sonpesca), installed the quality control
monitoring equipment to ensure the strict health and safety
required by the U.S. market, it said.
</P>
<P>
If the exports will profit for the business, the number of
exports could increase considerably. The industry, employing some
3,000 workers, produces 2,000 tons of oysters each year and
registers profits of about 5 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chile is the third biggest oyster producer in the world,
following China and Japan. Its main export markets are France and
Belgium, which receive 68 percent of all its shipments.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Accuses U.S. of Blocking Leader to U.N. Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) denounced the United States on Tuesday
for blocking Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the DPRK
Supreme People's Assembly, from attending the new millennium U.N.
Summit scheduled in New York from September 6 to 8.
</P>
<P>
In a public statement, the Foreign Ministry said Kim and his
party had to cancel their trip on Monday en route to New York
owing to obstructive moves of the U.S. administration authorities.
It added that the United States would have to pay a dear price for
having hurt the dignity of the Korean people.
</P>
<P>
When Kim and his party were about to board a U.S. passenger
plane in Frankfurt, Germany to travel to New York to attend the
summit, American air security agents unexpectedly showed up at the
airport, claiming that upon an order from their country, they
would inspect the members of the delegation including Kim and
their belongings because the DPRK was a "rogue nation," according
to the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said that the act violated the international usage of travel
and neglected the elementary etiquette and morality for a state
leader, and accordingly, it constituted an unbearable mockery of
the sovereignty of an independent state and a grave challenge to
the United Nations and the summit organized by it.
</P>
<P>
Under the pretext of "safe flight," the U.S. authorities, after
issuing entry visas to the delegation, inviting it to receptions
to be given during the summit and agreeing to have DPRK-U.S. high-
level contacts, blocked the delegation on its way to New York, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
This suggested that the hostile policy of the U.S. towards the
DPRK had not changed even a bit but was getting more despicable
and crafty, it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that this event clearly demonstrated that
though the U.S. was proposing a number of talks and talking about
"improved relations" with the DPRK, it was, in fact, displeased
with the DPRK's opening of relations with other countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Assured of Ukrainian Support on Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma assured his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin here Tuesday of
his country's support for China's drive to reunify the country on
the basis of the One China principle.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents, who are here for the U.N. Millennium
Summit held from Wednesday till Friday, met in Waldorf Hotel in
downtown New York City.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma told Jiang that his country has stuck to the One China
policy and had no official relations in any form with Taiwan,
which he described as an inalienable part of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that a successful resolution of the
Taiwan issue would benefit stability in Asia and peace in the
world.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang said he was grateful to Kuchma for his
position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time the two presidents met since 1994, when
Kuchma visited China two years after the two countries had
established diplomatic relations. The two leaders expressed their
wish for better ties between the two countries despite the
distance that separates them.

<HEADLINE> Japan Beat Morocco in Final Olympic Soccer Warm-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Olympic soccer team was
boosted by their 3-1 victory over Morocco in their final Olympic
warm-up match Tuesday night at Tokyo's National Stadium.
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 5,000 chanted "Troussier Nippon" after the team's
French coach, Philippe Troussier, who walked on to the field to
thank the fans for their support during the qualifying campaign.
</P>
<P>
The victory, thanks to two own goals and a right-foot half-
volley into the top corner from left-winger Masashi Motoyama,
extended the under-23 team's winning streak to 17 games.
</P>
<P>
The sequence comprises the 12 Asian qualifiers for Sydney,
during which Japan outscored their opponents 66-3, and five
friendlies, taking the overall goals ratio to 84-5.
</P>
<P>
Japan will leave for Australia on Saturday to prepare for their
Group D games against South Africa, Slovakia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Japan have won Asia's only medal in any men's Olympic soccer
tournament -- a bronze at the 1968 Mexico Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Olympic players can earn six million yen (56,640 U.S.
dollars) each if they could take the gold in the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
Morocco had taken an early lead with a thundering right-foot
drive from captain Faouzil El Brazil but buckled under relentless
Japanese attacks.
</P>
<P>
The North African country's under-23 team is scheduled to fly
to Sydney on Wednesday and will compete in the same group as South
Korea, Spain and Chile.

JAKARTA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
allocate 800 billion rupiah (96.5 million U.S. dollars) in fuel
subsidies to help improve the welfare of the country's poor and to
assist small businesses and cooperatives, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be channeled through three mechanisms, including
cash transfers directly to the needy, The Indonesian Observer
daily Wednesday quoted Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs
Rizal Ramli as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the funds must be delivered this year to the
targeted groups through infrastructure projects designed to create
job opportunities and loans for small businesses and cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Purnomo
Yusgiantoro said the main aim of the funds is to accelerate the
eradication of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Under the current state budget, the government will allocate
the necessary funds for a 44 trillion rupiah (5.3 billion dollars)
fuel subsidy earmarked for the April-December 2000 fiscal period.
</P>
<P>
The government is committed to its plan to reduce the subsidy
by implementing a 12-percent increase in fuel prices starting in
October.
</P>
<P>
The gradual elimination of blanket state subsidies, including
those on fuel prices, is part of the reform programs pledged by
the government to the International Monetary Fund in return for a

Radical Civic Union (RCU) chief Raul Galvan also resigned on

</P>
<P>
Vice President Carlos Alvarez, also President of the Senate,
said that the resignation of JP and UCR senators "will help to

</P>

Several senators and government officials have presented their

</P>
<P>
A federal judge said last Friday there was growing evidence of
bribe-taking in the Argentine Senate and announced he was carrying
out the investigation into a corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of the scandal threatened to rock Argentina's
political elite and to sidetrack efforts to put a sluggish economy
back on track.
</P>

President Fernando de la Rua has expressed his resolve to
prevent the scandal from bogging down the legislative process. He
warned that if the Senate was unable to pass pending legislation,

the world, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
To fill the big shortage of workers in the high-tech and
education sectors, Shanghai is seeking outside for talents to
strengthen its global competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The most sought-after are wizards with PhD's who have two years
' working experience in the country where they studied, or have a
deep knowledge in the cutting-edge high-tech sectors like software,
Internet and bioengineering.
</P>
<P>
A series of new policies is being drafted by the municipal
government, in an attempt to lure more global talents in, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the human resource authorities are considering
abolishing the retirement ages of 60 for men and 55 for women to
make more use of human resources most needed in the high-tech
sector.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai is not running short of employees, only those
possessing advanced knowledge," said Lu Min, deputy director of
the China Human Resources Market (Shanghai).
</P>
<P>
The Market is also an agent under the Shanghai Municipal Human
Resource Bureau, which is responsible for setting up human
resources policy.
</P>
<P>
Every year, about 40,000 college graduates in Shanghai dive
into the job market, with half of them getting a job in the city.
"But the talents are hard to spot," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
For example, Shanghai needs an estimated 10,000 professionals
to develop the IT sector, in particular information, biomedicine
and new materials, but graduates every year are only filling 4,000
to 5,000 prospective jobs.
</P>
<P>
Seeking employees from the global community would help Shanghai
adapt to global practices and rules and get ready for foreign
competition after China's entry into the WTO, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Shanghai has churned out a series of enticements
including pay increases, accommodation and holiday subsidies,
along with other favorable policies to win the hearts of global
wizards.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign talents, students returning from overseas and talented
people at home can come to work here without forsaking their
residents permits," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
But he warned the efforts would not be enough. "Even if we can
lure them to Shanghai, they will be scared away if the employers
fail to provide the terms they promise, such as a good working
climate and a comfortable life," the paper quoting Lu as saying.

<HEADLINE> Planning to Withdraw from Olympics, Kafelnikov Gets Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A consistent poor form this
year has seemed to force Yevgeny Kafelnikov to withdraw from the
Sydney Olympic Games, which would of course disturb the Olympic
tennis tournament as well as Russian Olympic officials.
</P>
<P>
After losing in straight sets to Slovakia's Dominik Hrbaty in
the third round of the U.S. Open Saturday, the Russian has not won
a singles title all year -- for the first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
And the fact has convinced the former world number one there is
little point going to Sydney. "You have to be a realist," the
former French and Australian Open champion was quoted as saying by
Russian media.
</P>
<P>
"I'm far from my best form at the moment, therefore there is
no point at all going to Australia."
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov's attitude was criticized on Tuesday by Vitaly
Smirnov, president of the Russian Olympic Committee. "You can
make millions of dollars or commute in a private jet but when it
comes to giving your best for your country he takes a back seat to
many of our true sports heroes," Smirnov said at a press
conference on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
If Kafelnikov quits, that would leave Marat Safin, currently
fourth in the ATP Tour Champions' Race, as the only Russian in the
men's draw and it would also prevent Russia from fielding a
doubles team.
</P>
<P>
"...we had helped Kafelnikov in his rise to the top, providing
free training, equipment and travel costs in the early years of
his tennis career," Smirnov said.
</P>
<P>
"We also helped his family along the way by persuading the
government to give them land on the Black Sea as well as other
things. But, I guess, now it's all forgotten."
</P>
<P>
Anna Kournikova, Russia's ace women's player, pulled out of
the Olympic tournament in July, citing a scheduling problem and
the risk of injury.
</P>
<P>
"It's not even worth talking about Kournikova and Kafelnikov
at this point. I'd rather talk about our many other great
sportsmen," an angry Smirnov said.

<HEADLINE> Sick Giant Panda Out of Danger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A giant panda cub found semi-
conscious in southwest China's Sichuan Province is now out of
danger thanks to the rescue efforts of local giant panda
specialists.
</P>
<P>
While watching the six-month old cub eating bamboo leaves,
veterinarian Yang Benqing said that the animal is this year's
first wild giant panda saved and sent to the nearby natural
reserve.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, the deserted cub was discovered on May 1 in
a bamboo forest, with an elevation of over 2,500 meters, in
Maoxing County, by a local farmer. The cub was then taken to the
Fengtongzhai Giant Panda Natural Reserve the following day.
</P>
<P>
The reserve assigned its most experienced experts and used its
best equipment to render emergency treatment, the expert said. The
cub was suffering from acute enteritis and malnutrition when it
arrived at the reserve.
</P>
<P>
When arriving at the reserve, the cub weighed only 7.3
kilograms, it now weighs at least seven kilograms heavier after
four-months medical treatment and care.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the giant panda would have died in the wild if she
had not been rescued by the farmer.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas are one of the world's most endangered species,
and only about 1,000 are known to exist in the wild, 80 percent of
them in Sichuan Province.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Have More Expressways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Dongguan city in south China
's Guangdong Province will spend four billion yuan on constructing
a 57-km-long expressway on the coast.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the projected expressway will be
situated along the eastern coast of the Pearl River estuary and
will be 33.5 meters wide, with six lanes. It will have seven
overpasses and three bridges.
</P>
<P>
On completion, the expressway will connect to the provincial
capital of Guangzhou in the north and join the Shenzhen seaside
highway and the western thoroughfare of Hong Kong in the south.
</P>
<P>
The four local towns of Mayong, Shatian, Humen and Chang'an in
Dongguan will also be linked to the expressway, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The expressway will enable easier distribution of cargo in the
western part of Dongguan and will promote the city's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that the provincial government has approved
Dongguan to build the expressway.
</P>
<P>
Dongguan, located in the middle of the economic corridor formed
by Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, has become one of the world'
s major bases for processing industries. It is now home to 13,000
overseas-financed businesses. Last year, the city exported 15.2
billion U.S. dollars worth of commodities.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Not to Attend PCC Meeting: Hamas Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian radical group the
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) declared Tuesday that it would
not attend upcoming meeting of the Palestine Central Council (PCC)
slated for September 9-10 in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is scheduled to discuss whether to proceed with the
statehood declaration on September 13 as declared earlier by
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"Our boycott of the PCC meeting does not mean that the movement
is closing the door for dialog with the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA)," Mahmoud Zahari, a Hamas leader told Voice of
Palestine radio.
</P>
<P>
Zahari called for setting up a committee to define the future
relationship between Hamas and the PNA and Hamas' participation in
the arrangement for establishing a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, opposing making peace with Israel and favoring armed
struggle in recovering the occupied lands, have launched a series
anti-Israeli attacks since the Palestinians and Israel signed the
Oslo peace accords in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian authority extended invitations to all factions,
including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, to attend the PCC meeting.
</P>
<P>
After the collapse of the Camp David summit, the latest
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks brokered by U.S. President Bill
Clinton, Arafat had launched an international tour to rally support
for his statehood declaration.
</P>
<P>
But many world leaders advised him not to take unilateral move
to avoid possible confrontation with Israel and complicating the
already touchy situation.
</P>
<P>
The Camp David summit failed over the future status of
Jerusalem, which both sides claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
The sides have met frequently ever since in tackling final
status issues such as settlements, refugees, border and security,
but little progress were reported.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will hold separate meetings with Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak on the sidelines of the U.N. Millennium
Summit on September 6-8, which have been seen as the last chance
for peace.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have said it is most likely the PCC will
decide to delay the statehood. If so, it will be the second delay,
with the first being agreed at a PCC meeting in April last year.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Lib Democrats Focus Attack on Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition Liberal
Democratic Party fully entered pre-election mode on Wednesday
with the release of a mini-manifesto, with a campaign against
poverty forming its centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
Liberal Democratic Party leader Charles Kennedy launched the
document, entitled Freedom in a Liberal Society, which puts the
case for higher taxes on the better-off to help fund increases in
pensions and improved public services.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy acknowledged that his party's plans would see an
increase in the overall tax burden, but said it was a price he
believed people were willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
"I want to see social justice in Britain," he said. "That
means a massive attack on poverty, both by helping those who are
most in need, such as pensioners and disabled people, and by
providing real equality of opportunity through education, health
and housing programs which help the disadvantaged to escape from
poverty."
</P>
<P>
Spelling out the differences between the Lib Dems and the
government, Kennedy said his party was more progressive, more pro-
European and more concerned about the environment.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, who heads the 47-strong group of Lib Dem Westminster
MPs, acknowledged that it was not credible to suggest his party
would form the next government on its own after the next election,
which is likely in May 2001.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Urges Global Help for Africa to Address Conflicts, Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Namibia said on
Wednesday that conflicts, poverty and AIDS are the most
challenging issues facing the African continent and urged the
world leaders to offer help to address them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the U.N. Millennium Summit which opened this
morning at the U.N. headquarters in New York, Sam Nujoma,
president of Namibia, said that "we cannot celebrate our
remarkable achievements in science, technology and other areas of
human endeavor, while millions of our fellow human beings continue
to live in a world of deprivation and even starvation."
</P>
<P>
"The glaring disparity between the North and the South is the
most burning issue of our time," said Nujoma, who is chairing the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said AIDS was depleting Africa's scarce skills and
called on the western pharmaceutical companies to make expensive
AIDS drugs much cheaper and readily accessible to Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Success against the spread of HIV/AIDS requires urgent and
coordinated efforts by political, corporate and spiritual leaders
to stem the spread of this pandemic," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, there is an imperative need for
pharmaceutical companies to give those millions of people living
with HIV/AIDS access to affordable drugs," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. statistics, in Africa, a majority of people
live on less than one U.S. dollar per day, while 40 percent of
government revenues are now being allocated to servicing debt.
</P>
<P>
AIDS has affected 24.5 million Africans out of the world's 34.3
million sufferers and experts say Africa needs 3 billion U.S.
dollars a year to stem the spread of this pandemic.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Millennium Dome to Stay Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Millennium Dome will
continue to trade until the end of the year despite widespread
calls for its immediate closure, the BBC reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A decision by the Millennium Commission to award the attraction
an extra 47 million pounds (70.5 million U.S. dollars) was
condemned by Conservative Party leader William Hague, who demanded
a full inquiry into the Dome "scandal."
</P>
<P>
But the commission's move was defended by the landmark's new
troubleshooter David James, who said closing the Dome would have
been 30 million pounds to 40 million pounds more expensive than
staying open for four more months.
</P>
<P>
However, he revealed he thought it might have been a bad idea
to build the dome in the first place.
</P>
<P>
James conceded the attraction was "a hell of a difficult place
to get to" and, with hindsight, it had "perhaps not been a wise
decision" to go ahead with construction.
</P>
<P>
Appointed Tuesday, James also said the dome organizers, the New
Millennium Experience Company, had failed to keep a register of
assets.
</P>
<P>
James said he did not believe it would be necessary to close
the dome early and said any move to do so would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
"We would be involved in extra costs and we would trigger a
whole series of contract defaults as well as very large redundancy
bills," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Tory leader William Hague called for the dome to be
closed immediately, dismissing it as "an empty pointless tent in
the middle of nowhere."
</P>
<P>
He also called for the resignation of the minister with
responsibility for the dome, Lord Falconer.
</P>
<P>
But London's Greenwich Council said the area had been given a "
major boost" by the decision to site the attraction in the borough.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Meets Indonesian President on U.N. Staff Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wahid, who is in New York to attend the Millennium Summit of
the United Nations, said he had already sent one battalion for the
reinforcement purpose.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Annan welcomed the news of the reinforcement, hoping
that these troops would "have robust rules of engagement," a
readout issued by the office said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting on an urgent basis, Annan strongly condemned
the murders, describing the security situation in West Timor as "
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, at the opening of the Summit, the largest gathering in
the U.N. history to discuss the role of the U.N. in the 21st
century, Annan confirmed that three U.N. refugee workers of the U.
N. High Commissioner for Refugees were killed in Atambua of West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
"This tragedy underlines once again the dangers faced by
unarmed humanitarian workers serving the United Nations in
conflict or post-conflict situations," Annan told the Summit.
</P>
<P>
More than 120,000 East Timor refugees remain in West Timor
after the militias forced them to flee their homes amid chaos
following the U.N.-brokered referendum which turned to be in favor
of East Timor's independence in August 1999.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Strongly Condemns Killing of Three U.N. Refugee Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday strongly condemned the murders by "rampaging
militia members" in West Timor, Indonesia, and declared the
security situation in that region to be "unacceptable," a U.N.
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The condemnation came as Annan met with Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid "on an urgent basis at noon," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The president shared this view, and said that he had ordered
two more battalions of the Indonesian Army to Atambua, in West
Timor, where the incident had taken place," the spokesman said. "
One of them was already on the way."
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general welcomed the news of the reinforcement
and said that he hoped these troops would have robust rules of
engagement," he said. "The president assured him this was the case.
"
</P>
<P>
Just before addressing the Millennium Summit, which opened here
Wednesday, Annan said that three United Nations refugee workers
were killed as the office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) was attacked in Atambua, a major refugee
center near the border with the U.N.-controlled East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"Before delivering my prepared statement, therefore, I must
inform the heads of state and government of a tragedy that has
occurred in West Timor," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief asked more than 160 heads of state or government
and other senior officials from 189 U.N. member states, who were
attending the opening ceremony, to observe one minute's silence in
honor of the victims.
</P>
<P>
"I much regret to have to open our proceedings on a somber note,
" he said. "The safety of United Nations personnel, in both
peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, is a matter of vital
concern to all of us."
</P>
<P>
The killings took place simply a few hours before the
Millennium Summit kicked off at the U.N. headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
"A few hours ago, the office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees in Atambua was deliberately attacked, by
a militia opposed to the independence of East Timor," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"This tragedy underlines once again the dangers faced by
unarmed humanitarian workers serving the United Nations in
conflict or post-conflict situations," he said.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations helicopter has airlifted 32 injured people
from Atambua and was heading for the East Timor capital of Dili.
All foreign aid staff in Atambua were being evacuated after the
attack, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations only last week resumed aid work in West
Timor after suspending it following brutal attacks on its staff
there.
</P>
<P>
More than 120,000 refugees remain in West Timor after the
militias forced them from their homes when they razed East Timor
after last year's U.N.-brokered vote. Most of the refugees are
near Atambua.

<HEADLINE> E-Commerce Growing Quickly But Still Immature, Says Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Business-to-business (B2B)
e-commerce continues to grow rapidly in the United States, but
remains immature in its development, according to a new study
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Boston Consulting Group (BCG), a U.S. management consulting
firm which conducted the research, estimates that U.S. B2B e-
commerce will grow from 1.2 trillion U.S. dollars this year to 4.8
trillion dollars in transaction value by 2004, when online
purchasing represents 40 percent of the total purchasing.
</P>
<P>
However, the study found that some B2B functions, such as price
negotiations and online collaboration, are still waiting to
migrate online in a significant way. In 2004, only 11 percent of
all purchases will involve online price negotiations, BCG said.
For many companies, negotiating prices online is a necessary first
step toward broader and deeper buyer-seller collaborations online.
</P>
<P>
These findings are based on survey responses from more than 260
buyers, sellers and e-marketplaces as well as interviews. They
show that despite a high level of online penetration, the majority
of transactions completed online will be ordering and
replenishment and not price negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"In the near term, B2B e-commerce may not be as disruptive to
many traditional buyer-supplier relationships as originally
thought," said the BCG report. "Almost half of the companies
surveyed find that offline communications is almost needed to
complete online transactions. Suppliers will continue to send
sales staff to court buyers, and buyers will continue to demand
personal commitments from their suppliers."
</P>
<P>
As the market matures and price comparisons become easier, the
report said, sellers do expect price pressures to increase.
Currently, sellers, who want to differentiate their offerings, can
use technology to offer more sophisticated forms of online
collaboration such as online design, project management, supply-
schedule coordination and build-to-order capabilities.
</P>
<P>
BCG's research also looked at the evolution of marketplaces.
Given the complexities of online procurement, more than half of
buyers and sellers expect to work with only a few e-marketplaces
per category.
</P>
<P>
The research shows that the size of the B2B e-commerce market
is far greater than is commonly reported, in part because it
recognizes the established base of electronic data interchange (
EDI) over private networks and its extensions to the Internet.

<HEADLINE> German Ruling Party Seeks Constitutional Change for Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Franz Muentefering, general secretary of the SPD, said a party
group led by SPD Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin was
working on the legislative proposals to permit referendums on
various issues.
</P>
<P>
The move came following a debate aroused by German European
Commissar Guenter Verheugen, who indicated last weekend that
Germany hold a referendum on the European Union's eastward
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Though German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer formally rejected Verheugen's suggestion, the SPD
and its ruling partner, the Greens party, have actually been
preparing for the initiative since June.
</P>
<P>
Muentefering said the two parties, backed by the left wing
Democratic Socialism Party (PDS), would soon launch a campaign to
win the support of two-thirds lawmakers in parliament, which is
necessary for an amendment to the German constitution, the Basic
Law.
</P>
<P>
He stressed Germany would not hold a referendum on whether or
not to accept the European Union's new member in central and
eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Germany's post-war constitution has purposely prohibited
national referendums to avoid possible abuse. During the Nazi era,
Hitler used referendums to show the public backing to his
decisions to quit the League of Nations and the Geneva Disarmament
Conference.

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces Economic Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore announced his economic plan
Wednesday, vowing to pay off the national debt by 2012 and create
10 million new high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Gore released a 12-chapter, 200-page document
entitled "Prosperity For America's Families," at Cleveland State
University in Missouri State, listing 10 goals he and his running
mate Joe Lieberman would pursue if elected in November.
</P>
<P>
Flanked by former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Gore told
the crowd that he would increase home ownership to 70 percent and
family incomes by one-third, halve the wage gap between men and
women, give families their lowest tax burden in 50 years, and
reduce the poverty rate to one in 10 people.
</P>
<P>
Gore also pledged to shave tariffs from semiconductors,
computers and related technology, further open telecommunications
markets, and keep Internet transactions tax- and tariff-free.
</P>
<P>
Gore promised to leave 300 billion dollars of the expected
federal surplus unspent as a hedge against overly sunny economic
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
"This is the place, this is the time: the beginning of this new
century. Let us build together a new prosperity, and let us be the
generation that makes it possible for all Americans to open the
door to the American dream," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
Gore said that the economic plan of his Republican rival George
W. Bush devotes so much money to a tax cut that there would not be
money left for important programs.
</P>
<P>
"The other side believes it's OK to spend more than the entire
surplus and then hope that the economy does better than anyone
expects," said Gore.
</P>
<P>
In response, Texas Governor Bush, campaigning at the Wilkes-
Barre airport in Pennsylvania, claimed that his plan has been
endorsed by Nobel prize winners while Gore's plan has been
endorsed by President Bill Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Prominent Scholars, Artists Explore Ways to Foster New Dialog Among Civilizations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A group of
internationally eminent scholars, civil servants, journalists and
artists met all day Tuesday at the U.N. headquarters in New York
to discuss the issues relating to cultural diversity, education
and the rapid growth of information technology, a UNESCO press
release said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The gathering, chaired by UNESCO's Director-General Koichiro
Matsuura, was organized by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in cooperation with
the United Nations and with the support of Iran to launch the
United Nations Year of Dialog Among Civilizations for 2001.
</P>
<P>
The year was established by a General Assembly resolution
proposed by Iran. Iranian President Mohammed Khatami opened the
morning session Tuesday, proclaiming, "Promoting a dialog in this
arena of culture in disparate societies should comprise one of the
bedrocks of understanding between cultures and civilizations."
</P>
<P>
Nobel laureate and Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka said it was "
time to do some soul searching about history," which he described
as "exhumation of the past." It is necessary "to consider how many
tributaries are flowing into the common stream of humanity's
present and future."
</P>
<P>
"No one civilization can provide all the answers," he said. "We
need to have a dialogue of equals, as opposed to a dialogue of
domination."
</P>
<P>
Several speakers called for examining the meaning of the world
dialog, and questioned where these dialogs should begin. Former
United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said that
the most difficult events of the past decade have occurred within
nations, such as the series of internal civil wars that have
touched every continent.
</P>
<P>
"A dialog among nations must commence with a dialog within
nations," he said. "This will lead to democracy, which lends
credibility and legitimacy to all forms of external dialog that
may follow, including those at the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Javad Fairzadeh, who directs the International Center
of Dialogue Among Civilizations in the Iranian capital of Tehran,
said that such a dialog must consider many perspectives, both
current and historical.
</P>
<P>
"There are people who believe that we must avoid some
subjective points of view and be all encompassing," he said. "We
must elevate the level of the discussion to recognize that there
is not one point of view alone, and that we will never be able to
recognize every individual through one reflection of life."
</P>
<P>
French sociologist Edgar Morin referred to the number of heads
of state in the meeting's morning session who questioned some of
the dominant roles assumed by Western powers.
</P>
<P>
"In any civilization," he said, "we all need to renounce the
kinds of monopolistic approaches that present difficulties in
understanding each other."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Condemns Killing of U.N. Staff in West Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At an urgent meeting called after the incident occurred
Wednesday at Atambua of West Timor, the council reiterated its
concern about militia activity in the region and militia
incursions into U.N.-administered East Timor, which led to the
death of two U.N. peacekeepers earlier this summer, according to
council president, Mali's Moctar Ouane.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the murder of the three staffs of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) by the militiamen against
independence of East Timor, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
described the security situation in West Timor as "unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
The tragedy underlines again the dangers faced by unarmed
humanitarian workers serving the United Nations in conflict or
post-conflict situations, Annan told a gathering of U.N. members
states, called Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
Ouane said the situation in West Timor is serious and council
members voiced their support for Annan's statement.
</P>
<P>
Council members urged Indonesia to take measures to ensure
security in refugee camps, to disarm and disband the militia, and
to work with the international community for a safe refugee return,
Ouane added.
</P>
<P>
The incident forced the U.N. to suspend aid activities for an
estimated 100,000 East Timorese refugees, who fled their homes
amid chaos following the U.N.-brokered referendum which turned to
be in favor of East Timor's independence in August 1999.

<HEADLINE> Record Number of Treaty Signs Expected During Millennium Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- In an unprecedented
demonstration of commitment to the international rule of law,
leaders of some 82 countries are scheduled to sign, ratify or
accede to a wide range of multilateral treaties deposited with
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan as the Millennium
Summit runs through September 8.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 treaty actions are scheduled to take place at a
treaty ceremony during the three-day Summit -- the largest
gathering of heads of state and government in history, convened to
forge a vision of the United Nations in the new century.
</P>
<P>
As world leaders debate the future of the organization, they
will also be taking concrete steps to enhance the universal legal
commitments and standards protecting people and the environment,
offering justice against prohibited acts and securing the rights
of all.
</P>
<P>
Annan called on member states to use the occasion of the
summit to undertake those legal commitments. In his report to the
Millennium Summit, which attracted more than 160 heads of state or
government, Annan said that it is only possible to free all people
from the scourge of war through strengthening respect for
international law, "in particular the agreed provisions of
treaties on the control of armaments, and international
humanitarian and human rights law."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Legal Counsel Hans Corell said, "In the United Nations,
we are constantly concerned with a multitude of questions that
request our immediate attention. However, when we look back and
the dust of these daily efforts has settled, what emerges is the
law that we have created."
</P>
<P>
"The whole purpose of the treaty ceremony is not just to sign
and ratify treaties but also to strengthen the rule of law and the
international treaty framework," said Palistha Kohona, chief of
the United Nations Treaty Section. This framework contains norms
and standards for just and harmonious interactions among nations
that also impact the lives of all people.
</P>
<P>
There are 517 multilateral treaties deposited with the
secretary-general. The conventions which countries will be signing
or ratifying during the summit set basic standards on a range of
questions, such as genocide, racism, economic, social and cultural
rights, civil and political rights, discrimination against women,
children's rights, the rights of migrant workers, the law of sea,
weapons of mass destruction, and war crimes.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A broad coalition of
mainly U.S. business and technology leaders Wednesday announced a
cross-industry initiative designed to accelerate and broaden
business-to-business integration and commerce on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Among the first group of 36 companies to endorse the Universal
Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) project are
Microsoft, Compaq, Sun Microsystems, IBM, Nortel Networks and
Aribia.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the purpose of the project, organizers said in a
news release that the growth of B2B commerce on the Internet faces
challenges in scaling to universal adoption due to the multitude
of technologies and standards used by businesses and e-
marketplaces. UDDI will address these challenges by developing a
platform-neutral set of specifications to enable businesses of all
sizes to describe themselves and to indicate their preferred means
of doing e-commerce. The project members also plan to share
operation of a globally distributed UDDI Business Registry, where
businesses can publish how they want to conduct business and
search for other businesses that provide the goods and services
they need.
</P>
<P>
The project is an open industry initiative in which any
organization can participate and implement the specifications. The
specifications build on core Internet standards and are
independent of any underlying platform, language, object model,
business application or marketplace.

2.56 trillion would be spent by the year 2005 and the rest by the
end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the program would include the purchase of 12
attack helicopters, vehicles of several types, the building of two
gunboats, four missile boats and two corvettes, the modernization
of submarines and Mirage 2000 fighters, existing missile boats
frigates and the acquisition of fuel ships, armor carriers,
improvements on the "Arrow" defense system and on communications
in the Aegean Sea, and the replacement of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Greece's total defense spending up to 2006 would be reduced
from the current 4.7 percent of GDP to 4.4 percent of GDP, he
added.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, Tsohatzopoulos outlined the aims and goals
of Greece's Defense Revision Strategy, saying that defending
against the Turkish threat was the main aim behind a revision of
the Greek Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
Greece's defense policy must steadfastly deal with Turkey's
insistence on changing the status quo and this could be achieved
by reducing the gap created by Turkey's unrelenting and
everwidening armaments procurements program.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tsohatzopoulos said, another goal of the defense
revision strategy was to assist in implementing Greece's joint
defense doctrine with Cyprus, secure east Mediterranean sea routes,
deal with possible instability to the north and honor Greece's
commitments to international organizations to participate in the
European army and international peacekeeping missions.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Calls on World Leaders to Do What's Best for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Wednesday urged heads of state or
government convening at the Millennium Summit, which opened here
Wednesday morning, to focus on the health, development and well-
being of the world's children as the chief measuring stick of
global progress.
</P>
<P>
"Children are the crucial of sustainable human development.
There is no question about that," said Carol Bellamy, executive
director of the UNICEF. "When we do what's good and right for
children, we do what's good and right for all of us."
</P>
<P>
"I therefore call on the distinguished heads of state gathering
here to enter every debate, every discussion, every ceremony of
this summit with the well-being of today's children, and the
welfare of future generations, uppermost in your minds," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Summit, the largest gathering of world leaders
in the 55-year history of the world body, opened at the U.N.
headquarters in New York with more than 160 heads of state and
government assembled here to discuss the U.N. role in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said she hoped world leaders would take concrete steps
to improve the lives of children in at least three crucial areas:
education, the fight against HIV/AIDS, and the scourge of conflict.
</P>
<P>
She said that they should commit themselves to bold action,
such as:
</P>
<P>
-- Ensuring by 2015 that all children complete primary school,
with equal opportunities for girls at all levels of education;
</P>
<P>
-- Cutting the incidence of HIV infection in young people by 25
percent by 2010;
</P>
<P>
-- Protecting children in war and conflict and seeing to it
that those who commit gross violations of children's rights are
brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy also echoed a call made earlier by U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan, urging the heads of state attending the summit
to use the opportunity to sign and ratify various human rights
treaties, especially those that protect children.
</P>
<P>
The treaties include two optional protocols to the Convention
on the Rights of the Child -- one on the trafficking of children,
child prostitution and child pornography; the other on the
involvement of children in armed conflict, the Convention on the
Prohibition of the Use of Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of
Anti-Personnel Mines, and the Rome Statute of the International
Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said that action on these issues was vital to the true
renewal of the United Nations and would set the stage for the U.N.
Special Session on Children in September 2001.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF, the only U.N. organization dedicated exclusively to
children, works for child protection, survival and development
within the framework of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
</P>
<P>
Created by the United Nations General Assembly in 1946 to meet
the emergency needs of children in post-war Europe, the UNICEF now
supports programs aimed at improving the lives of children across
the world, particularly those in the developing countries.

<HEADLINE> World Meeting on Cocaine Trafficking Opens in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sixth World Conference
on Cocaine Trafficking opened Wednesday in the Mexican tourist
port of Acapulco, 250 kilometers south from Mexico City, with the
attendance of delegates from 178 countries.
</P>
<P>
The spread of cocaine trafficking challenges the world police
forces, International Police (Interpol) criminal investigation
director Paul Higuen told the meeting that will end on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 350 tons of cocaine was seized in all the world,
almost six times more than the 51 tons confiscated in 1995, Higuen
said at the Acapulco forum.
</P>
<P>
The Interpol director asked to strengthen the programs against
addictions and the multiplication of the communications networks
and the intelligence labor for a more efficient combat to drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The seizure of cocaine show differences from region to region.
In Africa, only seven kilograms of cocaine were confiscated in
1990 and in 1997 it was 236 kilograms, while drug seized in Europe
was more than 22 tons in 1995, the officer noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that drug traffickers are "powerful, adaptable, and
have access to vast riches, technology, and weapons that permit
them dominate the market.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's Attorney General Jorge Madrazo said that the United
States, the biggest cocaine market, consumes 300 tons a year, and
Colombian, which turns out 500 tons of cocaine yearly, is the
biggest producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
Madrazo said that some 700,000 persons, or 1.4 percent of
Mexican population between 12 and 45 years old have consumed
cocaine some time in their lives.
</P>
<P>
According to Madrazo, 10.5 percent of the U.S. population
consumed cocaine, 3.8 percent in Canada, 1.1 percent in France and
3.3 percent in Spain.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government confiscated in its fight against drug
trafficking in the last five years over 1,500 tons of cocaine, 6,
515 tons of marihuana, two tons of opium gum and destroyed 76
clandestine labs.

<HEADLINE> Tech Stocks Fall Sharply, Blue Chips Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Technology stocks suffered
heavy losses from analyst downgrades of several high-profile
companies for the second day Wednesday, but the blue chips rose.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the technology heavy Nasdaq composite
index fell 129.84 at 4,013.34 points, extending its losses of 91.
15 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 50.03 at 11,310.64 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index fell 14.83 at 1,492.25.
</P>
<P>
Tech stocks fell as analysts lowered ratings on several
prominent companies. Shares of Micron Technology fell after
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette downgraded the memory chipmaker to "
underperform" from "buy" while WorldCom dropped after analysts
from Lehman Brothers and Wachovia Securities cut their rating on
the telecom provider.
</P>
<P>
It's the second day for the tech stocks to suffer from the
downgrading. On Tuesday, investment bank Piper Jaffray lowered its
rating on Intel, dragging tech stocks lower.
</P>
<P>
But merger news in the financial service drove the blue chip
stocks higher Wednesday. Citigroup said it will acquire Associates
First Capital for about 31.1 billion U.S. dollars in stock,
enabling the financial services company to speed its global
expansion in lending to consumers.
</P>
<P>
A report of rising productivity also helped the Dow index to
stay in the positive territory. The Labor Department reported that
Americans' productivity rose at a 5.7 percent annual rate in the
second quarter, pushing unit labor costs down by a rate of 0.4
percent, the lowest since the end of 1999, and easing pressure on
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 1.74 at 674.46 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell 2.41 at 536.61. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 13.17 at 971.15.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,620 up, 1,255 down and 502
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 992.42 million shares from 836.44
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Calls for New International Economic, Political Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing the three-day U.N. Millennium Summit which opened
this morning at the U.N. headquarters in New York, Fidel Castro
Ruz, president of Cuba, said the existing economic and political
order is unsustainable and must be changed.
</P>
<P>
The world population has reached 6 billion, 80 percent of which
live in poverty, and ages-old diseases from developing countries
such as malaria, tuberculosis and others equally lethal have not
been eradicated while new epidemics like AIDS threaten to
exterminate the population of entire nations, Castro said.
</P>
<P>
It cannot be overlooked that the current poverty and
underdevelopment have resulted from conquest, colonization,
slavery and plundering in most countries of the planet by the
colonial powers and from the emergence of imperialism and the
bloody wars motivated by new distributions of the world, Castro
noted.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations' basic role in the pressing new century is
to save the world not only from war but also from underdevelopment,
hunger, diseases, poverty and the destruction of the natural
resources indispensable to human life, the president said.
</P>
<P>
On the reform of the United Nations, Castro said, changes must
be made to turn it into a true representative body of the
interests of all the people.
</P>
<P>
The principle of sovereignty cannot be sacrificed to an abusive
and unfair order that a hegemonic superpower uses, the president
added.
