<HEADLINE> Rabin's Assassin Appeals against Life Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- In Israel's Supreme Court in
Jerusalem today, Yigal Amir, the assassin of late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin appealed against his life sentence for the murder
of the premier.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the five-hour hearing, Amir, who shot and killed
Rabin on November 4, 1995 in Tel Aviv following a massive peace
rally, was given an opportunity to speak in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
"I am not sorry that he (Rabin) died, and I am even happy that
he died," said the 23-year-old law student, adding that Rabin
"had betrayed his people and died as a traitor."
</P>
<P>
On March 27, Amir was sentenced to life imprisonment by the
Tel Aviv District Court, plus a consecutive six-year sentence for
aggravated assault on Rabin's bodyguard, who was wounded in the
shoulder by a bullet fired by Amir.
</P>
<P>
However, Amir's defense lawyer Gabi Shahal today suggested to
the Supreme Court that there had been a second gunman at the time
when Rabin was shot at.
</P>
<P>
He said that Amir had placed 9 bullets in his pistol on
November 4 last year, but after his arrest, police discovered
that 8 bullets remained, even though Rabin was hit by 2 bullets
and a third injured the bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyer also argued that Amir never intended to
killed Rabin, but only to paralyze him, and he asked the court to
reduce the murder conviction.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court will hand down its ruling in a later date.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firing Range Relocation Plan Causes Protest in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- About 12,000 people, including local
officials from three small towns in southwestern Japan, took to
the street today to protest against a proposed U.S. firing range
relocation plan.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted local police as saying that the
protesters, chanting slogans against Japanese military policy,
gathered on the banks of the Kusu River some 800 kilometers
southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
No incidents or arrests were reported by the police.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, a small island 1,100 kilometers farther southwest, was
the focus of attention after the rape of a 12-year-old girl last
September by three U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Since then, opposition to the American bases has intensified.
And the United States agreed earlier this year to return 20
percent of the U.S. military base land to Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
To reduce U.S. military activities on Okinawa, the Japanese
government is considering letting the United States use the
artillery range at Camp Hansen on Okinawa in rotation with few
others across Japan.
</P>
<P>
One of the candidates on the rotation list, according to media
reports, is the Japanese military's Hijudai firing range covering
parts of the towns of Yufuin, Kokonoe and Kusu.
</P>
<P>
The protesters participating in today's demonstration were
worried that the U.S. military's artillery practice might be moved
closer to their rural homes.
</P>
<P>
Takaya Sato, mayor of Yufuin, said the relocation of the
practice, if decided by the government later this summer, would
spread environmental damage.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader Decries Bomb Blasts, Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Head of State General Sani Abacha
has condemned the wave of bomb blasts and killings in Nigeria
while the Chief of Army Staff warned officers and soldiers not to
allow what is threatening peace and security to reoccur.
</P>
<P>
In a goodwill message to the Nigerian army in the occasion of
the 1996 Army Day celebration, Abacha said the recent bomb
explosions as well as the killing of prominent citizens in the
country were ''senseless and murderous.''
</P>
<P>
The attacks ''were clearly intended to create a bogey of
insecurity in the land which was faced with embarrassing threats
to lives and property, ranging from terrorist attacks on innocent
citizens and callous shooting of prominent individuals,'' Abacha
said.
</P>
<P>
The most striking case of killing that has aroused
international concern is the shooting of Kudirat Abiola, wife of
Nigeria's opposition leader by unknown gunmen early last month.
investigation of the killing is underway.
</P>
<P>
The head of state urged the officers and soldiers of the army
''to heighten your security consciousness and redouble your
devotion to duty in order to stem this dangerous trend.''
</P>
<P>
In his message on the occasion of the 133rd anniversary of
the Nigerian army, Chief of Army Staff Major General Ishaya
Bamaiyi said these negative developments must not happen again.
</P>
<P>
the army boss warned that many soldiers are still involved in
armed robbery and illegal duties, saying severe disciplinary
action awaits those caught.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the need for absolute loyalty to Head of
State General Sani Abacha and his administration, saying this is
the only way officers and soldiers of the army can patriotically
contribute positively to the stability, peace and progress of the
nation.

<HEADLINE> Jianlibao Marches to Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Jianlibao America, Ltd. said
it is going to help the Chinese athletes compete at the Atlanta
Olympic Games with best logistics support.
</P>
<P>
Jianlibao's close links with Chinese sports dated back to 1984,
when the Guangdong Jianlibao Group, Co. Ltd., which has developed
into a leading soft drink maker now in China, was launched to
develop special soft drinks for Chinese Olympic teams.
</P>
<P>
During that game, Chinese athletes, who appeared for the first
time since the country was founded in 1949, gave the world a
surprise with their excellent performance. The Janlibo Energy
Replenisher, constantly seen in the hands of the Chinese athletes,
was then called by foreign reporters as an "oriental magic water."
The Guangdong company has become the official sports drink maker
for all Chinese athletes ever since the end of the 23rd Olympic
Games in the year.
</P>
<P>
This year, Jianlibao has not been discouraged by the
monopolization by the world's beverage giant Coca Cola over the
major sponsoring activities. Instead, it has been busy making
preparations for receiving the Chinese delegation which include
more than 500 athletes and people from the press.
</P>
<P>
"The Centennial Summer Olympic Games is giving us a good chance
to do some concrete things for Chinese sports," said Lin Qishu,
president of the Jianlibao America, Ltd., which is based in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Their programs will include a grand welcoming ceremony jointly
sponsored by the Chinese embassy in Washington. The ceremony will
be attended by a number of social dignities and Chinese officials,
including Wu Shaozu, minister in charge of China's Physical
Culture and Sports Commission and head of the Chinese delegation.
Wu spoke highly of Jianlibao's efforts in assisting the Chinese
athletes and newsmen.
</P>
<P>
For the convenience of the Chinese attending the Games, the
company has compiled a guide book in Chinese, which includes all
the basic information about the locations of sports facilities,
scenic spots, transport and telecommunication means. "We call it a
trouble shooting tool for our guests," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
A 1-800 hot-line service is also available for instant
inquiries, he said.
</P>
<P>
To keep information most updated for the public, the company
also set up a website on Internet together with the Trinity Web
Serving Co. and the Sports News Department of the Xinhua News
Agency. On the site of http://www.chinaplaza.com, people can
follow the process of the games and get some insight of the
Chinese sports teams. So far, more than 80,000 hits have been
recorded at the site (meaning it has been visited by people for
more than 80,000 times).
</P>
<P>
Another major program is to sponsor a 200-strong cheering
squad, all made up by volunteers.
</P>
<P>
With another 50 volunteers of local Chinese residents, a
transport unit has been organized, employing dozens of cars and
vans to serve the Chinese team.
</P>
<P>
The company has also managed to link 32 Chinese restaurants in
providing a 20 percent deduction coupon for all members of the
Chinese team.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese beverage maker has already set up a number of
subsidiaries in different parts of the world. It aims at realizing
a sales volume of 750,000 tons, worth 4 billion yuan or about 480
million U.S. dollars, this year.

<HEADLINE> EU Finance Ministers To Meet on Monetary Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) finance
ministers, scheduled to meet here Monday, will focus their efforts
to curb public sector debt of some leading European economies to
the required level.
</P>
<P>
Of the EU's 15 states, only Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg are
on target to meet strict criteria for a common European currency,
which include bringing down public debt to below three percent of
the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The other nations, including Europe's economic powerhouse of
Germany, are lagging well behind.
</P>
<P>
Irish Finance Minister Ruairi Quinn said earlier that any
country which fails to meet the debt target in 1997 cannot hope to
join the monetary union, to be operational on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Ireland, now occupying EU's rotating presidency, believes five
more countries -- Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and the
Netherlands -- will be able to satisfy the deficit criteria.
</P>
<P>
Germany's deficit is projected to be 3.9 percent by the end of
the year, and is expected to drop to 2.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
France's debt will be some 4.0 percent in 1996, down from 5.0
percent last year. And Paris intends to cut that figure down to
3.0 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger: Peace Process Has to Be Continued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger said here today that what (late Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak) Rabin started throughout was necessitated by
Israel and any prime ministers will come to the conclusions that
the peace process has to be continued.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger found time to come to Israel from a conference in
Jordan primarily to visit the grave of Rabin, a long time friend
of his.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger made great efforts to broker peace in the post-1973
Middle East war between Israel and its Arab neighbors, an action
which has since been referred to as "shuttle diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
In less than two years, he traveled to the Middle East for 12
times. During this period, he made 20 visits to Israel and 19
trips to Egypt and Syrias, helping bring about agreements on
disengagement between Israel and Egypt and between Israel and
Syria, and second disengagement agreement between Israel and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Kissinger held a private meeting with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is leaving for his first official
visit to Washington since he came to power.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger refused to divulge contents of the meeting to
reporters afterwards. But he said that Israel and the United
States have a common destiny and leaders have to come to express
their common destiny.
</P>
<P>
He said that Rabin was a great man and he had come to pay
tribute to a great man. "I don't think this is the appropriate
time to talk about international situation," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 7 (Xinhua) -- In opposing U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali's second term election for the job, the
United States wants to turn the world body to advance its global
interests, wrote the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said in a signed article, "The United States wants
the United Nations as a fig leaf for its own policy goals -- both
to make it easier to get allies on board and to make it easier to
get the American people on board, allowing military action to seem
multilateral and humanitarian."
</P>
<P>
Washington has a clear idea of how to use it, and reform it for
America's ends. In the process, "the Clinton Administration finds
Mr. Boutros-Ghali, who is far less pliable than the vulnerable
Kurt Waldheim ever was, an annoying obstacle to its goals, as well
as an all-too-easy target for Republican criticism in an election
year."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the United States announced last month its decision
to oppose the secretary-general's second term at the U.N. office
and even threatened to use veto power in the Security Council for
this end.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the article pointed out, Boutros-Ghali has thrown a
defiant challenge to Washington to deny him a second term, thus
putting the Clinton Administration into a "public embarrassment."

<HEADLINE> Peace Process in Angola to Go on as Scheduled: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Venan-Cio De Moura
said today that the peace process in Angola will end as scheduled
as agreed by the warring sides.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks to reporters at the airport before going
to Cameroon to represent President Eduardo Dos Santos at the 32nd
Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit.
</P>
<P>
One of the political issues to be discussed at the summit will
be the peace process in Angola, he said, adding it is important
to brief the participants on the peace process in Angola and the
meetings between Dos Santos and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
De Moura considered that the massing of UNITA soldiers had
been slow and that the weapons it handed in were beyond
satisfaction as it is unacceptable in accordance with the
capability and firing power shown by UNITA during the 19 years of
civil war.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 ex-fighters of the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) had been sent to 14 assembly
camps throughout the country last month and they are waiting to
be incorporated into the regular army or disbanded according to
the Lusaka Accord signed between the two sides in 1994 to end the
civil war.
</P>
<P>
After the formation of the regular army around July, a
government of National Unity will be formed with Savimbi as vice
president of the government, according to the Lusaka Accord.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the Lusaka peace agreement has turned
for the better recently as the two warring sides have made
efforts, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Qatar Sign Economic Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Qatar signed here today an
economic accord to promote bilateral cooperation in trade,
economic and other fields.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was signed by Jordan's Prime Minister
Abdul Karim Kabariti and Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin
Jassem bin Jaber Al Thani, will update a similar one that was
signed in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that Jordanian-Qatari trade volume was not up
to the aspired level, noting that Jordan's exports to Qatar
amounted to 8.5 million Jordan dinars (about 12 million
U.S. dollars) in 1992 and rose to 14 million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Figures available show that Qatar's exports to Jordan totaled
7 million dollars in 1992 and climbed to 7.7 million dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
The two men said that they were keen to intensify efforts to
promote cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On political front and regional issues, the two sides pledged
that they would continue coordination to enhance the role of the
Arab League and called for reviving solidarity among Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian prime minister and the Qatari foreign minister
called for resumption of the Arab-Israeli peace talks and said
comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East could only be
achieved through Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab lands
including Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Balkan Countries Wish to Build Better Neighborly Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Balkan countries, concluding a
two-day meeting of foreign ministers here on Sunday, wished to
build better neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
In the "Sofia Declaration" unanimously approved by the
participating ministers, the countries called for a strengthening
of their economic and security ties.
</P>
<P>
They also reiterated support for the Dayton peace agreement on
Bosnia and said they would contribute to the former Yugoslav
republic's post-war reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
"Healing the wounds of Bosnia will help bring the region
together," said the conference's host and chairman, Bulgarian
Foreign Minister Georgi Pirinski.
</P>
<P>
Carl Bildt, the United Nations' High Representative for Bosnia,
said cooperation between the countries in the region would have a
positive impact on Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting brought together foreign ministers of Albania,
Bosnia, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Turkey and Yugoslavia, and
observers from Croatia, Slovenia, Italy and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group countries for the former Yugoslavia -- the
United States, Russia, Germany, Britain and France -- also sent
representatives to the conference.
</P>
<P>
However, as shown in the gathering, differences and disputes
remained among countries in the troubled region.
</P>
<P>
Albania's deputy foreign minister Arian Starova expressed
regrets that the "Sofia Declaration" failed to mention the
problems of Kosovo, where the Serbian authorities have denied the
ethnic Albanian majority basic freedoms.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the delegation from Macedonia, a former Yugoslav
republic, pulled out at the last minute after efforts to reach a
compromise over its name broke down.
</P>
<P>
Greece objects to the name Macedonia, which it says implies
territorial claims on its own northern province of that name.
</P>
<P>
"Macedonia is a region that overlaps three countries -- Greece,
Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia -- and we need to find a name
that won't create confusion," Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the just-concluded conference said they hoped
Macedonia would agree to attend next year's pan-Balkan foreign
ministers' meeting in Athens, Greece.

<HEADLINE> Editorial: Jiang's Six-nation Tour A Great Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
six-nation European and Asian tour is a great success and will
make a profound impact on the friendly cooperation between China
and the six countries.
</P>
<P>
This came in an editorial carried today in the People's Daily,
China's most influential newspaper.
</P>
<P>
From June 23 to July 6, President Jiang paid state visits to
Spain, Norway, Romania, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan,
during which he held in-depth talks with the leaders and made
wide-range contacts with people of all walks of life in the six
countries. The meetings and talks focused on how to establish
long-term and stable relations of friendly cooperation and
international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that President Jiang's visit, another major
diplomatic event after his African tour, has deepened mutual
understanding and trust and extended consensus between China and
the six nations.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the Chinese president issued separate
communiques with the heads of state of Romania, Uzbekistan,
Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan and signed a total of some 30 agreements
and documents, among which the border demarcation accord between
China and Kyrgyzstan is particularly worth mentioning.
</P>
<P>
These achievements, the editorial said, will have great impact
on enhancing friendly cooperation and good neighborliness between
China and the six countries and on improving long-term stability
and international peace environment necessary for China's reform,
opening up policy and modernization.
</P>
<P>
The success of President Jiang's visit also shows that
different social systems, cultural traditions, ideologies,
development patterns and economic levels are no barricade to the
development of state relations, it added.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the visit proves that the five principles of
peaceful co-existence are the guideline in handling modern
international relations and have distinct realistic significance
and great vitality," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the speech Jiang made at the Kazakh parliament,
the editorial said it made clear some important principles China
follows in safeguarding world peace and promoting common
development.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also stressed that President Jiang reiterated in
his speech that China stands for complete prohibition and thorough
destruction of nuclear weapons and endorses a comprehensive
nuclear test ban in the process towards this objective.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also called for the establishment of a just and equitable
international economic order and providing favorable external
conditions for the developing countries, which the editorial said
has increasingly captured the hearts and minds of the people in
the developing world and a growing number of far-sighted people in
developed nations.
</P>
<P>
The editorial then called on Chinese enterprises, especially
powerful state-owned ones, to make good use of foreign investments
and make way to world markets progressively.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that Chinese enterprises should attach great
importance to strengthening the economic and technological
cooperation with developing countries, "which will not only be
conducive to the development of China's national economy, but also
contribute to South-South cooperation and the common prosperity of
developing countries."

KUWAIT CITY, July 7 (Xinhua)-- Saudi Arabia and France
emphasized today that the U.N. resolution 242, which calls for
Israeli withdrawal from its occupied Arab land, is the basis of
the Middle East Peace process.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal was telling Saudi

occupied Arab on the basis of the land-for-peace formula.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Sends New Warnings to Israel Over Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has said that if Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists on taking a hard line in
Arab-Israeli peace talks, he will be exposed to international
isolation.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's top political aide, Osama
el-Baz, said that if Netanyahu sticks to his three "nos" -- no to
the return of the Golan Heights to Syria, no to a Palestinian
state with Jerusalem as its capital and no to negotiations on the
final status of Jerusalem, the Arabs will have three similar nos,
namely no normalization of relations with Israel, no peace
negotiations with Israel and no regional economic cooperation with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an interview to Egypt's weekly magazine Rosel Youssef, Baz
said that the Middle East peace process must be based on relevant
U.N. Security Council resolutions as well as the land-for-peace
principle. The interview was published by the magazine on its
Monday issue.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, vowing to take a tough stance in Israeli-Arab
negotiations, has refused to accept the principle of
land-for-peace, which was agreed upon in the 1991 Madrid peace
conference.
</P>
<P>
He has said that Israel would not return the Golan to Syria and
would not allow the establishment of an independent Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
He has also said that Jerusalem would remain Israel's eternal
and undivisive capital. Israel captured the Arab East Jerusalem in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
However, Baz said in the interview that Netanyahu's policy will
not be clear until after his visit to Washington and to Cairo this
month.
</P>
<P>
The Arab and European countries recently have urged Israel to
stick to the principle of land-for-peace, embodied in
U.N. resolutions.

KHARTOUM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat today made a half-hour stopover at Khartoum airport on his
way to Yaoundi, capital of Cameroon, to attend an Organization of
African Unity summit due to be held Monday.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted at the airport by Sudanese Minister of Culture
and Information Al Tayeb Mohamed Khier.
</P>
<P>
In a statement at the airport, Arafat praised Sudan's support
for Palestinian cause in all regional and international forums,
saying "we are proud of the relationship between Palestine and
Sudan."
</P>
<P>
On the outcome of the Cairo Arab summit held on June 22-23,
Arafat said the situation was still stale and that it needed a
special push from the co-sponsors of the peace process, the United
States and Russia, and the European community as well.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the peace process was at stake should the
situation remain as it is, adding that there were efforts to
obstruct the implementation of what had been agreed upon between
the Palestinians and Israel in Egypt and in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
This was Arafat's first visit to Sudan since 1994, following
the PLO's 1993 peace agreement with Israel, which Sudanese
President El-Bashir and his government have denounced as
treason to the Palestinian cause.

<HEADLINE> Security Beefed Up as OAU Summit Draws Near in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Security has been beefed up in the
Cameroonian capital of Yaounde today as African leaders began to
arrive one day before the 32nd Organization of African Unity
(OAU) summit which starts on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Major roads leading to the international airport, the State
House, the Palace of Congress which is the venue of the summit,
and the two leading hotels, Hilton and Mont-Febe where the heads
of state stay during the summit, have all been heavily guarded.
</P>
<P>
Armored cars mounted with machineguns are seen guarding road
barriers. Army sharpshooters keep watch from roof tops and in
tired official buildings. Blanket security cuts Yaounde into two
for hours on end to let the cavalcades of heads of state pass.
</P>
<P>
The 3,000-strong presidential guards, half of Cameroon's 5,000
gendarmerie and 10,000 armed police, have all been employed to
maintain security of the tiny mountain capital of the central
African country which hosts the OAU summit for the first time.
</P>
<P>
In one case, OAU Deputy Secretary General Vijay Makhan was
stopped by soldiers on the Bastos street in the major embassy
area of the city, to give way to the not-yet-coming convoy of
Algerian President Liamine Zeroual.
</P>
<P>
The armed guards, who do not know the OAU organizer, would not
let him pass until the identity of Makhan, who is often saluted
by journalists as "Monsieur Aec (African Economic Community)",
was verified by a Xinhua correspondent.
</P>
<P>
In another case, a journalist carrying his portable computer
bag into the conference hall also raised alarm among the security
men who took the disquette box as a "potential bomb".
</P>
<P>
During the three days of the summit meeting starting Monday,
drivers without special passes issued by the security authority,
would be barred from entering most areas of the city proper.
</P>
<P>
Police sources say everything is geared toward ensuring the
security of the heads of state and government attending the OAU
summit.
</P>
<P>
Tense atmosphere in the city is mounting. Police say they will
do everything to avoid the unfortunate incident during last
year's OAU summit in Addis when Egyptian President Mohammed
Mubarak narrowly escaped the assassination attempt on his way to
the venue of the summit.
</P>
<P>
"The Yaounde summit would be a safe one. And everybody will be
safe if not always happy," said a security officer.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges Libya to Cooperate in Plane Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac today
called on Libya "not to hinder action of justice" in inquiries
into the bomb attacks on two Western aircraft several years ago.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the appeal at a press conference held in the Saudi
city of Jeddah, said Agence France Presse reports.
</P>
<P>
"We have always said clearly that we are altogether ready to
resume relations as normal as possible with Libya, but with a
pre-condition and it is that Libya does not hinder the pursuit of
justice," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
A French DC-10 aircraft belonging to the UTA air company
exploded in September 1989 above Niger on its way from the Congo
to France, killing all 170 people on board. A Pan-Am boeing jet
also exploded in December 1988 above the Scottish town of
Lockerbie. The United States accused Libya of masterminding the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
A French judge flew to Libya last Friday to investigate the UTA
explosion with the agreement of the Libyan government.
</P>
<P>
France first concluded investigations on the UTA case in 1991
by calling for the arrest of four Libyan high officials it accused
of masterminding the terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been under a tough United Nations trade embargo since
1991 for its refusal to cooperate with Western countries in
investigating the two cases.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Stoppage of External Borrowing Affects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government's decision
to stop borrowing from abroad has been ''uncomfortable'' to the
international community, leading to a near-total closure of a
whole department in the World Bank, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
''This position is a drastic departure from the past for which
this administration should be commended,'' said Minister for
National Planning Chief Ayo Ogunlade.
</P>
<P>
''It is expected that this policy decision would be maintained
so that efforts are directed toward more effective and efficient
utilization of locally available resources,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The government stopped external borrowing because available
resources had not been effectively used for the benefit of the
Nigerians, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said Nigeria's original debt of 17 billion U.S. Dollars now
stood at 32 billion. So the government decided not to borrow
abroad to increase the existing loan stock, he said.
</P>
<P>
''This is an indication of the manipulations which we have
experienced from foreign collaborators who have now teamed up
into London and Paris clubs to intimidate us to take unpalatable
measures which have been strangulating the economy and increasing
the poverty level in the Nigerian society,'' he said.

<P>
TEHRAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A smut rain with ash and dust stroke
Iran's historical city of Shiraz famous for the Persepolis ancient
ruins, a press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Resalat reported that residents in
southwestern Fars province attributed the phenomenon to the fires
set by farmers on wheat farmlands on the outskirts of the city in
the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The smut rain often begins in the afternoons and early
evenings, and it has confronted the local residents with some
problems.
</P>
<P>
The report said that some Iranian farmers set the fire on
wheat farmlands with the aim of enriching nutrition with ash.
</P>
<P>
An environment protection expert in the province said that the
measures taken by farmers are fallacious and likely lead to
massive fires in parts of the province.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the measure does not improve soil strength and
fertility, rather, it is likely to eradicate useful plants and
contaminate the environment with very adverse consequences.

CAIRO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
arrived in Doha, capital of Qatar, the second leg of his Middle
East tour, today from Saudi Arabia on a short visit to this Arab
Gulf state, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the airport, the French president,
accompanied by his foreign, defense, interior and industry

<HEADLINE> Universal Primary Education within Pakistan's Reach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's objective of providing
universal primary education by the next decade is within reach,
provided parents, teachers and non-governmental organizations
(NGO) cooperate with the government.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank's latest report, "Pakistan can
break the cycle of low quality and low enrollment that has
hampered its education system until now by involving parents and
communities at the school level."
</P>
<P>
The report entitled "Improving Basic Education in Pakistan,
Community Participation, System Accountability, and Efficiency"
was released here today by World Bank Economist Guilherme Sedlacek
at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's enrollment rates remain relatively low and trail
behind its South Asian neighbors, the report notes.
</P>
<P>
Although universal education has been national policy since the
1950s, government effort has not raised gross enrollment rates
beyond the 60-percent level, partly due to the 3.1 percent annual
population growth rate.
</P>
<P>
"Poor parents in Pakistan are willing to sacrifice a great deal
to educate their children if they believe education will be of
sufficient quality to justify the cost effort," it added.
</P>
<P>
One of the main messages of the report is that to bring more
children into school and ensure that they learn, the federal and
provincial governments need to improve the quality of education.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan's poor educational performance has been thought to
have two broad causes: weak demand for education and inefficient,
low-quality supply," says Guilherme Sedlacek.
</P>
<P>
"But we have found parental demand to be high, even for girls'
education, when schools operate well," he added.
</P>
<P>
The quality of education has emerged as a major obstacle to
expanding enrollment levels for basic education, the report says.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, parents do exhibit strong demand for
basic education for their children -- stronger for boys, but still
considerable for girls.
</P>
<P>
But many parents feel the effort of educating children is not
worthwhile because the quality of education is so poor.
</P>
<P>
The report notes that experiments in community participation in
rural and urban areas across Pakistan indicate that participation
improves the quality of education because parents contribute more
and teachers become accountable to parents for observable results.
</P>
<P>
The report recommends that parent committees be phased in for
all government schools. For new schools, the creation of a parent
committee should precede the creation of the school.
</P>
<P>
The report notes that many private schools are run on
shoe-string budgets but still outperform government schools
because attendance among private school teachers is more regular
and they are more motivated than their counterparts in government
schools.
</P>
<P>
The report also recommends that the government expand the role
of the private and NGO sector in the educational system.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Improve Relations Across Taiwan Straits (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It stresses that it is the core of the eight-point proposal to
adhere to the one China principle.
</P>
<P>
Many facts show that whenever the Taiwan Authorities run
counter to the one China principle, great harm will be caused to
relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The essence of such speeches and actions as "two chinas in
stages", "equal political entities", "pragmatic diplomacy",
"involvement in the United Nations" is to violate the one China
principle and create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the article adds, these calls and utterances must be
firmly opposed.
</P>
<P>
The article says: "it is our consistent proposal to realize the
goal of the country's reunification through political
consultation."
</P>
<P>
It quoted Jiang as saying that the two sides can, under the
principle of one China, hold negotiations and reach agreement to
formally end hostilities, and to achieve peaceful reunification of
the Motherland. On this basis, they will commonly bear the
obligation to safeguard the country's sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
The article says that this proposal shows the Central
Government's sincerity and flexibility for promoting the process
of peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed that one year later, leaders of the Taiwan
Authorities, under internal and external pressure, made a certain
response to Jiang's proposal," the article says, adding: "it is
our hope that this is not only a gesture."
</P>
<P>
The article urged the Taiwan Authorities to take actual actions
to hold consultations without any delay, on ending the hostilities
across the Taiwan Straits, or other political issues of common
concern, under the one China principle.
</P>
<P>
This will be a judgement on whether the Taiwan Authorities have
the sincerity to improve relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The article also urged the Taiwan Authorities to earnestly take
actions to realize the direct exchange of mail service, trade, air
and shipping services as quickly as possible to create convenient
conditions and an environment for mutual contact and economic
cooperation between the people across the Taiwan Straits.

<HEADLINE> Leading Express Carrier Secures Foothold In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest express
transportation company, Federal Express (FedEx), hopes to make the
 best of the continuing fast growth of China's economy.
</P>
<P>
E. Brooke Harwood, managing director and general manager of
FedEx China operations, said today that the country has a
potentially huge market for express business, estimated at two
billion US dollars in size.
</P>
<P>
Express transportation in China has kept growing at an annual
rate of 30 percent over the past five years, he said at a luncheon
 hosted by the Hong Kong American Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
With China and other economies of Asia continuing to be among
the world's fastest growing economies, companies here are in
greater demand for time-definite delivery of goods and documents,
said Harwood.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, people's attitude towards express transportation
is changing. Foreign-funded companies in China are using express
services more frequently than government agencies, said the
managing director. He believed that the business will expand at a
big margin if an increasing number of people get to know it.
</P>
<P>
That is why FedEx has held an optimistic view on its
development in China since it started operation in 1984. FedEx is
among the group of foreign companies like TNT and DHL that took a
lead in exploring China's express transportation market in the mid
 1980s. At that time, Express Mail System (EMS) under the Chinese
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications came to be the biggest
player, who now still takes 50 percent of the domestic market
share.
</P>
<P>
FedEx is the only express transportation carrier in the world
using its own aircraft and crews to provide an integrated service
into and out of China. It gained an operating permit and licenses
in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
FedEx services covered 34 cities all over China including the
gateway hubs of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and
Shenzhen. Globally, the company serves 210 countries and regions,
delivering approximately 2.4 million items every working day.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Ready to Cooperate with Syria, But Asks It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Turkish official said here
today that Turkey is ready to cooperate with Syria on sharing the
waters of the Euphrates River but called on Syria first to stop
its support for the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Answering a question at a press conference, Turkish Foreign
Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel said, "The main issue between
Turkey and Syria now is not the water issue. The pressing
issue...is the cessation of support for terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Akbel said that the establishment of confidence and the
establishment of the atmosphere of security between the two
countries is of priority to improve the bilateral relations
between Turkey and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that Turkey was ready to cooperate on the
technical level with Syria and Iraq on the water issue, adding
that Syria ought to end its support for the PKK.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Iraq last weekend, Syria and Iraq accused
Turkey of violating international law by building several dams on
the upper reaches of the Euphrates without making prior
consultations with Damascus and Baghdad. They also invited Turkey
to another meeting between the three countries to discuss the
water issue.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly accused Syria of harboring Turkish
Kurdish guerrillas, who have staged a campaign for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Turkish authorities claim the rebel leader resides in
Damascus. Syria denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
In June, tension between Turkey and Syria escalated with each
country accusing the other of massing troops on their shared
border.
</P>
<P>
Their relations hit the lowest ebb after Turkey signed a
military pact with Israel in February.
</P>
<P>
However, signs of relaxation of the tension appeared when
Turkey's new Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan called on
July 2 for an Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Golan Heights and
promised closer ties with the Arab world.

<HEADLINE> China's Army Should Become a "Great Wall": Zhang Wannian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China's armed forces -- the PLA --
should be built into a "great wall of steel", a senior general
said during a recent inspection tour to two northwest provinces.
</P>
<P>
Heeding politics is essential to the building of the Chinese
People's liberation Army (PLA), China's armed forces, according to
Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting PLA troops stationed in northwest China's
Gansu and Shaanxi provinces from June 30 to July 8, General Zhang
urged that efforts be made to build the PLA into what he called a
"great wall of steel", trusted by the Chinese Communist
Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, by paying close attention to politics, the
most fundamental is adherence to the Party's basic line of taking
economic construction as China's central task, and upholding the
Party's absolute leadership over the troops.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Under any circumstances, we must act ideologically
and politically in keeping with the Party Central Committee with
Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, resolutely safeguard the
authority of the collective leadership of the Party Central
Committee, and firmly follow the command of the Party Central
Committee and the Central Military Commission."
</P>
<P>
"This is a major political principle, and an issue involving
politics and discipline," he said, adding that officers at all
levels are not permitted to waver in the slightest on this issue.
</P>
<P>
He noted that to heed politics and advance the PLA's
ideological and political progress, it is imperative to study hard
the basic theory of Marxism, particularly Deng Xiaoping's theory
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and President
Jiang Zemin's instructions on paying great heed to study and
politics.
</P>
<P>
The general stressed that effective measures must be taken to
improve all kinds of work focusing on military training, step up
building of Party branches in grassroots units and overcome
formalism.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Population Policy To Be Introduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A population policy that will chart
the way to improve the quality of life of the Zimbabweans will
be introduced probably within this year, a year earlier than planned.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) advisor on
population Neilia Chauke said here today, "We are consulting
chiefs, provincial development committees, non-governmental
organizations and parliamentarians to find out what it is they
would like included in the policy."
</P>
<P>
She said drafting of the policy was expected to take three
years, up to 1998, but with the progress being made, the process
would take one year less.
</P>
<P>
There is concern about zimbabwe's population growth of 3.1
percent every year against the economic growth rate of 2.9
percent. The country has already a population of 10.5 million.
</P>
<P>
The rapid population growth was upsetting the ecological
balance as people were crowded in communal areas, with rural
farmers continuing to till the tired soils every year, resulting
in massive deforestation and soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
She said the policy will emphasize on a multi-sectoral
approach so strategies adopted by different government ministries
did not conflict, but complemented the population policy.

<P>
TOKYO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus in
May dropped 46.4 percent from a year earlier to 361.2 billion yen
(about 3.612 billion U.S. dollars), the Finance Ministry said in
a preliminary report today.
</P>
<P>
In goods and services trade, Japan posted a deficit of 84.8
billion yen (about 848 million dollars), compared with a 352.9
billion yen (about 3.529 billion dollars) surplus a year earlier,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It said merchandise trade left a surplus of 447.0 billion yen
(about 4.470 billion dollars), down 41.1 percent, with exports up
16.0 percent to 3,403.0 billion yen (about 34.030 billion dollars)
and imports up 36.0 percent to 2,956.0 billion yen (about 29.560
billion dollars).

<P>
In service trade, however, Japan registered a deficit of 531.7
billion yen (about 5.317 billion dollars), up from the year

Meanwhile, the ministry said Japan's politically sensitive
current account surplus with the United States dropped a sharp
33.0 percent in 1995, but its surplus with emerging South East
Asian economies continued to rise.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hosts OIC Telecommunications Expert Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- an expert meeting of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) on telecommunications
opened here today to prepare grounds for developing technological
know-how in the 52 member organization.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 30 member states participated in the
meeting which will work for two days to draw up a draft agenda
for the Third OIC Meeting on Telecommunications, a ministerial
meeting to be held here for two consecutive days beginning from
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Rezvan Osman, president of the Second OIC Meeting
on Telecommunications, conceded the presidency of the third
meeting to a representative of Iran.
</P>
<P>
The second OIC ministerial meeting on telecommunications was
held in Bandung, Indonesia in 1991 and the first in Istanbul,
Turkey in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Osman, who is also the assistant secretary-general of the OIC
for economic affairs, expressed regret over the slow pace of
development of telecommunications and postal services in the
Islamic states.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministers of posts and telecommunications should
employ all capabilities available to enhance the level of
technology in telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the support of the OIC for the decisions to be made
at the Tehran meeting.
</P>
<P>
Osman expressed hope that the Tehran meeting would take
practical measures to attain the goal, referring to the decisions
of the two previous ministerial meetings on exchange of technology
and technical expertise,
</P>
<P>
Naturally, he said, there are serious obstacles hindering the
OIC from reaching its objectives, but the expert meeting would
make a breakthrough in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He said the telecommunications tariffs are competitive and the
OIC member states should opt for measures to reduce the tariffs.

<HEADLINE> EU Keeps Narrowing Trade Deficit with Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Trade deficit of the European
Union (EU) with Japan was down slightly to 20.7 billion ECU (26.9
billion U.S. dollars) last year, said a report today by EUROSTAT,
the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The report added that this was in line, albeit weaker, with the
trend since 1991 and 1992, when the deficit was around 30 billion
ECU (39 billion dollars) that fell, in 1994, to 21.8 billion ECU
(28.34 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
EUROSTAT attributed the improvement of EU's foreign trade to
its slowed-down imports and growing exports with Japan.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, EU's imports -- excluding the three new members of
Finland, Sweden and Austria -- from Japan amounted to 50.6 billion
ECU (65.7 billion dollars), up 4.5 percent from 1994 while its
exports rose by 12.5 percent to 29.9 billion ECU (38.8 billion
dollars) in the same period.
</P>
<P>
EUROSTAT's figure also showed that Japan supplied 8.7 percent
of EU's total imports and bought 5.1 percent of the single
market's exports.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured items accounted for 98 percent of EU's imports
from Japan last year and 85 percent of its exports to the country.
</P>
<P>
Machinery and transport equipment took the lion's share of EU's
trade: 74 percent of imports and 38 of exports, with
trasnportation vehicles alone taking 21 and 18 percent
respectively. About 40 percent of EU's imported vehicles in 1995
came from Japan.
</P>
<P>
The biggest deficits for the EU were in electrical goods,
office equipments and data-processing machines, road vehicles,
telecommunications and sound-recording equipments.
</P>
<P>
Its biggest surpluses were in clothing, beverages and medical
and pharmaceuticals .
</P>
<P>
As most EU countries showed a deficit with Japan, Denmark and
Italy recorded a small surplus of around 0.6 billion ECU (0.78
billion dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Britain registered the largest deficit of 7.1 billion ECU (9.23
billion dollars), followed by Germany of 5.9 billion ECU (7.67
billion dollars) and the Netherlands of 4 billion ECU (5.2 billion
dollars).

allegations by Cameroon of recent attacks by Nigerian troops on
Cameroonian positions in the north and south of Bakassi.
</P>
<P>
Cameroonian Foreign Minister Ferdinand Nyono, in a letter to
his Nigerian counterpart on June 19, alleged that as preparations
for new aggression, the Nigerian government has since May 13 been
concentrating troops in six different localities in the frontier
region of the north and far north of the Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
He also alleged that the Nigerian government was constructing
some social infrastructure including a police station at Jabawe
"which has been recently inaugurated and named after the late
eldest son of General Sani Abach who died in a plane crash in
January."
</P>
<P>
On the continuous hostilities between the two countries at the
Bakassi Peninsula, Ikimi said that it was Cameroon that had
constantly demonstrated total disregard and disrespect for
international law.
</P>
<P>
Cameroonian troops launched unprovoked attacks on the position
of Nigerian soldiers on February 3, 17, 18 and 19 this year,
Ikimi said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Improve Relations Across Taiwan Straits (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- An article issued here today urged
the Taiwan authorities to hold talks "without any delay" to end
hostilities across the Taiwan Straights.
</P>
<P>
Positive action by the Taiwan authorities would demonstrate
that their recent gestures and overtures directed at the mainland
were sincere.
</P>
<P>
The signed Xinhua article said that the Taiwan authorities
should make a substantive response as soon as possible to Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposals, which are a
foundation for improving and developing relations across the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua article notes that leaders of Taiwan have made some
remarks harmful to the feelings of the people across the Taiwan
Straits, and done much to damage the reunification of the
motherland in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
However, it says: "it is not too late to mend the fold, even
after some of the sheep have been lost".
</P>
<P>
History has again given the leaders of the Taiwan Authorities a
chance to decide where they will go. "We hope that they will make
a sensible choice," it says.
</P>
<P>
On June 22, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Offices of the
Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee and the State Council,
again urged leaders of the Taiwan Authorities to take actual
actions to respond to Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposal in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"This is our another effort to improve and develop relations
across the Taiwan Straits, and to promote the process of peaceful
reunification," it says.
</P>
<P>
The article recalls that On January 30, last year, Jiang
delivered an important speech on behalf of the Chinese Communist
Party and the Central Government, and put forward the eight-point
proposal for peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
The proposals received a wide welcome, giving relations across
the Taiwan Straits an unprecedented and good momentum for
development.
</P>
<P>
But since the latter half of last year, the article says, the
Taiwan Authorities have run counter to the spirit of the
eight-point proposal not only in words, but also in deeds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they have been internationally engaged in activities
aimed at creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", leading
to a situation in relations across the Taiwan Straits that the
people do not want to see.

GUIYANG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Four main railways which link
southwest China's Guizhou province with the provinces of Sichuan,
Hunan and Yunnan and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, have
been reopened.
</P>
<P>
The railways had been out of action for several days due to
prolonged rainstorms which began on the evening of July 1.
</P>
<P>
The torrential rain not only damaged the railways, but also
caused rock slides, which blocked the railways, causing great
inconvenience to passengers.
</P>
<P>
Railways running across Guiyang, capital city of the province,
are expected to be back in action within three days when passenger

<HEADLINE> Arab-American Dialogue Opens in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A seminar called Arab-American
Dialogue opened here today for discussion and consultation on
relations between the Arab world and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdul-Meguid said at his
opening address that the two-day meeting would examine "in depth
and in a comprehensive context" the Arab-American relations.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, entitled "U.S.-Arab Relations: From Distrust to
Cooperation," is co-sponsored by the Cairo-based Arab League and
the Council on Foreign Relations of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid, however, said that Arab-U.S. relations have been
characterized by a lack of understanding rather than distrust.
</P>
<P>
"I tend to differ with the title of this meeting ... I believe,
it is a little bit exaggerated to talk about distrust, I would
rather think it is a lack of understanding or lack of
communication instead of distrust," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of the seminar, saying that it is
the first of its kind that "brings eminent people from different
professional sectors as well as with different sensibilities to
examine together, in an informal context, the state of the overall
Arab-American relations."
</P>
<P>
Political analysts and experts and former government officials
from both Arab states and the United States as well as Arab League
officials, ambassadors to the league and American congressmen are
attending the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid said that the convening of the seminar reflects
"the commitment to create better understanding of each other's
issues and goals with the view of promoting the Arab-American
relations."
</P>
<P>
Henry Siegman, director of the U.S./Middle East Project of the
Council on Foreign Relations, told Xinhua that the seminar aims at
achieving a better understanding to deepen relations between the
U.S. and the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
"We will consider the (U.S.-Arab) relationship with its broader
historic prospective to establish certain basic principles and
guidelines that will affect and improve that relationship in the
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Siegman said that the seminar is not a governmental event,
adding that it is a form for informal exchange of views.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Transportation System Needs More Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 8 (Xinhua/OANA) -- With less than two weeks to
go, the Olympic Transportation System is still 300 drivers shy of
the 3,600 needed, and drivers are being recruited from as far away
as California.
</P>
<P>
"From each state we have a couple," said Erik Hiep, the
division manager for transportation for Randstad, the official
temporary employment agency of the Games. "The want to be part of
the dream."
</P>
<P>
Randstad has identified the additional 300 drivers, but until
they successfully complete the training course, they are not
officially hired. So Randstad is still accepting application.
</P>
<P>
The high crime rate in downtown Atlanta hindered recruitment of
local school bus drivers, many of whom are women.
</P>
<P>
Randstad has sweetened the offer with tickets to the opening
ceremonies' rehearsal. And because the search has gone
nationwide, the company is providing housing for out-of-state
drivers in appartments throughout the metro area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 600 of the 1,450 transit buses the Atlanta Committee
for the Olympic Games is borrowing from other cities have already
arrived. Another 400 are expected to roll in this weekend. The
remainder will come in almost daily and all are scheduled to be in
town by opening day.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Telecom Workers Continue Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Telecom offices here remained
closed for more than two hours today as workers of the state-run
Nepal Telecom Corporation (NTC) continued their strike to protest
against the government's policy to privatize the telecom sector.
</P>
<P>
Two NTC workers' unions had decided to jointly organize
part-time strikes from today to Thursday and a whole-day strike on
Friday in protest against the government's earlier decision to
invite private companies for telecommunication services.
</P>
<P>
Similar protests would also be organized in other parts of the
country, union sources said.
</P>
<P>
The telecom workers' unions last week began the strike with
part-time closure of offices after the Ministry of Communications
failed to respond to the unions' appeal for reconsidering its
privatization policy.
</P>
<P>
The ministry last year invited private parties to open new
telecommunications services like radio paging and mobile phone,
and has so far granted permissions to nine private companies for
such services.
</P>
<P>
NTC workers' unions have asked the government to cancel such
invitations and withdraw the privatization decision.
Privatization of the telecom sector would raise the question of
national security and jeopardize the entire structure of the
telecommunications network throughout the country, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the unions also asked the government to grant
autonomy to the NTC, which at present monopolizes the country's
telecom sector, prior to privatization so that it could compete
with private operators.

<HEADLINE> Zmbia To Earn 500,000 Dollars From Molasses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 8 (xinhua) -- Zambia is expected to earn 500,000 us
dollars from exporting 30,000 tons of molasses to its main
markets in Britain and the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
region.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Mukuwe Akamana, area sales manager of the
country's major sugar firm, the Zambia Sugar Company
(ZSC) in Ndola, north of Lusaka, last weekend, according to a report
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
''Sales of molasses to the SADC region and the UK have increased
considerably compared to last year when the company earned about
226,000 U.S.Dollars,'' Akamana said.
</P>
<P>
Sales of molasses had not been encouraging in the last four years
due to the severe drought which affected the sugar cane crop in the
country. However, with an improved production in this year's harvest
season, the ZSC expected to increase export figures of molasses to
meet the rising demand especially among commercial farmers, Akamana
said.
</P>
<P>
ZSC is making arrangements to the expansion of the regional market
for its specials such as jams, squashes, sauces and icing sugars.

KUALA LUMPUR, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A total of 3,065 people were
killed in road accidents in Malaysia in the first half of this
year, an increase of 218, or 7.6 percent compared with the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief of Malaysia's Federal Traffic Police, Del Akhbar
Khan, told a press conference here today that among the dead,
1,663 were motorcyclists and 277 pillion riders.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Top Prosecutor Pledges Further Anti-Corruption Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China's top prosecutor today urged
procuratorial bodies nationwide to strengthen the fight against
corruption by targeting "major and important" corruption cases
committed by state employees.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of the Supreme People's
Procuratorate, made the call at the 10th national conference on
procuratorial work, held once every five years.
</P>
<P>
The country's 200,000 procurators should also crack down on
criminal activities, and guard judicial processes and the
authority of law, Zhang told the conference which opened today.
</P>
<P>
Since the central authorities launched the anti-corruption
fight in 1993, the procuratorial bodies across the country have
beefed up efforts to crack major cases committed by party and
government officials, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
In the space of three years and five months since January 1993,
they handled 207,423 economic cases, 93,134 of which were "major
and important" cases, with over 10,000 yuan involved each. They
handled 61,695 cases of abuse or dereliction of power, of which
12,014 were major and important cases.
</P>
<P>
More than 12.3 billion yuan of state losses were recovered by
procuratorial bodies handling the cases in the period of time, the
conference were told.
</P>
<P>
Over 6,600 officials above the county-head level were
prosecuted, among whom 356 were above the city-head level, and six
were at the ministerial and provincial level, in the three years
and five month period, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the fight against crime affecting social and state security,
procuratorial bodies have brought over 1.8 million cases to courts
in this period of time.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard the correct enforcement of law, they proposed over
480,000 pieces of correction opinions against public security
departments and courts for illegal activities in the course of
case investigations and trials. They made more than 2,600 written
protests against courts for their unfair verdicts in the three
years and five months.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that "corruption has brought grave erosion to the
Party and government organizations, and to the country's
contingent of cadres, and is not easy to wipe out just by
several fights."
</P>
<P>
He requested the procurators to study the new trends of
corruption crimes in different periods of time, center their
efforts on what threatens reform and economic development most,
and about which the public complain most, and promote
anti-corruption work to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated his determination to make the country's
anti-corruption bureaux more well-equipped and efficient.
</P>
<P>
The elements affecting state security and social stability
still exist, the procuratorates should continue to do their jobs
of maintaining social stability, and supervising law enforcement,
Zhang said.

JAKARTA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 18,000 people fled their homes
in Banda Aceh, capital of Indonesia's Aceh province as floods
caused by torrential rains soaked the municipality for four days,
the official Antara News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Banda Aceh municipality Anwar Azuardi said

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market made a
nose dive today under the pressure of a weaker New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries index dived to its lowest level since March
11, closing 39.6 points or 1.78 percent lower at 2,191.2.
</P>
<P>
The local bourse was driven down by a landslide in the New York
Stock Exchange. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 114.9 points
to 5,588.14 on the fear of an interest rate hike in the next
month.
</P>
<P>
Strong employment growth in June in the United States fed into
fears that inflation would rise, prompting the Federal Reserve to
raise official interest rates before its Open Market Committee
meets next month.
</P>
<P>
Locally, the All Industrials index shed 66.8 points to 3,304.2,
while the All Resources index closed 18.4 points lower at 1,348.5.
</P>
<P>
National turnover totaled 235.12 million shares, valued at
579.34 million Australian dollars (457.68 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
But local dealers said that the market was not heading for a
crash like that in 1987, because the US economy remained strong.
</P>
<P>
They expected the local market to be in the doldrums and crab
sideways in the next few months. But some predicted that the
market would pick up in three to six months' time.
</P>
<P>
Today's free fall knocked 5.6 billion Australian dollars (4.4
billion US dollars) off the market value of the local bourse.
</P>
<P>
Most of the top 100 shares were forced down.
</P>
<P>
BHP lost 22 cents to 17.03 Australian dollars. CRA shed 37
cents to 18.58 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
News Corp dropped 20 cents to 7.25 Australian dollars, while
National Australia Bank dumped 20 cents to 11.55 Australian
dollars.

During the talks, the two prime ministers exchanged views on

</P>
<P>
Li said that the two countries have yielded a rapid development

China and Cote d' Ivoire have the tradition of supporting each
other, and conducting close cooperation in international affairs,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government thanked the Cote d' Ivoire government's
just stand of supporting China, and boycotting an anti-China
proposal raised in the session of UN Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
Cote d' Ivoire is a country with rich resources and a favorable
environment for investment, and China's experience and practice in
technology and management relatively conform to Africa, Li added.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Li said, the two countries will witness a wide
range of mutually-beneficial cooperation and a great potential.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have made encouraging progress in economic
and trade cooperation, Li noted, saying, "We hope the two
countries will expand bilateral cooperation on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit, in the spirit of emphasizing
practical results, and in various ways, and the Chinese government
encourages China's enterprises and companies to invest in Cote d'
Ivoire, and advance cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Li said that the entrepreneurs accompanying Duncan on the visit
will help promote bilateral cooperation in business circles.

<HEADLINE> Somali Factional Leader Aidid Loses New Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- In a heavy battle in Medina
District of southwest Mogadishu last night, the militiamen of
General Mohamed Farah Aidid were driven out of the newly occupied
territories by a counter attack from the forces of Ali Mahdi
Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in the Somali capital since Friday claimed the
lives of more than 51 and wounded 120 others.
</P>
<P>
Both politically allied radios of Osman Hassan Ali Atto and
that of Ali Mahi Mohamed spoke about the victory accomplished by
what they called the peace allied forces of USC/SNA and USC/SSA
which are led by the two men respectively.
</P>
<P>
Radio Osman Atto described General Aidid's forceful retreat as
a moral and practical defeat on the group of General Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Radio Ali Mahdi claimed that the allied forces have captured
one double-barrel 37 mm anti-aircraft gun and communication facility
from General Aidid's militiamen. The forces of Osman Atto stationed
at Bosnia Vicinity, just north of Medina, were fully involved in
the fighting which kicked General Aidid out of his new occupation
position in Medina.
</P>
<P>
The forces of General Aidid who have lost their newly-occupied
area have retreated back to K-7 junction, Halane former military
training school and Hosh camp (former US base in Medina known as
Sword Base).
</P>
<P>
However, the militiamen of General Aidid still continue their
siege of Medina with the possibility of regaining back the
territories lost last night. There is a heavy preparation going
on in the militia camps controlled by General Aidid in South
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
No official statement came from General Aidid nor his radio
had commented about the fighting that raged in the capital since
Friday. It is widely believed that General Aidid is reserving his
statement over the fighting until Medina falls for him.
</P>
<P>
According to the militia strength and armed wagons in Medina
enclave, the possibility for lifting the siege from Medina is too
slim.
</P>
<P>
As the sun rose this morning, heavy sporadic shooting
continued at the Green Line and in Medina where the opposing
militiamen still remain in their defense positions.

<P>
Duncan said he was warmly received immediately after he stepped
off his plane in China. This, he added, demonstrated the brotherly
friendship between the peoples of the two countries. Since the two
countries were diplomatically linked 13 years ago, there have been
continuous exchange visits by senior leaders of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng's visit to Cote d' Ivoire in 1986, and former
President Yang Shangkun's trip in 1992, greatly promoted the
development of the bilateral relations, Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with the friendly and cooperative bilateral
relations, and the Cote d' Ivoire government and the people thank
the Chinese government and its people for their selfless support,
and aid to the Cote d' Ivoire," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Cote d' Ivoire government, and the firms, have sincere
desire and great interest, as well as confidence, in developing
economic and trade relations between the two countries, the prime
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Duncan reaffirmed his government's stand to stick to the "One
China" policy, and to support the Chinese government's policy on
the issue of Taiwan. Li Peng expressed his appreciation for the
view.
</P>
<P>
Duncan said the Cote d' Ivoire President, the government and he
himself, hoped that Premier Li Peng would visit Cote d' Ivoire
again. Li Peng thanked the prime minister for the invitation,
saying that Cote d' Ivoire left him with a deep impression during
his trip to the country in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also briefed each other on the internal
situations of their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two prime ministers oversaw a ceremony at
which the two countries exchanged documents on China donating
ordinary materials to the Cote d' Ivoire government, on prolonging
the utilization term of China's first loan to Cote d' Ivoire. At
the ceremony China's Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources,
and Cote d' Ivoire's Ministry of Mineral Resources and Petroleum,
signed letters of intent on geophysical exploitation, and on
cooperation in geology and minerals.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, Chinese Premier Li Peng gave a red-carpet

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange dropped sharply today with Hang Seng Index plunging
 287.08 points to close at 10,890.
</P>
<P>
The plunge is no surprise to local analysts who have already
made predictions for a drop a few days ago, when the US employment
 figures rattled stock and bond markets in New York on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bond traders in Wall Street started selling when they learned
that a lot more people have found work in June than expected. More
 jobs mean rising of prices which will lead to higher interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is a close follower of Wall
Street, and the ups and downs in New York affect Hong Kong almost
every time.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index, a key indicator of the blue chips on the
local bourse, decreased 330.65 points at the morning close today,
but it managed to regain a little during the afternoon trading
hours.
</P>
<P>
All the four major Hang Seng sub-indices suffered heavily
today, with property plunging 603.69 points, finance down 237.40
points, utilities decreasing 230.51 points, and the industrials
and commercials down 228.12 points.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that information on interest rates in the United
States remains a major factor that will direct the trend on the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Coalition Government Wins Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's new coalition government
formed by the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) and the True Path
Party (DYP) won a vote of confidence in the parliament today.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government led by RP veteran leader Necmettin
Erbakan obtained 278 votes in the 550-seat parliament while 264
deputies from the Motherland Party (ANAP), Democratic Left Party
(DSP) and the Republican People's Party (CHP) voted against the
government.
</P>
<P>
Some DYP deputies also voted against the government though the
DYP led by Tansu Ciller formed coalition with the RP.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing is that seven deputies of the Grand
Unity Party (BBP) decided to vote for the government.
</P>
<P>
BBP Chairman Muhsin Yazicioglu said, " I will not be an
obstacle to this government, even if I do so involuntarily."
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol of the formation of the coalition
government, Erbakan will head the government for the first two
years on a rotating basis and Ciller is to take over as prime
minister for another two years.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan was assigned by President Suleymen Demirel to form a
coalition on June 7, one day after ANAP Chairman and Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz resigned.
</P>
<P>
On May 14, the Constitutional Court upheld an Appeal by the RP
which argued that the March 12 confidence vote for the center-
right coalition government was against the procedure code of the
parliament which requires an absolute majority of those who
attended the assembly.
</P>
<P>
The ANAP-DYP government won the confidence vote by 257-207 with
80 abstention, failing to gain an absolute majority.

<P>
They are striving not only for the huge commercial contract,
but also for increasing their influence in world manufacturing,
Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, major international hydro-electric power equipment
suppliers assembled themselves into four groups in an effort to
outbid each other.
</P>
<P>
China has imposed less strict terms on the bidders in
qualifications, bidding methods and commercial, financing and
technological conditions in the bid documents, prompting even more
heated competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
The sales of bid documents are better than expected, Qin
said. Qin predicted that some bidding companies may leave their
old groups, unite with new partners, or even bid on their own,
according to the requirements of the bid documents.
</P>
<P>
"They will make decisions to fully play their own advantages,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
China plans to hold a meeting within 40 days from June 24 to
answer possible questions the bidders could have about the bid
documents.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for submission of tenders is set at 6:00 p.m. on
December 18 this year. The date was specially set just before the
Christmas, so that the bidders will have a more comfortable
festival, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will evaluate the bidding in the first half of 1997. The
results will be announced in June or July next year, Qin said.

SEOUL, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Eight defense lawyers for former
South Korean Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo resigned
today in protest against the judges' decision that the defendants
are guilty.
</P>
<P>
The move came at the 20th session of the public trial of the
two former presidents and their aides involved in the 1979 revolt
and 1980 crackdown on civil uprising opened at the Seoul District
Court here today.
</P>
<P>
The three-judge panel, which accepted the resignations of the
two former presidents' lawyers, plans to appoint lawyers Kim
Soo-yun and Min In-shik as state attorneys for Chun and Roh.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh, who ruled South Korea from 1980 to 1993, are the
nation's first former presidents on trial for alleged corruption,
mutiny and treason.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges respectively stem from their
roles in the military revolt on December 12, 1979, and in the
bloody crackdown on the civil uprising on May 18, 1980, in
Kwangju, capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh, who were arrested last year, have also been
indicted for collecting millions of dollars in bribes during their
terms.

BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng this
afternoon had friendly conversations with Jean Louis Beffa,
president of French-owned Saint-Gobain, and his party.
</P>
<P>
Li said that there is a good cooperative momentum for
Sino-French economic and technological cooperation. Bilateral
cooperation at present has been expanded to aviation from energy,
communications and telecommunications in the past.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the building industry, one of China's pillar
industries, cherishes a huge and increasing market with the
development of China's economy and the improvement of its people's
life.
</P>
<P>
Li said he hoped that the cooperation between Saint-Gobain and
the Chinese side can be continuously developed.
</P>
<P>
Beffa said that the development of Chinese economy provides
Saint-Gobain with a favorable condition for cooperation, and his
group has set up joint ventures in a number of Chinese provinces,
adding that there has been good cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He said his group is renowned in many fields, covering plate
glass, sound and humidity insulation materials, pipe materials,
industrial ceramics, abrasive materials and grinding instruments.
</P>
<P>
Saint-Gobain is willing to strengthen its cooperation with
the Chinese side in the above-mentioned areas, particularly, it

<HEADLINE> Australian Aborigines Face Aids Ravage: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Australia's aborigines are
confronted with a ravage of HIV-AIDS and the country would face a
one billion dollars (770 million US dollars) health bill unless
coordinated action is taken to curb the spread of the virus,
Health Minister Michael Wooldridge said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national conference of the Students Association
here, Wooldridge said that virtually every risk factor which
existed in east African countries did exist in central Australia.
</P>
<P>
"The risk factors: a high level of sexually transmitted
diseases, poor health services, highly mobile population, the only
difference is the time frame," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wooldridge indicated that funding in this year's budget would
be directed towards an "aggressive" assault on sexually
transmitted diseases among aborigines.
</P>
<P>
"The threat that HIV poses to aboriginal populations will have
a greater focus in the Third National HIV AIDS Strategy which
comes into effect soon," he told the conference.
</P>
<P>
Agreements with the states and aboriginal representatives would
pave the way for better coordination in addressing aboriginal
health problems.
</P>
<P>
If the issue of AIDS was not addressed, Australia would face a
one billion dollars bill in direct costs to the community for
treatment, he warned.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Rapid Population Increase, Looming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's population continues
to grow at an alarmingly high rate with dismal prospects for
population stabilization.
</P>
<P>
As a result of a galloping annual growth rate of about 3
percent, Pakistan, with a population of approximately 140 million,
has now moved up to the rank of the world's seventh most populous
nation from the ninth position it occupied two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The main cause of Pakistan's rapid population growth is widely
believed to be the high fertility rate which goes with poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to the Economic Survey of the 1995-96 fiscal year,
Pakistan's total fertility rate -- the average number of children
a woman can expect to have -- is 5.9 and infant mortality is 95
per 1,000 births.
</P>
<P>
With a literacy rate of little more than 36 percent, most
people, especially those living in the rural areas, are unable to
appreciate that additional children will adversely affect their
standard of living.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, such a growth rate creates a highly dependent
population age structure that is difficult to accommodate in terms
of education, health, employment and other social services.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Pakistan's rapid population growth
is closely linked with the relatively low contraceptive prevalence
rate, which shows that family planning and reproductive health
services are still not available to, or not used by, the majority
of people who need or want them.
</P>
<P>
The latest Contraceptive Prevalence Survey by the UN Fund for
Population Activities (UNFPA) showed that contraceptive use in
Pakistan increased from 11.8 percent in 1990-91 to 17.8 percent in
1994-95.
</P>
<P>
This is, by any means, encouraging. However, Pakistan's
contraceptive prevalence rate is still the lowest in the region.
Much remains to be done to raise the level to where it can make a
significant impact on the growth rate.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that in the absence of this supporting
environment which is essential for the success of a population
program, no spectacular results can be expected.
</P>
<P>
Another worrying factor for the rapid population increase is
that the status of women in this country continues to be low.
Illiteracy, high mortality, absence of economic emancipation and
lack of self-esteem are believed to be the main reasons which
encourage women to have more children, especially when they only
have daughters.
</P>
<P>
Much needs to be done, therefore, to raise the social status of
women to control the fertility rate. That will require, in
particular, persistent efforts to increase literacy and employment
opportunities for women.
</P>
<P>
Education can play a vital role in the socio-economic
development of a country. However, in Pakistan, population
explosion and education are now inversely proportional.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the situation of decreasing
fertility rates and consequent slowdown of the population growth
can only be brought about through the provision of family planning
and reproductive health services within a comprehensive human
development strategy, coupled with empowerment of women and
respect for individual freedom and rights.

<HEADLINE> Impacts of Economic Slowdown Loom in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese businessmen have placed
their hope for a termination of the current economic slowdown in
this country, in which they see a potential crisis, on a
breakthrough in the stalemated peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen in small and medium industries have become more and
more uneasy anticipating that the slowdown will hit parts of the
economy as the gloomy picture of the Middle East peace process
hinders new capital inflows into Lebanon's distressed market.
</P>
<P>
However, businessmen refrained from directly blaming the
slowdown on the government of Rafik Hariri, the billionaire prime
minister, who masterminded the country's ambitious reconstruction
projects.
</P>
<P>
A recent bank report said that the first quarter of 1996
witnessed "sluggish" economic growth of 2.5 percent and the
annual rate of growth would drop to around 3 percent from the
predetermined 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The authoritative Bank Audi report noted that the government's
reforms policy is still suffering from the side-effects of foreign
trade deficit and growing national debt, adding that the financial
deficit for the first quarter was contained, however, within 38
percent of total government expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources close to the Ministry of Finance said that
the ministry had turned down applications by a number of Lebanese
companies to claim bankruptcy in the past few months, fearing a
snowball effect on the market.
</P>
<P>
Most of the firms threatening to close down are in the shoes
and clothing industries mainly located in the suburbs of Beirut
and in the remote areas of the North, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Layoffs during the past several months went unnoticed, though
Ministry of Labor officials tried to negotiate a compromise
between company owners and employees when cases were presented to
them.
</P>
<P>
A Beirut economic weekly, Eco News, reported that a number of
factories were threatening to stage a strike last week, but the
government succeeded in postponing, though not canceling, the move.
</P>
<P>
Private enterprises warned that there would be more layoffs if
the government insists on ratifying a new wage increase payable to
employees of the private sectors.
</P>
<P>
The dismal prospect of the regional situation also contributed
to preventing a return of war-compelled immigrants to Lebanon, to
which the Lebanese housing market had been looking forward.

<P>
Following the ending of Lebanon's 15-year civil war in 1990,
the real estate sector experienced an unprecedented boom, with
areas licensed for construction doubling to more than 20 million
square meters and the price of land increasing tremendously to
7,000 U.S. dollars per square meter in Beirut's commercial
districts alone.
</P>
<P>
But the construction boom failed to be translated into a
prosperity in the housing market. Now 35,000 apartments sit empty
in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
This summer has not seen a better indication, and the specter
of stagnation is still hovering over the market.
</P>
<P>
When unabling to endure any longer, the merchants would put
more and more pressures on the government for a tangible way out.

<HEADLINE> FIFA: No Plan to Scrap Sudden-death Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 8 (Xinhua/OANA) -- International Football
Federation (FIFA) said in Zurich on Monday that it had no plan to
stop using the extra time sudden-death rule.
</P>
<P>
"It's completely absurd," said FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper.
"There are no plans to scrap it and there never were. In fact, we
don't even have any plans to discuss such a thing. It's not on any
of our agendas."
</P>
<P>
In the sudden-death extra time, the side which scores the first
goal, or the "golden goal", wins the match.
</P>
<P>
After several experiments, FIFA decided to use the sudden-death
rule in all soccer tournament which needs to decide a winner.
</P>
<P>
At last month's European championship finals, the first major
international tournament that has the sudden-death finish
introduced, the practice drew much criticism.
</P>
<P>
Only one of five matches that went into the extra time was
decided by the golden goal, with the resting relying upon penalty
kicks.
</P>
<P>
Sudden-death rule will be used at the soccer tournament at the
Atlanta Olympic Games later this month.

<HEADLINE> Arson Damages Small Black Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A weekend fire caused 80,000
dollars in damage to a small black church in Graham, Washington
State. There were no threats and no immediate evidence of racial
motivation, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were investigating the fire at
Pleasant Hills Missionary Baptist Church, said sheriff's Officer
Curt Benson.
</P>
<P>
The fire, set late Saturday or early Sunday, began inside the
white, one-story wood frame building in the black community near
Tacoma, the Associated Press reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Forrest Hudson discovered the damage when he arrived
to open the church Sunday morning. The interior was blackened,
and services for the 20 church members were canceled.
</P>
<P>
The blaze was one of at least three church fires in the Pacific
Northwest in the past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a fire did damage to the Eritrean Community Center
in Seattle. The center is part of the Eritrean Orthodox Church,
which serves a segment of Seattle's black community.
</P>
<P>
Also in June, an arson fire burned the Immanuel Christian
Fellowship, a predominantly black church in Portland, Oregon.
That fire is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 churches, mainly in Southern states and with
predominantly black congregations, have been damaged or destroyed
by fire over the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials also are investigating a number of suspicious
fires that burned churches with majority white congregations
during the same time period.

<HEADLINE> Winner in Dam Bidding Has Yet to Emerge (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
YICHANG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The winner of one of the world's
most lucrative contracts - for China's Three Gorges Dam power
turbines - will not be known for another year.
</P>
<P>
Top international engineering giants have launched cut-throat
bidding to win the order worth hundreds of millions of dollars to
supply the first group of hydro-electric turbines and generators
for the Three Gorges Project that will eventually supply a tenth
of China's power needs.
</P>
<P>
Qin Zhongyi, vice-president of the China Yangtze Three Gorges
Project Development Corporation, explained here today that China
will put into consideration the performance, quality, loan
arrangements and technology transfer relating to the
equipment. Bidders taking part in the "examination" will then be
given points - with the highest scorers emerging as potential
winners.
</P>
<P>
But at present the potential winning bidders for the supply of
these equipment have yet to emerge, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
During June 24-27, China launched an international bidding for
the purchase of the first group of turbines and generators,
totalling 14 sets, for the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
The 14 sets, to be placed on the left bank of the Yangtze, are
expected to start generating electricity in 2003, the year that the
second-phase of the 17-year project gets underway. China plans to
eventually install 26 sets, with a total capacity of 18.2 million
kilowatts, for the project.
</P>
<P>
"We want to have more favorable prices," said Qin, who is also
the top official in charge of the international bidding for the
project, the world's largest water-control scheme.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Begins Before Parliament Ratifies Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Too impatient to wait for a
parliament ratification of a new election law, some Lebanese
coveting a seat in the unicameral house have embarked on a
campaign by hanging their pictures out and blowing trumpets to
gear up their election contests since the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Of the pictures hung on walls in the capital's streets and
lanes, no one can find a single old face.
</P>
<P>
Permanent candidates and incumbent members of the parliament
are waiting to see the fate of current negotiations on procedures
of election propaganda which will not produce any results before
July 20.
</P>
<P>
The general election, the second since the end of Lebanon's
civil war in 1990, will start on August 18 and last for four
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Several prominent Lebanese politicians, including Prime
Minister Rafik al-Hariri and former Prime Minister Omar Karami,
visited Damascus at the weekend for talks with Syrian officials on
the election. Syria, with its 35,000-strong troops in Lebanon's
eastern Beqaa and Beirut, is the main power broker in this
country.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese 128-seat parliament is scheduled to hold a
general session Tuesday, the last in its current four-year mandate
which will end on October 15, to discuss the controversial
election bill endorsed by the government two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The session is to last for three days. Though hot debates are
expected, local political observers rule out major amendments
to be introduced by the half-Moslem-half-Christian house to the
bill labeled as "exceptional."
</P>
<P>
According to the new bill, the country is to be divided into
four constituencies based on governorates, including Beirut, the
North, the South and Beqaa, except Mount Lebanon where the
election is to be held on the base of its six districts.
</P>
<P>
The most sharp criticism of the bill mainly came from the
country's Christians.
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Nasrallah Butros Sfeir, patriarch of the Maronite
Christian community, has lashed out at the bill, calling it
"inequitable and unfair."
</P>
<P>
Refraining from urging a boycott, the Maronite spiritual
leader, in his Sunday sermon, left it to the citizens to make
up their minds and choose their representatives "in the light of
the national interest."
</P>
<P>
Most Christians boycotted the last parliamentary election in
1992 on the grounds that no just elections could be held in
Lebanon with the presence of Syrian forces on its lands, but
complaints have been lodged by some Christian leaders that the
boycott had led to a misrepresentation in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Moslem religious and political establishments, including the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, have announced an intention
to participate in the election.
</P>
<P>
Talal Salman, the owner and publisher of the Beirut leftist
As-Safir daily, said the Lebanese are not satisfied with the
election bill, but most of them seem enthusiastic to turn out at
the polling stations.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese make distinctions between the bill and the election
itself," he said. "They do not care if the law is inequitable but
want to vote to prevent their opponents from confiscating the
authority in Lebanon in the coming four years."
</P>
<P>
The boycotters, he added, are those "who hate to participate
even if the election bill is the best in the world, and hate to
discuss Lebanon's sectarian, social, political and economic
problems."

<HEADLINE> Non-Seeded Krajicek Wins Wimbledon Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, ENGLAND, July 8 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Non-seeded Dutch
tennis player Michael Krajicek has snatched his first Wimbledwon
men's singles title after beatging his strong American opponent
MaliVai Washington in straight sets 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 at the Wimbledon
final here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The towering Dutch player Krajicek, the tallest Wimbledon
winner for 50 years, has become the first Dutchman to win a Grand
Slam title and also the first non-seeded Champion since 1985 when
the 17-year-old Boris Becker took the honour.
</P>
<P>
The-24-year-old player, who ranked 13th in the world,
overwhelmed his opponent Washington, the first Black Wimbledon
finalist in 23 years, by displaying unstoppable serves, excellent
defensive work and also accurate passing shots.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek, hitting 14 aces in the match to take his tally for
the tournament to 147, was exceptionally calm during the whole
match and he successfully broke his opponent's match to grab the
first set 6-3.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Washington, who ousted the 13th-seeded
fellow American Todd Martin in the semi-final, pulled himself
together to launch fierece counterattcks, but strong-willed
Karjicek held on strongly, gave Washington simply no chance to
turn the tables and finally too the following two sets by 6-4,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the final clash, Krajicek, who ousted world
number one and defending champion Pete Sampras in straight sets,
said, "for a split-second I thought 'Am I making fool of myself
?'. But then I realised not too many people were laughing and
that I had won."
</P>
<P>
Krajicek said that he was confident that he could break into
the top echelon of tennis stars after his first Grand Slam win,
"I'm confident about the future. Maybe I can break into the top
five or even better.
</P>
<P>
"I have more shots on grass now. My return and footwork has
improved. I served big when it counted today and I hit some aces
on the important points," he added.
</P>
<P>
Washington also paid tribute to Krajicek, "his serve was the
difference of the match it was really strong. When a guy is
serving like that it makes it tough to try and break."
</P>
<P>
"But it's great coming into an event with the best players in
the world and you're still standing on the last day. I can't put
the experience of the last two weeks into words," he added.

<HEADLINE> Swazi Teachers Reject Government Pay Rise Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Striking teachers in Swaziland
resolved to continue their three-week-old strike to press demands
for an 18 percent salary increase after rejecting the government's
offer of 10.94 percent.
</P>
<P>
at a mass meeting of the Swaziland National Teachers' Association
in Manzini last Saturday, about 2000 teachers in attendance rejected
the association's leaders' proposals that the strike be suspended while
negotiations continued, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Teachers, belonging to the Swaziland Teachers's Association which
as about 10,000 members, last month started a wildcat
strike along with civil servants, demanding a 18 percent salary increase.
But the Swazi government offered only a 9.9 percent salary hike plus a
four percent in allowances.
</P>
<P>
Teachers and civil servant leaders on Friday agreed on a position
with the government negotiating team after a 10-hour meeting, but
when they returned to their members for a mandate, teachers decided
to continue striking.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior cabinet spokesman confirmed on Sunday that the
25,000-member Swaziland Civil Servants' Association had accepted the
government's offer and would call off the strike subject to certain
conditions regarding a court order against its striking members.

<HEADLINE> Cut in Interest Rate Slowing Savings Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Growth in savings deposits has
slowed in China since an inflation-indexed interest subsidy was
abolished in April and there was an across-the-board cut in
interest rates for bank deposits in May.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics of the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, show that savings deposits in China increased by 495.98
billion yuan (about 59 billion US dollars) between January and
May, nearly 162 billion yuan more than during the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, savings deposits of urban and rural Chinese
stood at 3.46 trillion yuan, up 39.5 percent over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The monthly growth rate in savings deposits was one percentage
point lower than in April, which analysts say indicates the
Chinese saving practices are changing because of interest rate
switches.
</P>
<P>
A survey of depositors by the central bank has also shown that
the number of individuals who prefer to put their money in banks
has dropped by 6.6 percentage points in the past two months and
that the number of those who prefer spending to saving rose by 6.6
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Those who are saving have shifted from long-term deposits to
shorter term ones, with the proportion of deposits of three years
and above down 3.8 percentage points to a mere 13.6 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
After China raised its normal interest rates for savings
deposits in July 1993 and added an inflation-beating interest
subsidy for deposits of three years and over, Chinese willingness
to deposit money increased for 27 consecutive months, to 60.1
percent in February, 20 percentage points higher than in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
"The impact of the recent interest rate cut is evident as
people's intention to invest in equities has become stronger," the
central bank said in a release accompanying the latest survey.
</P>
<P>
In response to the question "What will be your choice if the
interest levels are lowered?", 17.3 percent of those surveyed said
that they would purchase equities instead, up 2.5 percentage
points from a survey three months ago.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Begins Before Parliament Retifies Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Too impatient to wait for a
parliament ratification of a new election law, some Lebanese
coveting a seat in the unicameral house have embarked on a
campaign by hanging their pictures out and blowing trumpets to
gear up their election contests since the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Of the pictures hung on walls in the capital's streets and
lanes, no one can find a single old face.
</P>
<P>
Permanent candidates and incumbent members of the parliament
are waiting to see the fate of current negotiations on procedures
of election propaganda which will not produce any results before
July 20.
</P>
<P>
The general election, the second since the end of Lebanon's
civil war in 1990, will start on August 18 and last for four
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Several prominent Lebanese politicians, including Prime
Minister Rafik al-Hariri and former Prime Minister Omar Karami,
visited Damascus at the weekend for talks with Syrian officials on
the election. Syria, with its 35,000-strong troops in Lebanon's
eastern Beqaa and Beirut, is the main power broker in this
country.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese 128-seat parliament is scheduled to hold a
general session Tuesday, the last in its current four-year mandate
which will end on October 15, to discuss the controversial
election bill endorsed by the government two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The session is to last for three days. Though hot debates are
expected, local political observers rule out major amendments
to be introduced by the half-Moslem-half-Christian house to the
bill labeled as "exceptional."
</P>
<P>
According to the new bill, the country is to be divided into
four constituencies based on governorates, including Beirut, the
North, the South and Beqaa, except Mount Lebanon where the
election is to be held on the base of its six districts.
</P>
<P>
The most sharp criticism of the bill mainly came from the
country's Christians.
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Nasrallah Butros Sfeir, patriarch of the Maronite
Christian community, has lashed out at the bill, calling it
"inequitable and unfair."
</P>
<P>
Refraining from urging a boycott, the Maronite spiritual
leader, in his Sunday sermon, left it to the citizens to make
up their minds and choose their representatives "in the light of
the national interest."
</P>
<P>
Most Christians boycotted the last parliamentary election in
1992 on the grounds that no just elections could be held in
Lebanon with the presence of Syrian forces on its lands, but
complaints have been lodged by some Christian leaders that the
boycott had led to a misrepresentation in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Moslem religious and political establishments, including the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, have announced an intention
to participate in the election.
</P>
<P>
Talal Salman, the owner and publisher of the Beirut leftist
As-Safir daily, said the Lebanese are not satisfied with the
election bill, but most of them seem enthusiastic to turn out at
the polling stations.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese make distinctions between the bill and the election
itself," he said. "They do not care if the law is inequitable but
want to vote to prevent their opponents from confiscating the
authority in Lebanon in the coming four years."
</P>
<P>
The boycotters, he added, are those "who hate to participate
even if the election bill is the best in the world, and hate to
discuss Lebanon's sectarian, social, political and economic
problems."

animal fossils during a recent crackdown on criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
The fossils include more than 100 bones of vertebrates and
over 1,000 from invertebrates.
</P>
<P>
After a one-month examination, Chinese experts identified 92
fossils of 15 species of vertebrates, all of them rare specimens.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Drug Industry Faces Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Pharmaceutical industry,
which accounted for 10 percent of the Kingdom's total exports in
1995, faces great challenges owing to mounting competition and
the government's inflexible pricing system.
</P>
<P>
Under Jordan's current regulations, each pharmaceutical product
produced in the kingdom can only be registered and priced by
a government technical committee after passing a quality control
carried out in the laboratories of the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
However, sources in the industry complained that once the
product was registered and priced, the authorities will never
make any adjustment to the price in line with the changes of
0price in the world market and fluctuation of the exchange
rate.
</P>
<P>
"A product registered ten years ago is being sold on the local
market today," a source said.
</P>
<P>
"We have repeatedly asked the government to raise
pharmaceuticals' prices, and if our requests are not met, we
will be compelled to withdraw some products from the local
market," said Mazen Darwazeh, general manager of Hikma
Pharmaceuticals, Jordan's leading company in the industry.
</P>
<P>
But the government said it had to make a balance between the
needs of the people and the requests of the manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Meisa Saket was quoted as saying by the English-language
daily "Jordan Times" today that "we understand the situation and
are considering raising prices."
</P>
<P>
"But, as a Ministry of Health, we also have to ensure the
people their right to health," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imported drugs pose a threat to Jordans national
drug industry.
</P>
<P>
Figures available show that local drugs account only for less
than 30 percent of the value of Jordan's total drug consumption.
</P>
<P>
The pricing system adopted by the technical committee of the
ministry for both local and imported drugs is based on the
availability and quality of the product as well as the prices
of similar products.
</P>
<P>
While the practice makes imported products less competitive on
the Jordanian market, it also makes the export of Jordanian
drugs to other countries less profitable, because 85 percent of
Jordans drugs is exported, sources stressed.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that Jordan's drug industry suffered a great
loss due to the 1989 devaluation of the Jordanian dinar.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1989, the losses of the Jordanian pharmaceutical
companies from sales to the Saudi Arabia market, one of the most
profitable markets for Jordanian exporters, reached up to 70
percent," said Darwazeh.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua has learned that the industry produced drugs worth of
225 million dollars and exported 120 million dollars worth of them
last year, only next to the exports of raw materials.

<HEADLINE> Battle With Cassava Disease Going on in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The fight against the cassava
mosaic virus disease has developed a new turn in Uganda by replacing the
local varieties with new varieties
resistant to the disease.
</P>
<P>
Cassava mosaic virus disease is a devastating disease which
attacks cassava leaves, destroys them and inhibits further growth
of the cassava crop in the field.
</P>
<P>
According to the local daily "The New Vision" today, the new
varieties Nase 1, Nase 2 and Migyera, which have similar
characteristic to those of the local varieties, quick maturity
period and high yielding, have become very popular in the areas
where cassava is the staple food.
</P>
<P>
Yona Baguma, acting head of the root crop program at Namulange
(30 km north of Kampala) Crop and Animal Research Institute was
quoted as saying that the demand for the planting material of the
BDH077WSB012S08PEQL16:4516:450901
new varieties has overwhelmed the supply from the research
institute as well as the field multiplication centers.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increasing demand for the planting material
to the increasing awareness at farm level that the new varieties
have the capacity to reinstate the cassava crop to its previous
role as the staple food in the cassava growing areas.
</P>
<P>
Soroti, Kumi and Pallisa are major cassava growing areas in
Uganda, where the crop has been severely attacked by the disease
since the disease was reported in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Cassava mosaic virus disease can effectively by controlled by
strict observance of sanitary conditions in the field.
</P>
<P>
Tororo and Iganda districts are other major cassava growing
areas in the country, which have remained fairly safe from severe
attack since 1989. Endiem

<HEADLINE> Bucaram Claims Victory in Ecuador's Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's populist candidate Abdala
Bucaram claimed victory over conservative reformist Jaime Nebot
after polls showed that he led eight points in the presidential
runoff election on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram, lawyer of the Roldosista Party, was ahead 54 percent
to 46 percent for the rightist Christian Democrat Nebot.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the presidential polls were held in this
Andean nation on May 19 and when neither of the two candidates
secured a majority, they were forced to a runoff vote.
</P>
<P>
Official results were expected in several days, but Nebot had
conceded defeat in a televised address.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram, a 44-year-old former athlete, was elected mayor
of Guayaquil several years ago but fled to Panama mid-term when he
faced allegations of corruption. He had also attempted to run for
the presidency in two previous elections but failed in both of
them.
</P>
<P>
This time, if official results confirm his victory, Bucaram
faces a minority in Congress. In the May polls, the Roldosista
secured only 19 seats in the 82-seat chamber while the Christian
Democratic won 27. That means Bucaram must forge alliances ahead
of his inauguration on August 10.

<HEADLINE> New Rules Set to Protect Filipino Maids in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
issued new protective measures for Filipino maids in Singapore as
he approved the lifting of the ban on the issue last Saturday, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
One of the rules requires that Singaporeans who want to hire
Filipino domestic helpers must first promise not to ask them to
wash cars, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Carmelita Dimzon, director of the Welfare and Employment Office
of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, said the
rule against car washing was necessary as many Singapore
households are known to have more than one car.
</P>
<P>
"Our maids already do a lot of domestic chores such as cooking,
cleaning the house, washing clothes and taking care of the baby,"
and it would be too much for them to clean three or more cars with
the little pay they get, she said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, undocumented Filipino workers now in
Singapore will be documented at the Philippine Embassy by
BDH085WSB014S08PEQL16:5516:550511
Singapore employment agencies that recruited them.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore government will also give Filipino maids working
permits and contracts with their employers. The employers must
first apply for accreditation with the Philippine Embassy, and
agree to a standard employment contract designed to better protect
the maids.
</P>
<P>
Employers are to post a bond of 2,000 Singapore dollars (about
1,428 US dollars) with the embassy for every maid hired, which
will be forfeited if the employers are found to violate the
contract.
</P>
<P>
Employers are also required to pay for the maid's air fare to
Singapore, provide 15 days of vacation a year and one day off at
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to halt the flow of Filipino job-seekers
who enter Singapore as tourists and take jobs there without
government permits.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government banned the deployment of domestic
workers to Singapore after the Singapore government ordered the
execution of Filipino maid Flor Contemplacion last year despite
pleas from the Philippines for a new hearing of her case.

<HEADLINE> China One of World's Great Sunflower Growers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China, with 1.3 million hectares
of land planted in sunflowers, has now has become one of the
world's leading sunflower growers, it was told at the 14th
international sunflower conference held recently in Shenyang,
capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Because of a short growth period and effective use of light,
heat, and land resources, use and output rate of the cultivated
land has increased, making the sunflower more and more favorable
to the country's peasant farmers.
</P>
<P>
The Academy of Agricultural Sciences of Liaoning Province bred
six new sunflower strains and grew nearly 120,000 ha of them in
some areas from 1992 to 1995, earning 235 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that sunflower oil has as high as 65 to 73 percent
linoleic acid, far higher than does soybean, rapeseed, peanut, or
cotton oil.
</P>
<P>
Sunflower oil is also high in vitamin E, vitamin B6, and
carotene.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Volcanic Activities Continue at New Zealand Mountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Volcanic activities continued at
Mt. Ruapehu in New Zealand's central North Island today with the
scientific alert level remaining at Level Three, indicating
significant eruptive activities, the Ministry of Civil Defense
said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists reimposed Level Three on a five-point scale after
Ruapehu belched ash on Sunday. They had downgraded the alert to
Level Two only two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
The NZ Television showed the spectacular eruption of the
mountain today with massive chunks of lava shooting hundreds of
meters high.
</P>
<P>
It reported that scientists monitoring the mountain flew over
the crater and saw huge pieces of glowing lava erupting into the
sky.
</P>
<P>
They said the new eruption was causing no danger as the chunks
of lava are falling close to the crater in the no-go area.
</P>
<P>
However, the eruption forced the close of the country's largest
airport in Auckland last night.
</P>
<P>
The Auckland airport reopened this morning, but some minor
airports in North Island remain closed.

<HEADLINE> Property Prices Drop in Ho Chi Minh City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 8 (Xinhua)-- The property prices in Ho Chi Minh
city, the largest ecoomic hub of Vietnam, are falling, a report
here said today.
</P>
<P>
In district 1 and district 3, the central areas of the city, a
four-room house is priced at 1,200 U.S. dollars a month. But the
owner seemed willing to negotiate without demanding a two-year
lease as was normally the practice just a year ago.
</P>
<P>
A house that adveritsed itself as suitable for a representative
office or showroom with nearly 200 sq.metres of utility space and
fully furnished door is being offered for 2,500 U.S. dollars a
month.
</P>
<P>
A lot of newly-renovated houses with facilities like air-con,
hot water, furniture, idd phone service and fax utilities have
sprung up after the demand soared during the last three years.
</P>
<P>
These houses now bring only 400 to 800 U.S. dollars a month
instead of nearly twice the amount just six months ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local market on house sales remains stable. A
typical Vietnamese house of 4m x 10m costs 10,000 to 15,000
U.S. dollars to buy, depending on its location. A street-front
house will cost more, about 40,000 to 50,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The drop in rentals is inevitable when the market forces of
demand and supply is in play, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Sanyo Electric to Boost Output of Flash Memory Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Sanyo Electric Co. will
increase its monthly production capacity of flash memory chips by
about 70 percent to five million units by the end of next March to
meet the expanding demand, Kyodo News Service reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Flash memories are integrated circuit electrically erasable
programmable read-only memories used for the mass solid state
storage of information in a variety of electronic applications.
</P>
<P>
Demand for the chips is strong, especially from manufacturers
of portable communication equipment, said the report.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of 35 billion yen, Sanyo plans to expand a
facility at its subsidiary in Niigata Prefecture in central Japan
to boost output capacity.
</P>
<P>
At present, the company is turning out three million 1- and
4-megabit flash memories per month.
</P>
<P>
The Niigata unit will introduce a new production line for
6-inch flash memories at the end of the year, and is scheduled to
operate another line for 8-inch memories sometime in the latter

SHANGHAI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The country's first health center
specializing in treating children who are suffering from
lead-poisoning has been set up in China's largest industrial
center.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 51.6 percent of children in cities
across the country are exposed to the possibility of lead
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that industrial pollution, which has become
worse even in the countryside in recent years, is the major
culprit, and one which has caused the lead content in children's
blood to increase sharply in China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the discharge of exhaust fumes containing lead by
automobiles, and an abnormally high lead content in some products
sold for children, such as stationery, toys, and even food have
been heavily criticised by the experts.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Chirac's Saudi Trip Aimed at Expanding Influence in Arab World (By Liu Guishan) (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president, who was accompanied by his Foreign, Defense,
Interior and Industry Ministers, said at a press conference Sunday
night that his visit was "very successful" and he was satisfied
with the talks he held with Saudi leaders.
</P>
<P>
"I will return home quite pleased to have put in motion this
partnership that I seek between two nations, particularly at a
time of great uncertainty in the region, for example, as regards
to the peace process," Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that through his visit and talks with
the Saudi leaders as well as his ministers' discussions with their
Saudi counterparts during their visit to the kingdom, Chirac has
at least to some extent realized his vision in pushing forward
what he has described as a new French "Arab policy."
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, they said, a string of meetings Chirac
held with senior Saudi officials Sunday successfully brought
closer the political, economic and cultural ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Saudi King Fahd and Crown Prince and
Commander of the Saudi National Guard Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz,
Chirac underlined French interest in reviving its old relations
and partnership with Saudi Arabia, set 30 years ago by both late
French President Charles De Gaulle and late Saudi King Faisal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministers accompanying Chirac were busying
themselves with holding bilateral talks with their Saudi
counterparts on various issues of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Charles Million, in talks with his
Saudi counterpart Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz, reviewed bilateral
defense agreement, including the cooperation program which calls
for the provision of modern French military equipment to the
Kingdom valued at 3.8 billion U.S. dollars, although no new arms
deals between the two countries were reported.

<HEADLINE> Students Spend Summer Holiday Working in Poorer Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 100,000 college
students from east China's Shandong Province have set off to help
farmers in poor counties or villages in China.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Education Daily, in June, the local
government and the provincial education committee jointly called
on college students to provide technological help and cultural
services for farmers in outlying poorer areas, this summer
vacation.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 students at the Shandong Teachers' University have
readily joined the activity, and planned to study the possibility
of eliminating illiteracy in mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 students in 216 groups from Shandong Polytechnical
University, headed by 95 professionals, will open training courses
on advanced technology for farmers.
</P>
<P>
Students from the Shandong Medical Science University chose the
Yimeng Mountains, a former revolutionary base area back during the
War of Resistance to Japanese Aggression and the War of National
Liberation in the 1930s and 1940s, to help local farmers wipe out
illiteracy, while providing them with medical services and
physical check-ups.

And also, French Foreign Minister Herve De Chartte held talks
with his Saudi counterpart Prince Saud Al-Faisal on means of
coordinating stance on regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Talks between French Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre and
Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef Bin Abdel-Aziz touched upon
issues related to an anticipated security agreement between the
two countries, but no details of the document was available for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in the Gulf said importance attached to building up
French ties with the Kingdom should not be underestimated in view
of the fact that Saudi Arabia ranks first in oil supply and France
buys one quarter of its oil from the Kingdom, and also, it is
Riyadh's third biggest arms supplier after the United States and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
They also take for granted that Saudi Arabia, as one of the
major Arab countries, has a big say in the Arab world. Therefore,
it could undoubtedly serve the interest of France in efforts of
pushing its new Arab policy in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that he hoped to influence all sides in promoting
steps towards achieving peace in the Middle East and solving other
issues in the Islamic Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's Saudi tour is also considered as part of a French
basket plan to strengthen its influence in the Middle East and the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The French president repeatedly claimed that he, by visiting
some Arab countries, was striving to revive France's Arab policy
which was described as based on four principles including
dialogue between equal partners, attachment to people's rights to
determine their destiny.
</P>
<P>
The French leader also pledged his support to the Arab people
in their wish for internal unity and for their endeavor to
materialize peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chirac visited Lebanon and Egypt in April and is planning to
visit Israel, the Palestinian territories and Syria this Autumn in
a bid to further foster peace.
</P>
<P>
Chirac declared in a Cairo speech during his visit to
Egypt in April that he wanted to "build a bridge from Europe to
the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Afirca Rings Bell of Peace, Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Africans ring the bell of peace
and development as their leaders gather here today to draw an
action plan for the continent in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In Cameroon's serene mountain capital of Yaounde, the
Organisation of African Unity (OAU), grouping 53 African
countries, today opens the 32nd assembly of heads of state and
government summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
Gone had apartheid and colonialisation. Political stability
and economic development become the two themes of major concern
for the three-day summit to be attended by at least 25 African
heads of state and government.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda of the summit are a set of pressing issues
ranging from regional peacekeeping, economic integration and a
series of social issues.
</P>
<P>
Ways to enlarge OAU's role in the regional affairs is another
topic presented before the African leaders.
</P>
<P>
The summit is expected to review the 35 draft resolutions
handed over to it from the 64th council of ministers meeting
which concluded here late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolutions under review include a series of thorny
issues facing africa, especially those concerning the "hot spots" in
the war-torn countries of Burundi, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Angola
and Somali where peace and stability are most desired.
</P>
<P>
How to strengthening the OAU role in conflict prevention,
management and resolution, is perhaps the most touchy issue to be
discussed by the heads of state and government.
</P>
<P>
The leaders are to weigh the option of establishing an African
peacekeeping force under the oau mechanism of conflict
prevention, management and resolution.
</P>
<P>
On economy, the top priority to be considered by the African
leaders is an action plan to step up the pace of regional
economic integration, which has been highlighted by OAU Secretary
General Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
Charity begins at home. The question is: how to take concrete
measures to implement the African Economic Community (AEC) treaty
which came into force in 1994, is a major task before the African
leadership.
</P>
<P>
The results of regional economic integration could only be
seen in the long run instead of the short term, while prices have
to be paid for the time being for the sake of the long-term
interest of the whole region. This is an understanding having to
be reached by the African leaders at the summit, said Salim.
</P>
<P>
According to the AEC treaty which was signed in the Nigerian
capital of Abuja in 1991, African countries are to establish a
profound economic community by the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
But the first thing is to establish the Economic and Social
Commission (ECOSOC), a core organ of the AEC which OAU has long
failed to inaugurate so far.
</P>
<P>
The summit is also scheduled to assess the feasibility of
creating the Alliance for Africa's Industrialisation (AAI), a
dream long cherished by generations of African leaders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a couple of pressing problems, including the
Rwandan refugee problem which led to bickering between the
ministerial delegations of Zaire and Rwanda at the OAU council of
ministers meeting, remained to be tackled by the summit.
</P>
<P>
Social issues such as AIDS disease, drug abusing and
trafficking, youth and development, education, women's affairs,
will also come up in the summit deliberations.
</P>
<P>
"What kind of Africa you want it to be?" that's a question put
forward by Malian President Alpha Konare and Eritrean President
Issias Afwerki to the 150 African children from 15 African
countries at the African children's mini-summit held on Sunday in
Yaounde, one day before the OAU summit.
</P>
<P>
"We want an African in peace and development."
</P>
<P>
The Yaounde declaration for 21st century Africa is going to be
drawn by the African leaders, which embodies the regional body's
action plan to build a better Africa.
</P>
<P>
And we will see what's on it.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolian Herdsmen Get Canadian Study Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Dorina, a 27-year-old herdsman in
the Hulun Buir League of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region, had never dreamed that one day he would go to Canada - but
it's becoming a reality now.
</P>
<P>
Eight herdsmen will board a plane in Beijing today to fly to
Vancouver to see firsthand and to study the country's advanced
livestock technology for 14 days.
</P>
<P>
The team was organized by the local government, but all eight
of the herdsmen from Xin Barag Left Banner on the border of Russia
and Mongolia are travelling at their own expense.
</P>
<P>
They will be met in Canada by the Canada Livestock Husbandry
Development Corporation, which has made all the arrangements for
the study and inspection tour.
</P>
<P>
The visit will cost each of the herdsmen 45,000 yuan (5,400 US
dollars), or almost five years' salary for an ordinary urban
worker in China. But the newly-rich herdsmen showed great interest
in the visit. Uetunasun, who boasts the biggest number of
livestock - a herd more than 7,000-strong - of all the team
members, said: "I fully support the idea of learning from foreign
counterparts; it's really worthwhile to allocate only 90 head of
sheep (each head being worth about 500 yuan) from my thousands of
head of sheep for getting advanced technology."
</P>
<P>
Erdemutu, deputy-secretary of the Communist Party Committee of
Hulun Buir League and head of the team, said that this is the
first time herdsmen have been able to travel abroad at their own
expense, thanks to the reform process, which helped them gradually
to rid themselves of the old idea of relying only upon the
government.
</P>
<P>
"The relaxed government policy and the application of
scientific technology have helped some herdsmen acquire wealth,"
he said, adding that the whole economy of the pastoral area is
transforming from its traditional form to a more intensive one,
making the improving of their level of culture and scientific
technology a priority.
</P>
<P>
"This visit will provide an opportunity for the herdsmen to
broaden their horizons and learn from the outside world. In the
future, we will try to provide them with more such opportunities,"
he said.

chambers.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the exposition is "Zambia-Malawi business spirit
'96 (produce, process and prosper)". ZACCI and MCCI are
encouraging the exposition participants to exhibit only locally
grown or manufactured products.
</P>
<P>
"In this way it is hoped that the business community from the
two countries will not be hampered by the 'information drought'
which has hitherto existed," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
During the exposition, a symposium will also be held to
discuss trade problems such as smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The trade exposition is set to be held in Zambia's border town of
Chipata on September 21 and 22.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is making efforts to strengthen economic relations
within the sub-region of southern Africa, particularly with its
neighbors. Business institutions have organized its members to
take part in trade fares in those countries to make them get to
know the environments for expansion of their business.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Surgeons Cure Indonesian Woman's Leg Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese surgeons have completed a
tissue-resecting and skin-transplant operation on the leg of an
overseas Chinese woman from Indonesia, relieving her of five years
of suffering.
</P>
<P>
Zhuang Meizhu, 58, had suffered from lymphedema on her left leg
without cure until she was admitted to Nanfang Hospital in south
China's Guangdong Province last month.
</P>
<P>
Her left calf had become swollen because of the lymphedema five
years ago, and grew to three-times the normal size.
</P>
<P>
The disease kept troubling her even though doctors had
performed surgery on her twice in Indonesian hospitals. She was
brought to Nanfang Hospital when her illness became serious last
month.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in the Plastic Surgery Department said that Zhuang was
suffering from a form of the disease that is quite rare both in
China and overseas.
</P>
<P>
They operated on her last Wednesday, resecting a great deal of
affected tissue on the diseased portion of the leg, and
transplanting skin.
</P>
<P>
"I feel quite relieved after the operation," Zhuang said
recently while recovering.

National Petroleum Company (KNPC) and Conoco, an American oil
company, signed Sunday night a one-year technical service
agreement on oil refining, official sources said today.
</P>

potentials in oil field.
</P>
<P>

industrial operations, management of the maintenance operations,
projects and industrial security as well as the optimum
employment of energy and the upgrading of oil production levels,"
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Conoco is well-known for its experience in oil refining and in
operating advanced refineries.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading South African newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
The Citizen
</P>
<P>
-- The African National Congress and the rival Inkatha Freedom
Party yesterday denied a newspaper report that the two parties
are planning a merger in Kwazulu/Natal, but saying they are
considering improving their relations in the strife-torn
province.
</P>
<P>
-- President Nelson Mandela yesterday expressed concern at an
exodus of skilled whites from South Africa and urged his black
supporters to make whites feel they belong to the country.
</P>
<P>
The star
</P>
<P>
-- About 15,000 children under the age of 17 were arrested in
South Africa's Gauteng Province last year on criminal charges
varying from bag-snatching to murder and rape, said police
statistics on juvenile crimes released at the weekend.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Approves Creation of New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet approved late
Sunday night the establishment of the National Infrastructure
Ministry, specially created for Ariel Sharon, a retired hardline
army general and the Likud bloc's veteran power-broker.
</P>
<P>
The approval capped a marathon negotiation within the
government on the formation of the new powerful ministry, which is
made up of bits and pieces from other ministries.
</P>
<P>
It includes, among other things, the Israel Land Authority,
Development of Negev and Galilee, and national water sewage
project.
</P>
<P>
As most ministries refused to relinquish some of their
power to contribute to the new ministry, fierce inner-fighting
and bickering have long delayed its creation, letting Sharon
out in the cold nearly one month after the inauguration of
the new government on June 17.
</P>
<P>
The in-fighting almost led to a severe crisis as Foreign
Minister David Levy, leader of the Gesher party split from
Likud, threatened last week to quit the government, if Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to bring Sharon into the
cabinet by today before he leaves for visit to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is to present the plan to the Knesset (parliament)
for approval this afternoon before he departs for
his U.S. trip.
</P>
<P>
Ariel Sharon, a hardline former defense minister who
launched the notorious aggression against Lebanon in 1982,
played a leading role in creating the Likud-Gesher-Tsomet
faction that helped Netanyahu win the May 29 elections.
</P>
<P>
Sharon championed the expansion of Jewish settlements in the
Palestinian territories when he served as Housing Minister
several years ago. His inclusion into the cabinet is expected to
arouse grave concern from the Arab world, especially the
Palestinians, who feared he would push the new government's plans
to expand the Jewish settlements.

<HEADLINE> French Woman Raped, Men Robbed at Home in Phnom Penh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A French woman was raped after
she and her three male compatriots were robbed at their home in
Phnom Penh Friday, the Cambodian Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted a French Embassy spokesman as saying on Sunday
that the woman had been sent to France Saturday for medical care.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said it was the first time that an attack had
taken place inside a foreigner's own house.
</P>
<P>
Ou Vanna, chief of the police department for foreigners'
affairs, said the French young woman was raped by a Cambodian man
who broke into the house with three other unidentified men.
</P>
<P>
"The woman and three Frenchmen (in the house) were robbed at
gun point before the rape occurred," Vanna added.
</P>
<P>
Mao Chandara, first deputy of the Judicial Center for the
Ministry of Interior, said the robbers took away 400 U.S. dollars
from the expatriates.
</P>
<P>
The rape and robbery, one of the most violent incidents in a
recent spree of robberies against foreigners, took place just
hours after the Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk warned that
foreigners "should never be sure" they will remain unharmed in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The king admitted in a statement that there are security
problems in his country, adding that the government will tackle
these problems.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned the foreigners to "take maximum precautions or
measures in order to avoid death or undeserved accidents."
</P>
<P>
Social security has deteriorated recently in Cambodia as crimes
rose.
</P>
<P>
According to the report of the Ministry of Interior, there were
48 robberies and 40 murders in which 25 were injured in the
capital in the first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Two-Thirds of China's Eyeglasses Below Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A random survey conducted by
technical supervisory departments has found that only 34.6 percent
of the eyeglasses in China are up to standard, China's "Market
Daily" has reported.
</P>
<P>
About 300 million Chinese people wear glasses, generating an
annual demand for 75 million pairs, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that 36.9 percent of Chinese middle and primary
school students have poor eyesight, 33.6 percent of them
short-sighted. Bad eyesight and myopia can be found in 65.9
percent and 63.8 percent of middle and senior high school
students, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the huge market demand has aroused the
interest of business people interested in investing in the
increasing number of glasses shops.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there were only four specialty glasses
shops in Beijing in the 1980s, but that the number is now more
than 500, most of them run by private business people.
</P>
<P>
Although the government-run shops make a profit of 30 percent,
that of many shops is as high as 100 to 200 percent, according to
the paper, which also criticizes some shops for their
poorly-trained technicians and bad business ethics.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributes the disarray in the market to the lack of
laws and regulations and weak professional standards.

HANOI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Dengue fever has killed 45 people and
affected 9,700 others in Southern Vietnam since May, according to
the official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Another 300 people in the south are suffering from typhoid

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Approves Huge Budget Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Treasury's plan for a 4.9
billion shekel (about 1.63 billion U.S. dollars) cut in the
government's 1997 budget was approved at a cabinet session after
seven hours of debate here late Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the action as
"painful but inevitable surgery," saying that "this is only a
partial step." Foreign Minister David Levy and two other
ministers abstained in the final vote.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's comprehensive plan demands a series of cuts
ranging from drastic reductions in child allowances, standing
army salaries and pensions, to extra medical treatment costs and
increases in public transport fares.
</P>
<P>
The proposal sets out plans for a total 1997 budget of just
over 170 billion shekels (about 57 billion dollars), nominally
less than this year's budget of 172 billion shekels, without
inflation adjustments.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly Israel still has the needs of a developing modern
society," Finance Minister Dan Meridor said. "However, the
previous government's health, education, and welfare expenditure
added up to a sum that was beyond our capabilities."
</P>
<P>
"Hence the need for tough decisions which necessitated public
courage. It would have been easier to be popular," he added.
</P>
<P>
There is hardly a family in the country that will not be
affected by the cuts, which will cover all sectors of the
population.
</P>
<P>
The main budget cuts include:
</P>
<P>
-- Flat payments of 10 shekels (about 3.3 dollars) for each
visit to a doctor and 20 shekels (about 6.6 dollars) for
out-patient appointments;
</P>
<P>
-- A 50 percent reduction in child allowances for the first
two children in a family with up to three children, where the main
bread-winner earns more than the average wage, but less than
1.5 times the average wage. Families with a higher income will
not receive any payment for the first two children;
</P>
<P>
-- Cuts in benefits to retired career army officers;
</P>
<P>
-- Repeal of the Demobilized Soldiers Law and the Veteran
Citizens Law;
</P>
<P>
-- Increase of public transport fares by 13 percent;
</P>
<P>
-- Dismissal of hundreds of civil servants, including 350 in
public works and 100 in transport;
</P>
<P>
-- Delay in introduction of longer school day until the year
of 2000, instead of 1998;
</P>
<P>
-- A 20 percent tax on lottery and other gambling wins worth
1000 shekels (about 333 dollars) or more.
</P>
<P>
The budget-cut decision has triggered strong reaction from the
 opposition parties. Heated debates are expected at the Knesset
(Israel's parliament), which must approve the final 1997 budget
no later than October 28.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Experts Call for Recycling of Solid Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Many Chinese experts attending a
conference in Kunming of southwest China's Yunnan Province have
said that attention should be paid to recycling large amount of
solid waste, "China Chemical Industry News" has reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that China produces 60 million tons of solid
waste without recycling each year, resulting in huge economic
losses and damage to the environment.
</P>
<P>
Non-ferrous metal mines accumulate a total of four billion tons
of slag ore and urban areas generate 1.64 billion tons of garbage
a year, most of which is not collected for recycling.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, experts urge that a national solid waste
recycling engineering center be established.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the experts as saying that developed countries
place great importance on the recycling of solid waste and have
established new industries as a result.
</P>
<P>
Because China is poor in resources in relation to its huge
population, greater efforts must be made in using the solid waste
in as good a manner as possible, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Tissue Bank In Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 8 (Xinhua)-- The Sri Lanka Tissue Bank has been
set up to enable seriously ill patients to live longer with the
tissues of a dead person in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society (SLEDS), which was set up in
1961, has received a warm response from the people of Sri Lanka,
and the Sri Lankan International Eye Bank (SLIEB) launched in 1965
has gifted over 36,400 corneas to foreign countries as well.
</P>
<P>
Even at that time there were already several volunteers to
donate parts of their bodies for transplant, but the technology
was not available then for tissue banking, according to Dr. Hudson
Silva, director of the SLEDS.
</P>
<P>
But since then, Sri Lanka's Atomic Energy Authority (SLAEA) and
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) based in Vienna have
joined hands to fill this gap in information and technology and to
demonstrate the peaceful application of atomic energy, Dr. Silva
said.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the Sri Lankan Tissue Bank was completed in
July last year as a joint project of the SLIEB, the Sri Lankan
Health Ministry and the SLAEA.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lanka's Tissue Bank would serve as a model for the
South Asian region, Dr. Silva said.
</P>
<P>
The tissues obtained from dead bodies (cadavers) are preserved
after irradiation by gammarays. Some human tissues can be
steralized by chemical processes and the use of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
Among the tissues available at the bank are skin, bones, heart
valves, duramater, cartilage, ear drums, amnion and sclera. It can
 provide bones and amnion tissues at present, he said.
</P>
<P>
Skin has been used in tissue grafting in patients with burns
and wounds. Amnion tissue, when freeze-dried, irradiated and used
on these patients, relieves their pain and is a good skin
substitute.
</P>
<P>
There is a high demand for bones, mainly due to accidents. The
tissue bank now prepares for customers tailored bones according to
the surgeon's requirements of a particular type, size and shape of
a bone at short notice.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Silva said long bones and bone chips have already been used
in Colombo National Hospital and ribs have been used at the Dental
Hospital to repair jaws and orbits.
</P>
<P>
Heart valves have been used in large quantities to help
children who suffer leaking valves caused by rheumatic fever.
</P>
<P>
There is also a demand for duramater, the tick fibrous covering
of the brain inside the skull, for repair of recurrent hernias,
head injuries and eye operations, according to Dr. Silva.
</P>
<P>
The tissue bank has already supplied amnion for burn victims in
India, Pakistan and Nigeria. It has supplied sclera for eye
surgery in Abu Dhabi and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Caspian Sea's Sturgeons Reduced Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Sturgeons in the Caspian Sea have
declined by two-thirds over the past five years, according to
Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
Research by fishery protection experts of the Commonwealth
shows the number of sturgeon has gone from 200 million to 60
million, a reduction of more than 60 per cent.
</P>
<P>
At this rate the sturgeon, regarded as one of the rarest fishes
in the sea, will be listed in the red book of the world's precious
rare animals in two or three years. This new problem in the
protection of the sea's ecological environment has attracted great
attention throughout the world recently.
</P>
<P>
The sharp reduction of the Caspian sturgeon is due to lack of
protection, the uncoordinated actions of states along the coast of
the Caspian and over-fishing.
</P>
<P>
In the past, only two countries, the former Soviet Union and
Iran, borded the coast. They signed many agreements to exploit
jointly fish resources of the sea.
</P>
<P>
Under these agreements, only ships of the two countries could
sail or fish in the sea, and people from other countries were
banned from boarding these ships without permission.
</P>
<P>
To protect the fish, the two countries reached an accord in the
1960's to suspend catching the fish when a trend indicating the
fish's rapid reduction appeared
</P>
<P>
Following the Soviet Union's breakup in 1989, the coastal
states increased to five: Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan
and Azerbaijan. The mechanism controlling the destiny of economic
fishes of the Caspian Sea has since been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Agreements signed by the old Soviet Union and Iran have,
essentially, not been complied with by all the five states.
Driven by the tremendous value of sturgeon roe, illegal catches
have become rampant day-by-day, even in the sturgeons' spawning
waters.
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports here say the sturgeon catch has declined
enormously because of the rapid reduction of fish in the sea.
</P>
<P>
The annual catch of the Soviet Union in the 1980's was 30,000
tons, but in 1995 the total fished by all states except Iran was
3,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the total catch of this year will be 800
tons and the quality will be poorer than before.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Europe Desire EU, NATO Membership: Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from central and eastern
European countries today met in Salzburg and expressed their will
to be included in an expanded European Union, providing security
and promotion of economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Austrian President Thomas Klestil told the opening ceremony
that guaranteeing security, the eastern expansion of the European
Union (EU) and improving Europe's international standing were the
most important tasks for the "new Europe."
</P>
<P>
Open borders and markets in European countries would bring some
threats to the security of the region, such as organized crime,
drug trafficking and illegal migration, he told the three-day
meeting organized by the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
To fight these crimes, European countries needed an effective
mechanism for preventing conflicts and controlling crises,
Klestil said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the integration of the central and eastern
European countries would promote Europe's international
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Slovenian President Milan Kucan told the summit that "Europe is
destined for cooperation," but the happy world of cooperation
would not come by itself.
</P>
<P>
The summit is being attended by heads of state and government
leaders from 12 central and eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite Russian objections, most heads of state at the summit
expressed their hope of joining the EU and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn said integration was the
most important means of modernization, and could bring about
stability in central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma said a suspension of the
political and economic integration would only lead to "a new
Berlin Wall."
</P>
<P>
Some leaders mentioned Russia's attitudes to the expansion of
the EU and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Romanian President Ion Iliescu said Russia's position had to be
taken into account when enlarging the size of NATO and the EU. It
was important for countries in this region to establish a
long-term relationship of confidence with the regional powerhouse,
especially in the field of economy.
</P>
<P>
But other leaders said that during the expansion of NATO,
Russia no longer had to feel threatened or isolated from other
European countries.
</P>
<P>
"There is no more need (for Russia) to think of NATO as a
potential aggressor," said Polish Prime Minister Wlodzimierz
Cimoszewicz.

<HEADLINE> Language Problems Cost Jobs In Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Lack of second language skills
prevented many British job-seekers from obtaining employment,
forcing UK-based financial services to recruit foreigners instead,
said a survey agency in London.
</P>
<P>
A London branch of the Survey agency, Reed Accountancy, found
that one in three jobs requires a second language. Most of these
are going to candidates from France, Germany and the Benelux
countries.
</P>
<P>
British job-seekers in the financial services area are likely
to be passed over for possibly less technically qualified but
bilingual Europeans, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The second language demand arises from the rising number of
foreign companies in London, particularly in the area of financial
services.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years a number of German, French and American
banks have invested heavily in the city and have been anxious to
recruit staff in the UK who can deal with their pan-European
clientele.
</P>
<P>
The lack of fluency in a second language is partly a
traditional British problem, said John Taylor, a senior lecturer
in German at the University of Surrey.
</P>
<P>
The number of language students at UK universities was
declining, despite the demand. Applications to do German, French
and Russian degrees fell between 11 and 21 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Language problems are also holding back the travel and tourism
industry. It was learned that the airline had been forced to go to
the Netherlands and France to recruit bilingual cabin staff for
its expanding Gatwick operation.
</P>
<P>
To combat the problem, the English Tourist Board now runs
one-day courses to get hotel staff used to dealing with requests
in other languages.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Sends Congratulatory Message to OAU Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today sent
a congratulatory telegram to the 32nd Assembly of Heads of State
and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which
opened today in Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
The telegram said African countries are an important part of
the developing world and represent an active force in
international affairs, in a world that is going towards
multipolarity.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the telegram said, the political situation in
Africa has gradually stabilized and its economy looked up with a
growing tendency towards building a stronger Africa through
concerted efforts.
</P>
<P>
A stable, prospering and united Africa will not only serve its
own interests, but also help beef up the entire developing world
and serve world peace and prosperity, the telegram said, adding
that China has the full confidence in the future of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The telegram praised the OAU's great contribution in its 33
years of history to the political liberation of Africa, and to its
peace, stability and economic integration in the new era. The OAU
"has always been a banner of solidarity and struggle for African
countries," the telegram said.
</P>
<P>
The telegram said China has always valued its friendship and
cooperation with Africa and set store by its ties with OAU and
African countries. It called Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
recent African tour "an important event in the history of
Sino-African relations."
</P>
<P>
"China and Africa, the biggest developing country and the
largest developing continent respectively, are linked by a common
destiny. They should stand together through thick and thin," the
telegram said.
</P>
<P>
China stands ready to work with Africa to forge a long-term
stable and friendly relationship and all-round cooperation towards
the 21st, the telegram said. It promised that China will always,
as it did in the past, support African countries and the OAU in
their efforts for peace and development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that with the concerted efforts of all the
African countries and the OAU, the African continent will advance
towards a new century of development with a whole new look," the
premier said in the telegram.
</P>
<P>
The premier wishes the assembly a complete success.

<HEADLINE> Poland Marks 50th Anniversary of Kielce Pogrom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000 Poles and Jews
gathered today in Kielce in central Poland to commemorate the
pogrom 50 years ago, in which 42 Jews were killed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in front of the house on the Planty Street, where the
massacre took place on July 4, 1946, Polish Prime Minister
Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz expressed "deep regret" for all wrongs
done by Poles to Jews and called for "reconciliation and
brotherhood" between them.
</P>
<P>
Others at Sunday's ceremony included the mayor of Kielce,
Boguslaw Ciesielski, Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, and
other Polish political and religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
Jews from Israel, the United States and Several European
Countries, including a few holocaust survivors, were also present.
</P>
<P>
The Kielce massacre occurred after the end of world war
ii. When Jews returned to their homes from the concentration camps
of the Germans, they found that their houses had been occupied by
Poles and the atmosphere became hostile.
</P>
<P>
On the day of the tragedy, there were a false report that a
Polish boy who had been missing for a few days, then resurfaced,
had been abducted by the Jews and held in the house at 7 Planty St.
</P>
<P>
An angry mob soon gathered before the house. A lieutenant and
three soldiers entered the house and fired their machine guns. Two
girls were thrown out of a second-floor balcony and killed.
Others were dragged out of the house and killed by the mobs.
Altogether 42 Jews were killed.
</P>
<P>
Although 12 people stood trial and nine were sentenced to death
within a week of the massacre, the event remained a mystery in the
past decades.
</P>
<P>
An official investigation of the event was only started in 1989
and is still underway. The Polish government officially
apologized for the pogrom.
</P>
<P>
The massacre soon sparked a massive emigration of the Jews.
Before it, about 250,000 Jews were living in Poland. Today the
figure is around 5,000.
</P>
<P>
Flowers were put in front of the house in memory of the victims
at today's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Polish parliament observed a minute's silence
for the victims, with its president Jozef Zych calling for a
thorough investigation of the pogrom.

<HEADLINE> US Firms Sell Banned Pesticides to India: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Some top US companies exported
over 1,050 tons of highly toxic banned pesticides to India from
1992 to 1994 by concealing the names of the chemicals and their
manufacturing firms, the Times of India reported today, quoting
findings of a US foundation.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,000 tons of these chemicals were also sold in Pakistan
and over 3,000 tons in Sri Lanka during the same period, said a
comprehensive study released this week by the Los Angeles-based
Foundation for Advancements in Science and Education (FASE).
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the actual figures could be even higher
as nearly two thirds of the US pesticide exports were not
specifically identified in shipping records, which is in violation
of the US government regulations.
</P>
<P>
The exported pesticides mainly fell under three categories --
organophosphates, carbamate, organochlorines and bipyridyl -- all
highly toxic substances, the study said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that organochlorine pesticides attack the brain and
nervous system and can cause breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
The FASE study said that in the past five years, US companies
have exported over 114,600 tons of pesticides that are banned in
their own country, mainly to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The US export of banned pesticides has increased by 10 percent
since 1990 when the FASE conducted its first such study.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Raps US Proposal on Labor Standards in WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is opposed to a proposal
by the US and Norway to set up a working group to study basic
labor standards within the framework of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the Thai officials were quoted as saying by
the local press today.
</P>
<P>
The officials of the Commerce Ministry stressed that Thailand
and the other member countries of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) hold a unified position on this issue.
</P>
<P>
The proper body to oversee the labor issue is the International
Labor Organization (ILO), they noted.
</P>
<P>
At a WTO senior official meeting earlier in Geneva, US and
Norwegian officials proposed that a working party be created at
the WTO ministerial meeting scheduled for December in Singapore to
report findings on labor issues regularly in the future.
</P>
<P>
A draft proposal distributed by them suggested that standards
be established in four areas -- collective bargaining rights, the
right to form associations, prohibition of child and forced labor,
and an end to sex discrimination at the workplace.
</P>
<P>
The Thai officials said the developed countries should allow
the developing countries to grow gradually and improve themselves
without interference.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the US did not sign in many ILO
conventions, while most developing countries have ratified these
conventions.
</P>
<P>
The US should at least accept and sign those ILO conventions
before trying to force any labor standards in the WTO, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Union Protests Legalizing Foreign Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Congress of Thailand has
threatened to organize a nationwide strike if the government does
not reverse its decision to legalize foreign labor in the country,
the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Suvit Hathong, president of Thailand's largest labor union,
said the legalization of foreign labor will put hundreds of
thousands of Thai workers out of their jobs and lead to numerous
social problems.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 workers from Bangkok and neighboring provinces
staged a rally on Sunday in front of the government house to press
home their demand.
</P>
<P>
Late last month the government decided to allow 700,000 illegal
immigrants, mostly Burmese, Laotians and Cambodians, to work
legally in 39 of the country's 76 provinces.
</P>
<P>
Under the decision, immigrant workers can take up employment in
fisheries, agriculture, construction, transportation and industry.
</P>
<P>
Government agencies and labor leaders have agreed that there is
a labor shortage in fisheries, agriculture and construction
sectors, but labor unions claim that vacancies in transport and
industrial sectors can be filled by Thai workers.

<HEADLINE> Pottery Landscaping in Dalian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Dalian's Pottery Landscape Park,
the largest of the kind in northeast China, opened to the public
earlier this month in Liaoning Province's coastal city.
</P>
<P>
The park covers 6,500 square meters with more than 4,000 potted
plants that represent the five biggest schools of this type of
landscape art in China.
</P>
<P>
Of the exhibits, the potted gingko, maple, and multi-branch
iron trees are rarely seen in northern China, where the weather is
not as hospitable as in southern China.
</P>
<P>
The landscape creates a scene in miniature with an artistic
treatment of woody plants and herbs, contained in pots decorated
with water and rockery.
</P>
<P>
The art was developed in China over 1,000 years ago when the
Chinese began to plant trees in earthenware pots, pottery, or
wooden buckets, a practice that was later developed by the
Japanese.

<HEADLINE> Villages Immune from Criminal Case for 30 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A large number of Chinese villages
along the ancient Silk Road have not reported a single crime for
over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
While a growing crime wave sweeps the world, villages in the
Hexi Corridor in northwest China's Gansu Province have been immune
from thieving and criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attribute the phenomenon partly to the simple
and honest customs maintained since the Han and Tang Dynasties
over 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
People around the world, of all ethnic groups, have for
thousands of years, dreamed of safe and crime free
communities. But few, if any, will have succeeded like the Hexi
villages.
</P>
<P>
Co-ordination work by local neighborhood committees has also
played an important role, said one local official.
</P>
<P>
Every village has one co-ordinating committee, which deals with
disputes and squabbles among the villagers, and helps them solve
any difficulties. As a result many incidents that suddenly flare
up were settled before they had a chance of worsening into
criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
However, the customs of the villages have seen considerable
changes over the past few years as a result of the implementation
of the country's reform and opening-up policy. The co-ordinating
committees have been able to maintain the village life by
improving their working environment.
</P>
<P>
In Toudun Village, a relatively rich village, the co-ordinating
committee provides good board and lodgings for migrant laborers,
who account for one-fifth of the total population of the village.
</P>
<P>
The committee persuaded both the employees and the employers to
sign contracts, in an attempt to protect the rights and interests
of both parties.
</P>
<P>
As for the villagers, the committee manages to publicize legal
knowledge among them, and offers moral education-related lectures
to them.
</P>
<P>
But as people in the world watch the daily drama of crime
unfold, the people of the Hexi area of China cannot even remember
when the local policeman was last called in to investigate a
crime.

<HEADLINE> World AIDS Conference Opens Amid Urgency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The 11th International AIDS
conference which opened in Vancouver, Canada today, will focus on
the spread of AIDS and new drugs to combat the disease.
</P>
<P>
About 15,000 delegates from 125 countries are participating,
according to the local press.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations estimates 21.8 million people around the
world are living with HIV or AIDS. Some 8,500 people are infected
daily -- more than five every minute -- with HIV that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000 delegates are health-care providers, people with
HIV-AIDS, educators and public health workers. Their theme at the
world's biggest-yet AIDS conference is "One World, One Hope."
</P>
<P>
Since the global pandemic took hold in the early 1980s, 5.8
million people have died of the killer disease, which destroys the
immune system.
</P>
<P>
The number of HIV infections is rising sharply in Asia, where
the epidemic was found only in the late 1980s, said Peter Piot,
head of the United Nations program on HIV-AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Africa remains the most affected continent. It accounts for
almost two-thirds of the worldwide cases of HIV infection and
about three-quarters of all cases of full-blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of people with HIV or AIDS live in
developing countries, where the focus must be on education and
prevention rather than high-tech drugs, the local press said,
quoting medical experts.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto off to Europe for Medical Check-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto left
here last night for a medical check-up in an undisclosed European
country, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The 75-year-old head of state is accompanied by four of his six
children, the sources said, adding that there are no ministers in
his entourage.
</P>
<P>
The sources did not specify in which hospital Soeharto would
undergo the medical check-up and when he would return home.
</P>
<P>
Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said earlier on Friday that
the check-up was expected "to take a few days."
</P>
<P>
Foreign news agencies reported over the weekend that the
president would go to Frankfurt, Germany, for examination of heart
and liver problems.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who performed no official duties on Saturday, played
a two- hour, nine-hole golf round in the morning, the Republika
daily said.
</P>
<P>
In August 1994, Soeharto underwent a number of medical tests at
the Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital, where he was found to have
kidney stones. The doctors later gave him a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah has dropped against the US dollar on
Singapore and Indonesian markets since the announcement of
Soeharto's medical check-up abroad last Friday.

<HEADLINE> Drama on Aging Popular in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A rare opportunity for the elderly
to get up on stage has occurred in China's capital, with a
dramatic turn that cuts against the usual fare about young people
and their love affairs.
</P>
<P>
The recent success of "Bingtanghulu", a drama about the city's
senior citizens, has stunned many critics.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic performance has run for 20 consecutive nights,
with theaters full to capacity.
</P>
<P>
The title of the work means "sugarcoated haws on a stick". It
concerns a group of old people who gather to tell the stories of
their own lives, and includes the conflicts between the old and
the young, a common enough theme, but a complex social problem.
</P>
<P>
Up on the stage, actors and actresses come forward one by one
to tell of their worries and loneliness after retirement.
</P>
<P>
Some critics have said that the drama encourages young people
to think about the lives of their parents' generation, which spent
its golden years in the age before reforms and opening-up and
which went through hardships in the 1960s and 1970s. Some now find
happy days late in life, but many simply find that they cannot
adjust to the changing society.
</P>
<P>
To some extent, the old are pushed into a corner of society as
the younger generation ignore their psychological needs. This is
partly because of the improving economy and the introduction of
western culture that are causing a break with thousands of years
of tradition.
</P>
<P>
More young people are preferring to live apart rather than stay
under the same roof as their parents, as housing conditions
improve, but the number of old people has been growing, moving
China into an "aged society", as sociologists warn of the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
The drama is the work of a group of young artists from two of
Beijing's culture and art troupes, who believe that art might be a
better way to enlightment the public than academic papers.
</P>
<P>
They are now preparing a national tour to spread awareness
through their work.

Beijing now has 22 public libraries. The Capital Library, with
a floor space of 10,700 square meters, has a collection of more
than 2.5 million books. Its number of rare books stands at 34,000.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Testifies Again in Whitewater Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today testified on videotape for a second Whitewater-related
trial, for the defense in the trial of two Arkansas supporters
charged with fraud and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
On the order of U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright,
Clinton's attorneys and spokesmen declined to discuss the
two-plus-hours deposition in the White House.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released afterwards, the White House said, "The
president has consistently stated that he will provide the court
with whatever information he can offer and today's deposition
fulfills that promise."
</P>
<P>
Clinton has not been charged with any crime but was subpoenaed
to testify as a witness for the defense in the criminal trial of
small-town bankers Herby Branscum Jr. and Robert Hill, who are
charged with violating federal laws to curry favor with Arkansas
Governor Clinton in 1990 and win state appointments.
</P>
<P>
Today's session was shorter than last time's four-plus hours
because the defense attempted to restrict the line of questioning
to how Clinton came to appoint the men to state offices. Clinton
appointed Branscum for the state highway commission and
reappointed Hill to the state banking board.
</P>
<P>
In April, Clinton testified by videotape in the Whitewater
trial of Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker, and James and Susan
McDougal. The three were convicted.
</P>
<P>
Branscum and Hill were charged in February in an 11-count
indictment with misapplying funds from the Perry County Bank and
channeling the money through relatives to federal and state
political campaigns, including Clinton's 1990 governor's race.
Prosecutors are trying to show that some of the money went to
Clinton's presidential exploratory campaign in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Also, the government alleges Branscum and Hill conspired not to
file reports with the Internal Revenue Service on withdrawals of
52,500 dollars from the Clinton for Governor campaign account at
their Arkansas bank. The IRS requires reports on withdrawals of
more than 10,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deposition will be shown to the Arkansas jurors after the
defense begins presenting its case, possibly later this week.

<HEADLINE> African Children Appeal for Peace in Mini-Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Over 150 African children have
appealed for a lasting peace in the continent in a mini-summit
held here, one day before the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
summit.
</P>
<P>
Mali and Eritrean Presidents Alpha Konare and Issias Afwerki,
who had arrived here earlier today to attend the OAU summit
scheduled to open on Monday, earnestly listened to the calls
voiced by the delegates -- the small boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents promised to create an enabling and stable
environment for these future leaders of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The horrors of war and conflict are still haunting the
continent after over three decades of national independence in
Africa. And children and women are always the main victims of the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The mini-summit was organized by the United Nations
International Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The three-day OAU summit is to be attended by at least 25
heads of state and government in Africa. The United Nations
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has also arrived in
Yaounde, capital of Cameroon to attend the meeting.

<HEADLINE> US Near to Start Training, Equipping Bosnian Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Under intense pressure from the
U.S. government, Bosnian Muslim and Croat officials have agreed on
the text of a law that could clear the way for the start of a
multi-million-dollar program to train and equip a joint
Muslim-Croat army, a senior U.S. official said today.
</P>
<P>
The official told the Washington Post that if the national
defense law is passed, representatives from the U.S. military
Professional Resources Inc. could be in Bosnia by midweek to sign
the contract of U.S. training and equipping.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 160 former American military personnel
were scheduled to take part in that program. A 98.4 million U.S.
dollar shipment of U.S. weapons is expected to follow shortly.
</P>
<P>
To complete the initial stage of the train-and-equip program,
some 800 million U.S. dollars will be needed, according to a study
commissioned by the Pentagon last year.
</P>
<P>
High-ranking U.S. officials have been pressing the Muslims
and Croats for the past six months on the law and other matters
blocking the U.S. program.
</P>
<P>
The defense law was agreed upon late last week after U.S.
Defense Secretary William Perry publicly appealed to the leaders
of Bosnian Muslims and Croats to reach an agreement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Training and equipping the Bosnian army is a key element in the
U.S.-led effort to stabilize the Balkans by creating a balance of
power between a joint Muslim-Croat army and the better-armed
Bosnian Serbs.
