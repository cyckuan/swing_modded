Govt. Eyes Elian Parole Revocation
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The Justice Department said tonight it would revoke Elian
Gonzalez's parole to remain in the United States by Thursday unless his Miami
relatives agree to promise to surrender the boy if they lose their court fight.
''Without a specific written commitment ... we have no choice but to move
forward with the termination of Elian's parole as of Thursday, March 30, 2000,
at 9:00 a.m.,'' the government said in a letter to the attorneys representing
the relatives. The agency also it has called the relatives to a meeting Tuesday
morning to discuss the ramifications of the parole termination and an orderly
return of the boy to his father in Cuba.

OPEC Fails To Agree on Oil Output
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC oil ministers failed to reach agreement Monday
on how much crude oil to add to global supplies, with Iran seen as the chief
obstacle to a consensus that could provide some price relief to consumers. The
ministers were to resume discussions Tuesday. Iran accepts the need for OPEC to
boost output, the Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh said, but the
amount of an increase favored by his country might not be enough to reduce
petroleum prices from nine-year highs. Iran, OPEC's second-largest producer, is
known to favor boosting output by about 1.2 million barrels a day -- an amount
that probably would do little to reduce world oil prices.

Putin Outlines His New Role
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Vladimir Putin, taking the helm of a weak, unwieldy Russia as
its second democratically elected president, admitted to voters Monday that he
has no swift solutions to the poverty and corruption that bedevil his nation.
Putin ordered the government to pay off wage debts to state workers, and said a
first order of business after his convincing victory in Sunday's election would
be selecting a prime minister. Putin has promised to protect democratic
freedoms, but has yet to indicate how he would carry the sprawling nation into
the post-Boris Yeltsin era. Putin, 47, was named acting president when Yeltsin
resigned Dec. 31.

Dying Ex-Smoker Awarded $20 Million
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A jury ordered the nation's two largest tobacco
companies Monday to pay $20 million in punitive damages to a dying ex-smoker who
took up the habit after the surgeon general's warning began appearing on
cigarette packs in the 1960s. The Superior Court jury decided 9-3 to order
Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds to pay $10 million each to Leslie Whiteley and
her husband. That verdict was the first time the industry lost to someone who
started smoking after 1969, when tobacco companies began putting
government-required health warnings on cigarette packs.

Microsoft Verdict May Be Delayed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some government lawyers have expressed sufficient interest
in a settlement Microsoft Corp. has offered in its antitrust case that they
expect a trial judge at least to delay plans to deliver his verdict on Tuesday.
The 11th-hour proposal from Microsoft, faxed on Friday, was considered generally
inadequate in important areas by some of the 19 states in the lawsuit. But it
was provoking enough discussion among others on Monday that a delay was widely
expected, according to sources close to the case who spoke on condition of
anonymity.

Tennessee Beat Texas Tech 57-44

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Tamika Catchings, playing with a sprained right ankle
for much of the game, scored just seven points but grabbed 16 rebounds as
top-seeded Tennessee held off Texas Tech 57-44 in the NCAA Mideast Regional
final. Kara Lawson led Tennessee with 13 points. Michelle Snow and Semeka
Randall each had 12 points for the Lady Vols, now a perfect 7-of-7 in regional
finals played in Tennessee. Texas Tech hasn't been to the Final Four since 1993,
when Sheryl Swoopes led the Lady Raiders to a national championship in their one

Capriati Beats Williams at Ericsson
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) -- On the verge of victory, Jennifer Capriati hit a
serve that would shame the worst weekend hacker. The lip of her racket sent the
ball sailing over Serena Williams' head and into the first row of seats behind
the baseline. She could smile because she regrouped for another impressive win
in her career comeback. Despite the shanked serve and other shaky moments,
Capriati outlasted the sixth-ranked Williams 7-6 (2), 1-6, 6-3 in the fourth
round of the Ericsson Open. With the sloppy but dramatic victory, the
13th-seeded Capriati advances to the quarterfinals in Key Biscayne for the first
time since 1992.

<HEADLINE> Ford Workers Can Share Car Discounts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. says its salaried
employees now can give vehicle discounts to others.
</P>
<P>
   Under a modification of the so-called X plan, 54,000 workers can
sign up three people a year for the savings on Fords internal
computer network, Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no management approval needed and no paperwork,''
said company spokesman Ed Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicles bought under the X plan cost 4 percent more than those
bought through the A plan, Ford's popular discount program for
employees and their families.
</P>
<P>
   A Ford Taurus SE retailing for $19,700 cost about $18,000 under
the X plan and $17,300 under the A plan, Ed Jolliffe, general
manager of Gorno Ford in Woodhaven, told The Detroit News.
</P>
<P>
   Some high-end models are excluded from the X plan.
</P>
<P>
   In January, General Motors Corp. sent millions of $500 loyalty
coupons to customers, employees and retirees.
</P>
<P>
   GM made the coupons transferable to allow employees and
customers to pass them on to friends, said GM spokeswoman Rebecca
Harris.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Helicopter Crash Kills 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- A helicopter hit a power line and
crashed on New Zealand's South Island on Tuesday, killing five
people, including four Americans, the Civil Aviation Authority
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hughes 500 helicopter clipped a high power cable leading
from a local power station near Lake Manapouri, 600 miles south of
Wellington, Civil Aviation Authority communications officer Emma
Peel said.
</P>
<P>
   Three women and two men were killed in the crash, which left
debris scattered along the lake shore, said Dunedin police
spokeswoman Jo Galer.
</P>
<P>
   She confirmed that four tourists aboard the helicopter were
American but declined to release their names or any other personal
details.
</P>
<P>
   A police team was heading to the crash site to confirm the
identities of the victims, Galer said.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter crashed while flying over the western arm of the
lake, a picturesque area popular with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Fiordland Helicopters Ltd. manager Kim Hollows confirmed his
company was involved. The pilot was a young woman from the southern
New Zealand city of Queenstown, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hollows declined to give further information.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's Transport Accident Investigation Commission was
investigating the crash.

<HEADLINE> Tennesssee 57, Texas Tech 44  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- A limping Tamika Catchings couldn't shoot,
yet the All-American managed to do everything else in leading
Tennessee to the Final Four for a record 12th time.
</P>
<P>
   Catchings, playing with a sprained right ankle for much of the
game, scored just seven points but grabbed 16 rebounds as
top-seeded Tennessee held off Texas Tech 57-44 on Monday night in
the Mideast Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   The junior, the focus of Texas Tech's defense, was 2-for-11 from
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''To counteract that, I went down and made sure I rebounded and
played great defense so I wouldn't be sitting on the bench with
Pat,'' Catchings said, referring to Tennessee coach Pat Summitt.
</P>
<P>
   For awhile, the game looked like a replay of last year's East
Regional final, when Tennessee star Chamique Holdsclaw couldn't hit
a shot. The Lady Vols lost that game to Duke, ending a run of three
straight national championships.
</P>
<P>
   But Catchings refused to let the Lady Vols (31-3) lose to Texas
Tech (28-5).
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1 forward tipped away passes, took charges and
matched her career high with the 16 rebounds. She had three steals
and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is the player of the year, and players of the year tend to
make plays in a lot of different ways that hurt people,'' Texas
Tech coach Marsha Sharp said. ''She hurt us on the boards a lot.
It's just those little things that separate teams this time of
year. When you got a player like that, they normally can bail you
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kara Lawson led Tennessee with 13 points. Michelle Snow and
Semeka Randall each had 12 points for the Lady Vols, 7-of-7 in
regional finals played in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was ugly, but it was also beautiful,'' said Summitt, who
matched former UCLA men's coach John Wooden with her 12th Final
Four trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told our basketball team that we were in this situation a
year ago and the ball wouldn't fall. We just couldn't come up with
the plays you have to come up with. That's where we go back to our
rebounding and defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech hasn't been to the Final Four since 1993, when Sheryl
Swoopes led the Lady Raiders to a national championship in their
one and only appearance. The Lady Raiders used their defense to
harass Tennessee into one of its worst shooting performances this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee led most of the game, but Texas Tech got within 42-40
with 8:37 left on Aleah Johnson's basket. Randall scored six points
in a 10-2 spurt that sealed the victory for Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess we just forgot about her,'' Johnson said. ''I don't
know. Some players step up, some don't, and she was the one that
stepped up in that run.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson led Texas Tech with 12 points. Plenette Pierson had all
10 of her points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee routed Furman, Arizona and Virginia to reach the
regional final, and the Lady Vols looked like they would add Texas
Tech to the list after taking a 12-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas Tech got Snow into quick foul trouble, and she went to
the bench with 14:11 left. With the 6-foot-5 Snow sitting, the Lady
Raiders started heading to the basket. Pierson scored eight of her
10 up close.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee had more trouble midway through the half.
</P>
<P>
   Catchings landed awkwardly on her right foot after missing a
jumper from near the free throw line, badly wrenching her ankle
with 10:17 left before halftime. The pro-Tennessee crowd fell
silent as she was helped off the court by a team official and team
trainer Jenny Moshak.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same court and almost the same spot where Cincinnati
star Kenyon Martin broke his right leg 2{ weeks ago during the
Conference USA men's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Catchings' ankle was wrapped heavily and she returned to the
game with 3:02 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurt when I came back out, but I wanted to be out there for
my teammates,'' she said.

A Precise Market Forecast   
By JOHN CUNNIFF
AP Business Analyst
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Here's a market forecast in language clear as a
child's primer, unencumbered by qualifications and unaccompanied by
the usual, ''on the other hand'' escape clause.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which stood at a record
1,527.46 at the close of last week's trading, will rise to 1,631 in
late June or July, and then fall all the way to a low of 1,468 by
October.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, it will begin a new ascent to 1,876 by November
2001. What happens then has yet to enter the sights of the daring
forecaster, Robert Morrow, who thus puts his reputation at stake.
</P>
<P>
   For Morrow to do so is not new.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1987 he told viewers of the Nightly Business Report that
the Dow Jones average would peak in August at 2,700. It peaked in
August at 2,722.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1980, ''Money Magazine'' readers were told that a
bull market would begin in August 1982 when the S&AMP;P index was at
100. The bull market began in that month at 98.7.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike so many other forecasters, Morrow feels so strongly about
his system that he seeks always to put his forecast on record
before the public, and in specific numbers.
</P>
<P>
   As a professional adviser to fiduciaries and other very large
investors, he doesn't seek public acclaim. He's not even a stock
market type. An engineer, he holds 37 technology patents.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow's specialty is vibration analyses, the sort of testing
necessary in the operation of large machinery, such as aircraft and
turbines. Such things emit vibrations. So does the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   While his work is highly technical and specially adapted to the
marketplace, it is essentially based on these vibrations, which, it
can be assumed, reflect patterns of human and financial behavior.
</P>
<P>
   No, perhaps not the behavior of single individuals, such as
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, but in very broad terms
that Morrow the scientist then seeks to refine before putting
himself at the mercy of the future.
</P>
<P>
   He does so not solely for stocks, but for bonds, currencies and
gold, among others, but it is the hard and fast numbers of the
stock indices that best demonstrate his acumen.
</P>
<P>
   During the period of his current forecast, the Dow Jones
industrial average, which closed last week at 11,112.72 points,
will reach 12,190 by July and then fall to 10,971 by October.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, it will begin an ascent through most of the year
2001 to a peak of 14,777 in November 2001. From there, you're on
your own until he gets a clearer picture into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow, a grandfather, works out of a home office in Bradenton,
Fla., issuing weekly and special faxes to his institutional clients
and discussing the marketplace and his expectations by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   While the long hours and highly technical work might sound
tedious to many people, it has fascinated Morrow since the 1970s,
when he was still working as an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   It is not his sole interest. He has applied his technical
knowledge to the analysis of tornadoes, and has filed a patent
application for microforecasting their paths.
</P>
<P>
   Like machines and securities, he says, tornadoes have a
particular signature that trained spotters can identify on radar,
enabling them to specify precise areas as in immediate danger.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bruno says no on-time budget in 2000  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Though a case of merely stating the obvious,
the majority leader of the state Senate has become the first state
leader to concede that state budget adoption in 2000 will be late
for the 16th straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Bruno, a Republican, blamed Democratic Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver for another impending budget failure. Asked at a
news conference Monday if he thought there was a chance for an
on-time budget, Bruno said, ''No, I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't and you can thank Shelly Silver for that,'' Bruno
said.
</P>
<P>
   New York's legislatures and governors have failed to pass a
budget on time since 1984. It has become increasingly clear in
recent weeks, with the absence of extended top-level budget
negotiations or the convening of legislative conference committees,
that state leaders were not going to break the streak in 2000,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno is critical of Silver's efforts to arrange what the
majority leader said is a ''veto-proof'' budget with Republican
Gov. George Pataki -- something Bruno says the governor will never
agree to -- before moving ahead with meaningful talks on a new
spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said Monday he wants Pataki involved in the conference
committee process so the Legislature does not send the governor a
budget filled with spending he ends up vetoing. Pataki vetoed
hundreds of millions of dollars two years ago from a budget the
Legislature drew up without his input, and last year's budget
impasse lasted into August because Silver said he did not want a
repeat of 1998's vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want the governor to lay his vetoes on the table,'' Silver
told WROW in Albany Monday. ''He should be part of that process on
an informal basis. He should be advising the conference committees
that if they go here, 'We will be forced to veto.' If we stay
within these parameters, 'We will not.'''
</P>
<P>
   Silver said Monday he was in frequent contact with Pataki and
may be close to reaching an arrangement the speaker finds
acceptable. But Silver could not say when such a deal could be
closed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could be five hours away, we could be five days away, we
could be five weeks away,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruno said Silver's strategy may result in a much longer
budget delay.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he waits for the governor to give to him a veto-proof
budget, empowering the governor, giving up all of his (Silver's)
power as a leader in the Legislature, it may be five months'' until
a budget is passed, Bruno said. ''I hope not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno also accused Silver of wanting to engage in the secret
backroom negotiating sessions in which past budgets have been
worked out through involving the two legislative leaders and the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not going to three men in a room and he can wait here
until Christmas for me to get into three men in a room,'' Bruno
said. ''I'm not going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki proposed a budget estimated by the Legislature at just
under $77 billion. The Senate passed a budget resolution earlier
this month Bruno said is $500 million higher than the governor's
spending plan and Assembly Democrats say their budget resolution is
$1.3 billion higher than Pataki's proposed budget.
</P>
<P>
   The size of various tax cuts, including reductions in the
state's sales taxes on gasoline, are among the chief differences of
the three spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   Silver has also suggested he will hold up adoption of a new
budget unless it includes funding for a new subway line in
Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> McCall attacks Pataki administration on tax refunds  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The Pataki administration could hasten the
release of more than 1.2 million state income tax refunds by simply
ordering a transfer of funds, the state's comptroller says.
</P>
<P>
   Comptroller H. Carl McCall accused the administration of
preventing the release of the checks because of an unwillingness to
depart from estimates of how much would be needed for refunds
contained in Gov. George Pataki's financial plan for the 1999-2000
state budget.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said the state Department of Taxation and Finance has
processed the taxpayers' returns and his office has cut the checks,
which roughly average $400 each. But McCall said the state Division
of the Budget has not given the go-ahead to send the refunds out
because technically there will not be money to cover the checks
until April 1.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said there is currently $431 million in processed checks
waiting to be sent and that the total will grow past $500 million
by the time the new state fiscal year begins April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''Half a billion dollars that should be in taxpayers' wallets is
sitting in Albany,'' McCall said. ''There's no reason these tax
refunds couldn't be paid faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Conway, a spokesman for the state Budget Division, said
taxpayers are experiencing ''no lengthy or undue delays in getting
their refunds.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall said the checks cannot be sent because the state has
reached the $460 million in refunds to state income taxpayers
between Jan. 1 and March 31 called for in Pataki's financial plan
for the current state budget.
</P>
<P>
   That number was identical with the payment cap in 1999 and 1996,
and somewhat smaller than the three-month limits in 1997 ($577
million) and 1998 ($500 million), according to McCall spokesman
Dennis Tompkins.
</P>
<P>
   There was no carryover in unpaid returns in 1997, but $177
million was delayed in 1998 and $258 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Tompkins said that with the economy booming and more tax returns
being filed more promptly by electronic mail, returns are coming in
faster than ever to the state. But he said the governor's financial
plans have not allowed for significantly more payments to go out in
the first quarter of the calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   The financial plan numbers are set by Pataki and not approved by
the state Legislature, Tompkins said. McCall said Pataki's Budget
Division could make the checks good by simply assigning more money
from the Personal Income Tax Refund Reserve Account to the current
fiscal year instead of maintaining the financial plan's estimated
balance of $2.5 billion in the account on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Conway blamed the criticism from McCall, a Democrat, on his
possible status as a challenger to Republican Pataki for governor
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''Refunds are being handled in the same way they have been for
years,'' Conway said. ''Absolutely nothing is being done
differently than it has been for the last five years and for
decades before that under prior (Democratic) administrations.''

<HEADLINE> OPEC Members To Convene for Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- As OPEC members haggled over the optimal
size of a planned increase in oil production, a powerful outside
presence -- the United States -- cast an unusually long shadow over
the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC oil ministers failed to reach agreement Monday on how much
crude oil to add to global supplies, with Iran seen as the chief
obstacle to a consensus that could provide some price relief to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers were to resume discussions today.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, the world's biggest consumer of oil, went to
exceptional lengths prior to the meeting to lobby the cartel to
raise production. Alarmed at the tripling of oil prices during the
past 12 months, the U.S. government has said that an increase of 2
million to 2.5 million barrels per day is needed to replenish
depleted inventories and satisfy growing world demand.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson pressed home the point
when he recently visited eight of the 11 OPEC countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time that the United States has been really
involved'' in OPEC decision-making, said Bill Edwards of
Houston-based Edwards Energy Consultants. ''This time it's the big
power play.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of leaning on OPEC, however, Washington is unlikely to
secure all the fresh oil it wants.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have backed a production increase of 1.5
million to 1.7 million barrels a day. The upper limit of their
proposed increase would amount to about 7 percent more than what
OPEC members agreed to pump after sharply curtailing output last
March.
</P>
<P>
   A stingier proposal, offered by Iran, would pump no more than
1.2 million barrels of additional crude -- an amount that probably
would do little to reduce world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. must not expect Iran to support its output ideas,''
said Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh, speaking to
reporters prior to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   An OPEC delegate, speaking on condition of anonymity, told
reporters that Libya, Indonesia and Nigeria agree with Iran on the
amount of new oil that should be produced.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. motorists and other consumers of refined products such
as gasoline, much depends on the efforts by moderates led by Saudi
Arabia, OPEC's No. 1 producer, to win Iran over to their point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   American motorists now pay an average of $1.59 per gallon for
unleaded gasoline, an increase of nearly 60 cents since prices
bottomed out at 99.8 cents per gallon in February 1999, according
to a Lundberg Survey of 10,000 U.S. gas stations released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts warn of possible shortages and $2-a-gallon gas
during the peak driving season this summer if OPEC fails to
substantially raise output.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC, which operates on decisions by consensus, must decide
whether to extend cuts it made in 1998 and 1999 that have propelled
oil prices to their highest levels since the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
The latest round of cuts expires at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah suggested that
political considerations, including U.S. diplomacy, played a bigger
part than economic factors in his country's decision to push for a
comparatively large increase in production.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House of Representatives made a largely symbolic
contribution to the diplomatic pressure last week when it passed a
bill that would require the White House to review OPEC's pricing
practices and to restrict military aid to countries found to be
fixing petroleum prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's rare that you get the threat of sanctions on Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait -- key Gulf allies -- and discussions that harken back to
1991,'' said Raad Alkadiri, an analyst with The Petroleum Finance
Co., a consultancy headquartered in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military forces helped expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC pumps more than 26 million barrels of crude each day, or
about 35 percent of the world's supply. Key non-OPEC producers,
such as Mexico and Norway, have said they are watching to see what
OPEC will do before adjusting their own output.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico cooperated with OPEC by cutting production by 325,000
barrels a day last March. However, its economic dependence on
exports to the United States makes it reluctant to antagonize
Washington over oil matters.
</P>
<P>
   ''For them, the health of the U.S. economy is more important
than oil at $28 to $30 a barrel. That's where you get the
divergence,'' Alkadiri said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. oil prices tripled to a March 8 peak of $34.37 per barrel
following OPEC's decision last March to slash production.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude in the United
States have eased somewhat in recent weeks. Crude oil for delivery
in May fell 23 cents to $27.79 a barrel Monday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Daimler Buys Stake in Mitsubishi  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT STODDARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Just 10 years ago, Mitsubishi and other Japanese
automakers looked invincible.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were buying up Toyota Corollas and Nissan Maximas,
helping to push Ford Motor Co. and the former Chrysler Corp. to the
edge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Now the tables have been turned. Thanks to booming U.S. and
European economies in the 1990s and a debilitating economic slump
in Asia, Japan's automakers themselves are for sale as they
struggle for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Motors -- hurt by plunging sales and profits -- has
watched its share price lose lose half of its value over the past
four years.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mitsubishi announced that DaimlerChrysler AG will buy
a controlling 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi, leaving Toyota Motor
Corp. and Honda Motor Co. as the lone independents among Japan's
top five automakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good for Mitsubishi. At least they can survive,'' said
Jeremy Tonkin, an auto analyst at Towa Securities Co. in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ''These deals would have been unheard of 5 or 10 years ago,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitsubishi-DaimlerChrysler alliance creates the world's
third-largest automaker with annual production of 6.5 million
vehicles, ahead of Toyota's 5.19 million vehicles. The biggest are
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   The $2 billion deal is the biggest foreign investment in a
Japanese automaker since France's Renault SA in May paid $5.4
billion for a 36.8 percent stake in Nissan Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, DaimlerChrysler chairman Juergen Schrempp
and Mitsubishi president Katsuhiko Kawasoe said they had signed a
letter of intent in Stuttgart to form an alliance regarding the
design, development, production and distribution of passenger cars
and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The final contracts will be signed within the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Kawasoe will remain president of Mitsubishi Motors, though
DaimlerChrysler will get seats on Mitsubishi's 36-member board in
proportion to its stake.
</P>
<P>
   The deal plugs holes in each company's strategy for survival,
giving heavily indebted Mitsubishi a partner with deep pockets and
DaimlerChrysler access -- albeit late -- to Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals such as Ford and GM have been building factories or
forming alliances with local automakers to gain entry into a market
that analysts expect will soon be the world's fastest growing.
</P>
<P>
   Ford owns 33.4 percent of Mazda Motor Corp., Japan's
fifth-biggest automaker. GM owns 49 percent of Isuzu Motors Ltd.,
10 percent of Suzuki Motor Corp. and recently announced plans to
take 20 percent of Fuji Heavy Ltd., the maker of Subaru cars.
</P>
<P>
   For DaimlerChrysler, Mitsubishi is an attractive catch. It looks
cheap despite its crippling $16.4 billion of debt. The partnership
saves the German-American automaker the cost of building a sales
and production network here on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mitsubishi is the ideal partner for DaimlerChrysler to
strengthen its position in the entire Asia region,'' Schrempp said.
''It's a milestone for our Asian strategy.''

<HEADLINE> Alliances Abound in Auto Industry  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE, AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- With all the world's major automakers looking for
partners or merger candidates, even the wallflowers have a full
dance card.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler AG' $2.05 billion agreement Monday to purchase a
controlling stake in Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp. was just the
latest in a long line of pairings: General Motors Corp. with Fiat,
Subaru and Saab; Ford Motor Co. with Mazda and Volvo; Nissan with
Renault. Only a few automakers -- Honda and BMW among them -- talk
about the virtues of independence.
</P>
<P>
   All of these deals have been fueled by a mix of ambition and
fear, as automakers worry whether they'll be strong enough to
survive. But teaming up doesn't always produce teamwork, and the
payoffs can take decades.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons automakers cite for such deals:
</P>
<P>
   --Reducing costs. Developing an all-new model typically costs a
U.S. automaker about $1 billion; DaimlerChrysler spent $2.8 billion
on the latest makeover of its minivans, which reach showrooms later
this year. By sharing more vehicle parts -- such as transmissions
and engines -- those costs are spread out over more vehicles. The
same desire also applies to developing expensive new technology,
such as fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
   --Expanding into new markets. Automakers looking for space to
grow have targeted Asia and Latin America, where there are fewer
competitors and more potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   --Overcapacity. Analysts estimate automakers will have the
capacity to build about 70 million vehicles a year by 2002, but
demand will equal just 60 million vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The alliances announced since Daimler-Benz bought the Chrysler
Corp. in 1998 have not been in effect long enough to influence
products; developing new models typically takes 2-3 years. And even
for those deals in place for a decade or more, there can still be a
healthy debate about the returns.
</P>
<P>
   Take Mazda and Ford. Ford bought a 25 percent stake in Mazda in
1979 to learn more about Japanese manufacturing and management
ideas. The two companies built cars and trucks for each other, but
there was little collaboration; one side would simply hand over
nearly complete vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Only after Ford took control of Mazda in 1996, increasing its
stake to 33.4 percent, did the two truly collaborate on a large
scale. Their first jointly designed project for the United States
goes on sale later this year -- the Ford Escape/Mazda Tribute small
sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were two global companies with two different sets of
product assumptions,'' said Henry Wallace, Ford's chief financial
officer who ran Mazda from 1996 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   GM has an assortment of deals with several automakers, and owns
Saab outright. It's had a large stake in Isuzu Motors Co. since
1971 and a smaller part of Suzuki since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   GM also sought to learn Japanese management techniques and get
access to Asian markets. But as with Ford-Mazda, there was little
joint work. Suzuki builds the Chevrolet Metro and Tracker for GM;
Isuzu built the Geo Storm coupe. GM builds the Izuzu Hombre compact
pickup, a version of the Chevrolet S-10 and GMC Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   At GM, ''the joint ventures have been underutilized in North
America, and globally they're used better but still not as well as
possible,'' said Jim Hall, an industry analyst with AutoPacific in
Southfield, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   But Hall said that was changing, with Isuzu becoming the truck
and diesel engine expert within GM.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and GM have made several forays into smaller Asian markets,
while expanding into Latin America as well. Ford has plants in
India and Thailand; GM builds Buicks in Shanghai, China. Such moves
are expensive -- GM has lost $366 million in Asia and Australia
since 1997 -- and have added little to either company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   And those plants have added factories to the world auto
industry's capacity. While not a major problem in the United
States, overcapacity has been seen as a problem in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's chairman, Juergen Schrempp, said Monday that
Mitsubishi would look to reduce capacity soon, possibly by selling
a Japanese factory, but that DaimlerChrysler itself needed all its
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said worries about overcapacity may be a little overblown.
Automakers can carry extra capacity profitably, and find a use for
it with new product. And if a company's strategy is ''done right,
it's the other guy's overcapacity.''

<HEADLINE> Penn State Reaches First Final Four  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Tennessee and Connecticut were expected to reach the
women's
Final Four. Penn State wasn't.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions ended 24 years of frustration for coach Rene
Portland and started Leon Barmore's retirement earlier than most
had figured when they knocked off top-seeded Louisiana Tech 86-65
on Monday night to win the Midwest Regional. It's the first Final
Four berth in Penn State history.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee held off Texas Tech 57-44 in the Mideast Regional to
advance to the Final Four for a record 12th time.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, which hadn't been to the Final Four since 1996, won
the East Regional with an 86-71 victory over LSU.
</P>
<P>
   In a late game, No. 1 Georgia played No. 2 Rutgers for the West
Regional crown.
</P>
<P>
   So now it's on to Philadelphia where Penn State will play
Connecticut in the national semifinals Friday night. Tennessee will
take on the Georgia-Rutgers winner.
</P>
<P>
   Portland and her Nittany Lions are making their first trip to
the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ''She deserves it,'' Penn State center Andrea Garner said of
Portland, who grew up in suburban Philadelphia. ''She's been in
there, I don't know how long, longer than I am old. She writes on
the board, 'This is our time.' It's her time, too.''
Penn St. 86, Louisiana Tech 65:
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Shepherd scored 20 of her 25 points in the first half to
put Penn State in control and the Lady Lions (30-4) survived the
pressure defense of top-seeded Louisiana Tech guards Tamicha
Jackson and Betty Lennox in their Kansas City battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their execution in the first half was just perfection,''
Portland said. ''If we get four like that in a row, we'll be
wearing a different hat.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss snapped Louisiana Tech's 21-game winning streak as the
Lady Techsters failed to get Barmore in the Final Four one last
time. Barmore, who has been part of 10 NCAA Final Four trips as a
head coach or assistant, retired with a 520-77 record in 18 years
at Tech. His winning percentage of .872 is the best of any major
college basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Darling and Garner each scored 15 points for Penn State,
with Darling getting 12 assists and Garner grabbing 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson led Tech (31-3) with 19 points and Lennox scored 14, but
they were a combined 12-for-40 from the field.
Connecticut 86, LSU 71:
</P>
<P>
   At Richmond, Va., Svetlana Abrosimova scored a season high-tying
25 points to lead Connecticut (34-1), which also got 16 points from
Sue Bird and 15 from Shea Ralph. It was the Huskies' 15th straight
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut went undefeated in 1994-95 to win the school's only
women's national title.
</P>
<P>
   April Brown scored 18 of her 23 points in the first half and
Marie Ferdinand added 17 for LSU (25-7), which fell to 0-2 in
regional finals.
</P>
<P>
   LSU pulled within six points, 58-52, with 12:23 remaining in the
game. But the Huskies went on a 17-6 spurt to lead 75-58 with 6:05
left.
Tennessee 57, Texas Tech 44:
</P>
<P>
   It appeared Tennessee might be in trouble when Tamika Catchings
was helped off the court with a sprained right ankle with 10:17
left in the first half in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   But the 6-foot-1 forward returned to grab 16 rebounds, tip away
passes, make three steals and hand out six assists in Tennessee's
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Kara Lawson led Tennessee (31-3) with 13 points. Michelle Snow
and Semeka Randall each had 12 points for the Lady Vols, now a
perfect 7-of-7 in regional finals played in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech (28-5) was led by Aleah Johnson with 12 points.

<HEADLINE> Chemical Plant Explosion Injures 71  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN K. STACK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Texas (AP) -- An explosion Monday rocked a Phillips
Petroleum chemical plant near the Houston Ship Channel, killing one
worker and injuring at least 71 people.
</P>
<P>
   The blast sparked a fire that sent thick smoke over the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in the main shop area when I heard a loud explosion,''
said Tim Williams, a plant worker who estimated he was more than
200 yards from the 1:25 p.m. explosion. ''My ears hurt, and I took
off running. I looked back and saw flames, and kept going.''
</P>
<P>
   Search crews discovered the body of a missing employee some five
hours after the early afternoon blast. Plant general manager Jim
Ross said 32 employees and 39 contract employees were taken to
hospitals with injuries that included burns, smoke inhalation and
anxiety-related disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Norm Berkley said the plant employs roughly 850
people, and said about 600 would have been there at the time of the
blast.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in neighboring plants and residents in the area were
urged to remain indoors while schoolchildren were kept inside after
the bell rang. Smoke continued to rise two hours after the blast,
and was clearly was visible across Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillips complex was the site of a 1989 series of explosions
and fires in a polyethylene reactor that killed 23 and injured 130.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, two people were killed and four were injured in an
explosion at the complex. Afterward, federal officials fined
Phillips $204,000 for 13 alleged safety violations.

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- L. Stanley ''Buddy'' Berenson, who made
Hartford's jai alai fronton one of the state's most popular
attractions in the 1980s, died Friday. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson was president and chief executive officer of World
Jai-Alai and owner of several frontons in Florida when he purchased
the Hartford Jai-Alai Fronton in the spring of 1982.
</P>
<P>
   He is credited with increasing the popularity of jai alai and
attracting some of the sport's top players.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson learned from his father, Richard Berenson, who was
president of the Miami jai alai and partly responsible for the
legalization of jai alai in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford operation saw $93 million in bets annually before
hitting hard times in the early 1990s. The facility closed in 1995
after Berenson failed to persuade legislators to allow him to
install slot machines.
Paul Calinescu:
</P>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Paul Calinescu, known as the father of
Romanian cinema and a winner of the top prize at the prestigious
Venice Film Festival, died Saturday. He was 98.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1930s, Calinescu made Romania's first professional
documentary films. ''Tara Motilor,'' a 1938 production dedicated to
the Romanians living in the Western Carpathian Mountains, was
awarded the top prize in the documentary category at the Venice
Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   After 1949, Calinescu turned to making artistic movies,
including ''Titanic Waltz'' and ''Porto Franco.'' Many of his
movies won awards at Romanian film competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Calinescu was the mentor of several generations of Romanian
directors and was given the title of Bucharest's Honorary Citizen
in 1996.
Jim Cash:
</P>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Screenwriter Jim Cash, who co-wrote
films such as ''Top Gun'' and ''Dick Tracy,'' died Friday. He was
59.
</P>
<P>
   Cash was a professor of English and American Thought and
Language at Michigan State University. He had been hospitalized for
about four weeks before his death with an intestinal ailment, said
university spokesman Terry Denbow.
</P>
<P>
   Cash worked with Jack Epps Jr. in writing films such as ''Legal
Eagles'' and ''The Secret of My Success.'' Cash was good at
dialogue, while Epps specialized in story lines. The two worked by
speakerphone and dual computer screens that allowed them to work on
text simultaneously even though they were thousands of miles apart.
Ian Dury:
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Singer Ian Dury, who rode the punk bandwagon in
the 1970s with the singles ''Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick'' and
''Reasons to be Cheerful (Part 3),'' died Monday of cancer. He was
57.
</P>
<P>
   Dury's clever, Cockney-accented lyrics were backed by a band
called the Blockheads.
</P>
<P>
   The group was signed to independent Stiff Records. Its 1977 tour
with other Stiff artists, including Elvis Costello and Nick Lowe,
served as a springboard for the so-called New Wave.
</P>
<P>
   Dury also acted in movies ranging from Roman Polanski's
''Pirates'' to Peter Greenaway's ''The Cook, The Thief, His Wife
And Her Lover,'' and he wrote a musical, ''Apples,'' that played
London's Royal Court Theatre in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Dury was partially crippled by polio at age 7 and was a lifelong
campaigner for acceptance of disabilities and eradication of polio.
Jack Haley:
</P>
<P>
   SEAL BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Jack Haley, who helped usher in the
golden age of surfing from the 1940s to the 1960s, died Saturday of
cancer. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   Haley, who won the first U.S. Open of Surfing at Huntington
Beach in 1959, was inducted last year into the Huntington Beach
Surfing Walk of Fame and the Seal Beach Surfing Hall of Fame. He
also served for many years as a Seal Beach lifeguard.
</P>
<P>
   He opened a surfboard shop in Seal Beach in 1960, and in 1965
opened Captain Jack's, a popular Sunset Beach restaurant.
Reggie Harris:
</P>
<P>
   TEANECK, N.J. (AP) -- Reggie Harris, a news anchor at WWOR-TV in
New York, died Monday while exercising at home. He was 46.
</P>
<P>
   Harris had been a lead reporter and anchor at WWOR-TV since
1997. Prior to that, he spent 10 years at WCBS-TV in New York and
worked in Dallas before coming to WCBS in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is survived by his wife, Diane Harris, and two children.
Thomas Needham:
</P>
<P>
   CRANSTON, R.I. (AP) -- Superior Court Judge Thomas Needham, who
oversaw the first attempted murder trial of Claus von Bulow, died
Sunday. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Needham was the judge at the 1982 trial in which von Bulow was
convicted of trying to kill his heiress wife. Von Bulow appealed,
was retried and acquitted, prompting Needham to say, ''On the
evidence that was received in my courtroom, he was guilty as
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Needham oversaw other high-profile cases. In 1977, he drew
protests after ruling that Rhode Island women were required to use
their husbands' surnames. The state Supreme Court overturned his
decision. He also was the judge who declared the state's ban on
Sunday sales unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Needham, a World War II veteran, spent 25 years in private
practice and served four terms as a Republican state senator. He
was appointed to the bench in 1974.

</P>
<P>
   Patterson was the managing director of overseas operations for
ABC News for many years, covering the war in Beirut, the Persian
Gulf War, the Iranian revolution and the Somali invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson also served as director of production for ABC News
magazines, vice president of operations and was named senior vice
president in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Vitamin C May Hurt Cancer Patients  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Cancer patients who take large doses of
vitamin C might make their disease worse by inadvertently
protecting their tumors from radiation and chemotherapy, new
research suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said they cannot prove the vitamin is harmful during
cancer treatment, but added that there are strong biological
reasons to think megadoses could be bad.
</P>
<P>
   The concern is based on the discovery that cancer cells actually
contain large amounts of vitamin C, which appears to protect them
from oxygen damage. Many cancer treatments, especially radiation
therapy, work by triggering oxygen damage to the genes of cancer
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Golde, physician-in-chief at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York, warned against too much vitamin C in a
presentation Monday at a meeting of the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin C has many adherents, in part because it is an
antioxidant, a substance that protects the body from potentially
harmful oxygen particles known as free radicals. Oxidation -- the
same process that rusts iron -- is suspected of triggering cancer
and other disease.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts recommend that people eat plenty of fruits and
vegetables because they are good sources an antioxidant nutrients,
among other things. Many people routinely take high doses of
vitamin C and other antioxidants in the belief that they will
prevent or cure illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   However, doctors caution that even though various nutritional
supplements are natural, this does not necessarily mean they are
also safe or effective, especially when combined with other
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barrie Cassileth, a medical sociologist who studies vitamin
and herbal remedies at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, noted that vitamin
C fell from favor as a cancer treatment in 1985 after a Mayo Clinic
study found it to be worthless. But it has recently returned to
vogue, and some practitioners give extremely high doses to cancer
patients as an addition to ordinary treatment or even as a
substitute.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Golde's team discovered how vitamin C gets into human
cells. They found that an oxidized form of vitamin C called
dehydroascorbic acid enters cells through the same opening used by
sugar. Once inside, it is immediately converted back to vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   He said a key feature of many cancers is they have many more of
these sugar openings than do ordinary cells. This allows them to
take in the energy they need to grow.
</P>
<P>
   But Golde said cancer cells often also have very high
concentrations of vitamin C. The exact function of the vitamin
inside cancer is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ''My experience as a biologist would say it is no accident,'' he
said. ''The cancer cell wants vitamin C because it wants
antioxidant protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Among cancer's uses for the vitamin, he said, could be
protection against the harmful effect of radiation therapy, as well
as some forms of chemotherapy that work by inducing oxygen damage.
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin-rich food and multivitamins are safe for cancer
patients, Golde said, but he routinely advises cancer patients to
avoid gram-size doses of vitamin C while under treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harmon Eyre, medical director of the cancer society, said
Golde's work suggests it is especially important to avoid big doses
of vitamin C during radiation treatment, which works in large part
through triggering oxygen damage. Lab experiments have also shown
that loading cancer cells with vitamin C can make them resist
radiation treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It argues to cancer patients that supplements need to be
thought through very carefully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, researchers from the University of Southern
California presented data at a conference suggesting that vitamin C
pills may speed up clogging of the arteries, the underlying cause
of heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Golde's work on vitamin C and cancer was published last
September in the journal Cancer Research.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Weight-Gain Gene  </HEADLINE>
By MALCOLM RITTER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists have created strains of mice that can
eat a high-fat diet without getting chubby using a single gene that
might lead to a new obesity treatment for people.
</P>
<P>
   In its normal form, the gene, called HMGIC, apparently helps
mice make more cells to store fat when they have been eating a
fatty diet, researchers said. But the mice in the experiment had a
defective version of the gene.
</P>
<P>
   They apparently failed to create storage cells in response to
the high-fat diet, and so avoided putting on weight, the
researchers said in the April issue of the journal Nature Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   The finding could lead to a human obesity treatment if
scientists can find a drug that interferes with the effect of the
normal HMGIC gene, said Kiran Chada, a biochemistry professor at
the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and senior
author of the paper. He is also president of a company formed to
develop products related to the gene.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bradford Lowell, an obesity expert at Harvard Medical
School, said it will take a lot more work to find out how promising
Chada's approach would be for humans.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rudy Leibel, an obesity expert at Columbia University in New
York, said if a person's supply of fat-storing cells were
restricted, fat might build up in the liver instead. That could
seriously interfere with liver function, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chada said he has seen no sign of fatty liver buildup in the
mice.
</P>
<P>
   Mice born with the genetic defect develop only about 10 percent
of the normal amount of body fat but are otherwise normal, Chada
said. Mutant mice that ate a high-fat diet for six months didn't
put on any more weight than mutants that ate a standard diet.
</P>
<P>
   Normal mice, in contrast, did become obese on the high-fat diet.
All three groups of mice ate about the same amount.

<HEADLINE> Personality of jurors figures into Ross death penalty case  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- The trials of mass murderers John Wayne
Gacy and Ted Bundy are being reviewed by court officials as jurors
deliberate the fate of serial killer Michael Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas P. Miano and lawyers on both sides Monday discussed
how other states handled their infamous murderers to get ideas
about how to proceed with deliberations in Ross' case.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member jury is scheduled to resume deliberations today,
after listening again to instructions Miano gave them about the
state's death penalty law.
</P>
<P>
   The jury has been praised for its attentiveness and
intelligence, and also questioned for some of its unusual requests.
Last week, the panel asked for push pins and elastic bands, and
asked for some of their writings to be shredded.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the jury asked how they should consider mitigating
factors in Ross' life that would spare him the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors wanted to know whether a mitigating factor must apply in
all of the killings if a factor is found in one case. Miano
instructed the jury Monday to consider whether mitigating factors
separately for each count.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is trying to decide whether Ross, 40, should get the
death penalty or life in prison for killing four teen-age girls in
eastern Connecticut in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced lawyers not involved in the case say the jury's
behavior shows it is taking its job seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ''A life's on the line and they know it,'' said Norman Pattis, a
criminal defense lawyer in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Ross already is serving two life sentences for killing two other
young women in Windham County.
</P>
<P>
   A key to his defense is his claim that he suffers from sexual
sadism -- a mental disorder that causes violent sexual fantasies and
causes him to take pleasure in harming or humiliating others.
Sexual sadism might be such a mitigating factor that would spare
Ross' life.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have raised the possibility that Ross is faking the
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is made up of three women and nine men. They are an
older panel, with few jurors appearing to be Ross' age or younger.
</P>
<P>
   Miano has praised them for their attentiveness during the trial,
which started Feb. 22. One juror even asked the judge why one
witness was not sworn in the same way the others were.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the jurors are engineers, which has led to speculation
that the jury is going to take its time and be very scientific in
reaching a decision. The requests for different colored markers, an
easel, a flip chart, push pins and other items seem to back up this
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The request for their writings to be shredded at the end of the
day seems to show the jury is also cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tieger, a jury consultant from West Hartford, said nothing
special can be read into the requests, however odd. The jury may
want the items to organize the evidence, such as papers and photos,
or the requests may come from a single juror who has his or her own
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it is unfair to stereotype the engineers on the
jury, although some traits are prevalent with the profession.
</P>
<P>
   ''In general I don't think they're very sympathetic jurors. They
tend to be more analytically thinking jurors, tend not to take
emotions into account,'' Tieger said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said they tend not to buy into psychological defenses,
which could be a problem for Ross' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Pattis said engineers he's seen on juries tend to want a higher
burden of proof than other jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Engineers and scientists in general are not generally
favorably disposed to the burden of proof being less tidy than what
they're used to,'' Pattis said.
</P>
<P>
   In regular criminal trials, the state has the burden of proving
the defendant committed the crime. In death penalty hearings,
however, both sides have a burden of proof, although the defense's
burden is lower than the prosecution's.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
crimes were especially cruel, heinous or depraved.
</P>
<P>
   The defense must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a
mitigating factor exists in Ross' character or background or in the
facts and circumstances of the case.

<HEADLINE> More training, equipment needed for terrorism readiness  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRATFORD, Conn. (AP) -- To U.S. Rep. Christopher Shays, the
question is when -- not if -- the United States will face a major
terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   So Shays, R-Conn., brought together a group of state, local and
federal emergency management officials Monday to talk about
readiness in the event of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus was that more training, equipment and
communication is needed to prepare local and state officials to
respond properly. To do that, officials asked for more federal
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joxel Garcia, commissioner of the state Department of Public
Health, said Connecticut could be a target for terrorism because of
its proximity to New York, its nuclear power plants, prestigious
universities and Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said the state improved its emergency management system
as it prepared for Y2K and dealt with an outbreak of West Nile
encephalitis last fall. But he said the state needs a more
comprehensive emergency plan, more training for its workers and
improved hospital preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Connecticut ... has been closer now than ever to being
prepared for a bioterrorism event. ... But still, not all needs
have been met,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shays, chairman of the House Subcommittee on National Security,
Veterans Affairs and International Relations, heard testimony from
an assortment of emergency management officials -- including, fire,
police, health, environmental and hospital personnel -- during a
field hearing at the Stratford Armory.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's hearing followed a ''tabletop'' exercise on Friday in
which local, state and federal officials participated to a mock
disaster: a mustard gas explosion aboard an Amtrak train as it made
its way into Bridgeport during rush hour traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Shays said the drill and the hearing showed that local officials
need more training and equipment, including protective gear,
detection devices and communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   During the drill, many emergency workers became sick from the
mustard gas and the city's two hospitals quickly reached capacity.
The drill also highlighted duplicated efforts and showed that the
emergency responsibilities of some agencies were unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm absolutely convinced that there will be a terrorist
attack,'' Shays said. ''We all have to be prepared for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays said he would push for more federal funding, including
money for more drills, so officials can work together on emergency
response.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those exercises are absolutely essential because it's a
practice run, and they're able to see where they have the weak
links and they are able to meet their counterparts (in other
communities),'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New stamp celebrates 100 years under the sea  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROTON, Conn. (AP) -- The U.S. Postal Service has issued five
stamps depicting the evolution of submarines over the past century
as a way to honor the nation's submariners.
</P>
<P>
   The stamps were unveiled Monday during a ceremony commemorating
the 100th anniversary of the Navy's submarine force.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means we've been recognized finally,'' said Ray Comeau, one
of many submarine veterans who attended the ceremony at the Navy's
sub base.
</P>
<P>
   Submarines traditionally are referred to as the silent service,
and speakers at the ceremony heaped praise on submariners for their
seldom-recognized sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Submarines and submariners have truly delivered time and time
again,'' said U.S. Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Submarines were the only means of defense of the West Coast in
the early part of the century, Dodd said. They also played a key
role during World War II and helped end the Cold War, he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Sam Gejdenson, a Connecticut Democrat who lobbied for
the stamps, also praised workers at Groton's Electric Boat shipyard
which built many of the subs.
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony, a bell tolled in memory of those who lost
their lives on the seas during war. Flags representing submarines
lost at sea were lowered as a bell rung twice and music played
softly in the background.
</P>
<P>
   The stamps depict the evolution of submarines from the 54-foot
USS Holland, the Navy's first submersible. Stamps also depict the
S-class subs designed during World War I and the present,
multi-mission Los Angeles-class fast attack and the 560-foot
Ohio-class fleet ballistic missile submarines.
</P>
<P>
   The stamps ''serve to remind us all of the dedication of those
who served on these and other vessels like them,'' said Jo
Saunders, Connecticut district manager of the postal service.
</P>
<P>
   The stamps, which include a booklet describing the history of
the submarine force, also pay tribute to American technology and
innovation, speakers said.
</P>
<P>
   The stamps mean a lot to submariners, said Harry Caldwell Jr., a
retired Navy captain whose father, Harry Caldwell Sr., was the
first commanding officer of the country's first submarine around
1900.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he would be pleased at the recognition of what's gone
on for the past 100 years in submarines,'' Caldwell said. ''I also
think he would marvel at the way technology has changed from the
crude ship he had.''

<HEADLINE> Teen-age drivers involved in fewer crashes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Public safety officials credit a new
system for training teen drivers with helping cut down on
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The number of accidents involving 16- and 17-year-old drivers
declined 13 percent since 1996, when the state passed a driver
education law that mandated learner's permits, the New Haven
Register reported.
</P>
<P>
   The law also required new drivers to hold learner's permits and
drive only with an adult in the car for the first four months.
</P>
<P>
   For new drivers who do not take a driver education course, the
learner's permit runs for six months.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, teen drivers were involved in 5,986 crashes on state
roads or injury accidents on local roads. In 1998, the latest year
for which figures are available, teen drivers were involved in
5,184 such crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly, the mandate of additional training has had an
impact,'' said State Police Sgt. Paul Vance. ''Nothing can replace
experience behind the wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, there were 12 fatal crashes involving 16 and
17-year-old drivers. In 1993, there were 28 such fatal crashes,
state statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   The figures mirror an overall decline in car accidents in the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Some teens say the learner's permit system has made them better
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good idea,'' said John Cornelius, 17, of Milford, who
noted he has driven for a year without an accident or a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Dave Walker, 17, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a good safety procedure,'' Walker said. ''Driving
is a lot more involved now. There are a lot of people on the road
without proper training.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature this year is debating further increases in
driver training, including a requirement that drivers with
learner's permits get 30 hours of experience behind the wheel under
adult supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the idea argue that parents, and not the state,
should decide when their children are ready to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard Tulisano, D-Rocky Hill, questioned proposals to
restrict young drivers. He wondered what would happen if the teen
accident rates started increasing.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they go up are we going to blame the law? We'll probably
blame the law and make it 30 years old to drive,'' Tulisano said.

<HEADLINE> Committee passes 3-year gas tax cut  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state House will consider a bill that
would reduce Connecticut's gas tax by 7 cents over the next three
years, but Republicans say they'll push to get the same cut before
July.
</P>
<P>
   Since early February, Gov. John G. Rowland has been trying to
pare the 32-cent tax down to a quarter by April 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Committee unanimously approved the 3-year plan
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good thing about the committee action is they recognize
the governor is right,'' said House Minority Leader Robert Ward,
R-Northford. ''They're just unable to accept a Republican proposal
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill which now heads to the House would reduce the gas tax
to 28 cents per gallon effective July 1. Another penny would be
shaved on July 1 2001, and two more cents would come off a year
later, lowering the tax to 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not far enough soon enough,'' said Rep. Richard Belden,
R-Shelton. ''It's now the time that we can do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland's plan to cut one of the country's highest gas taxes
would cost an estimated $99 million in revenue. Hawaii has the
highest gas tax in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland's budget director Marc Ryan says the cut could be
covered with money from the state's special transportation fund and
the Department of Motor Vehicles sales taxes. Administration
officials say the cut would mean a savings of $85 to $140 a year
for a family that drives 30,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland has said cutting the gas tax to a quarter will keep
Connecticut drivers from crossing state lines to fill up their
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people are still paying more in Connecticut than they are
in Massachusetts... our border towns are going to get killed,''
said Sen. John McKinney, R-Southport. ''People need relief now. If
cutting the gas tax 7 cents over three years is good policy,
cutting it 7 cents now is better policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats have opposed Rowland's plan, arguing it will drain
the special transportation fund, resulting in a shortage of money
for mass transit and highway improvement projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to do it in a way that doesn't jeopardize special
transportation,'' said Rep. Jacqueline Cocco, D-Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said the state could afford to put $10 million in the fund
every year to offset potential shortfalls in the special
transportation fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any problems with this are easily fixed,'' he said. ''All you
need is the political will.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed Monday would also phases out the hospital gross
receipts tax over three years, provides two sales tax free weeks
and gives tax breaks to companies that donate computers to schools.
</P>
<P>
   It also exempts some items from the sales tax, including college
text books, child car seats, canes and caskets. Additionally, the
bill would subject movie tickets to the 6 percent sales tax instead
of the 10 percent admissions tax.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court rejects convicted murderer's bid for new trial  </HEADLINE>
syhoflsfonsrh
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court has turned down
the appeal of a convicted murderer who claimed his trial was
tainted by racism.
</P>
<P>
   The argument was based on the claims of juror June Briere, who
has spent more than $18,000 out of her own pocket trying to appeal
Santiago's conviction in the death of drug dealer Fernando
Ilarraza.
</P>
<P>
   Briere claims that she was pressured to find Santiago guilty by
a juror who said the conviction would mean there would be ''one
less spic on the streets of Willimantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam Superior Court Judge Samuel Sferrazza dismissed Briere's
allegation before sentencing Santiago in 1996. But the state
Supreme Court ordered the judge to re-examine the issue.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing from six jurors in the case -- including Daniel
McConnell, the juror who allegedly made the remark -- Sferrazza in
November again rejected Briere's contention and the case returned
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The high court ruled Monday that no evidence existed to show
racism played a role. Five jurors supported McConnell's denial.
</P>
<P>
   Briere could not be considered credible because of the close
relationship she developed with Santiago, the court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Briere, 62, testified in the Superior Court inquiry that she had
become ''the champion of the defendant's cause'' and even had
readied a room in her Putnam home for him to stay in upon his
release.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was ample evidence that Briere had lost her objectivity
and had become an advocate for the defendant,'' the justices wrote
in their decision.
</P>
<P>
   Briere, who continues to visit Santiago regularly at McDougall
Correctional Institution in Suffield, said Monday she will not give
up the case. She said she continues to gather evidence that
Santiago, who is serving a 50-year sentence, is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty hard when a young man looks you in the eye and
says, 'What am I doing here? I didn't do anything wrong,''' she
said. ''It upsets me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Schoenhorn, Santiago's attorney, could not be reached for
comment Monday. A message was left at his Hartford office.

<HEADLINE> Vidalia Onion Prices May Rise  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Shoppers looking forward to Georgia's sweet
Vidalia onions may be left with a bitter taste when they see higher
prices and later delivery this year.
</P>
<P>
   Prices may be up about 10 cents a pound because farmers in the
20-county southeast Georgia region where the famed onions grow are
peeling back production.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can only harvest so many onions, physically. We had more
onions planted last year than what we could get packaged. We don't
need that many, so we had to cut back,'' said Delbert Bland, who
operates a 2,600-acre farm south of Reidsville.
</P>
<P>
   State agriculture figures indicate Georgia farmers planted
14,918 acres of Vidalias this year, compared with 15,500 acres in
1999 and 16,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers usually sell Vidalias to grocers at about 50 cents a
pound, and the consumer typically pays around 69 cents. Consumer
prices this year could go as high as 79 cents a pound, Bland said.
</P>
<P>
   But University of Georgia extension economist Bill Thomas said
prices should also stabilize. ''Hopefully, it will help maintain a
steadier price at the grocery store,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first crop of Vidalias will also likely hit the shelves a
little later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, four producers were fined by the Georgia Department
of Agriculture for distributing green onions as fresh Vidalias,
said Bobby Harris, assistant commissioner of the marketing
division. Onions harvested too early do not have the quality or
shelf life of mature onions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Farmers tell me they'll cooperate and try to uphold the
integrity of the Vidalia onion'' this year, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vidalia Onion Committee, which oversees marketing and
research on the famous onions, also is urging farmers to avoid
trying to compete with Texas onion farmers by getting their onions
to market early.
</P>
<P>
   If Georgia farmers hold off a little, it will also help
alleviate consumer confusion between Texas onions and Vidalias,
said Tina Wheeler, executive director of the committee. She said
keeping consumers clear on the difference is her group's focus this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bland said the first Vidalias should hit the market around April
25.
</P>
<P>
   The onion committee will spend $65,000 to promote Vidalias
through magazine, television and radio interviews in Boston, New
York, Chicago, Philadelphia and the Washington, D.C./Baltimore
area.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're conducting a big promotion this year unlike any we've
ever conducted,'' Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   Vidalias are planted in November and grow through the winter.
They are harvested in April and shipped fresh from April to early
June. Onions not shipped by then are stored in coolers and shipped
up until October, or whenever supplies are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's famous onions are grown in and around Vidalia, where
the onion was first grown in 1931. In 1986, the Legislature
established a 20-county region as the only district where onions
could be labeled Vidalia onions.
</P>
<P>
   The crop is one of the state's most valuable, bringing in about
$60 million a year.

<HEADLINE> South Korea To Open New Airport  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INCHON, South Korea (AP) -- Fifty years ago, U.S. marines
splashed ashore in a daring maneuver that shifted momentum in the
Korean War. Today, off those same shores, a new airport worth $5
billion is taking shape on reclaimed tidal land.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of South Korea's biggest civil engineering projects, an
ambitious attempt to become Northeast Asia's main hub airport with
an annual capacity of 100 million passengers by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   The Inchon International Airport is scheduled to open in the
spring of 2001, although a date has not been fixed. It will replace
congested Kimpo airport in Seoul as South Korea's gateway for
international flights.
</P>
<P>
   Inchon is the latest airport renewal project in Asia. Hong Kong
opened Chek Lap Kok Airport in 1998, and Malaysia built Kuala
Lumpur International Airport in a bid to capture Southeast Asian
hub travel.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean airport sits on flats between two islands that
allied warships and landing craft sailed past in September 1950 in
a daring plan conceived by U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
</P>
<P>
   Surprised North Korean forces retreated from the South Korean
capital, Seoul, 25 miles to the east. The war dragged on for three
years before the combatants signed an armistice.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting left the Korean peninsula in ruins, and the two
Koreas are still divided by a heavily militarized border. But the
Inchon airport is yet another symbol of South Korea's race to
industralize and modernize over the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our ultimate goal is to become the hub airport in this region,
comparable to Amsterdam's Schipol Airport and Singapore's Changi
Airport,'' said Kim Hyo-joon, chief operating officer of the new
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Two parallel runways, stretching from shore to shore, are in
service for test flights and another will be added. Nearby sit a
control tower, designed by a French company, and a glassy,
crescent-shaped passenger terminal, designed by American firms.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers level mounds, and heavy trucks roam networks of dirt
roads.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated cost is about half that of a French-designed
high-speed railroad under construction between Seoul and the
coastal city of Pusan. Delays and corruption have plagued
construction.
</P>
<P>
   One of South Korea's most successful civil works projects was
the 1970 opening of a highway between Seoul and Pusan, cutting
travel time along the route and spurring economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Bechtel International Inc. of San Francisco, the
Inchon airport will initially handle 27 million passengers, 1.7
million tons of cargo and 170,000 flights a year.
</P>
<P>
   When the airport is fully developed in 20 years, the planned
capacity is four times as many passengers, four times as much cargo
and three times as many flights.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts applaud South Korea's willingness to open up
its air space. In 1997, it signed an ''open sky agreement'' with
the United States, allowing U.S. airlines to use Seoul as a staging
point for flights to other regional cities.
</P>
<P>
   George Lee, an analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo,
said South Korean's easing of restrictions on foreign airlines and
Inchon's pivotal location give it an edge over Japan's Narita and
Kansai airports in the race to become a regional hub.
</P>
<P>
   Hub routes include those between Southeast Asia and North
America and the Siberian route between Japan and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Inchon airport has problems. Housing, hotels and
shopping centers are far behind schedule because of sluggish
private investment. Only one road, an eight-lane highway, will link
Seoul with the airport until a high-speed rail line is built by
2005.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea began building the new airport in 1992 to relieve
Kimpo, which reached its saturation point in 1997 with 34.5 million
passengers. It will handle only domestic flights after Inchon
opens.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic in South Korea has increased an average 12 percent
annually since the 1988 Seoul Olympics, double the average rate of
the rest of the world. Regional demand also has ballooned.
</P>
<P>
   A crush of visitors is expected in 2002, when Seoul and Tokyo
co-host the World Cup soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Inchon is much less expensive than Hong Kong's $20 billion
airport and the $25 billion Kansai airport in Osaka, Japan, because
builders had to fill in a shallower depth of water. That could
allow South Korea to offer lower landing and other user fees.

<HEADLINE> Gore Hopes Offense Is Best Defense  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scarred by his own fund-raising past, Al Gore
is trying to overcome the issue of what he did with a promise of
what he will do on campaign funding if voters take him at his word
and entrust him with the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president combined his confession of a role in conduct
in 1996 ''that pushed the system to the breaking point and fueled
further cynicism'' with a vow to push for changes in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   It was an attempt to deflect an issue that Gov. George W. Bush
has used against Gore since they won primary campaigns in which
reform became a catchword. As the likely Republican nominee, Bush
won't let it go and, as the presumptive Democrat, Gore can't afford
to be a standing target.
</P>
<P>
   So he moved Monday to claim the issue, which required him to
concede that he is an ''imperfect messenger'' because of his own
excesses and missteps in raising campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got the scars to prove it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a new look for a candidate with a problem. The standard
tactic is to deny, try to change the subject, evade the questions.
And worse case, when pressed to the limit, lie.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton did when sex, marijuana and draft avoidance
questions threatened his 1992 campaign. And again in the Monica
Lewinsky scandal that led to the impeachment he survived.
</P>
<P>
   But on campaign finance conduct, Gore was cornered. It's all on
tape, the vice president at a Buddhist temple fund-raiser. ''No
controlling legal authority,'' his own words in defense of the
fund-raising calls he placed from the White House. The conviction
of a friend for arranging more than $100,000 in illegal donations
to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Now come Justice Department investigations of his campaign
chairman's personal financial conduct and of missing White House
e-mail messages that could bear on the inquiry into 1996
Clinton-Gore fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reform isn't a topic that has turned elections,
but character and trust have become top issues after the ethically
marred Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore joked at a dinner Saturday night that his strategy for
winning the White House is to claim some of the credit for the
thriving economy and leave the blame for scandal with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But controversy about his own fund-raising conduct is Gore's
problem, not Clinton's. So the vice president is out to pre-empt it
and put his own imprint on reform.
</P>
<P>
   He did so Monday with a new feature, a ''Democracy Endowment''
to raise about $7 billion in tax-deductible donations to pay for
House and Senate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of his proposal was essentially a reprise of the reform
bill the Senate rejects every year. It centered on a ban on ''soft
money,'' the unregulated funds the political parties are allowed to
raise and spend, supposedly apart from their candidates, but
actually in support of them. Illegal foreign contributions the
Democrats accepted in 1996, and returned after the election, were
soft money donations.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion surveys give few clues as to how the issue will
play for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the
Press showed that 52 percent of Americans said they would be less
likely to vote for Gore if they believed he took part in unethical
fund raising in 1996. But an equal percentage of those surveyed
said it wouldn't make a difference whether he had been part of ''a
scandal-ridden Clinton administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismissed Gore's proposal as ''a taxpayer financed
government takeover of campaigns,'' and a hollow one at that. He
said that unless Gore ''stops withholding information about his own
fund-raising excesses,'' his commitment to reform will be suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has his own proposal, including a ban on soft money from
corporations or labor unions, but not from individuals. It includes
a feature Democrats will not accept, which is to require labor
unions to get their members' permission before using dues for
political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, who made campaign reform the centerpiece of
his challenge to Bush, echoed his former rival on union money while
welcoming the features of Gore's proposal that are in his own
reform bill.
</P>
<P>
   To be convincing, McCain said, Gore needs to ''call for a
complete and open investigation of 1996 campaign finance
irregularities.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he said, people will see it as an election-year
conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing reform is no conversion for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He has advocated public financing of congressional elections
since he first went to the House in 1978. There, and in the Senate,
he sponsored more than a dozen reform bills.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's congressional record was part of his defense when former
rival Bill Bradley charged that Republicans would eat Gore up on
the subject unless he fully explained what went on in 1996. Even
when he dropped his challenge and endorsed Gore, Bradley did not
drop his call for a fuller explanation of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Gore is not what he has said, but what he has
done.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Choate Leads Reform Party  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With his chairmanship of the Reform Party
upheld by a federal judge, Pat Choate is moving to stabilize the
fractured third party with plans to raise $1 million in the next
several months and to reach out to his vanquished rival.
</P>
<P>
   ''The door is open,'' Choate said after Monday's ruling. ''Our
goals are the same.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no sign that Jack Gargan, who fought Choate for
the chairmanship, would accept the gesture. In an interview minutes
after U.S. District Judge Norman K. Moon ordered a halt to his
activities, Gargan vowed to leave the party and take his supporters
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is no party, this is somebody's little fiefdom,'' said
Gargan, an ally of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, who recently quit
the party. ''There will be a huge exodus from the party at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon ruling Monday that the chairmanship belongs to Choate, Ross
Perot's 1996 presidential running mate, ended a tug-of-war that had
weakened the party's standing in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will now allow us to go forth and mount a competitive
race for the White House this fall,'' Choate said after the ruling
in Lynchburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he was announcing plans to move the party's headquarters
to Washington and to raise $1 million by the time of the August
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Moon ordered Gargan and Treasurer Ronn Young to stop all
activities relating to those positions, including soliciting
donations, spending the party's money, operating an official Web
site and planning a convention. The party would suffer
''irreparable injury'' if the two men continued, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan said he would leave the party after 10 years helping
build it.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a way, I've won. This has been a rats nest for me. This has
been eight months of hell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A rowdy meeting of party leaders in Nashville, Tenn., last month
elected Choate to replace Gargan. But Gargan argued in court that
the meeting was convened illegally and that the vote to oust him
and install Choate was invalid.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion, Moon rejected all of Gargan's arguments. Citing
the party's constitution and Robert's Rules of Order, a handbook on
parliamentary procedure, Moon said the Nashville meeting did not
require 30 days notice as Gargan contended. He said Gargan's
refusal to call the meeting to order -- which led to televised
brawling -- was ''an improper attempt to subvert the will of the
controlling body,'' and that the 109 votes to remove Gargan and
Young were more than required.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Reform Party will suffer irreparable injury if Gargan and
Young are not enjoined from acting as the authorized
representatives of the party,'' Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   Moon's ruling resolves the dispute between Gargan and Choate,
but there are other problems.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of the party's most popular elected leader,
Ventura, and the void created by Perot's silence on political
issues have left it with a patchwork of state organizations caught
up in a variety of fights waged in courtrooms and cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, the Texas billionaire and two-time presidential
candidate, refused Monday to comment on the lawsuit or answer
questions about whether he plans to jump into the race and compete
for his party's nomination against former Republican Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I'm ready to say something, I'll let you all know,''
Perot said following remarks to the Federation of American Health
Systems in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   He has refused to speak directly with Buchanan, the front-runner
for the Reform nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, meanwhile, is being sued by New Hampshire Reform Party
Chairman John Talbott, who says the conservative columnist is
illegally using the party's name in his state and trying to elect
his own convention delegates at a meeting in Manchester on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Buchanan and Choate are threatening to go to
federal court over rules by the Commission on Presidential Debates
that would exclude the Reform Party's nominee from those events
unless he is scoring 15 percent or better in public opinion polls.
Without participation in the debates, Buchanan has said, the party
has no chance of winning the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's poll standing is dismal now, but he predicts he will
break into double digits by June.

<HEADLINE> Army sergeant blamed for sharing White House calling code  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A long-distance calling code that belonged to
the White House turned out to be a wrong number for an Army
sergeant who was arrested after he allegedly gave it to others.
</P>
<P>
   Before the scheme was discovered, more than $50,000 in illegal
calls had been rung up, according to federal prosecutors who on
Monday announced the arrest of 30-year-old David Gilmer, of
Woodbridge, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmer was assigned to the White House Communications Agency
when the government noticed a sudden rise in unauthorized calls
made with the code over several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed in federal court in Manhattan, U.S. Attorney
Mary Jo White alleged that Gilmer gave the White House phone access
number to people in New York and New Jersey, allowing them to make
9,400 unauthorized calls between Dec. 5, 1999, and Feb. 8, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The callers were tapping into the same telephone service
provided to the president, vice president, White House senior
staff, the National Security Council and U.S. Secret Service,
according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   The computerized telephone system is owned by private companies
but operated by the White House Communications Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmer was charged Friday with conspiracy to defraud the
government. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   A message left at Gilmer's home Monday after he had been
released on bail was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney, said there was
no indication that those who obtained the access codes could have
done anything more than make free phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators searched seven locations in New York and
one in New Jersey this month to gather evidence. According to the
complaint, a person in New Jersey told investigators the code had
come from Gilmer.
</P>
<P>
   The individual agreed to let federal agents tape telephone calls
with Gilmer, including one in which Gilmer admitted he had provided
access codes to others, the complaint said.

<HEADLINE> The Candidates on Campaign Reform  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Some positions of the presidential candidates,
Republican George
W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore, on campaign finance reform:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ban the unregulated and unlimited donations to parties known as
soft money?
</P>
<P>
   Bush: Ban it from corporations and unions but allow it from
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Gore: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Public financing of congressional elections?
</P>
<P>
   Bush: No. ''It's a taxpayer-financed government takeover of
campaigns that replaces individual spending decisions with
decisions made by an unelected government committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore: Eventually. Establish $7 billion endowment to be raised
over seven years from tax-deductible contributions from
individuals, corporations and unions and dispensed to all
qualifying candidates who want it. Tax deductions would cost
treasury an estimated $2 billion. Candidates who draw from the fund
could not raise any other money.
</P>
<P>
   Ban political ads by interest groups?
</P>
<P>
   Bush: No.
</P>
<P>
   Gore: No, but make such groups disclose the names of their
financial supporters, and require broadcasters running the ads to
offer equal and free time to candidates affected by the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Stop unions from using members' dues for political action
without specific permission?
</P>
<P>
   Bush: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore: No.
</P>
<P>
   Make broadcasters give free air time to presidential candidates?
</P>
<P>
   Bush: Has not proposed mandatory free air time.
</P>
<P>
   Gore: Yes. Favors five minutes every night in the 30 days before
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists:
</P>
<P>
   Bush: Forbid members of Congress from raising money from
lobbyists while Congress is in session. But aides say money-raising
could go ahead during any recess, including weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Gore: Require monthly disclosure on the Internet of lobbyists'
activities, including meetings they've had to influence
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Other:
</P>
<P>
   Bush: Require contributions to be disclosed almost immediately
on the Internet. Now, presidential candidates report on
contributions monthly; for congressional candidates, it's
quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore: McCain-Feingold bill banning soft money and setting other
controls would be first piece of domestic legislation sent to
Congress.

<HEADLINE> 73 Bodies Found in Uganda Mass Grave  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUGAZI, Uganda (AP) -- Prison laborers dug layer-by-layer through
rotting corpses Monday, pulling dozens of bodies from a mass grave
at a sugarcane field -- the third scene of carnage linked to a
doomsday cult.
</P>
<P>
   The laborers unearthed 73 bodies, including two dozen children
and babies, from the field belonging to a defrocked Roman Catholic
priest who was one of the sect leaders. The grim discovery brings
the number of cult-related deaths that police have confirmed to 562
since a March 17 fire in a makeshift church.
</P>
<P>
   Two other compounds in southwestern Uganda belonging to the sect
remained to be examined. James Bangirana, a local police official,
said late Monday that wasn't certain that all the bodies of sect
victims had been found.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bodies recovered Monday bore stab wounds and others
had pieces of cloth wrapped tightly around their throats. They
appeared to have been dead at least a month, said Dr. Ben
Twetegire.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners, shirtless and shoeless, stood head-high in the
trench, sweating and digging under a glaring midday sun as they
worked to unearth the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   They covered their noses in gauze and passed cigarettes among
themselves to try to ward off the enveloping stench, which drifted
for hundreds of yards across lush hillsides overlooking a series of
volcanic lakes. Onlookers and police plucked leaves from a cypress
tree and thrust them into their nostrils to ease the stench.
</P>
<P>
   As the twisted bodies were hoisted from the reddish brown earth,
villagers pressed against the crude wood fence at the edge of the
cane field.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no screams of recognition. The bodies were
apparently those of strangers -- sect members who came for seminars
on righteous living and the end of the world from former priest
Dominic Kataribabo, a leader in the Movement for the Movement for
the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies, some of them dismembered and one visibly pregnant,
were examined for little more than a minute each by Twetegire, who
dictated his horrific notes to Medal Magdalene, a 30-year-old
health worker. Prisoners then picked up the bodies and flung them
into a nearby trench for reburial.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to the doctor, Magdalene's list went on and on:
</P>
<P>
   Body No. 38. young male. largely decomposed.
</P>
<P>
   Body No. 39. young female. badly decomposed. external signs of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Police inspector Chris Tindigarukayo said authorities didn't
wait for forensics experts to examine the bodies before reburial
because they feared the spread of disease.
</P>
<P>
   The cursory examinations came as the Ugandan government
announced it had created a team of investigators, supposedly to
examine the bodies found in Rugazi and re-exhume corpses found
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The team, which includes chemists, a pathologist and forensic
experts, would be heading into the interior in the next day or so,
police spokesman Eric Naigambi said by telephone from Kampala,
Uganda's capital.
</P>
<P>
   After Rugazi, the team was to go to the village of Buhunga,
where they will re-exhume 153 bodies of sect members found there
last week in mass graves, quickly examined by a local doctor, and
reburied.

<P>
   Terenzi Kingera, a regional officer with Uganda's criminal
investigation division, said the doctor had been ''overwhelmed'' by
the job, so the corpses needed to be re-examined.
</P>
<P>
   Kingera said the investigators' main goal would be figuring out
''how could so many people be killed. Were they poisoned and with
which kind of poison?''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has been plagued by logistical problems since
it began. Police are ill-trained and desperately ill-funded, often
without vehicles or fuel to power them.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Ugandan officials, meanwhile, have quoted witnesses as
saying the sect's two top leaders -- Cledonia Mwerinde, 40, and
Joseph Kibweteere, 68, a former Roman Catholic priest -- may have
left Kanungu on March 17, the same day a church fire there killed
330 members. Six more bodies were later found in a pit latrine in
Kanungu.
</P>
<P>
   The fire deaths were initially viewed as a mass suicide.
However, many have speculated that the two leaders fled because the
world did not end Dec. 31 as they had predicted and sect members
wanted back the belongings they surrendered on joining.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities now are treating all the deaths as murders.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Muhezi, a member of parliament and a onetime head of
Uganda's internal security agency, theorized Saturday that sect
leaders cracked down viciously on the defiant, poisoning some, and
urging a mass suicide to curb further defections.
</P>
<P>
   Police discovered the Rugazi grave Friday when they came to
inspect the compound that had belonged to Kataribabo, who is
believed to have died in the Kanungu fire.
</P>
<P>
   Kanungu, Buhunga and Rugazi are all in the mountains of
southwestern Uganda, near the border with Rwanda and Congo and no
more than 50 miles apart.
</P>
<P>
   The sect once had up to 1,000 members. Authorities fear most may
have become victims.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 3, Blackhawks 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Milan Hejduk scored his second game-winning goal
in as many nights and Joe Sakic extended his career-best point
streak to 13 games with a pair of assists to lead the Colorado
Avalanche to a 3-1 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   One day after beating the Dallas Stars with an overtime goal,
Hejduk got his 33rd goal of the year with 2:30 left in the game.
Sakic had 16 goals and nine assists in his last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bourque added his sixth goal since being acquired in a March
6 trade with the Boston Bruins. Dave Reid had an empty-net goal as
the Avalanche maintained at least a four-point lead over Edmonton,
which played at San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sullivan scored Chicago's lone. Steve Passmore stopped 30
of 32 shots for the Blackhawks, 5-2-2 in their last nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado outshot the Blackhawks 14-3 in the first period, but
failed to get anything past Passmore. The Avalanche also didn't
convert two early power play chances.
</P>
<P>
   Passmore caught a break midway through the period when
Colorado's Martin Skoula hit the crossbar from the slot, but made
an acrobatic sliding save to deny Milan Hejduk's backhanded attempt
off the rebound from close range. Patrick Roy faced little pressure
from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado led 1-0 after two periods, but the Blackhawks kept the
puck in the Avalanche zone in the first three minutes of the
period. Roy turned aside scoring chances by Dean McAmmond and
Jean-Yves Leroux.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque broke the scoreless duel at 4:28 of the period with his
16th goal of the year. Sakic skated down the puck along the boards
and sent a cross ice pass to Bourgue, who beat Passmore over his
left shoulder with a slap shot from the right circle.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan tied the game at 1-1 at 6:14 of the third period on a
great individual effort. Roy turned aside Sullivan's shot from the
lower right circle, but Sullivan skated down the puck behind the
net and, using Skoula as a screen, put a wraparound under Roy's
stick.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado had a goal by Adam Deadmarsh disallowed at 11:35 when
Drury made contact with Passmore in the crease. Hejduk's
game-winner came at 17:30 on a blast from the slot after receiving
Sakic's pass from behind the net.
</P>
<P>
   Reid's empty net goal came at 19:41.

   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Ethan Moreau and Alex Selivanov scored
third-period goals to lift the Edmonton Oilers to a 2-1 victory
over the San Jose Sharks on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton tied the game at 1:23 of the period when Selivanov
scored on an 8-foot backhander that beat San Jose goaltender Steve
Shields.
</P>
<P>
   Moreau scored the game-winner with 12:20 left when he picked up
the rebound of Todd Marchant's shot and scored on a 12-foot shot.
</P>
<P>
   The victory lifted Edmonton two points ahead of the Sharks and
Phoenix and into sixth place in the Western Conference playoff
race. The Oilers have 82 points to 80 for San Jose and Phoenix. All
three teams have seven games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks scored 1:29 into the game on Todd Harvey's goal.
Edmonton goalie Tommy Salo stopped Jeff Friesen's shot, but Harvey
picked up the rebound and put it between Salo's legs.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was only San Jose's third in 30 games (26-3-1) in which
it has led after two periods. Conversely, the victory was only
Edmonton's third (3-22-3) in games in which it has trailed after
two periods.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers are 4-2-1 in their last seven games; the Sharks 5-3-1
in their last nine.

<HEADLINE> Home Milk Delivery Still Exists  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- Troy Miller steps lightly onto the dark
porch, careful not to let the frozen snow crunch too loudly under
his feet. When he does speak, it's barely above a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   ''This guy's a policeman,'' he says, carefully placing two
half-gallon cartons of milk on the porch. ''I've been delivering to
his family for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as quietly as he approached -- he walks almost on tiptoe --
Miller makes his way back to his white truck with its big engine
humming quietly, and heads down the darkened street.
</P>
<P>
   It's 5 a.m. The sun is still a solid hour from poking over the
horizon. Miller, 32, is not quite halfway through his daily
delivery route, dropping off milk, butter and eggs to his
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the milkman still cometh. Often seen as a throwback to a
time before supermarkets and convenience stores, milk deliverers
still make their rounds in a world of 'I need it now.'
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an interesting job,'' said Miller, a driver for McCann's
Home Dairy of Fargo. ''There's a quiet solitude about it that I
like. ... I've got two little boys at home. This is often the only
quiet time I get.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis McCann has operated McCann's Home Dairy for 12 years.
His four drivers and fleet of trucks serve about 1,600 households
in the Fargo area.
</P>
<P>
   Business is stronger than ever, McCann said. Instead of
signaling the end of milk delivery, the busy 21st century has
actually helped boost profits since so many families are on the go.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like there's a little elf that comes and replaces your
milk twice a week, a little tooth fairy of sorts,'' said Sarah
Gackle, a mother of four who runs a day care service. ''You never
see him, but you know he's been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gackle has been a customer of McCann's for about seven years.
She pays slightly more for home delivery -- about 15 cents per
half-gallon more than at the grocery -- but she's happy to pay it.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a deal,'' she said. ''Fifteen cents more to have it
delivered to my door? I call that a bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most customers, Gackle has a standing order for a certain
number of milk cartons each week. But if she needs more -- or less --
she can call McCann the night before or just leave a note tacked to
her front door.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 12 to 30 companies nationwide that still deliver
milk to homes represents a tiny part of the $18 billion worth of
milk sold annually, but experts say their popularity has grown
strongest in urban areas of the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ''Life is getting so hectic that people are looking for ways to
free up their time. They don't want to spend 20 minutes in a line
at the grocery store if they don't have to,'' said Jim Carroll,
president of the International Home Delivery Association, a trade
group that tracks popularity of home delivery products.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll also is owner of the third-generation Crescent Ridge
Dairy in Sharon, Mass., just outside Boston. The dairy delivers
fresh milk -- still in real glass bottles -- to 9,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said a half-gallon of milk, delivered in a returnable
glass bottle, costs his customers about 20 cents above what a
half-gallon carton would cost at the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience isn't the only reason for home delivery, Carroll
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has a little to do with nostalgia,'' he said. ''They like
the old-fashioned kind of personalized service. For many, it's a
reminder of a happier time when things weren't so rushed.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend has even hit smaller dairies, who are switching back
to glass bottles to expand their business, said Murray Bain, vice
president of marketing for Stanpac, a Smithville, Ontario, company
that makes the bottles.
</P>
<P>
   For Gackle, the personalized style of home milk delivery has
made her a loyal customer. One of her biggest worries was whether
she would still be able to get milk delivered to her new home.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said it would be no problem,'' she said. ''That's what's
so wonderful about it. That little extra effort.''

<HEADLINE> White Sox 12, Diamondbacks 8  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Jose Valentin's bases-clearing triple
fueled a six-run eighth inning and Frank Thomas homered as the
Chicago White Sox rallied to beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 12-8
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Lee added a two-run double and Greg Norton hit a
sacrifice fly for the other run as Chicago roughed up reliever Matt
Mantei in the eighth. Mantei gave up five runs on one hit, three
walks and a hit batsman, and recorded just one out.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox took a 2-0 lead in the first inning when Ray
Durham led off with a double against Arizona starter Omar Daal.
With one out, Thomas (2-for-3, 3 RBI) homered to left field.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks cut the lead to 2-1 in the second inning
against Chicago starter Cal Eldred. With the bases loaded and two
outs, Tony Womack drew a walk to force Steve Finley home.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (2-for-4, 3 RBI) hit his fourth homer of the spring, a
three-run shot, off Eldred, and Damian Miller had an RBI single, in
the third inning as Arizona took a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks made it 7-2 in the sixth, but shortstop Tony
Womack's error allowed Chicago to pull within 7-5 in the bottom
half of the inning on run-scoring singles by Thomas, Magglio
Ordonez and Paul Konerko.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox added another run in the seventh, when Durham walked and
eventually scored on a wild pitch, before taking the lead in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Foulke (1-0) picked up the win with two scoreless innings
of relief. Eldred pitched four innings, giving up five runs on six
hits and six walks.
</P>
<P>
   Daal gave up five runs (four earned) on eight hits over 5 1/3
innings.

<HEADLINE> Settlement reached in legal battle sparked by Virgin Mary painting  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The city and the Brooklyn Museum of Art have
reached a truce in a heated six-month legal battle sparked by an
exhibit featuring a dung-decorated painting of the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   In a settlement signed Monday and approved by U.S. District
Judge Nina Gershon, both sides agreed to drop dueling lawsuits over
the ''Sensation'' exhibit and pay their own legal fees. The deal
also commits the city to spend $5.8 million over two years for a
museum renovation project.
</P>
<P>
   The judge specifically barred Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the
city from ''inflicting ... any punishment, retaliation,
discrimination or sanction of any kind'' against the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement came six months after Giuliani -- calling the
painting ''sick'' -- froze an annual $7.2 million operating subsidy
for the museum, then sued in state court to evict it from the
city-owned site it's held for a century.
</P>
<P>
   After the museum filed its own lawsuit in federal court, the
judge declared the sanctions unconstitutional late last year in a
preliminary order restoring funding. The mayor refused to back
down, renouncing the judge as ''totally out of control'' and
appealing her decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, Mayor Giuliani has agreed that the preliminary
injunction that he ridiculed a few months ago will become
permanent,'' museum attorney Floyd Abrams said at a news conference
announcing the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who had been scheduled to be deposed in the case next
week, was meeting with Republican leaders in Albany and raising
funds in Cleveland for his U.S. Senate bid and had no immediate
response.
</P>
<P>
   But Corporation Counsel Michael Hess insisted the administration
was ''very gratified'' with the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt at this time that it was time to end the hostilities
on both sides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials, meanwhile, portrayed the agreement as a
resounding victory for the museum -- and for free speech. Abrams
characterized the City Hall offensive as ''one of the most
dangerous assaults on the First Amendment'' that he had seen as a
veteran constitutional lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''A loss would have validated the efforts by the mayor to bully
the museum into canceling an art exhibition, and then to cripple it
for not doing so,'' Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
   In the museum dispute, critics accused Giuliani of pandering to
conservative voters. City officials accused the museum board of
directors, British collector Charles Saatchi and Christie's auction
house, an exhibition sponsor, of trying to cash in on work by
modern artists whose sole aim is to shock.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Virgin Mary portrait fashioned with a clump of
elephant dung and magazine cutouts of female genitalia,
''Sensation'' included mannequins with genitals as facial features,
a glass tank featuring a fake cow's head and 20,000 live maggots,
and farm animals bisected and displayed in formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   The show prompted angry protests by religious groups; one man
was arrested after smearing the Virgin Mary portrait with white
paint. The show also attracted record crowds during a three-month
run ending in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like we have nothing to apologize for,'' Robert Rubin,
the museum board chairman, said Monday.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Kills 7 in Pakistani Town  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) -- A powerful bomb ripped through a
crowded market Tuesday on the border with Afghanistan, killing
seven people, including six children, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another 16 people were wounded, many seriously, when a bomb
destroyed a congested market in Torkham on the Pakistani border
with Afghanistan, said Iftikar Khan.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb was hidden in a shop where a 50-year-old man and six
young children were seated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one has taken responsibility for the bombing in Torkham, a
center for the illegal trade in homemade and smuggled weapons. The
town is also located in Pakistan's tribal region.
</P>
<P>
   Although a part of Pakistan, the tribal belt is largely governed
by tribal councils who convict and sentence the guilty, usually
according to laws they enact.
</P>
<P>
   Torkham sits on the border with Afghanistan, ravaged by a bitter
and bloody civil war. Hundreds of Afghan refugees daily pass
through the giant steel gates that separates the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Customs checks of Afghans are minimal and few of the Afghan
people crossing into Pakistan have passports or documents.

<HEADLINE> MLB Teams Set Rotations  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   With most teams' season openers just a week away,
managers put
their pitching rotations in order.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, an 18-game winner last year, will pitch the Los
Angeles Dodgers' season opener in Montreal next Monday night
against Dustin Hermanson, with Chan Ho Park and Orel Hershiser
starting the second and third games.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Fernandez will start Florida's season opener against San
Francisco on Monday, and Ryan Dempster, Vladimir Nunez, Jesus
Sanchez and Brad Penny will follow Fernandez in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Kile, acquired from Colorado as part of an offseason
pitching makeover, will start St. Louis' opener Monday against the
Cubs, Chicago's first game back following the two-game series this
week against the New York Mets in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Stephenson, who takes the place in the Cardinals'
rotation that opened when Kent Bottenfield was dealt to Anaheim for
Jim Edmonds, allowed two runs and four hits in five innings Monday
during a 3-3, seven-inning tie against Montreal in Jupiter, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the regular season, if he throws 80 pitches the way he did
today, that's the difference between going five or six innings or
pitching into the seventh or eighth inning,'' Cardinals manager
Tony La Russa said.
</P>
<P>
   At Tokorozawa, Japan, Rickey Henderson went 3-for-4 as the Mets
beat the Seibu Lions 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's name has come up in trade talks with the Detroit
Tigers involving Bobby Higginson. Baseball's career steals leader
created a commotion this spring by asking for a deal, but nothing
has happened so far.
</P>
<P>
   Against Seibu, Henderson scored two runs and drove in one. He
left after five innings with the Mets ahead 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the way it is with baseball,'' teammate Mike Piazza
said. ''You have to put the distractions behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Tokyo Dome, Sammy Sosa went 0-for-4 as the Chicago Cubs
lost to the Tokyo Yomiuri Giants 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pitching was everything. They've got good pitching,'' Sosa
said. ''All of them were impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jeff Cirillo, expected to replace Dante Bichette as
Colorado's cleanup hitter, aggravated a strained right quadriceps
Monday while hitting eight times in a minor league game.
</P>
<P>
   ''The leg's not ready,'' Cirillo said. ''There's no pain, but
there's definitely something in there. I almost regret doing this
today. ... I do regret doing it. After my first at-bat, I was like,
'This is probably not a smart idea.' That's where I'm stupid.''

73 Bodies Found in Uganda Mass Grave
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   RUGAZI, Uganda (AP) -- Prison laborers dug layer-by-layer through rotting
corpses Monday, pulling dozens of bodies from a mass grave at a sugarcane field
-- the third scene of carnage linked to a doomsday cult. The laborers unearthed
73 bodies, including two dozen children and babies, from the field belonging to
a defrocked Roman Catholic priest who was one of the sect leaders. The grim
discovery brings the number of cult-related deaths that police have confirmed to
562 since a March 17 fire in a makeshift church. Two other compounds in
southwestern Uganda belonging to the sect remained to be examined.

Vitamin C May Hurt Cancer Patients
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Cancer patients who take large doses of vitamin C might
make their disease worse by inadvertently protecting their tumors from radiation
and chemotherapy, new research suggests. Doctors said they cannot prove the
vitamin is harmful during cancer treatment, but added that there are strong
biological reasons to think megadoses could be bad. The concern is based on the
discovery that cancer cells actually contain large amounts of vitamin C, which
appears to protect them from oxygen damage. Many cancer treatments, especially
radiation therapy, work by triggering oxygen damage to the genes of cancer
cells.

OPEC Members To Convene for Meetings
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- As OPEC members haggled over the optimal size of a
planned increase in oil production, a powerful outside presence -- the United
States -- cast an unusually long shadow over the proceedings. OPEC oil ministers
failed to reach agreement Monday on how much crude oil to add to global
supplies, with Iran seen as the chief obstacle to a consensus that could provide
some price relief to consumers. The ministers were to resume discussions
Tuesday. The United States, the world's biggest consumer of oil, went to
exceptional lengths prior to the meeting to lobby the cartel to raise
production.

   MIAMI (AP) -- The Justice Department said tonight it would revoke Elian
Gonzalez's parole to remain in the United States by Thursday unless his Miami
relatives agree to promise to surrender the boy if they lose their court fight.
''Without a specific written commitment ... we have no choice but to move
forward with the termination of Elian's parole as of Thursday, March 30, 2000,
at 9:00 a.m.,'' the government said in a letter to the attorneys representing
the relatives. The agency also it has called the relatives to a meeting Tuesday
morning to discuss the ramifications of the parole termination and an orderly
return of the boy to his father in Cuba.

Putin Outlines His New Role
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Vladimir Putin, taking the helm of a weak, unwieldy Russia as
its second democratically elected president, admitted to voters Monday that he
has no swift solutions to the poverty and corruption that bedevil his nation.
Putin ordered the government to pay off wage debts to state workers, and said a
first order of business after his convincing victory in Sunday's election would
be selecting a prime minister. Putin has promised to protect democratic
freedoms, but has yet to indicate how he would carry the sprawling nation into
the post-Boris Yeltsin era. Putin, 47, was named acting president when Yeltsin
resigned Dec. 31.

Dying Ex-Smoker Awarded $20 Million
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A jury ordered the nation's two largest tobacco
companies Monday to pay $20 million in punitive damages to a dying ex-smoker who
took up the habit after the surgeon general's warning began appearing on
cigarette packs in the 1960s. The Superior Court jury decided 9-3 to order
Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds to pay $10 million each to Leslie Whiteley and
her husband. That verdict was the first time the industry lost to someone who
started smoking after 1969, when tobacco companies began putting
government-required health warnings on cigarette packs.

<HEADLINE> Expansive Burke collection of Japanese art goes on view at the Met  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A simple earthenware figure crafted thousands of
years ago hints at the Japanese aesthetics of the ages that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   In successive galleries, the evolution unfolds -- seen in more
than 200 breathtaking sculptures, scrolls, screens, woodblock
prints, lacquerware pieces, textiles and ceramics extending into
the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Taken from the biggest and most comprehensive private collection
of Japanese art outside Japan, ''Masterpieces of the Mary Briggs
Burke Collection'' was to go on view at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art today.
</P>
<P>
   The show, the first major Japanese exhibit the museum has
mounted in a quarter-century, includes pieces ranging from
prehistoric earthenware dating to about 3000 B.C. to dramatic and
brilliantly colored screens of the Edo period, which ended in the
19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing the works, many never before on public display, is a
stroll through the history of Japan itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''The collection is not idiosyncratic like many other
collections in this country. Mrs. Burke likes Japan very, very
much, and she wanted to have the arts representing various aspects
of Japanese culture and various periods. In that sense it is rather
comprehensive,'' said Miyeko Murase, a curator of Japanese art at
the museum who organized the show and wrote its mammoth catalog,
''Bridge of Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Murase worked closely with Burke for more than three decades,
helping her build her collection of about 1,000 masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I walk through the exhibit I feel a flow, a continuum.
That's what all cultures go through, evolution,'' Murase said of
the exhibit, which she arranged chronologically.
</P>
<P>
   An earthenware figure of a girl from around the sixth century,
probably made in eastern Japan, is simplistic and abstracted, with
an expression that seems to vary depending on the position from
which it is viewed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The technique is extremely simple, and I think in that sense
it has a continuum in the 16th and 17th century pottery in the
other room,'' Murase said. ''The Japanese already showed at that
time a sort of feeling for the material, very different from the
Chinese, who tried to make very thin ceramics out of clay. The
Japanese did that, too, but I think they were best in keeping the
natural quality of the clay as is.''
</P>
<P>
   Murase continued: ''You see some of the pots, strange pots,
broken pots that are considered more beautiful than perfect pots.
So that's already shown in those earlier pieces. It's sort of the
artist submitting himself to the dictate of the material rather
than try to conquer the limitations of the material.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the earthenware and ceramic works, the show
includes many masterpiece scrolls and screens, among Burke's
favorite media.
</P>
<P>
   One illustrated Zen scroll stands out. Painted in red, green and
black ink in 1278, the story scroll is perhaps the earliest of its
kind. In 10 sections, each framed by a simple black circle, it
shows how to find Zen truth, which is symbolized by an ox.
</P>
<P>
   ''These became very popular in Japan from the 15th century, 16th
century, but this is the 13th century, and for some reason it was
never shown to the public before. So it's really a debut,'' Murase
said. ''It's remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on public view for the first time is a glittering
gold-painted screen showing elegant women on a bridge throwing
their fans into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very symbolic, but no one really knows what it
symbolizes,'' Murase said. ''It's one of those screens belonging to
the 17th century, and very few screens of that genre or subject
matter survive. It is quite rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke, who keeps her extraordinary collection in her apartment
near the Manhattan museum, did not attend a preview.
</P>
<P>
   From a wealthy family in St. Paul, Minn., Burke became
fascinated by things Japanese at an early age. Her mother, who
traveled to Japan, owned Japanese works of art and built a Japanese
garden.
</P>
<P>
   When Burke moved to New York, she studied art history. In 1954,
she began making frequent trips to Japan. She started her
collection about a year later, after marrying printer Jackson
Burke.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is only a fraction of the collection, but it's wonderful
to see the pieces displayed in public,'' Murase said.
</P>
<P>
   The show will be at the museum through June 25.

<HEADLINE> California Republicans Attack Gore  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group led by some prominent California
Republicans has a new ad campaign against Al Gore and hopes to
raise millions of dollars more to keep up the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The first ads began airing Monday across California, and in New
York and Washington, accusing the vice president of hypocrisy on
campaign finance reform and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Former California Gov. Pete Wilson has helped the new group,
Shape the Debate, raise $1.5 million. Additional ads are planned
for California markets this spring, said George Gorton, a veteran
GOP consultant who leads the group.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are the opening volley from outside groups looking to
influence the election that pits Democrat Gore against Republican
George W. Bush. Federal law allows interest groups to air ads for
or against candidates as long as the commercials do not advocate
their election or defeat, although many ads of this kind stop just
short of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   These groups also are not required to identify their financial
backers.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said the group has raised $1.5 million, but would not say
how. The group's Web site notes that contributions are unlimited,
can come from any source and will not be made public.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the group's organizers publicly support Bush. Its
attorney, Vigo G. Nielsen, gave $1,000 to Bush's campaign, as did
Patrick Shea, one of two board members.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said donors fear they would face retaliation if they were
known to be criticizing the vice president. He said he has not
consulted with Bush or his campaign -- a step that would render the
ads an illegal campaign contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The ads began appearing the same day Gore unveiled a campaign
finance proposal that would require groups such Shape the Debate to
disclose their donors if they advertise within 60 days of an
election. They are running in New York, Washington and four large
California markets -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is exactly the type of shady politics that is having a
very negative effect on democracy,'' said Gore spokesman Chris
Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Shape the Debate hopes to raise an additional $2 million to $3
million for another round of spots later this spring, principally
in California, a crucial state in the fall election, Gorton said.
Its two-member board also includes former Republican Rep. Bill
Lowery.
</P>
<P>
   The ad's theme is strikingly similar to a Bush campaign mantra:
Gore's trustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   Patterned after the game show ''Jeopardy!,'' the 30-second spot
pretends to be a show called ''Hypocrisy.'' A contestant chooses
''political hypocrites for 200'' and is told: ''He says he supports
campaign finance reform, but held an illegal fund-raiser at a
Buddhist Temple.'' The answer: ''Who is Al Gore?''
</P>
<P>
   Two similar questions poke at Gore's statements on tobacco and
Medicare spending cuts. The ad doesn't mention that the Medicare
cuts Gore supported were smaller than the cuts backed by
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Groups across the political spectrum also have tried to
influence the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   During the primaries, a pair of Texas businessmen calling
themselves Republicans for Clean Air aired pro-Bush ads. From the
left, the Sierra Club and the National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League also have gone after Bush.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani's reaction to police shooting hurts him in polls  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's unsympathetic response
to the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man could change
the course of the U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby International poll taken after the police slaying of
26-year-old Patrick Dorismond earlier this month shows that
Giuliani's 7-point lead over first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has
vanished and that Clinton now holds a slim 45 percent to 42.3
percent advantage. Her lead is within the poll's 3.8 percentage
points margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, released Sunday, also shows that the Republican mayor
would receive just 28 percent of the vote in the city he leads,
down from 44 percent three weeks ago. Giuliani has also tumbled in
several key demographic areas, including among upstate voters, Jews
and Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of people said the mayor should have expressed
sympathy to Dorismond's family, and one in four said the issue
would be a factor in whether he or she votes for Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Other polls have shown that Giuliani has as little as 5 percent
support among blacks. Observers believe the mayor's hard-edged
response to the shooting -- in which he has strongly suggested that
Dorismond was responsible for his own death -- could spark a large
turnout of Democrats in a state in which registered Democrats
outnumber Republicans by a ratio of about 5 to 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's handing her the race,'' pollster John Zogby said. ''It's
not that she's doing better, it's that he's doing worse. We've seen
the tide turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, however, brushed aside the poll results Monday at a
press conference in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm absolutely destroyed by it,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Turning serious, he said, ''No. I'm not concerned about it at
all. I think that if you've been through tough elections, as I
have, you expect to be up in the polls, you expect to be down in
the polls, and you expect to be statistically tied in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, a security guard and son of a prominent Haitian
singer, was killed by an undercover officer while trying to hail a
cab March 16 in a failed police drug sting. It is unclear whether
the officer fired by accident.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, Giuliani released Dorismond's criminal
record, including previously sealed information about an arrest
when Dorismond was 13 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has also pointedly refused to offer Dorismond's family
condolences and has said he will not meet with the family or
members of the city's black community.
</P>
<P>
   Following Dorismond's funeral Saturday in Brooklyn, police
clashed with bottle-throwing protesters. Twenty-three officers were
injured, and 27 civilians were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton campaign has made Giuliani's handling of
the shooting Exhibit A in its effort to paint him as being too
ill-tempered for the U.S. Senate, Giuliani has stubbornly refused
to soften his stance.
</P>
<P>
   ''No regrets,'' the mayor said Monday. ''I think I handled it
appropriately, appropriate to the situation and appropriate to what
had to be done in order to make sure that the public got
information that the media to this day is still suppressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani complained last week that the media is unable to cover
police shootings fairly.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''I think over the long term people will see that it
was the correct response.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dorismond shooting follows three other fatal police
shootings: Malcolm Ferguson on March 1 while he was fleeing police
in the Bronx; Richard Watson, killed by an officer in September
1999 after allegedly cheating a cab driver out of his fare; and
Amadou Diallo, who was shot at by undercover officers 41 times in
February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Giuliani's almost daily exhortations that the city's
police department is among the most restrained in the nation when
it comes to firing weapons, a Daily News-New York 1 poll found that
72 percent of respondents believed that ''the use of deadly force
has gotten out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, 60 percent said federal monitoring of the department is
necessary, an idea that Giuliani strongly opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Republican political consultant Jay Severin said Monday that he
doubts that the 15 percent of undecided voters in the race will
base their votes on the Dorismond shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst thing that's going to come out of this is that
Rudy's going to appear to be tough on crime and Hillary's going to
appear to be too weak on crime,'' he said. ''I don't think the
undecideds are going to vote for someone they perceive as being
weak on crime.''

<HEADLINE> Bush To Outline New Education Plans  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a week devoted mostly to his top issue,
George W. Bush was adding the promise of a federal literacy program
to his education palette, along with plans for improving teacher
recruitment and retention.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the Texas governor and presumed Republican presidential
nominee said the proposals are aimed at fleshing out his pledge to
make education his top priority if elected, in contrast with Vice
President Al Gore's promise to make campaign finance his
centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Education is an issue that polls especially well with women, a
traditionally Democratic group that Bush is courting in his race
against Gore, the likely Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was outlining the new reading program today in a speech to
Asian-American business people at the Reston, Va., headquarters of
Sallie Mae, the nation's largest issuer of student loans.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the federal government offers Even Start, which
provides literacy training to both preschoolers and their parents.
There also is a literacy component to Head Start, as well as adult
literacy training provided under the Vocational Education Act.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a sign of how important reading is, education is and
how both are fundamental parts of the governor's agenda,'' Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was detailing the plan to recruit, retrain and
retain teachers on Thursday in Pewaukee, Wis., during a two-day
campaign and fund-raising swing through the state.
</P>
<P>
   Today's trip to Virginia was part of a two-day East Coast swing
that also included appearances and fund-raisers in Parsippany,
N.J., New York and Baltimore. Bush also planned to visit Eau
Claire, Milwaukee and Green Bay, Wis., while in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   His fund-raisers were expected to raise $1.375 million,
including $500,000 at a New York luncheon, $450,000 across the
Hudson River in New Jersey, and $250,000 in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has delivered three major education speeches since
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   His plans call for spending $5.5 billion over five years,
although its cornerstone is not spending but accountability through
locally designed and administered tests.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposes taking away federal Title I money from poorly
performing schools and giving it to families to help defray the
cost of educating their children elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore has proposed spending $115 billion over 10
years to continue President Clinton's program aimed at reducing
class sizes by providing more money to hire teachers. So far, about
30,000 have been hired, with a goal of 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also wants to triple the number of charter schools, make
preschool available to every 4-year-old and expand Head Start.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and Gore battle for the title of ''Education
President,'' the two have taken different approaches when it comes
to using public education for their own children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's children are taught at private schools, while Bush's twin
daughters have attended public schools in Dallas, two private
schools and, since 1996, a public high school in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech to the Asian-Americans was a follow-up to the
Hispanic business audience that sat for his first education speech
in California.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor feels that education is the key to getting a good
job, and these business groups will be the first to tell you that
what they look for in a prospective employee is a good education,
good work habits, good discipline,'' Fleischer said.

<HEADLINE> High Court To Rule on Hate Crimes  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The case of a white New Jersey man who fired
shots into a black family's home asks the Supreme Court to decide
when judges can impose longer sentences under hate-crime laws.
</P>
<P>
   Charles C. Apprendi Jr., who fired the shots in 1994, says a
jury -- not the judge -- must decide whether he acted because of
racial prejudice. He initially told police he wanted to give the
family a message that they did not belong in his otherwise
all-white neighborhood. Later he said the shooting had no racial
motive.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question of mental state ... has long been the province of
juries,'' Apprendi's lawyers said in court papers. ''New Jersey,
however, seeks to take from the defendant his protection by that
jury.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's lawyers, supported by the Clinton administration,
contend motive is a ''traditional sentencing factor'' that can be
decided by a judge instead of a jury.
</P>
<P>
   After arguments today, the Supreme Court is expected to issue a
ruling by July.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all states have some type of hate-crime law, and New
Jersey's 1981 statute was among the first enacted. The law allows
defendants to be sentenced to longer prison terms if they acted
with a ''purpose to intimidate an individual ... because of race,
color, gender, handicap, religion, sexual orientation or
ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi was arrested in December 1994 after firing shots into
the home in his neighborhood in Vineland, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   At first he told police he wanted to send a message to the black
family, but he later said he was unfairly pressured into making
that statement. He said he had no racial intent but fired into the
house when its purple front door attracted his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi pleaded guilty to a firearm violation and possessing a
bomb in his house, which carried a maximum 10-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors sought an enhanced sentence under the hate-crimes
law. The judge imposed a 12-year term, saying prosecutors had shown
that Apprendi's act was racially motivated. The judge used a
lenient legal standard, saying prosecutors had made that showing by
a ''preponderance of the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi appealed, saying the race-bias issue should be decided
by a jury using the highest legal standard -- whether prosecutors
offered proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Most other states' hate-crime laws require that standard of
proof, his lawyers said, contending his intent should be treated as
an element of the offense to be considered by the jury.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled against Apprendi and upheld
the sentence, saying the existence of a ''biased purpose'' did not
have to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Apprendi vs. New Jersey, 99-478.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators and broadcasters are waging
an unusually public battle over a plan to license hundreds of
microradio stations, each side accusing the other of using
misleading information to prove their point.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters and others say that the creation of these low-power
radio stations -- operating at 10 and 100 watts -- would cause
serious interference with regular full-power FM radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   But top officials at the Federal Communications Commission
called a news conference Monday to rebut those allegations. They
said a CD that the National Association of Broadcasters circulated
on Capitol Hill is misleading. The CD contains simulated levels of
interference -- songs and voices on radio stations -- that consumers
would purportedly hear on their regular FM stations once the
low-power stations are set up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a misrepresentation of the engineering facts,'' said FCC
Chairman Bill Kennard. ''Clearly, you have an industry that does
not want to have new voices coming onto the airwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission attacked the broadcasters' claims as it was
kicking off the process to select recipients of the new licenses.
Applications for the first batch of channels will be accepted in
May.
</P>
<P>
   FCC engineers did their own demonstration to show that even with
a radio signal strength much higher than what they are permitting,
people listening to FM stations on their portable, clock or home
radios would not hear significant interference or any cross-talk at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ''Interference claims are nothing new at the FCC,'' said FCC
Commissioner Gloria Tristani. She stressed that the agency took a
conservative approach in giving the green light for the low-power
program.
</P>
<P>
   But the broadcasting lobby says that tests support its claims.
The group has taken its opposition to the courts and to Capitol
Hill, where it has gained the backing of a number of lawmakers.
Legislation to undo the FCC's rules implementing low-power radio
has been introduced in the Senate and is winding through the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''The undeniable fact is that hundreds of thousands of radio
listeners will experience additional interference as a result of''
low-power radio, said NAB spokesman Dennis Wharton. The association
has added to its Web site audio interference samples.
</P>
<P>
   NAB is not the only group that has raised questions about the
plan. National Public Radio has asked the FCC to delay
implementation of the plan, fearing that it could interfere with
radio reading services for the blind and visually impaired. Such
services are carried on subcarrier channels.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials say they will continue to work with NPR to
address this issues and will be vigilant to investigate any claims
about interference as the low-power stations starting broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the FCC selected the first group of states from which
it will accept applications. That process will continue until late
spring of next year when all the noncommercial licenses will be
issued. The licenses are targeted at nonprofit and educational
groups that have a fixed presence in their communities.

<HEADLINE> Author Benchley Talks About 'Jaws'  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Peter Benchley, author of the 1974 blockbuster
''Jaws,'' says if he had the book and movie to do over again, he
wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't do it at all. I wouldn't try to demonize an
animal,'' Benchley said Monday in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the fame he gained from ''Jaws,'' Benchley said he has
been able to follow the continuing research into the life of sharks
and is involved in projects to bring that information to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   These include an article on great white sharks in the recently
published April issue of National Geographic magazine and a
television program on the same subject.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past quarter-century the amount of information that has
come to light through study and experience has changed the
perception of what motivates shark behavior that used to be thought
homicidal, Benchley said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a gradual process of learning more and more about
the animal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Society has changed, the perceptions of animals have
changed,'' over the same period, he added. ''So to have a story in
which an animal is a conscious villain is not acceptable anymore,''
Benchley said. ''I don't mean acceptable from the political
correctness point of view, I mean acceptable morally and ethically
and every other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Benchley said the information in ''Jaws'' was good for its time,
but added ''it's shocking how little was known in 1974. And it's
stunning how much as been learned in the last 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, much remains to be learned about sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ''What has changed is that we are, through modern fishing
technology, destroying the animal,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   And sharks don't have a big constituency defending them, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Senate Again Takes Up Flag Amendment  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Votes are near in the Senate on proposed
amendments to the Constitution that could make desecrating the U.S.
flag illegal and put limits on contributions to political
campaigns. The Supreme Court has said both are forms of free speech
protected by the Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Late today, the Senate takes up a measure offered by Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., that would give Congress power to set reasonable
limits on the amount of contributions that can be made to a
candidate for federal office.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings wants his provision added to a proposed constitutional
amendment on flag desecration introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah. The flag vote could come Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both are expected to be defeated, Hollings' by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Hatch proposal is likely to mirror the last flag-desecration
vote in the Senate, in 1995, when supporters fell three short of
the two-thirds majority needed to amend the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Debate has been passionate on both sides of both issues, as
opponents argued they seriously undermine the First Amendment's
free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's amendment comprises one sentence: ''Congress shall have
power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a leading critic of campaign
finance limits, said the Hollings provision ''crudely reaches in
and rips the heart right out of the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., made campaign spending reform a
cornerstone of his failed bid for the Republican presidential
nomination. He says his legislative efforts to limit campaign
contributions are constitutional, but Hollings argued that more
fundamental changes in the nation's legal framework are needed.
''This thing is a real disaster,'' he said. ''It's an
embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance-limits opponent McConnell also opposes the flag
amendment. He proposed an alternative under which Congress would
enact a law to establish jail terms and large fines for damaging a
flag with the intent to incite or produce violence. A vote on that
approach also was scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're dealing here with a nonissue,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett
of Utah, one of four Republicans who voted against the amendment in
1995. ''No one is burning the flag in America today in any
discernible numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficult constitutional amendment path was chosen because
the Supreme Court has struck down both flag desecration and
campaign finance laws on First Amendment ground.
</P>
<P>
   The flag amendment has been a Republican priority since the
party gained control of both chambers of Congress in 1995. The
House has achieved the two-thirds majority in votes in 1995, 1997
and again last year. The Senate fell three votes short in 1995 and
hasn't tried again.
</P>
<P>
   A constitutional amendment also needs to be ratified by
three-fourths of state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters acknowledge they are still several votes short, but
the vote will put senators on the record in an election year. The
debate this week coincides with a meeting in Washington of the
American Legion, a primary backer of the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Flag Alliance, a pro-amendment group of 140
veterans and civic groups, said three-fourths of Americans support
a flag amendment and 49 state legislatures -- all but Vermont's --
have passed resolutions urging Congress to pass the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents argued there is no sense in amending the
Constitution, to the possible detriment of free speech, for an act
that rarely occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ''To protect the symbol of freedom at the expense of freedom
itself is backwards to me,'' said Paul Tash, executive editor of
the St. Petersburg Times and chairman of the freedom of information
committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. The real
test of free speech, he said, comes ''when that free speech is
repugnant.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Edge Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's key stock index edged higher Tuesday, led
by telecommunications shares. The dollar was lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 93.31 points,
or 0.5 percent, to close at 20,374.34. On Monday, the average rose
322.95 points, or 1.61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 106.44 yen at 3 p.m. (1 a.m. EST) Tuesday,
down 0.46 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York level of 106.87 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei reversed an early retreat to
close at at a two and a half year high for a second day. Today's
closing price was its highest since July 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   NTT Mobile Communications Network Inc. led gains by
telecommunications stocks. Japan's largest cellular phone company
said Monday it will spend 1 billion yen ($9.3 million) to take a 5
percent stake in an online bank venture.
</P>
<P>
   Investors selectively bought technology stocks including NEC
Corp. and Toshiba Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. slipped after jumping Monday
on news the Japanese automaker will sell a 34 percent stake to
DaimlerChrysler AG of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi fell 2.6 percent to 458 yen ($4.30).
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 26.93 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,680.76. The
TOPIX closed up 13.32 points, or 0.81 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar slipped against the yen,
dragged down by the sinking euro.
</P>
<P>
   The euro slid against the yen after Deutsche Bundesbank
President Ernst Welteke said overnight that he didn't see any
reason to raise European interest rates now.
</P>
<P>
   The euro was traded at 102.90 yen, down from 104.35 yen late
Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   That weighed on the dollar because traders selling euros for yen
typically sell euros for dollars and then dollars for yen.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell
to 1.8800 percent from 1.8950 percent Monday. Its price rose 0.13
point to 100.17.

<HEADLINE> Stamford lawsuit says constables were ''lawless''sdstmpr  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The city of Stamford and two elected
constables are among five defendants cited in a multimillion-dollar
federal civil-rights lawsuit stemming from an armed incident at a
hotel in Norwalk in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint alleges the city of Stamford tolerated
''lawlessness'' and ''abuse of authority'' by two of its elected
officials, constables Ralph Serafino and Jon Gallup.
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit, which has been assigned to U.S. District
Court Judge Peter C. Dorsey in New Haven, seeks damages of $500,000
against each of the defendants -- the city, Serafino, Gallup, Albert
Moavaro, now a Greenwich police officer, and Glen Pennell, a court
bailiff in Norwalk.
</P>
<P>
   The action also seeks punitive damages of $1 million against
each of the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   James Farrell, the attorney representing the five plaintiffs,
said the lawsuit stems from a dispute among the owners of the
Norwalk Inn on Feb. 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defendants were hired to carry out a hostile takeover,''
Farrell said Monday. ''They went to the Norwalk Inn in the middle
of the night with guns and bulletproof vests and staged a takeover
like rebels during a junta. They held people hostage for a day and
did not let the hotel employees make outgoing calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the 28-page complaint filed Feb. 11 alleges
the four men impersonated deputy sheriffs, displayed automatic
weapons and official badges outside of Stamford, and used their
official positions, badges or identification to assist private
individuals as security guards.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims the plaintiffs' civil rights, including the
right to be free from unreasonable seizures and the right to be
secure in person and property, were violated.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup, the husband of Mayor Dannel Malloy's executive aide,
denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe we conducted ourselves in the appropriate fashion
and did our duty as constables,'' said Gallup, 40, who has served
as a full-time constable since 1995. ''We were not acting on our
own. We were given direction by attorney Peter Lathouris. It was a
family dispute and we were caught in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Constables act as individual contractors performing services on
behalf of attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit charges the city with failing to ''properly and
adequately train, instruct and supervise Stamford constables.'' It
also alleges the city has ''with deliberate indifference failed to
properly sanction or discipline its constables for violations of
the constitutional rights of citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew McDonald, the city's director of legal affairs, said he
plans to file a motion to dismiss the case against the city.
Stamford's seven constables, who are elected by city residents, are
not municipal employees, McDonald said.

<HEADLINE> State won't investigate claim of illegal donation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Two state commissions have decided not to
investigate an allegation that Gov. John G. Rowland received an
illegal $100,000 contribution to his 1994 gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey B. Garfield, executive director of the State Elections
Enforcement Commission, and Rachel S. Rubin, managing director of
the State Ethics Commission said Monday that the statute of
limitations on the charge has expired.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't investigate any request for an investigation that's
beyond our statute of limitations,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The election panel's five-year statute ran out in 1999 on the
1994 incident, and the ethics panel's three-year statute expired in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Republican campaign contributor James B. Irwin claims Rowland
requested he funnel the donation through the Republican National
Committee as a way to skirt the state's $2,500
campaign-contribution limit.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 5, 1994, the day after Irwin had his company send
$100,000 to the RNC, the RNC gave $80,000 to the Connecticut
Republican Party. By Election Day the RNC had sent $286,000
more----at a time when the state GOP spent hundreds of thousands on
phone banks and mailings to help narrowly defeat Democrat Bill
Curry.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland has acknowledged seeking Irwin's financial support for
his own campaign, he denied asking him to donate to the RNC or
talking about funneling such a donation back to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   He said Irwin's charge comes from bitterness over the governor's
recent reappointment of the judge who presided over the 1995 trial
in which a man charged with murdering Irwin's son was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Curry called for an independent investigation of the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Pagani, Rowland's spokesman, questioned Curry's motives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Curry obviously still thinks this is 1994. One day Mr.
Curry will wake up and realize that it's the year 2000 and he lost
the 1994 race.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry pointed out the charges come from a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question here is the integrity of the system,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> INS Eyes Elian Parole Revocation  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- In an escalating war of words, the U.S. government
said it will swiftly end Elian Gonzalez's right to remain in the
United States unless his Miami relatives promise to surrender the
6-year-old boy if they lose their court fight to keep him out of
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service said the boy's parole
would end at 9 a.m. Thursday unless the family provides a written
guarantee to give up Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which made the demand in a letter delivered to
family attorneys late Monday, said the commitment is required by
law as a condition of the parole that allows Elian to remain in the
United States under the care of his great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials and the relatives were scheduled to meet today to
discuss the next step.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives want the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta to overturn a federal judge's ruling affirming an INS
decision to return Elian to Cuba. The court has scheduled oral
arguments for the week of May 8, which could complicate any steps
by the government.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction to the INS demand from Elian's
Miami relatives or from the crowd of about 50 people gathered
outside the boy's Little Havana home.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Linda Osberg-Braun, an attorney for the relatives,
insisted the family has complied with government demands and would
continue to obey the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe we're in compliance,'' she said. ''We want
assurances from the INS. We fear them revoking Elian's parole,
tearing him from his family and returning him to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   The child has been the subject of an international custody
dispute since November, when he was rescued by fishermen who found
him lashed to an innertube off the Florida coast. His mother and 10
others died when their boat sank during the journey from Cuba to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives say they can give him a better life than
he would have in communist Cuba. The Justice Department says he
belongs with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have made it clear they would not want to
do anything to traumatize the boy, who this week on ABC said he
believes his mother is still alive. The INS also does not wish to
provoke Miami's large Cuban community.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters outside Elian's home responded to a call
by the anti-Castro Democracy Movement to be prepared to form a
human chain around the home if the government tries to remove the
child. A 15-foot banner in front of the house with a drawing of
Elian carries the message: ''I just want to live in freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Olga Scott, 50, came from Houston to join the protest. ''Over
our dead bodies, they will not take him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of people who aren't willing to kill but are
willing to die only for the child's rights,'' added Ramon Saul
Sanchez, head of the Democracy Movement.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, Castro mocked Cuban exiles who said they feared he
would launch an armed raid to repatriate the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian remained home from school Monday, and family spokesman
Armando Gutierrez said he won't return out of fears that Cuba might
try to force him back to the communist island.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Obdulia Copa left the boy's home at the end of the
school day and confirmed that she will be teaching the child at
home for the rest of the week and possibly until the custody
dispute is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent effort to increase American support for their
battle to keep Elian, the child's relatives last week allowed ABC's
Diane Sawyer to spend two days with Elian. The result was his first
extended interview, being broadcast this week on ''Good Morning
America.''

73 Bodies Found in Uganda Mass Grave

	   RUGAZI, Uganda (AP) -- Prison laborers dug layer-by-layer through rotting
corpses Monday, pulling dozens of bodies from a mass grave at a sugarcane field
-- the third scene of carnage linked to a doomsday cult. The laborers unearthed
73 bodies, including two dozen children and babies, from the field belonging to
a defrocked Roman Catholic priest who was one of the sect leaders. The grim
discovery brings the number of cult-related deaths that police have confirmed to

Scientists Find Weight-Gain Gene

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists have created strains of mice that can eat a
high-fat diet without getting chubby using a single gene that might lead to a
new obesity treatment for people. In its normal form, the gene, called HMGIC,
apparently helps mice make more cells to store fat when they have been eating a
fatty diet, researchers said. But the mice in the experiment had a defective
version of the gene. They apparently failed to create storage cells in response
to the high-fat diet, and so avoided putting on weight, the researchers said in
the April issue of the journal Nature Genetics.

Vitamin C May Hurt Cancer Patients
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Cancer patients who take large doses of vitamin C might
make their disease worse by inadvertently protecting their tumors from radiation
and chemotherapy, new research suggests. Doctors said they cannot prove the
vitamin is harmful during cancer treatment, but added that there are strong
biological reasons to think megadoses could be bad. The concern is based on the
discovery that cancer cells actually contain large amounts of vitamin C, which
appears to protect them from oxygen damage. Many cancer treatments, especially
radiation therapy, work by triggering oxygen damage to the genes of cancer
cells.

OPEC Members To Convene for Meetings
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- As OPEC members haggled over the optimal size of a
planned increase in oil production, a powerful outside presence -- the United
States -- cast an unusually long shadow over the proceedings. OPEC oil ministers
failed to reach agreement Monday on how much crude oil to add to global
supplies, with Iran seen as the chief obstacle to a consensus that could provide
some price relief to consumers. The ministers were to resume discussions
Tuesday. The United States, the world's biggest consumer of oil, went to
exceptional lengths prior to the meeting to lobby the cartel to raise
production.

<HEADLINE> GOP Targets Marriage Penalty Tax  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate Republican bill intended to ease the
income tax marriage penalty paid by millions of two-income couples
would provide billions of dollars more in tax relief than a measure
passed earlier this year by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Senate GOP aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, put the
bill's price tag at between $230 billion and $240 billion over 10
years using projected budget surpluses. The version passed by the
House in February would cost $182 billion over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has proposed a less costly marriage
penalty bill, threatened to veto the House measure in part because
it would use such a large chunk of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 million two-income couples pay more income taxes simply
because they are married than if they were single. Senate Finance
Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., planned to release details
of the Senate bill today, with the committee to begin considering
it on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the sharply higher cost of the Senate bill is
that it would ensure that married couples who take numerous tax
deductions and credits do not get entangled in the complex
alternative minimum tax, which is intended to ensure the wealthy do
not escape taxes through legal means. That provision alone could
cost up to $50 billion over 10 years, according to congressional
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging Senate bill will mirror the House bill on several
other points, according to a memo on the bill's ''basic building
blocks'' circulated by Finance Committee staff:
</P>
<P>
   -- Both would eliminate the marriage penalty for couples who take
the standard income tax deduction beginning in 2001. The House bill
raises that deduction to twice that of single filers, which this
year would increase the deduction for a married couple filing
jointly from $7,351 to $8,800.
</P>
<P>
   --Both would provide broad-based tax cuts by widening income tax
brackets. The House bill would widen the bottom 15 percent income
tax bracket for married couples so that they pay that rate on the
first $52,500 of income, compared to $43,850 in current law. The
Senate bill would phase the change in more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   --Both would address the marriage penalty paid by some low-income
couples who claim the earned income tax credit. The House measure
would raise the income cutoff for those couples by $2,000 beginning
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   As in the House, Senate Democrats were expected to draft their
own alternative that targets the tax relief more toward the middle-
and lower-income groups and also avoids giving untoward tax relief
to couples who now earn a tax ''bonus'' -- generally those in which
one spouse earns the lion's share of the income.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republicans want to give broad-based tax relief disguised
as a marriage penalty bill,'' said Mike Siegel, spokesman for Sen.
Max Baucus, D-Mont.

<HEADLINE> Best Actor Award Scarce for Blacks  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Clarke Duncan may not have his
supporting actor Oscar, but he hopes his recent Academy
Award-nomination gets him something else: leading-man status.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan has uphill climb. Roles that get black performers into
the best actor category have been scarce in an industry that has
often relegated them to playing either the villain or victim,
critics say.
</P>
<P>
   Even when black actors and actresses do get nominated, they have
traditionally been overlooked. Sidney Poitier is the only black
performer to win the top acting Oscar, in 1964 for ''Lilies of the
Field.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there are enough quality roles. And that's what
we need to be doing,'' said Duncan, the star of the supernatural
prison saga ''The Green Mile.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hollywood has duly recognized work steeped in racial
sensitivity, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences rarely
rewards those performances outside the supporting actor or actress
categories.
</P>
<P>
   No black woman has ever won the best actress category, though
some have been nominated. Most notable was Whoopi Goldberg for
1985's ''The Color Purple,'' another example critics point to of
the Oscars recognizing, but not rewarding, a film about black
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real issue is that black people are not part of the good
old boy network of writers directors and producers. If that
changed, you'd see the role of black actors changing,'' said Thomas
Rideout, the director of a National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People program in Los Angeles aimed at getting blacks
started in the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Denzel Washington was up for best actor this year for his
tempestuous performance in ''The Hurricane,'' playing middleweight
boxer Rubin Carter, who spent 20 years in prison for a
triple-slaying until a judge overturned the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is one of the few A-list black actors whose status
transcends his skin color, enabling him to attract leading-man
roles in major productions that are normally reserved for white
actors -- such as last year's thriller ''The Bone Collector.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he gets attention at Oscar time traditionally for films
involving black oppression. His only win was for a supporting role
as a runaway slave turned union soldier in ''Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Washington snagged a supporting actor nomination
for the South African civil rights drama ''Cry Freedom.'' A best
actor nomination came for his portrayal of the slain black activist
in ''Malcolm X.''
</P>
<P>
   In the heat of Oscar competition, the makers of ''The
Hurricane'' tried to champion its entertainment value and soften
the political implications. But its political nature was lost on
few people.
</P>
<P>
   Even Carter chose to politicize the movie while promoting it. On
a tour of the nation's prisons, Carter showed the movie to inmates
and championed its story about a flawed criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the producers, this is an entertaining tragedy that draws
us to it. It has that right,'' he said recently. ''But my (story)
has redemptive value that gets us into America's moral crisis
today.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Duncan, who portrayed a childlike giant mistakenly sent
to death row in Depression-era Louisiana, he hopes to use his fame
to follow in Washington's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   With a broad frame that stands at a towering 6-foot-5, Duncan
has made a career playing thugs -- appearing as either a criminal or
a bouncer in at least seven of his 11 films, not counting ''The
Green Mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan said he's eager now to diversify.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't had any problems yet. I mean I've only been acting
for three years. Talk to me in seven more years,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt Unveils Yosemite Plans  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Nearly 95 percent of Yosemite National
Park, more than 704,000 acres, is wilderness. Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt wants more.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt on Monday outlined a long-awaited development plan that
he says will restore and protect the splendor of the park that
stretches along California's eastern flank.
</P>
<P>
   The 500-page draft summary called the Yosemite Valley Plan seeks
to scale back parking, move buildings, remove roads, reduce
campsites and establish a 150-foot wide protected zone along most
of the Merced River.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists say the plan doesn't go far enough.
Others who use the park for recreation fear it will mean
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the plan is a shuttle bus system that would
ferry day visitors in from three expanded lots at the main
entrances, reducing the flow of traffic by 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for converting a portion of a popular road
through the valley into a bike and foot trail and studying for five
years how the valley's habitats are affected by current crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about turning people away from the park,'' Babbitt
said. ''The problem is not that there's too many people. The
problem is there's too many cars.''
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the National Park Service, the plan would be the
culmination of a 20-year battle to reduce human footprints in the
seven-mile long, one-mile wide Yosemite Valley, the main
destination for park visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The process is far from over. Babbitt encouraged supporters and
critics to make their voices heard during the 90-day comment period
beginning April 7.
</P>
<P>
   Set aside in 1890, Yosemite's alpine wilderness, groves of Giant
Sequoias and Yosemite Valley draw nearly 4 million visitors a year
and 7,000 cars on a busy summer day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really think the plan finds an elegant balance between park
protection and visitor use and enjoyment,'' said Jay Watson,
regional director for The Wilderness Society, which played a lead
role in the proposal. ''The Park Service should be applauded for
listening to the public in putting this thing together.''
</P>
<P>
   But other environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, said
the draft report was released too early, before the separate Merced
River Plan has been finalized.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Merced River forms the heart of the valley ... There isn't
a way to evaluate the Yosemite Plan until the river plan is done,''
said Sierra Club spokeswoman Joyce Eden.
</P>
<P>
   The Yosemite draft reflects the somewhat controversial mission
by federal land managers to protect wildlife and habitats --
sometimes at the expense of visitor freedom or by excluding
snowmobiles, jet skis, tour planes and other recreational vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ''They do pollute the environment and just the use of them is
skyrocketing,'' said Elaine Sevy, a park service spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Some recreationalists fear this trend will inevitably lead to
tighter restrictions. Already, a national rule scheduled to go into
effect in April will limit the use of jet skis to 21 of 379 parks.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed legislation last week that will restrict the
amount of scenic air tours above parks, said Destry Jarvis, an
assistant with the Interior Department.
</P>
<P>
   Many parks already have or are considering their own specific
recreational rules. For example, the Grand Canyon already governs
its air traffic and Yellowstone is considering banning snowmobiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess the question we're asking is, 'Is the government
protecting the land for the people or from the people?' said Tom
Barile, chairman of the Sierra Nevada Access, Multiple-Use and
Stewardship Coalition, a group of property owners, off-road vehicle
enthusiasts, horseback riders and loggers. ''People need to
recreate.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Poor Paying Much for Housing  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The economy may be booming, but a new federal
report indicates not everyone is benefiting -- particularly the
working poor who are having an increasingly hard time finding
affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, shows that a record number of working-poor families --
at least 5.4 million of them -- were paying more than half their
income for housing or living in substandard conditions in 1997, the
freshest figures available. That's an increase of 12 percent since
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials released the report to Congress, which is
currently considering a bill that includes $690 million for 120,000
new rental assistance vouchers to be distributed in cities
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is going so well (economically), it's hard to
imagine that we have such a terrible housing shortage,'' HUD
Secretary Andrew Cuomo told reporters Monday. ''But actually the
strong economy is one of the reasons we have a lack of affordable
housing.''
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials said incomes for average Americans are growing at
a rate roughly 30 percent greater than incomes for the poorest
Americans. That, in turn, is driving up rents and home prices from
San Francisco and Seattle to Chicago and Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want the city back,'' Magdalena Mendez said of
suburbanites and others who are moving into pricey condominiums and
rehabbed homes just blocks from the three-unit Chicago building she
must vacate today.
</P>
<P>
   The bank is foreclosing on her landlord. So Mendez -- a
34-year-old salon assistant -- has been trying to find a
three-bedroom apartment for herself and her five children for more
than three months. She is having trouble finding anything for less
than $800 per month in the same neighborhood as her children's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's upsetting to those of us who've always worked and lived
here in the city -- who have an education, who work hard and who
still can't get what we want,'' said Mendez, who paid $350 a month
for her top-floor apartment that she figures could now rent for
$1,000 a month if it's rehabbed. That's more than she makes in a
month.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that gentrification is a new concept. But statistics
show that it is an accelerating one.
</P>
<P>
   Consider San Francisco's Mission District, a working-class,
predominately Hispanic neighborhood that is quickly turning
upscale. In New York, old tenement buildings on Manhattan's Lower
East Side are being converted into luxury units.
</P>
<P>
   HUD researchers have found that the nation is losing low-income
housing units at an increasingly alarming rate -- 400,000 units
between 1993 and 1997, compared with 425,000 between 1985 and 1993.
Officials at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies
also have noted the trend -- one that residents in some
neighborhoods are trying to buck.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our community is kind of the example of the mix of all of
America, and we'd like to keep it that way,'' said Fran Tobin, a
community activist who's fighting to save affordable housing on
Chicago's North Side.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, that is more easily said than done.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Daley administration has made it clear that their focus is
middle and upper-class people,'' Tobin said, referring to Chicago
Mayor Richard Daley. ''I think that's a pretty common attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Smith, a spokeswoman for Chicago's Department of Housing,
disputed that claim, pointing to a $4 million trust fund used to
subsidize low-income renters and their landlords.
</P>
<P>
   But she noted that, like many cities nationwide, Chicago's goal
is to create mixed-income neighborhoods, rather than having large
pockets of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what a healthy city needs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Mendez's ex-husband has taken custody of their
children until she finds a suitable place for them to live. She
plans to live with her two sisters while she seeks apartments and
is almost to the point where she'd take government help if it
becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always thought I wouldn't need it. I don't want to fall into
the system or get trapped,'' said Mendez, who gets some rent help
from her ex-husband. ''But I'm not sure I have a choice anymore.''

<HEADLINE> DreamWorks Finally Wins Best Picture  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hollywood's youngest studio, DreamWorks SKG,
finally has its best-picture Oscar. Ironically, the studio's famous
co-founder didn't earn it.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman director Sam Mendes piloted ''American Beauty'' to five
Oscars rather than one of the world's best-known filmmakers,
DreamWorks co-founder Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the folks at DreamWorks couldn't be happier -- it's been
a tough few years in the entertainment-making business.
</P>
<P>
   ''DreamWorks is about making things that Steven, David or myself
have a passion about,'' said Jeffrey Katzenberg, who co-founded
DreamWorks with Spielberg and music mogul David Geffen. ''It's
about supporting something we believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Academy Awards triumph Sunday was even headier since
DreamWorks was denied the best-picture award a year ago, when
Spielberg's World War II epic ''Saving Private Ryan'' lost to
''Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweetening the victory, the movie beat two best-picture nominees
from Disney and one from Disney-owned Miramax, the distributor of
''Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   With a modest budget of $15 million, ''American Beauty'' has
turned in big profits, topping $108 million domestically. In
addition to best-picture honors, the film also won Oscars for
Mendes, actor Kevin Spacey, screenwriter Alan Ball and
cinematographer Conrad L. Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's triumph was an artistic fulfillment of the promise
that surrounded the formation of DreamWorks in 1994. Yet the
prevailing wisdom in Hollywood is that the studio needs less dream
and more works.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does seem to me to be a mission impossible to start a
studio. Nobody's done it in 50-plus years,'' said Kim Masters,
whose new book ''The Keys to the Kingdom: How Michael Eisner Lost
His Grip'' details DreamWorks' hits and misses.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hollywood's seven long-established major studios, which
have decades of movies and TV shows in the vaults, DreamWorks lacks
a library of titles to help drive revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The studio also has been unable to get production up in the
range of the 15 or 20 films a year that other big distributors
release. DreamWorks released half a dozen movies in 1999, though
this year it plans seven movies out by summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saving Private Ryan'' was a bona fide blockbuster, taking in
$215 million. But Spielberg's first film under the DreamWorks
banner, ''Amistad,'' was a commercial dud, grossing just $44
million.
</P>
<P>
   And Spielberg remains a free agent under his non-exclusive
arrangement with DreamWorks. He continues to pick and choose
potential directing projects under development at rival studios.
</P>
<P>
   Other DreamWorks films also had disappointing runs, including
''The Peacemaker'' and ''Small Soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' asteroid flick ''Deep Impact'' was a hit with $141
million in 1998, though Disney did better a few months later with
its own meteor movie ''Armageddon.'' Likewise, Disney's digitally
animated insect picture ''A Bug's Life'' out-performed DreamWorks'
creepy-crawly movie ''Antz.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg, who shepherded Disney's return to animation mastery
with ''Beauty and the Beast'' and ''The Lion King,'' mustered only
respectable returns for DreamWorks' first animated film, ''The
Prince of Egypt,'' which grossed less than a third of what ''The
Lion King'' took in.
</P>
<P>
   Television production also has languished. The costly ''Ink''
went bust, as did the comedy ''Champs'' and the drama ''High
Incident.'' DreamWorks' one TV success, ''Spin City,'' recently
lost star Michael J. Fox, who quit the series because of his battle
with Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   There has been industry speculation that DreamWorks might look
to merge or otherwise align with a more established studio. Barring
such a move, DreamWorks' long-term viability remains up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''Starting a studio is a very, very daunting proposition,''
Masters said. ''If it ultimately doesn't work, it can be considered
a noble effort. They can say they made some great movies. They can
say they won an Oscar.''

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Bill Limiting Seizures  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New restrictions on the federal government's
ability to seize private property suspected of being linked to
crime are contained in legislation passed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The voice vote in the Senate on Monday sends the asset
forfeiture bill to the House where it has the backing of House
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the legislation is to alter procedures that have
resulted in the seizure of hundreds of millions of dollars in
property, mainly from suspected drug traffickers, but also from
innocent people who have lost their homes, cars and boats.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., will ''protect the
legitimate constitutional rights of American citizens while at the
same time protecting this tremendous asset to law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would shift the burden of proof in asset
forfeiture cases from the property owner, where it now lies, to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   A House version of the bill that passed last June by 375-48
stated that the government must have ''clear and convincing
evidence'' that property is being used in an illegal act.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration said that set too high a bar for federal
prosecutors, and some senators agreed. House and Senate lawmakers
met last week with Attorney General Janet Reno to work out a
compromise that now states the government must make its case ''by a
preponderance of the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill also enables a judge to release property to the owner
if continued government possession poses a substantial hardship,
extends the time a property owner has to challenge a seizure in
court and ends the requirement that a person seeking to recover
property post a bond with the court.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is supported by a broad range of groups, including the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Civil Liberties Union and
the American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 1658.

<HEADLINE> Penn Wants Gene-Therapy Labs Opened  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The University of Pennsylvania has asked
federal regulators to reopen its gene-therapy clinical trials that
were stalled after the death of an Arizona teen-ager last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for Human Gene Therapy said it will establish
procedures to ensure patients recruited for trials meet federal
guidelines and that regulators are promptly informed about research
progress, lead scientist James M. Wilson said in a letter to the
Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The institute ''has done its very best to be completely candid
and thorough in all its communications with the FDA, and we will
continue to do so. We want to focus energy on the future,'' said
the letter quoted by The Philadelphia Inquirer in today's editions.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was in response to a March 3 warning letter from the
FDA, saying the school could not reapply to conduct trials until
corrective actions were taken.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA in January suspended all the university's gene therapy
studies, citing 18 rule violations in the experiment that killed
18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger, the first patient known to have died
as a direct result of a gene therapy experiment, last September.
</P>
<P>
   The university insisted it immediately notified the FDA of
Gelsinger's death, fully cooperated in the ensuing investigation,
and that none of the alleged violations would have changed
Gelsinger's care.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest letter, the university also said it has contracted
with an independent company to monitor the school's gene therapy
program.
</P>
<P>
   FDA spokesman Lawrence Bachorik told the Inquirer that the
agency had not reviewed the latest letter.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani's reaction to police shooting hurts him in polls  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Public Advocate Mark Green this morning called
for a judicial inquiry into Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's release of the
sealed juvenile records of Patrick Dorismond, the unarmed man
killed during a confrontation with police.
</P>
<P>
   In papers prepared for filing in state Supreme Court, Green
asked the court to investigate how Giuliani and Police Commissioner
Howard Safir obtained the sealed records and whether the disclosure
violated the law.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani contends that releasing the information was legal
because Dorismond's death ended his right to privacy. But Green,
the city's No. 2 official and a Democrat, cites legal precedents in
which judges have refused to release sealed Family Court records of
deceased individuals. Giuliani is a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The records that the mayor released showed that Dorismond was
arrested at age 13 for robbery and assault. But the charges were
ultimately dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, 26, a security guard and son of a renowned Haitian
singer, was fatally shot during a confrontation with undercover
cops in a failed drug sting in Manhattan on March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also publicized two other cases in which Dorismond was
charged as an adult for assault and gun possession; he pleaded
guilty to disorderly conduct in both cases. Giuliani has contended
that the criminal records show Dorismond had a propensity for
violent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor's unsympathetic response to the shooting of
Dorismond could change the course of the U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby International poll taken after the slaying shows that
Giuliani's 7-point lead over first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has
vanished and that Clinton now holds a slim 45 percent to 42 percent
advantage. Her lead is within the poll's 4 percentage points margin
of error.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, released Sunday, also shows that the Republican mayor
would receive just 28 percent of the vote in the city he leads,
down from 44 percent three weeks ago. Giuliani has also tumbled in
several key demographic areas, including among upstate voters, Jews
and Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of people said the mayor should have expressed
sympathy to Dorismond's family, and one in four said the issue
would be a factor in whether he or she votes for Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Other polls have shown that Giuliani has as little as 5 percent
support among blacks. Observers believe the mayor's hard-edged
response to the shooting could spark a large turnout of Democrats
in a state in which registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 5 to
3.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's handing her the race,'' pollster John Zogby said. ''It's
not that she's doing better, it's that he's doing worse. We've seen
the tide turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani brushed aside the poll results Monday at a press
conference in Albany: ''I'm not concerned about it at all. I think
that if you've been through tough elections, as I have, you expect
to be up in the polls, you expect to be down in the polls, and you
expect to be statistically tied in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has refused to offer Dorismond's family condolences or
meet with black community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Michel Faulkner, a longtime Giuliani backer, on Monday
condemned the mayor's handling of the case and urged him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an outcry for justice in our city that has gone
unanswered by our mayor,'' the black Baptist pastor said.
</P>
<P>
   Following Dorismond's funeral Saturday in Brooklyn, police
clashed with bottle-throwing protesters. Twenty-three officers were
injured, and 27 civilians were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's death follows three other fatal police shootings of
unarmed black men: Malcolm Ferguson on March 1 while he was fleeing
police in the Bronx; Richard Watson, killed by an officer in
September 1999 after allegedly cheating a cab driver out of his
fare; and Amadou Diallo, who was shot at by undercover officers 41
times in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Giuliani's assertions that the police department is
among the most restrained in the nation when it comes to firing
weapons, a Daily News-New York 1 poll found that 72 percent of
respondents believed ''the use of deadly force has gotten out of
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, 60 percent said federal monitoring of the department is
necessary, an idea that Giuliani strongly opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Republican political consultant Jay Severin said Monday that he
doubts that the 15 percent of undecided voters in the race will
base their votes on the Dorismond shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst thing that's going to come out of this is that
Rudy's going to appear to be tough on crime and Hillary's going to
appear to be too weak on crime,'' he said. ''I don't think the
undecideds are going to vote for someone they perceive as being
weak on crime.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans News Conference  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to hold a press
conference Wednesday and will begin the session by sketching his
agenda for moving several popular initiatives through Congress this
spring, the White House said today.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is pressing the Republican-led Congress for new gun
control laws, an overhaul of the Medicare system, a raise in the
minimum wage and other issues. Clinton and congressional Democrats
hope to use election-year politics to pressure Republicans to
compromise, or risk handing Democrats an election issue for the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   After the question-and-answer session, Clinton plans a
fund-raising trip to South Carolina and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The White House press conference will be Clinton's second this
year. At a session Feb. 15, he took questions on presidential
politics with relish, even as he said he is trying to stay above
the day-to-day political fray.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea To Overhaul Conglomerates  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea will take steps to end the
secretive management style of a handful of rich families that
control the country's biggest conglomerates, the government said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The warning followed a family squabble over leadership of
Hyundai Group, South Korea's largest conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   The feud between two brothers ended Monday when Hyundai's
founder, Chung Ju-yung, endorsed his fifth son to succeed him as
head of the business group.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials said the dispute showed how the
management of a major conglomerate is arbitrarily controlled by the
decision of a single family.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a typical case of abusing an outdated
family-controlled management system,'' said Finance and Economy
Minister Lee Hun-jai.
</P>
<P>
   Ministry officials said the government will launch a
wide-ranging review of ownership structures at the country's major
conglomerates. The review will begin as early as next month, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   A typical South Korean conglomerate, called chaebol, is composed
of dozens of subsidiaries producing a variety of goods.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, these subsidiaries have guaranteed each other's
debt. That has allowed a family with a majority share of a parent
company to control other subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The rights of smaller shareholders were often ignored as these
families shuffled important management posts among themselves and
their followers.
</P>
<P>
   The government urged Hyundai and other conglomerates to
dismantle headquarters offices that the families established
without legal grounds to coordinate management of the subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   If the conglomerates do not heed the warning, the government may
order the country's commercial banks, many of them controlled by
the government, to call in their loans from the heavily indebted
conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's financial crisis left most conglomerates with
large debts. In return for helping them restructure with fresh
loans, the government ordered the conglomerates to slim down and
make their management practices more transparent.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the conglomerates have not obliged.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hyundai dispute, Chung's oldest and fifth sons bickered
over control of the group for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting of dozens of CEOs of group subsidiaries on Monday,
the senior Chung, 84, announced that the fifth son, Chung Mong-hun,
52, will succeed him and represent Hyundai.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chung family did not ask for the views of minority
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, dozens of civic and shareholder activists protested
at Hyundai's headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Dow Slips 3.17; Nasdaq Falls 15.70  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened modestly lower today after Abby
Joseph Cohen, Goldman Sachs's influential chief market strategist,
said clients should reallocate some of their holdings from stock to
cash.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 3.10 at 11,022.75.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 3.17 at 1,520.69, and the Nasdaq composite index
was down 15.70 at 4,942.86.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell at the opening after Cohen pared her firm's
recommended weighting for stocks. Cohen now recommends clients keep
65 percent of their holdings in stock, down from 70 percent
previously. She said clients should put 5 percent of their assets
in cash, up from zero.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Cohen raised her year-end target for the S&AMP;P 500
to 1,575 from 1,525. Cohen also raised her target for the Dow to
12,600 from 12,300.
</P>
<P>
   American Express led the Dow lower, falling 1 3/16 to 149 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, Dell Computer fell 1\ to 56| and Intel fell 1
5/16 to 141].
</P>
<P>
   Also today, the Conference Board reported consumer confidence
weakened in March for the second consecutive month. The report
suggested consumer spending could slow in coming months in the wake
of rising interest rates and soaring oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Confidence Index dropped to 136.7 in March from
140.8 in February and a record 144.7 in January. The decline was
bigger than Wall Street analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 129.22 million
shares, ahead of Monday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.47 to 572.18.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.5 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.6 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
up 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Launches Anti-Polio Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA BRYSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq launched a nationwide polio
vaccination campaign Tuesday, struggling to combat the re-emergence
of a disease it had conquered before the Persian Gulf war and
sanctions undermined its medical and sanitation systems.
</P>
<P>
   Using vaccines purchased under the U.N. oil-for-food program
that allows Iraq to skirt trade sanctions to help its people, the
government planned to target 3.5 million children under the age of
5.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccinations were offered free at state-run clinics across the
country starting Tuesday and ending Saturday. A second round will
be administered over another five days beginning April 25.
</P>
<P>
   At a clinic in a working-class Baghdad neighborhood Tuesday,
parents slung their babies and toddlers onto a cot. Then nurses
held the children's mouths open and trickled in the vaccination
drops, their bitterness in most cases bringing instant tears. Soon,
the clinic was filled with the wails of angry children.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF, which along with the World Health Organization was
helping Iraq in the vaccination campaign, had declared Iraq polio
free in 1990, meaning it had seen no trace of the disease for three
years. Then Iraq invaded Kuwait and precipitated the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   The disease that causes childhood paralysis began to reappear in
the mid-1990s -- last year, 77 cases were diagnosed. UNICEF, as the
United Nations Children's Fund is known, blamed an infrastructure
weakened by both war and international trade sanctions imposed to
punish Iraq for the invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions have pushed millions of Iraqis into poverty and
malnutrition, which affects their ability to fight infectious
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Homemaker Salwa Kazam, who brought her youngest son,
11-month-old Mohammed, to be vaccinated Tuesday, said life was much
different when her oldest son was born 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then, everything was so easy. The sanitation system was
better, everything was better,'' she said. ''Polio vaccinations
then were just a precaution, but there was no serious concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents alerted by an intensive advertising campaign on radio
and television, in newspapers and at mosques in recent weeks
brought their children to the clinic scrubbed and in their best
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Polio is highly infectious. It usually strikes children under 5,
affecting the spinal cord and brain and causing paralysis and
sometimes death.

<HEADLINE> Senate Debates Flag Amendment  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Votes are near in the Senate on proposed
amendments to the Constitution that could make desecrating the U.S.
flag illegal and put limits on contributions to political
campaigns. The Supreme Court has said both are forms of free speech
protected by the Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Late today, the Senate takes up a measure offered by Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., that would give Congress power to set reasonable
limits on the amount of contributions that can be made to a
candidate for federal office.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings wants his provision added to a proposed constitutional
amendment on flag desecration introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah. The flag vote could come Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings said lawmakers have become a ''dignified bunch of
money-raisers'' and that those supporting efforts by Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis., to change
contribution rules are ''getting a free ride voting for it, knowing
it's never going anywhere'' because the bill is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Both are expected to be defeated, Hollings' by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Hatch proposal is likely to mirror the last flag-desecration
vote in the Senate, in 1995, when supporters fell three short of
the two-thirds majority needed to amend the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Debate has been passionate on both sides of both issues, as
opponents argued they seriously undermine the First Amendment's
free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's amendment comprises one sentence: ''Congress shall have
power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a leading critic of campaign
finance limits, said the Hollings provision ''crudely reaches in
and rips the heart right out of the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., made campaign spending reform a
cornerstone of his failed bid for the Republican presidential
nomination. He says his legislative efforts to limit campaign
contributions are constitutional, but Hollings argued that more
fundamental changes in the nation's legal framework are needed.
''This thing is a real disaster,'' he said. ''It's an
embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance-limits opponent McConnell also opposes the flag
amendment. He proposed an alternative under which Congress would
enact a law to establish jail terms and large fines for damaging a
flag with the intent to incite or produce violence. A vote on that
approach also was scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're dealing here with a nonissue,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett
of Utah, one of four Republicans who voted against the amendment in
1995. ''No one is burning the flag in America today in any
discernible numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficult constitutional amendment path was chosen because
the Supreme Court has struck down both flag desecration and
campaign finance laws on First Amendment ground.
</P>
<P>
   The flag amendment has been a Republican priority since the
party gained control of both chambers of Congress in 1995. The
House has achieved the two-thirds majority in votes in 1995, 1997
and again last year. The Senate fell three votes short in 1995 and
hasn't tried again.
</P>
<P>
   A constitutional amendment also needs to be ratified by
three-fourths of state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters acknowledge they are still several votes short, but
the vote will put senators on the record in an election year. The
debate this week coincides with a meeting in Washington of the
American Legion, a primary backer of the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Flag Alliance, a pro-amendment group of 140
veterans and civic groups, said three-fourths of Americans support
a flag amendment and 49 state legislatures -- all but Vermont's --
have passed resolutions urging Congress to pass the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents argued there is no sense in amending the
Constitution, to the possible detriment of free speech, for an act
that rarely occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ''To protect the symbol of freedom at the expense of freedom
itself is backwards to me,'' said Paul Tash, executive editor of
the St. Petersburg Times and chairman of the freedom of information
committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. The real
test of free speech, he said, comes ''when that free speech is
repugnant.''

<HEADLINE> Measles Kills 900 in Afghanistan  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR ZIA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- A measles epidemic that is raging in
northern Afghanistan has claimed more than 900 lives, many of them
children, the World Health Organization said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp rise in the death toll stems from an inability to get
medical help to the remote mountainous areas hardest hit by the
epidemic, said Sahibjan Kakawazi, the WHO information officer in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the deaths have occurred in Afghanistan's northern
Badakhshan province and Samangan provinces and western Herat.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, nearly 600 children have died in Badakhshan
province, 225 miles north of the Afghan capital of Kabul, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ahmed Zia, a public health officer in Badakhshan, put the
death toll at 100. The reason for the discrepancy was not
immediately clear, but the areas are remote and difficult to reach
and information often takes weeks to reach populated centers.
</P>

   In Samangan's Dara-e-Suf district, where fighting between
Taliban and anti-Taliban forces has raged, WHO officials are

<P>
   ''We are rushing in emergency supplies, but often it takes weeks
to deliver medicines on donkeys,'' said Kakawazi.

<HEADLINE> Personality of jurors figures into Ross death penalty case  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- The trials of mass murderers John Wayne
Gacy and Ted Bundy are being reviewed by court officials as jurors
deliberate the fate of serial killer Michael Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas P. Miano and lawyers on both sides Monday discussed
how other states handled their infamous murderers to get ideas
about how to proceed with deliberations in Ross' case.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member jury resumed deliberations today, after listening
again to instructions Miano gave them about the state's death
penalty law.
</P>
<P>
   The jury has been praised for its attentiveness and
intelligence, and also questioned for some of its unusual requests.
Last week, the panel asked for push pins and elastic bands, and
asked for some of their writings to be shredded.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the jury asked how they should consider mitigating
factors in Ross' life that would spare him the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors wanted to know whether a mitigating factor must apply in
all of the killings if a factor is found in one case. Miano
instructed the jury Monday to consider whether mitigating factors
separately for each count.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is trying to decide whether Ross, 40, should get the
death penalty or life in prison for killing four teen-age girls in
eastern Connecticut in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced lawyers not involved in the case say the jury's
behavior shows it is taking its job seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ''A life's on the line and they know it,'' said Norman Pattis, a
criminal defense lawyer in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Ross already is serving two life sentences for killing two other
young women in Windham County.
</P>
<P>
   A key to his defense is his claim that he suffers from sexual
sadism -- a mental disorder that causes violent sexual fantasies and
causes him to take pleasure in harming or humiliating others.
Sexual sadism might be such a mitigating factor that would spare
Ross' life.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have raised the possibility that Ross is faking the
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is made up of three women and nine men. They are an
older panel, with few jurors appearing to be Ross' age or younger.
</P>
<P>
   Miano has praised them for their attentiveness during the trial,
which started Feb. 22. One juror even asked the judge why one
witness was not sworn in the same way the others were.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the jurors are engineers, which has led to speculation
that the jury is going to take its time and be very scientific in
reaching a decision. The requests for different colored markers, an
easel, a flip chart, push pins and other items seem to back up this
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The request for their writings to be shredded at the end of the
day seems to show the jury is also cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tieger, a jury consultant from West Hartford, said nothing
special can be read into the requests, however odd. The jury may
want the items to organize the evidence, such as papers and photos,
or the requests may come from a single juror who has his or her own
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it is unfair to stereotype the engineers on the
jury, although some traits are prevalent with the profession.
</P>
<P>
   ''In general I don't think they're very sympathetic jurors. They
tend to be more analytically thinking jurors, tend not to take
emotions into account,'' Tieger said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said they tend not to buy into psychological defenses,
which could be a problem for Ross' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Pattis said engineers he's seen on juries tend to want a higher
burden of proof than other jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Engineers and scientists in general are not generally
favorably disposed to the burden of proof being less tidy than what
they're used to,'' Pattis said.
</P>
<P>
   In regular criminal trials, the state has the burden of proving
the defendant committed the crime. In death penalty hearings,
however, both sides have a burden of proof, although the defense's
burden is lower than the prosecution's.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
crimes were especially cruel, heinous or depraved.
</P>
<P>
   The defense must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a
mitigating factor exists in Ross' character or background or in the
facts and circumstances of the case.

<HEADLINE> OK Given To Limit Parole Hearings  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today bolstered states'
authority to increase the time between parole hearings for certain
prison inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 decision reversed a federal appeals court ruling that
said Georgia violated inmates' rights by increasing their
punishment when it decided to increase -- from three years to eight
years -- the time between parole hearings for those serving life
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The justices sent the case back to Georgia so a lower court
could reconsider that issue under a standard far easier for state
officials to satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The states must have due flexibility in formulating parole
procedures and addressing problems associated with confinement and
release,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   His opinion relied heavily on a 1995 decision in which the
justices said California could extend from one to three years the
time between prison parole hearings for people convicted of more
than one murder. Other states have taken similar steps in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the Georgia case, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had
ruled that Robert L. Jones' rights were violated when state prison
authorities decided to consider parole requests less frequently
than when he had been imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was sentenced to life in prison in 1974 on a murder
conviction in Fulton County. He escaped, and in 1982 was sentenced
to a second life term for another murder.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his second conviction, state policy was to
consider parole after an inmate served seven years. If parole was
denied, reconsideration was available every three years from then
on.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the Georgia State Board of Pardons decided to require
parole reconsideration hearings once every eight years. After Jones
was denied parole in 1989, a new hearing was scheduled for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court in 1991 decided that the change was an
unconstitutional increase in punishment after the fact. As a
result, Jones was reconsidered for parole at three-year intervals,
being turned down in 1992 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After the Supreme Court's 1995 ruling in the California case,
Georgia officials went back to spacing parole hearings eight years
apart. That's when Jones sued.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the 11th Circuit court's ruling for Jones ''failed
to reveal whether the (policy change) created a significant risk of
increased punishment for (Jones).'' He should get a chance to make
such a showing when the case returns to Georgia, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy said that Jones' criminal history makes it
''difficult to see how the (change) increased the risk of his
serving a longer time ... Yet if such a risk develops, (Jones) may
... seek an earlier review before the 8-year interval runs its
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer joined Kennedy's
opinion. Justice Antonin Scalia joined in the result but filed a
separate opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Justices David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg dissented. In an opinion by Souter, they said the change
adopted by the pardons board made parole harder to get and
therefore violated the Constitution's ban on after-the-fact
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Garner vs. Jones, 99-137.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 60.50; Nasdaq Down 35.99  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today after Abby Joseph Cohen,
Goldman Sachs's influential chief market strategist, said clients
should reallocate some of their holdings from stock to cash.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 60.50 at 11,086.35.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 1.66 at 1,525.52, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 35.99 at 4,922.57.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell at the opening after Cohen pared her firm's
recommended weighting for stocks. Cohen now recommends clients keep
65 percent of their holdings in stock, down from 70 percent
previously. She said clients should put 5 percent of their assets
in cash, up from zero.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that she became bearish; she just became a little
less bullish,'' said Larry Wachtel, market strategist at Prudential
Securities. But in a market that has risen sharply the past few
weeks amid investors' continuing optimism about stocks, Cohen's
shift caused only a brief setback.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Cohen raised her year-end target for the S&AMP;P 500
to 1,575 from 1,525 and her target for the Dow to 12,600 from
12,300. Yet Cohen told clients that many sectors of the market have
risen so steeply that their potential for further gains is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Among those sectors: technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in a decade, our model portfolio is no
longer recommending an overweighted position in technology,'' Cohen
said in a summary of her remarks to clients. ''Many of the
technology shares were given the respect they deserve over the last
18 months, and are no longer undervalued.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, Intel fell 2] to 140 5/16. Yahoo! fell 3 3/16 to
197 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks turned higher on strength from American
Express, up 3{ to 154, and J.P. Morgan, up 2~ to 134.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, the Conference Board reported consumer confidence
weakened in March for the second consecutive month. The report
suggested consumer spending could slow in coming months in the wake
of rising interest rates and soaring oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Confidence Index dropped to 136.7 in March from
140.8 in February and a record 144.7 in January. The decline was
bigger than Wall Street analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 306.79 million
shares, ahead of Monday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.59 to 568.06.

<HEADLINE> Rover Pushes BMW Earnings Lower  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Automaker BMW AG posted a large loss
for 1999 due to the costs of selling its Rover units but its pretax
earnings rose modestly as analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker lost 2.5 billion euros, or $2.4 billion, for 1999
including restructuring costs of 3.1 billion euros, or $3 billion,
related to the sale of Rover's unprofitable passenger car division.
BMW had earned 462 million euros a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Pretax profit, excluding one time charges and gains, rose 4.7
percent to 1.1 billion euros, or $1 billion, last year from 1
billion euros in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must recognize that our Rover products were not as
successful as we had hoped,'' chief executive Joachim Milberg said
Tuesday in announcing 1999 results at a Munich news conference.
''Excluding our losses at Rover, the BMW brands had a successful
year.''
</P>
<P>
   BMW agreed two weeks ago to sell its MG and Rover passenger car
division to British investment group Alchemy Partners Ltd. for
undisclosed terms and its Land Rover division to Ford Motor Co. for
$2.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Details of both agreements are still being hammered out. Some
analysts suspect BMW may even be paying Alchemy to take the
loss-maker off its hands.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts largely expected BMW's loss and applauded its move to
shed Rover, despite the extra costs.
</P>
<P>
   Investors drove BMW shares up 1.84 percent in Frankfurt trading.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you have is a twofold development,'' said Erik Burgold,
an auto analyst with BHF Bank in Frankfurt. ''A strong report for
the BMW brands and a continuing negative development for the Rover
group as a whole. From that point of view there were no big
surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretax profits for BMW brand automobiles surged 5.1 percent to
2.1 billion euros, or $2 billion, in 1999 from 2 billion euros a
year earlier. In contrast, Rover passenger cars' losses widened to
1.2 billion euros, or $1.15 billion, from 250 million euros in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Even Land Rover off-road vehicles, once considered a gem in the
BMW lineup, failed to make a profit in 1999, the company reported,
without giving specific figures.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose 6.6 percent in 1999 to 34.4 billion euros, or $33
billion, up from 32.3 billion euros a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   That included a 12 percent increase in sales of the BMW brand
passenger cars, and a 2 percent increase in revenue from sales of
Rover passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of Rover cars sold dropped 32 percent and profits
were eroded by a strong British pound, which made it more expensive
to build the car in Britain and export it to other countries.

<HEADLINE> Iran Holds Out on Oil Production  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Iran is the only OPEC member holding out
against an agreement to increase petroleum output by as much as 7
percent, the Saudi Arabian oil minister said today as delegates met
privately to try to forge a consensus that could lead to some price
relief for consumers at the gas pumps.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC ministers resumed formal discussions later after failing to
reach agreement Monday on how much crude oil to add to global
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest difference is between the position of Iran and the
rest. Their position is consistent -- that they don't want any
change,'' Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Naimi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Prices on world oil markets fell on a report by Dow Jones
Newswires that quoted an unidentified OPEC delegate as saying the
group has agreed to increase output by 1.7 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts for West Texas Intermediate crude were down 47 cents a
barrel at $27.32 in late morning trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. In London, North Sea Brent was 26 cents lower at $25.42
on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have backed a production increase of 1.5
million to 1.7 million barrels a day. The upper limit of their
proposed increase would amount to about 7 percent more than what
OPEC members agreed to pump after sharply curtailing output last
March.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has proposed boosting daily production by no more than 1.2
million barrels of crude -- an amount that probably would do little
to reduce world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton said he is adopting a
wait-and-see attitude, but is encouraged by OPEC's plans ''in
combination with what some of the non-OPEC members will do.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the aggregate, it could be sufficient to get production and
consumption back in to alignment and to rebuild some of these
stocks, which are at the lowest point in a decade,'' Clinton said.
''And if that happens, then I'll be encouraged. But I want to wait
and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke just prior to a meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, the world's biggest consumer of oil, has gone
to exceptional lengths to lobby the cartel to raise production.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed at the tripling of oil prices during the past 12 months,
the U.S. government has said that an increase of 2 million to 2.5
million barrels per day is needed to replenish depleted inventories
and satisfy growing world demand.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson pressed home the point
when he recently visited eight OPEC countries.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a month, Richardson has also spoken each day by
telephone with oil ministers and top energy officials from OPEC
countries and non-OPEC producers alike, according to a Department
of Energy official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time that the United States has been really
involved'' in OPEC decision-making, said Bill Edwards of
Houston-based Edwards Energy Consultants. ''This time it's the big
power play.''
</P>
<P>
   For global consumers of refined products such as gasoline, much
depends on the efforts by moderates led by Saudi Arabia, OPEC's No.
1 producer, to win Iran over to their point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Naimi suggested that Iran is only willing to back an agreement
that would legitimize the estimated 1.2 million ''unofficial''
barrels that OPEC members are currently pumping each day in excess
of their quotas.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't have a problem with an increase being what actual
production is,'' Naimi said.
</P>
<P>
   An OPEC source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said today
that the group might agree to boost production starting next month
despite Iran's objections.
</P>
<P>
   The source said there are precedents for such an action by a
majority of OPEC members. However, it wasn't immediately clear how
an agreement to boost output would work without Iran's consent.

   OPEC, which normally reaches decisions by consensus, must decide
whether to extend cuts it made in 1998 and 1999 that have propelled
oil prices to their highest levels since the 1991 Gulf War. The
latest round of cuts expires at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah suggested Monday
that political considerations, including U.S. diplomacy, played a
bigger part than economic factors in his country's decision to push
for a comparatively large increase in production.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House of Representatives added to the diplomatic
pressure last week when it passed a bill that would require the
White House to review OPEC's pricing practices and to restrict
military aid to countries found to be fixing petroleum prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's rare that you get the threat of sanctions on Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait -- key Gulf allies -- and discussions that harken back to
1991,'' said Raad Alkadiri, an analyst with The Petroleum Finance
Co., a consultancy headquartered in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC pumps more than 26 million barrels of crude each day, or
about 35 percent of the world's supply. Key non-OPEC producers,
such as Mexico and Norway, have said they are watching to see what
OPEC will do before adjusting their own output.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. oil prices tripled to a March 8 peak of $34.37 per barrel
following OPEC's decision last March to slash production.

<HEADLINE> Meningitis Claims 132 Lives in Niger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIAMEY, Niger (AP) -- A meningitis outbreak in the West African
country of Niger has claimed 132 lives, the government said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Close to 1,200 cases have been reported since early January and
the disease is spreading, Health Minister Assoumane Adamou said in
an appeal for international assistance broadcast on national radio.
He said the deaths are concentrated in three eastern regions,
including the capital, Niamey.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation can be controlled if we have enough funds,''
Adamou said. He said 5 million doses of meningitis vaccine are
needed, but he did not specify how much money the country needs.
</P>
<P>
   Meningitis, an infection of the membranes surrounding the brain
and spinal cord, can be caused by a virus or bacteria. With
treatment, only 1 percent of infected people die. Outbreaks are
common in Niger, one of the world's poorest countries, which
straddles the southern tip of the Sahara desert.
</P>
<P>
   Africa suffered its worst meningitis epidemic in 1996 when more
than 150,000 people -- most of them children -- were infected in
several countries and 16,000 died. Another 16,000 suffered brain
damage or paralysis.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 38.78; Nasdaq Falls 43.08  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today after Abby Joseph Cohen,
Goldman Sachs's influential chief market strategist, recommended
that clients reallocate some of their holdings from stock to cash.
Technology shares, which Cohen singled out as having little room
for further growth, fell.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 38.78 at 11,064.63. Microsoft led the blue-chip
index out of an early decline.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 1.74 at 1,522.12, and the Nasdaq composite index was
off 43.08 at 4,915.48.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell at the opening after Cohen pared her firm's
recommended weighting for stocks. Cohen now recommends clients keep
65 percent of their holdings in stock, down from 70 percent
previously. She said clients should put 5 percent of their assets
in cash, up from zero.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that she became bearish; she just became a little
less bullish,'' said Larry Wachtel, market strategist at Prudential
Securities. But in a market that has risen sharply the past few
weeks amid investors' continuing optimism about stocks, Cohen's
shift caused only a brief setback.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Cohen raised her year-end target for the S&AMP;P 500
to 1,575 from 1,525 and her target for the Dow to 12,600 from
12,300. Yet Cohen told clients that many sectors of the market have
risen so steeply that their potential for further gains is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Among those sectors: technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in a decade, our model portfolio is no
longer recommending an overweighted position in technology,'' Cohen
said in a summary of her remarks to clients. ''Many of the
technology shares were given the respect they deserve over the last
18 months, and are no longer undervalued.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, Intel fell 3{ to 139 3/16. Yahoo! fell 4] to
196].
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks turned higher on strength from American
Express, up 3| to 154[, and J.P. Morgan, up 2 1/16 to 133 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which fell steeply on Monday after the company failed
to appease government antitrust authorities with an offer to
settle, rose 2 5/16 to 106]. Late Monday, lawyers in the case
received word that the judge in the case would postpone his
verdict, allowing for continued negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said trading in Microsoft is likely to be highly
volatile until a settlement is reached or until U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson delivers a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, the Conference Board reported consumer confidence
weakened in March for the second consecutive month. The report
suggested consumer spending could slow in coming months in the wake
of rising interest rates and soaring oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Confidence Index dropped to 136.7 in March from
140.8 in February and a record 144.7 in January. The decline was
bigger than Wall Street analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues and decliners were nearly even on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 306.79 million shares, ahead
of Monday's quiet pace. Breadth was far poorer on the Nasdaq, where
eight stocks fell for every five that rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.77 to 567.88.

<HEADLINE> Electric Utility TXU Pulls Offer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Electric utility TXU says its European unit has
withdrawn its $2.3 billion offer for a Spanish electric utility
because another company has made a higher offer.
</P>
<P>
   TXU Europe made a cash offer on March 13 for Hidroelectrica Del
Cantabrico, Spain's fourth largest energy company.
</P>
<P>
   But TXU decided to withdraw its offer after Union Fenosa,
Spain's third largest utility, made an offer that is about 13
percent higher, Carol Peters, a spokeswoman for Dallas-based TXU,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We aren't willing to match it,'' Peters said. ''We have made a
fair offer. We don't believe it would be a good value for our
customers if we proceed forward.''
</P>
<P>
   TXU would reinstate its offer if Union Fenosa's proposal is not
approved, Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   Hidroelectrica has about 520,000 electricity customers and more
than 115,000 natural gas customers with 1999 sales exceeding 7,600
gigawatt-hours of electricity. It has more than 2,100 megawatts of
installed electric generation capacity with generation market share
of about 7 percent. TXU has worked closely with Hidroelectrica
since 1998, when it bought a 5 percent stake in the company,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   TXU is an electric and natural gas utility that offers other
energy-related services. The company delivers energy to 9 million
customers primarily in Texas, the United Kingdom, continental
Europe and Australia, and has assets valued at more than $40
billion.

<HEADLINE> Ben Stein Does 'Millionaire' Parody  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The music, that relentless heartbeat, may
finally be the thing that drives Ben Stein over the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stop that!'' he shouts. ''This isn't a cardiologist's office.
It's a game show!''
</P>
<P>
   A bit cranky, are we? There's an unmistakable green around the
edges of Comedy Central's spoof of everybody's favorite game show,
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' and we're not talking about the
color of money.
</P>
<P>
   Jealousy was bound to happen. First Alex Trebek went off the
deep end this month, publicly mocking easy questions on
''Millionaire'' and pointing out that emcee Regis Philbin finished
last both times he appeared on the celebrity version of
''Jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Stein opens a few wounds in ''Who Wants to Win Ben Stein's
Money,'' a special version of his own successful game show, ''Win
Ben Stein's Money,'' that premieres Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   Stein bounds on-stage clad in the monochromatic garb that is
Philbin's signature: black shirt, black tie, black jacket, black
trousers. Only the white tennis shoes set him apart.
</P>
<P>
   The first contestant gets a question worth $1. ''Joe,'' Stein
asks. ''What is your first name?''
</P>
<P>
   His choices are Santa, Moesha, Jesus and Joe. He declines a
lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after Joe racks up a few other correct answers, Stein
reminds him how far he's come. ''Joe is $999,800 away from winning
a million dollars,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Jealous, perhaps? Well, sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're jealous of the fact that they get paid so much,'' Stein
said by telephone from California. ''We wish them well -- I'm a
stockholder of (ABC parent) Walt Disney. But we're all sort of in
awe of the fact that for doing something that is basically a lot
easier than what we do, they get paid such tremendous amounts of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes that the success of ''Win Ben Stein's Money,'' on a
much smaller scale, paved the way for ABC to take a chance on ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great show,'' he said. ''Regis is a great guy ... It's
just that we are like the poor relatives coming out of some holler
in the Appalachians seeing that some little invention that we
thought up has made our cousins fantastically rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein's parody follows the rules of his own game show, including
the climactic moment where he challenges the survivor of three
contestants to a 60-second series of brain teasers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to do something Regis would never do,'' he says.
''I'm actually going to become a contestant. Stay tuned! You might
learn something.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein wins handily, as he does roughly three-quarters of the
time. He's asked to identify the British poet who won a Pulitzer
Prize in 1948 (T.S. Eliot), the New England state that annually
celebrates Bennington Battle Day (Vermont) and the Latin name for
Southern Lights (aurora australis). It's not multiple choice, and
no helpful friends are waiting by the phone.
</P>
<P>
   He'd relish a chance to put Philbin or Trebek in the soundproof
booth next to him, doubting they could handle it. ''It's incredibly
hard and stressful,'' Stein said over the phone later.
</P>
<P>
   ''I get paid to do my show every day one-33rd of what Regis
gets,'' he said. ''And I have to answer the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   We're sensing a theme here.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just slaving away in the salt mines,'' he said,
''wondering if we ever will come up for a breath of that rich
network air.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein loves his home at Comedy Central but it is, after all, a
cable channel with a much more limited reach than ABC. In a perfect
world, he'd like the chance to air ''Win Ben Stein's Money'' on a
broadcast network one night a week in addition to the nightly cable
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   He shouldn't hold his breath. Comedy Central, which has Stein
under contract through the end of this year and holds future
options on the show, isn't about to let that happen, spokesman Tony
Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We, in effect, have created this hit,'' Fox said. ''Why would
we want to share it? I understand his point of view, but it doesn't
make business sense for us.''
</P>
<P>
   So the game continues. A contestant on ''Who Wants to Win Ben
Stein's Money'' is asked to identify the well-known Indiana college
where Philbin went to school.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could poll our audience,'' says Stein's sidekick, Jimmy
Kimmel, ''but they're really only good if you ask a drug
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Strings well in the background. The heartbeat sounds again.
Stein whines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can we stop the frickin' music?'' he says.
</P>
<P>

   DAVE'S BACK: This week marks the return of David Letterman to

<HEADLINE> Credit Card Offerings and Pitfalls  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CUNNIFF, AP Business Analyst
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I'm getting more credit-card solicitations than ever before.
While I do not need another credit card, some of the rates and
terms seem attractive. Should I consider them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, some of them are attractive -- those going to the most
credit-worthy customers, many of whom have paid off their accounts
over the past few years and so are eagerly sought after.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, some offers simply must be called exploitive and
sometimes deceptive, and unfortunately they are usually aimed at
those people most in need.
</P>
<P>
   One solicitation, for example, offers what it says is a low
rate, but an asterisk accompanies the percentage. When you find the
explanation you learn that this is the absolute minimum rate, the
base from which future rates will be assigned.
</P>
<P>
   Those future rates will be geared to increases in the prime
lending rate, which right now is on the rise, and likely to
continue rising through this year and possibly beyond.
</P>
<P>
   You could end up paying more than 25 percent on an annual basis,
not just because of increases in the prime lending rate, but
because of what is called an annual membership fee.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, that fee should put you on guard because it amounts
to nearly $100. However, it is deducted from your account in
monthly installments, meaning the credit-card provider -- not you --
has had the use of that money for much or most of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't end there. If you have reached the limit on your
account at the time the provider deducts the installment on your
annual fee you may incur a penalty -- and it will be hefty one.
</P>
<P>
   Late payments? They too are likely to incur a severe charge.
Grace periods? There probably are none. The helping hand that is
offered in the solicitation can become a cold, grasping paw.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest penalty of all in accepting such a card is the
threat to your good name, that is, your credit record. There simply
are too many chances for you to overlook or be late with a payment.
</P>
<P>
   It would be reassuring to believe that only disreputable
companies would be involved in such tactics, but it is not always
so. It's a tough marketplace out there. You must read the details.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are sound credit-card arrangements being offered by
financial institutions that want your long-term business, and will
deal fairly and considerately with you.
</P>
<P>
   So, be patient. One of those offers might come in the mail
tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani's reaction to police shooting hurts him in poll  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's unsympathetic response
to the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man could change
the course of the U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken after the police slaying of 26-year-old Patrick
Dorismond this month found that Giuliani's 7-point lead over first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has vanished. The latest Zogby
International poll indicated that the race about even: 45 percent
favored Clinton and 42 percent backed the mayor, within the poll's
4-point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, released Sunday, also shows that the Republican mayor
would receive just 28 percent of the vote in the city he leads,
down from 44 percent three weeks ago. Giuliani also tumbled in
several key demographic areas, including among upstate voters, Jews
and Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of people said the mayor should have expressed
sympathy to Dorismond's family, and one in four said the issue
would be a factor in whether he or she votes for Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Other polls have shown that Giuliani has as little as 5 percent
support among blacks. Observers believe the mayor's hard-edged
response to the shooting -- in which he has suggested that Dorismond
was responsible for his own death -- could spark a large turnout of
Democrats in a state in which registered Democrats outnumber
Republicans by a ratio of about 5 to 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's handing her the race,'' pollster John Zogby said. ''It's
not that she's doing better, it's that he's doing worse. We've seen
the tide turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, however, brushed aside the poll results Monday at a
news conference in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm absolutely destroyed by it,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Turning serious, he said: ''No. I'm not concerned about it at
all. I think that if you've been through tough elections, as I
have, you expect to be up in the polls, you expect to be down in
the polls, and you expect to be statistically tied in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, a security guard and son of a prominent Haitian
singer, was killed by an undercover officer while trying to hail a
cab March 16 in a failed police drug sting. It is unclear whether
the officer fired by accident.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, Giuliani released Dorismond's criminal
record, including previously sealed information about an arrest
when Dorismond was 13. He has also refused to offer Dorismond's
family condolences and has said he will not meet with the family or
members of the city's black community.
</P>
<P>
   Public Advocate Mark Green called today for a judicial inquiry
into Giuliani's release of the sealed records. In papers prepared
for filing in state Supreme Court, Green asked the court to
investigate how Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir
obtained the sealed records and whether the disclosure violated the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani contends that releasing the information was legal
because Dorismond's death ended his right to privacy. But Green,
the city's No. 2 official and a Democrat, cites legal precedents in
which judges have refused to release sealed Family Court records of
deceased individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton campaign has attempted to use Giuliani's
handling of the Dorismond case to paint the mayor as being too
ill-tempered for the U.S. Senate, Giuliani has stubbornly refused
to soften his stance.
</P>
<P>
   ''No regrets,'' he said Monday. ''I think I handled it
appropriately, appropriate to the situation and appropriate to what
had to be done in order to make sure that the public got
information that the media to this day is still suppressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani complained last week that the media is unable to cover
police shootings fairly.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''I think over the long term people will see that it
was the correct response.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dorismond shooting follows three other fatal police
shootings: Malcolm Ferguson on March 1 while he was fleeing police
in the Bronx; Richard Watson, killed by an officer in September
1999 after allegedly cheating a cab driver out of his fare; and
Amadou Diallo, who was shot at by undercover officers 41 times in
February 1999. Diallo's case resulted in second-degree murder
charges against the officers; all four were acquitted last month.

<HEADLINE> Jury Punishes Tobacco Companies  </HEADLINE>
By MARY ANN LICKTEIG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Leslie Whiteley is a 40-year-old smoker
with lung cancer who has been told by her doctors that she will
probably die this year. She has also won a stinging verdict against
Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   In a 9-3 decision Monday, a Superior Court jury ordered Philip
Morris and R.J. Reynolds to pay $10 million each to Whiteley and
her husband.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed to be the first case the tobacco industry has
lost to someone who began smoking after tobacco companies began
labeling cigarette packs with a government-required warning in the
1960s. In 1966, the labels said smoking ''may be'' hazardous, and
in 1969, the warning was strengthened to say it ''is'' hazardous to
your health.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteley said she started smoking in 1972 at age 13. She smoked
Philip Morris' Marlboros and Reynolds' Camels until 1998, when she
quit shortly before doctors diagnosed small-cell lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Her co-counsel Robert Brown said cigarette package warnings
don't go far enough. They should say that 450,000 people die from
smoking-related illnesses each year and that one of every two
long-term heavy smokers will die that way, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a big level of difference between 'They're not good
for you' and 'You've got a 50 percent chance of dying from one of
several very serious diseases,''' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The same jury awarded the couple $1.7 million in compensatory
damages last week after finding the companies deceived the public
about the dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for both companies said they expected the verdict to
be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the result itself is just contrary to common sense,
and I think that a lot of people -- including (those) not
necessarily on our side -- will see that as well,'' said Michael
York, a lawyer who represents Philip Morris but was not involved in
the Whiteley case.
</P>
<P>
   The industry tends to lose cases where internal documents are
presented to the jury, said Richard Daynard, a law professor at
Northeastern University and chairman of the Tobacco Products
Liability Project, which encourages lawsuits against cigarette
makers.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco jury had access to 950 documents, most of them
internal company papers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where juries have seen the documents and seen what companies
were thinking and doing, versus what they were saying, the jury
says, 'OK, Ms. Whiteley should have been a stronger person, but
she's paying dearly for her weaknesses, and the tobacco companies
are laughing all the way to the bank,''' Daynard said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, juries have awarded damages to individual
smokers only five other times, and three of those verdicts were
overturned on appeal. Companies are appealing the other two, and
have yet to pay any damages.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to believe that the public, including smokers,
have long been aware that smoking has significant and inherent
risks,'' said R.J. Reynolds spokesman Seth Moskowitz. ''And people
who choose to smoke in the face of these known risks should not be
financially rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that the warning labels offered
tobacco companies some protection from damage suits but did not
provide a complete shield. The court said a suit could be based on
evidence that companies defrauded the public or state regulators by
concealing the dangers of smoking. California law barred suits by
individual smokers until 1997.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, Leonard Bove, said after Monday's verdict that he
rejected the warning labels as a defense because the companies
accepted labels only to appease the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The intent was not to warn the end user of a health risk,''
said Bove, a waste-water treatment plant operator. ''The label was
there only because the government made them put it there.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Births Rose 2 Percent in 1998  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Propelled by a strong economy and more women
of childbearing age, total U.S. births rose 2 percent in 1998, the
first increase since 1990, the government reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women who had babies were on their own -- births to
unwed mothers reached an all-time high. But researchers said it
wasn't teen-agers fueling the baby boomlet; it was twenty- and
thirtysomething daughters of baby boomers who had their own kids
but didn't always get married first.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the economy gets better, people have more children,'' said
Dr. Gabriel Escobar, a perinatal researcher with Kaiser Permanente,
a health maintenance organization. ''But most of the increase is
because there are more people entering the childbearing years.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 3.94 million births in 1998, or about 14.6 for every
1,000 people, the report by the National Center for Health
Statistics showed. In 1997, 3.88 million children were born and the
rate of births was slightly lower at 14.5 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The increase was the first since 1990, when 4.1 million children
were born. Between 1990 and 1997, the number of births fell 7
percent as women waited longer to have children and teen births
declined amid the availability of more reliable contraceptives, an
emphasis on abstinence and fears about AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of the 1998 babies were born to unmarried
women, the report said. Some 1.29 million babies were born to
single women in 1998, up 3 percent from the prior year and the
highest number reported since the government started collecting
birth data in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Ventura, the report's lead author, said there are
simply more single women entering childbearing years than there
were in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The report, whose data was compiled from state birth records,
showed 29.2 million women between the ages of 15 and 44 in 1998,
the most recent year for which figures were available. There were
28.6 million women in that age bracket in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look behind the birth numbers you'll see an increase
in the number of unmarried women,'' said Ventura, who expects birth
rates to continue to rise in the years ahead as more children of
baby boomers have their own kids.
</P>
<P>
   Teen birth rates were down 2 percent to 51.1 birth per 1,000
teens -- an 18 percent drop from 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But birth rates for all women in the 20s and 30s was on the
rise. After falling during the 1990s, the birth rate for women
between 20 and 24 -- the principal childbearing ages -- rose 1
percent to 111.2 births per 1,000. The rate for women aged 30 to 34
rose 2 percent to 87.4 births per 1,000 women -- the highest rate
since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings:
</P>
<P>
   --Twin births continued to increase in 1998, rising by 6 percent,
the largest single-year increase in several decades.
</P>
<P>
   --The number of triplets and other multiple births climbed 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   An unprecedented jump in the number of multiple births in the
past two decades is tied to the use of fertility drugs and the
number of older women giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   Older women are more likely to have multiple births and, if they
encounter problems getting pregnant, try fertility treatments.

<HEADLINE> Court Mulls Jury Role in Hate Crimes  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Juries, not judges, should decide whether
crimes are motivated by hate and deserve extra punishment, the
Supreme Court was told Tuesday by the lawyer for a white man who
fired shots into a black family's home.
</P>
<P>
   ''The constitutional safeguards of 'beyond a reasonable doubt'
and a jury are paramount,'' said Joseph D. O'Neill, lawyer for
Charles C. Apprendi Jr., who fired the shots in his New Jersey
neighborhood in 1994. Allowing a judge to impose a longer sentence
based on a lower standard of proof violates the Constitution's
Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury, O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that people who commit crimes
can be given harsher punishment for acting because of prejudice.
Tuesday's case, to be decided by July, asks whether the existence
of prejudice is a question for the judge or jury.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's lawyer, Lisa S. Gochman, told the justices that
motive is a traditional sentencing factor that was properly decided
by the judge in Apprendi's case. Judges can sentence people to
death by finding aggravating factors, and they also can increase
sentences under hate-crime laws, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some justices appeared skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''The difficulty I have is that nowhere have we defined what the
distinction is between an element of the offense (that must be
decided by a jury) and an enhancement factor'' that can be decided
by the judge, said Justice Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter said New Jersey's hate-crime law gives
motive ''a very different role'' than normal by allowing a judge to
increase the maximum allowable sentence by deciding the defendant's
motive was racial prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said, however, that ''in my day as a
sentencing judge'' the rules were much looser. A law might set the
penalty for robbery at one year to life in prison and ''let the
judge decide,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gochman said current laws could be seen as giving defendants
more protection than older laws that gave judges more discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer worried that a ruling for Apprendi
might put in doubt federal sentencing guidelines that allow
numerous findings to be made by judges.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyer Edward C. DuMont, arguing in the
state's support, said states have wide latitude to decide what
counts as an essential element of a crime that must be decided by a
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all states have some type of hate-crime law. The
justices' ruling is expected to affect some other state laws,
although many already require that motive be determined by the
jury.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's law allows defendants to be sentenced to longer
prison terms if they acted with a ''purpose to intimidate'' because
of several factors including race, sex and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi was arrested in December 1994 after firing shots into
the home in his neighborhood in Vineland, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   At first he told police he wanted to send a message to the black
family. Later, he said he had no racial intent but fired into the
house when its purple front door attracted his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi pleaded guilty to a firearm violation and possessing a
bomb in his house, which carried a maximum 10-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors sought an enhanced sentence under the hate-crimes
law. The judge imposed a 12-year term, saying prosecutors showed
that his act was racially motivated. The judge used a lenient legal
standard, saying prosecutors had made that showing by a
''preponderance of the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi appealed, saying the race-bias issue should be decided
by a jury using the highest legal standard -- whether prosecutors
offered proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled against Apprendi and upheld
the sentence.

<HEADLINE> Bush Outlines New Education Plan  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RESTON, Va. (AP) -- George W. Bush laid out a $5 billion plan to
address reading problems in the nation's youngest school students
Tuesday, declaring their illiteracy amounts to a ''national
emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor and presumed Republican presidential nominee
also lined up the endorsement of former rival Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The nod from the millionaire publisher, at an evening rally in
Forbes' home state of New Jersey, could bring Bush some additional
conservative support at the same time he targets women and other
traditional Democratic constituencies with his reading initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls give both Bush and his Democratic rival, Vice
President Al Gore, roughly equal marks on who would do the best job
of improving education.
</P>
<P>
   ''America must confront a national emergency,'' Bush told a
group of Asian-American business people gathered in suburban
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Too many of our children can't read,'' he said. ''Our economy
is the envy of the world; unfortunately, our schools are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal would provide reading instruction for about
900,000 kindergarten and first-grade students. Over time, aides
said, he envisions adding a lesser amount of money to diagnose and
remedy lingering problems with second graders.
</P>
<P>
   Casting himself as a new Republican, Bush even cited the late
Albert Shanker, former head of the American Federation of Teachers,
a union traditionally aligned with Democratic causes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This plan is different. It's different from my opponent. It's
different from the administration. And it's different from those
who would say there is no federal role for education, different
from those who would throw money into schools without reforming
them,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the White House, Gore scoffed that Bush's education
agenda was ''subordinate to his risky tax scheme, which would
actually slash money for education.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, the vice president
said Bush could not pay for his education proposals if he also cut
taxes as proposed, by about $1 trillion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tax-cut plan ''puts a huge cloud over everything that he
says about education,'' Gore told the AP. ''You can't propose an
economic plan that results in devastating, slashing cuts to
education and pretend that you're not doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's new program, dubbed ''Reading First,'' is modeled
after a program begun this year in Texas. It would set the goal of
teaching every American school child to read by the end of the
third grade.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics cited by the Bush campaign, 68 percent
of the fourth graders in the nation's poorest school areas were not
able to read at a basic level in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bush calls for spending $5 million annually to diagnose reading
problems with kindergarten and first-grade students.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $90 million per year would be used to train
teachers to make the diagnosis. The biggest chunk of money -- $900
million annually -- is pegged for literacy programs that would be
designed and implemented locally.
</P>
<P>
   States would have to apply for the money, and it would be
awarded only if they proposed programs that met ''research-based''
standards.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore has proposed spending $115 billion over 10
years to continue President Clinton's program aimed at reducing
class sizes by providing more money to hire teachers. So far, about
30,000 have been hired, with a goal of 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also wants to triple the number of charter schools, make
preschool available to every 4-year-old and expand Head Start.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal here is not to spend the most or cut the most,'' Bush
said. ''The goal is to improve the most.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, the federal government offers Even Start, which
provides literacy training to both preschoolers and their parents.
There also is a literacy component to Head Start, an early
childhood education program, as well as adult literacy training
provided under the Vocational Education Act.
</P>
<P>
   Bush previously outlined plans to spend $5.5 billion over five
years on education reform, although the cornerstone of his approach
is not spending but accountability through locally designed and
administered tests.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposes taking away federal Title I money from poorly
performing schools and giving it to families to help defray the
cost of educating their children elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   School and student testing would start at third grade -- just
after the second-grade cutoff for the new reading program.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday in Pewaukee, Wis., Bush planned to continue
detailing his education initiative with a speech outlining a plan
to recruit, retrain and retain teachers.

<HEADLINE> Ford Subsidiary Joins Nazi-Era Fund  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Ford Motor Co.'s German subsidiary said Tuesday it
will contribute about $13 million to a German fund established to
compensate Nazi-era slave and forced laborers.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidiary, Ford-Werke AG, said in a statement it wants to
make ''a humanitarian contribution to help former forced laborers
who are still alive and others who suffered particular hardship''
under the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was among several corporate giants criticized in recent
months for not joining the $5 billion fund, which is being set up
by the German government and industry to address the needs of
long-neglected Nazi victims.
</P>
<P>
   Under the fund deal, about 240,000 slave laborers -- those who
were put to work in concentration camps and had been expected to
die doing their jobs -- would receive up to $7,500 each. More than 1
million forced laborers, who worked in factories outside camps,
would get up to $2,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   About 780 firms have signed on to the fund, which as of Tuesday
had collected about $1.2 billion in pledges and donations, said
industry foundation spokesman Wolfgang Gibowski. Industry leaders
say they are confident that more companies will join and they will
be able to meet their $2.5 billion share.
</P>
<P>
   In return, German companies have been promised protection from
lawsuits in U.S. courts seeking compensation for Nazi victims.
</P>
<P>
   Ford-Werke was incorporated in Berlin in 1925 and relocated to
Cologne in 1931. Ford has acknowledged that the plant used forced
laborers during the war, when the plant was turning out trucks and
light armored vehicles for the Nazi war machine.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's U.S. headquarters maintains it lost contact
with the plant after Nazi Germany declared war on the United States
and seized Ford-Werke's assets as enemy property. It has denied
claims by victims' lawyers that it profited from the forced labor.

<HEADLINE> Senate Looks At Finance, U.S. Flag  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today rejected a proposed
constitutional amendment giving Congress control over political
contributions. Still pending was another amendment that could make
desecrating the American flag illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Senators voted 67-33 to defeat a measure offered by Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., that would give Congress power to set reasonable
limits on the amount of contributions that can be made to a
candidate for federal office. A two-thirds majority is needed for
constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings wanted his provision added to a proposed amendment on
flag desecration introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. The flag
vote could come later today or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings said lawmakers have become a ''dignified bunch of
money-raisers'' and that those supporting efforts by Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis., to change
contribution rules are ''getting a free ride voting for it, knowing
it's never going anywhere'' because the bill is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The Hatch proposal is likely to mirror the last flag-desecration
vote in the Senate, in 1995, when supporters fell three short of
the two-thirds majority needed to amend the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Debate has been passionate on both sides of both issues, as
opponents argued they seriously undermine the First Amendment's
free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's amendment comprises one sentence: ''Congress shall have
power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a leading critic of campaign
finance limits, said the Hollings provision ''crudely reaches in
and rips the heart right out of the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain made campaign spending reform a cornerstone of his failed
bid for the Republican presidential nomination. He says his
legislative efforts to limit campaign contributions are
constitutional, but Hollings argued that more fundamental changes
in the nation's legal framework are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance-limits opponent McConnell also opposes the flag
amendment. He proposed an alternative under which Congress would
enact a law to establish jail terms and large fines for damaging a
flag with the intent to incite or produce violence. It was defeated
64-36.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're dealing here with a non-issue,'' said Sen. Robert
Bennett of Utah, one of four Republicans who voted against the
amendment in 1995. ''No one is burning the flag in America today in
any discernible numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficult constitutional amendment path was chosen because
the Supreme Court has struck down both flag desecration and
campaign finance laws on First Amendment ground.
</P>
<P>
   The flag amendment has been a Republican priority since the
party gained control of both chambers of Congress in 1995. The
House has achieved the two-thirds majority in votes in 1995, 1997
and again last year. The Senate fell three votes short in 1995 and
hasn't tried again.
</P>
<P>
   A constitutional amendment also needs to be ratified by
three-fourths of state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters acknowledge they are still several votes short, but
the vote will put senators on the record in an election year. The
debate this week coincides with a meeting in Washington of the
American Legion, a primary backer of the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Flag Alliance, a pro-amendment group of 140
veterans and civic groups, said three-fourths of Americans support
a flag amendment and 49 state legislatures -- all but Vermont's --
have passed resolutions urging Congress to pass the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents argued there is no sense in amending the
Constitution, to the possible detriment of free speech, for an act
that rarely occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ''To protect the symbol of freedom at the expense of freedom
itself is backwards to me,'' said Paul Tash, executive editor of
the St. Petersburg Times and chairman of the freedom of information
committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. The real
test of free speech, he said, comes ''when that free speech is
repugnant.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 10.24; Nasdaq Down 61.90  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today after Abby Joseph
Cohen, Goldman Sachs's influential chief market strategist,
recommended that clients reallocate some of their holdings from
stock to cash. Technology shares, which Cohen singled out as having
little room for further growth, fell.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was down 10.24 at 11,015.61.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 3.51 at 1,520.35, and the Nasdaq composite index was
off 61.90 at 4,896.66.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell after Cohen pared her firm's recommended weighting
for stocks. Cohen now recommends clients keep 65 percent of their
holdings in stock, down from 70 percent previously. She said
clients should put 5 percent of their assets in cash, up from zero.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that she became bearish; she just became a little
less bullish,'' said Larry Wachtel, market strategist at Prudential
Securities. But in a market that has risen sharply the past few
weeks amid investors' continuing optimism about stocks, Cohen's
shift was enough to rattle traders somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Cohen raised her year-end target for the S&AMP;P 500
to 1,575 from 1,525 and her target for the Dow to 12,600 from
12,300. Yet Cohen told clients that many sectors of the market have
risen so steeply that their potential for further gains is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Among those sectors: technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in a decade, our model portfolio is no
longer recommending an overweighted position in technology,'' Cohen
said in a summary of her remarks to clients. ''Many of the
technology shares were given the respect they deserve over the last
18 months, and are no longer undervalued.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, Intel fell 6[ to 136 9/16 and Sun Microsystems
fell 2 15/16 to 102 1/16. Yahoo! fell 2 3/16 to 198 9/16, and
Amazon.com slid 2| to 70{.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said her model portfolio carries a slightly higher
exposure to financial stocks, which helped boost Dow components
American Express and J.P. Morgan. American Express gained 3~ to
154] and J.P. Morgan rose 3 7/16 to 134 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which fell steeply on Monday after the company failed
to appease government antitrust authorities with an offer to
settle, rose 1 7/16 to 106{. Late Monday, lawyers in the case
received word that the judge in the case would postpone his
verdict, allowing for continued negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said trading in Microsoft is likely to be highly
volatile until a settlement is reached or until U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson delivers a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices fell as OPEC oil ministers continued their meeting on
production cuts. Airline stocks benefited most, with Delta Airlines
up 2 3/16 to 54 3/16 and UAL Corp., the parent company of United
Airlines, up 3 9/16 to 59[. UAL also released an upbeat profit
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, the Conference Board reported consumer confidence
weakened in March for the second consecutive month. The report
suggested consumer spending could slow in coming months in the wake
of rising interest rates and soaring oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Confidence Index dropped to 136.7 in March from
140.8 in February and a record 144.7 in January. The decline was
bigger than Wall Street analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-8 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 639.19 million
shares, ahead of Monday's quiet pace. Breadth was poorer on the
Nasdaq, where two stocks fell for every one that rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 9.32 to 564.33.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Decides To Endorse Bush  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RESTON, Va. (AP) -- Satisfied that George W. Bush supports
conservative positions, Steve Forbes is endorsing his former
Republican presidential rival.
</P>
<P>
   The millionaire magazine publisher planned to announce his
support Tuesday night during an appearance with the Texas governor
in Manville in Forbes' home state of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Forbes has always been a loyal Republican,'' said adviser
Greg Mueller. ''It's been encouraging that Bush has taken
conservative positions on issues like proposing a tax cut program,
education choice and a medical savings account to help the
uninsured.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller said with Bush heading to New Jersey, Forbes wanted to
make the endorsement in a region where those conservative positions
would ''resonate loudly, not only in New Jersey but in parts of New
England and New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is being challenged for the presidency by Vice President Al
Gore, who himself beat a New Jerseyite -- former Sen. Bill Bradley --
for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' high-water mark in the 2000 primaries was in the leadoff
Iowa caucuses, where his appeal to conservative voters on social
issues brought him a second-place finish behind Bush. He dropped
out of the race on Feb. 10 after finishing third in Delaware -- and
after spending $38 million of his personal fortune on his campaign.
During his first run, in 1996, he had spent $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were nosed out by a landslide,'' he told reporters as he
exited the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was the ninth of ten candidates to drop out of the
Republican race. A little more than a month later, he was followed
by Bush's closest challenger, Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Bush has picked up the endorsements of most of his
former rivals, most prominently former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth
Dole, who has joined Bush on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush team is still hoping for a formal endorsement from
McCain to show complete party unity.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the primary season, the Bush team was concerned about a
challenge from Forbes, who was accused by some fellow Republicans
of weakening the party's 1996 nominee, Bob Dole, with withering TV
ads.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was sharply critical of Bush's five-year, $483 billion
tax plan as well as his allowance for abortion in the case of rape,
incest or endangerment of the mother, but he never mounted the
full-scale assault the Bush team had feared.
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain, ''People in our campaign are continuing to talk
to people in his campaign,'' said Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes.
''We very much appreciated his comments that he would be supporting
the Republican nominee this fall.''

<HEADLINE> Industry Urged To Fight Fatigue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Transportation Safety Board's
chairman asked the transportation industry Tuesday to take the lead
in making sure workers get enough rest.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies have been slow to change rules for hours of
service, so transportation businesses should act on their own to
assure the alertness of drivers, train engineers, pilots and
others, chairman Jim Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall urged businesses to encourage ''strategic napping,'' noting
that no more than 20 to 40 minutes of rest from time to time can
restore alertness.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested installation of data recorders on commercial
vehicles to make sure that drivers observe rest rules and
recommended that businesses restructure work schedules to provide
more time between shifts and more regular schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board has long worried about the problems of drowsy
drivers and pilots and in January urged testing for prescription
painkillers and other drugs in fatal accidents to see if they
contribute to sleepiness.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the National Sleep Foundation released a survey of
1,154 people that concluded Americans don't get enough sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Americans average 6.9 hours of sleep weeknights, the survey
found. Many people reported that both work and recreation keep them
up.
</P>
<P>
   Around 27 percent reported feeling drowsy two or more days a
week, and one in 14 reported having fallen asleep at work at least
once in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   More than half, 51 percent, reported having driven while drowsy,
and 17 percent had fallen asleep at the wheel, according to the
poll, which had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> New Dollar Coin Has Great Start  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The launch of the Sacagawea dollar coin is a
rousing success despite criticism of a $40 million advertising
campaign to promote it, a U.S. Mint official told Congress on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''So popular are these coins that in 14 weeks we will have
produced and shipped more than 500 million Golden Dollars,'' said
John Mitchell, the Mint's deputy director, using another name for
the coin. ''It took 14 years for customer demand to call for that
many Susan B. Anthony dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell spoke at a House hearing that examined the production
of the nation's money and how to protect it from high-tech
counterfeiters.
</P>
<P>
   He said there's been ''projection-busting enthusiasm'' for the
Sacagawea coin since its introduction at the end of January. The
coin depicts the young Shoshone Indian woman who accompanied
explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to the Pacific Ocean
in 1805.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., chairman of the House Banking
Committee's panel on monetary policy, praised the Mint for its
introduction of the coin but said, ''Many others in Congress wished
the release had been handled better.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have complained about the Mint's decision to team with
Wal-Mart, which uses the dollar coins to make change, and about the
expensive ad campaign, which uses a likeness of George Washington
to promote the coins.
</P>
<P>
   Mint officials say the ad campaign is financed from the agency's
profits, not taxpayer revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The Susan B. Anthony -- the last dollar coin introduced -- was a
flop. But Mitchell said the ad campaign and the partnership with
Wal-Mart should drive up interest for people and companies to use
the new coin.
</P>
<P>
   Small banks have had particular trouble getting the new coins.
Last month the Mint and the Federal Reserve took steps to speed up
delivery by shipping the new coins directly by registered mail to
community banks and other small financial institutions, the same
way it sent the coins to Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect that within a few weeks the distribution channels
will catch up to initial demand and the Federal Reserve will be
able to fill all depository institutions' orders for the new dollar
coin,'' said the Louise Roseman, who oversees bank operations and
payment systems for the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said the Mint is working closely with vending machine
makers and transit authorities to encourage them to use the new
coins. But he said casinos haven't shown an interest.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thomas Ferguson, director of the Bureau of Engraving
and Printing, said new high-tech $5 and $10 bills redesigned to
thwart counterfeiters will be available to the public in late May.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Ease Marriage Penalty Tax  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Expanding on a House-passed bill, Senate
Republicans introduced legislation Tuesday that would cut taxes by
$240 billion over 10 years for millions of couples who are paying
Uncle Sam more simply because they are married.
</P>
<P>
   ''Life is not getting cheaper for millions of American
families,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee. ''It's only fair to let them keep more of their
hard-earned money.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax code's ''marriage penalty'' forces an estimated 25
million couples, most of them in two-earner households, to pay
higher income taxes than if they were single. Fixing it is a
priority for Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill and for
President Clinton, but they disagree on how to go about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill is similar in many ways to legislation passed by
the House in February that would cut taxes by $182 billion over 10
years using projected budget surpluses. Clinton, meanwhile, has
threatened to veto the GOP bills and is pushing an alternative that
targets relief to middle- and lower-income couples at a cost of $45
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Clinton called the Senate bill ''bloated.''
</P>
<P>
   Its sharply higher cost is due largely to a $45 billion
provision that would permanently extend a temporary fix ensuring
that people who claim numerous personal tax credits -- such as the
$500 per-child credit -- do not run afoul of the complex alternative
minimum tax. That tax was originally intended to prevent the
wealthy from escaping taxes, but it has begun ensnaring more
middle-income people because it was never indexed for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill mirrors the House bill on other key points:
</P>
<P>
   --Both would eliminate the marriage penalty for couples who take
the standard income tax deduction, beginning in 2001, by raising
the deduction to twice that of single filers. This year, that would
increase the deduction for a married couple filing jointly to
$8,800 from $7,351.
</P>
<P>
   --Both would provide broad-based tax cuts by widening the bottom
15 percent income tax bracket for married couples so that they pay
that rate on their first $52,500 of income, rather than the $43,850
in current law. The Senate version would begin phasing in that
change in 2002, a year earlier than the House.
</P>
<P>
   --Both would address the marriage penalty paid by some low-income
couples who claim the earned income tax credit by raising the
income cutoff for those couples by $2,000 beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Committee will begin considering the bill on
Thursday, with a Senate floor vote tentatively set for mid-April,
Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, addressing the marriage penalty has the twin
political advantages of reinforcing the GOP's image as tax cutters
and as protectors of traditional values such as marriage and
family.
</P>
<P>
   ''The current tax code we have in the United States is at war
with the values of our culture,'' said Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also favor reducing the tax impact on marriage, but
they say the Republican approach would consume far too much of the
projected budget surplus and would also give tax cuts to millions
of couples who now enjoy a marriage bonus -- generally families in
which one spouse is the prime breadwinner.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president has proposed and supports marriage penalty tax
relief, but not a bill that is this bloated and undermines fiscal
discipline,'' said White House spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the Finance Committee were drafting an alternative
aimed squarely at couples who pay the marriage penalty, costing
$160 billion to $180 billion over 10 years, said Sen. Kent Conrad,
D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would use up all the money that's available for tax
relief,'' Conrad said of Republicans. ''If we're going to have an
overall plan that adds up and makes sense, there's got to be some
discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Senate Republicans said they would press ahead and
attempt to build enough momentum to persuade Clinton to sign the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good, simple bill that everyone will get some
benefit from,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.

<HEADLINE> Ireland To House Refugees on Boats  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN (AP) -- Ireland has created an agency to deal with a
growing number of refugees and has decided to house some on vessels
moored at ports, the government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 refugees a month flow into the Irish Republic from
around the world. Thirteen thousand immigrants reached this country
of 3.5 million people in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,700 had applied for asylum between November and last
week -- a rate that indicates some 8,000 would require housing by
year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister John O'Donoghue said a new agency would deal
with the reception of asylum seekers and the integration of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   He said permanent accommodation for 4,000 asylum applicants will
be constructed as soon as possible. Some small hotels will be
purchased, mobile homes would be used and 1,000 people would stay
in ''flotel vessels,'' -- so-called floating hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Using boats to house refugees along the Irish coast is not
unanimously supported, even in Prime Minister Bertie Ahern's
coalition government. Some say refugees living on boats would be
cut off from the rest of the community.
</P>
<P>
   The flotel concept is being resisted by the Irish Refugee
Council. Its chief executive, Peter O'Mahoney, said the council was
aware of the difficulties facing the government, but, ''We do not
see flotels as the solution. They exacerbate the problem by cutting
people off, and will not help.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ahern urged immediate action to reduce problems caused by
the constant arrival of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Mary Harney called the flotels,
''a better alternative than some of the others available.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly can't have people on the street, or tents in the
park, and we have not got an unlimited supply of housing,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Ireland's Office of Public Works recently visited
Norway and the Netherlands to see vessels of the type being
considered.
</P>
<P>
   The government's program for asylum seekers is to provide
housing, three meals a day and $24 per week for each adult.

<HEADLINE> Court Cuts Police Power To Search  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court sharply curtailed police
power to rely on anonymous tips to stop and search people. The
unanimous ruling Tuesday was a victory for civil rights
organizations but a police group said the nation's streets may
become more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The court said Miami police acted unlawfully when in 1995 they
searched and arrested a juvenile for carrying a gun after an
anonymous telephone caller said someone matching his description
had a concealed weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is whether an anonymous tip ... is, without more,
sufficient to justify a police officer's stop and frisk of that
person,'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court. ''We
hold that it is not.''
</P>
<P>
   She said such ''bare-bone tips'' generally do not give police
the reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct needed to justify the
type of stop-and-frisk search the nation's highest court has
allowed for the last 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   The court's unanimity caught some legal experts by surprise.
Over the past two decades, a series of conservative-led rulings
dramatically narrowed protections offered by the Constitution's
Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable police searches and seizures.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a slam-dunk victory for individual rights,'' said
James Tomkovicz, a University of Iowa law professor who represented
the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups in a
friend-of-the-court brief attacking searches based on anonymous
tips.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court made clear it is not going to sacrifice personal
privacy whenever the magic word 'firearm' is mentioned,'' he said.
''That message was made even more emphatic by the fact the court
was unanimous.''
</P>
<P>
   The liberal groups had attracted an unlikely ally -- the National
Rifle Association, whose friend-of-the-court brief had urged the
justices to protect ''the peaceful carrying of a firearm.''
</P>
<P>
   But the National Association of Police Organizations reacted
angrily. ''We are disappointed and, frankly, baffled by the court's
decision,'' said Robert Scully, the group's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a consequence of this ruling, the danger to law enforcement
officers and the general public will significantly increase, and we
fear that more officers and more members of the public will be
assaulted and murdered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Miami case, a youth identified in court records only as
J.L. was arrested as a result of an anonymous tip that three black
youths were standing outside a pawn shop and that the one in a
plaid shirt was carrying a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that the search of J.L. violated his Fourth
Amendment rights and, as a result, the seized gun cannot be used as
evidence against him. The decision upheld a Florida Supreme Court
ruling that had suppressed use of the gun as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg made clear the ruling also covers anonymous tips about
people carrying illegal drugs. But the decision stopped short of
saying whether anonymous tips can spark lawful police searches when
''the danger alleged ... might be so great as to justify a search
even without a showing of reliability.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ginsburg wrote, a report of a person carrying a
bomb would not necessarily be judged by the same standard.
</P>
<P>
   Police also might get more leeway ''where the reasonable
expectation of Fourth Amendment privacy is diminished, such as
airports and schools,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that police found the gun on J.L. held little sway with
the court. ''That the allegation ... turned out to be correct does
not suggest that the officers prior to the frisks had a reasonable
basis for suspecting J.L. of engaging in unlawful conduct,''
Ginsburg said. ''The reasonableness of official suspicion must be
measured by what the officers knew before they conducted their
search.''
</P>
<P>
   Allowing such searches ''would enable any person seeking to
harass another to set in motion an intrusive, embarrassing police
search of the targeted person simply by placing an anonymous
call,'' the court said.

<HEADLINE> Losses continue at Penn Traffic; bosses still say outlook rosy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Even as The Penn Traffic Co.'s losses have
continued to grow, so has company officials' optimism that the
regional grocer is on the right road to fiscal recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported Tuesday that it lost $24.2 million in the
fourth quarter, or $1.21 per share, bringing its losses to $60
million for the 31 weeks since it emerged from bankruptcy
reorganization. The company lost $93.6 million in the fourth
quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Penn Traffic, which operates stores in five states, has now lost
more than $364 million since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, revenues for the fourth quarter -- typically robust
with holiday-season sales -- were down nearly 10 percent from $690.5
million a year ago to $625.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, company officials said revenue comparisons are skewed
because Penn Traffic has closed more than four dozen stores over
the past year as part of its bankruptcy restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   A more disturbing figure was the company's same-store sales --
the barometer by which retailers gauge whether customers are
returning -- which fell 0.7 percent in the quarter ended Jan. 29.
Last quarter, same-store sales rose slightly, the first increase in
return customers since Penn Traffic declared bankruptcy in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, same-store sales were down 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the losses, company leaders said cash flow was stronger
than expected for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pleased with our fourth-quarter financial performance,
notwithstanding slightly negative same-store sales,'' said Joseph
V. Fisher, Penn Traffic's president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have made significant progress during the past year
improving our operations and merchandising. We believe that we are
well positioned to achieve positive same-store sales and solid
earnings growth in fiscal 2001,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Penn Traffic's top financial officer, Martin A. Fox, agreed that
company's financial position was strengthening. He noted that the
company had credit availability totaling more than $140 million and
that its earnings before reorganization expenses and special
charges were subtracted were actually up 25 percent from a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and Fox blamed unseasonably mild winter weather for
hurting grocery sales in the company's fourth quarter. In stormier
weather, they said, shoppers tend to buy more.
</P>
<P>
   Penn Traffic operates 211 stores in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New
York, Vermont and West Virginia under five trade names: P&AMP;C Foods,
Big Bear, Big Bear Plus, Bi-Lo Foods and Quality Markets. It also
is a wholesale food distributor to 85 licensed franchises and 72
independent operators.
</P>
<P>
   The company reorganized under bankruptcy and in a prearranged
plan with creditors, it closed more than four dozen stores and shed
$1.13 billion in debts by selling them majority ownership.
</P>
<P>
   In June, during the second quarter, the company emerged from
bankruptcy and embarked on a $100 million capital program under its
new owners.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Off on Rain News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Forecasts of normal to above-normal rainfall in
the Midwest over the next week sent grain and soybean futures
prices tumbling Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service's six- to 10-day forecast raised
concerns in the market that an extended period of dryness in the
Midwest is ending.
</P>
<P>
   The increased precipitation should give the corn crop a good
start once planting gets underway in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat futures prices fell as conditions for the hard red winter
crop improved. Wheat futures prices also were hurt by the weakness
of corn futures prices.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean futures prices fell as commodity funds liquidated their
holdings in anticipation of a drop in futures prices due to
improving weather.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery was 4} cents lower at $2.49{ a bushel;
May corn was 7{ cents lower at $2.25 a bushel; May oats were 3\
cents lower at $1.18{ a bushel; May soybeans were 5 cents lower at
$5.26{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle and pork futures prices were higher in trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Pork prices were boosted by uncertainty over the impact of
Japan's ban on South Korean pork and beef imports due to suspected
foot-and-mouth fears. The ban could increase demand for U.S.
livestock.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of pork gave a lift to cattle prices.
</P>
<P>
   April live cattle was .12 cent higher at 73.17 cents a pound;
April feeder cattle were .17 cent higher at 84.57 cents a pound;
April hogs were .28 cent higher at 62.95 cents a pound; May pork
bellies were 3 cents higher at 94.85 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Satisfied Bush is conservative, Forbes decides to endorse him  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RESTON, Va. (AP) -- Satisfied that George W. Bush supports
conservative positions, Steve Forbes is endorsing his former
Republican presidential rival.
</P>
<P>
   The millionaire magazine publisher planned to announce his
support Tuesday night during an appearance with the Texas governor
in Manville, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Forbes has always been a loyal Republican,'' said adviser
Greg Mueller. ''It's been encouraging that Bush has taken
conservative positions on issues like proposing a tax cut program,
education choice and a medical savings account to help the
uninsured.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller said with Bush heading to New Jersey, Forbes wanted to
make the endorsement in a region where those conservative positions
would ''resonate loudly, not only in New Jersey but in parts of New
England and New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is being challenged for the presidency by Vice President Al
Gore, who himself beat a New Jerseyan -- former Sen. Bill Bradley --
for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' high-water mark in the 2000 primaries was in the leadoff
Iowa caucuses, where his appeal to conservative voters on social
issues brought him a second-place finish behind Bush. He dropped
out of the race on Feb. 10 after finishing third in Delaware -- and
after spending $38 million of his personal fortune on his campaign.
During his first run, in 1996, he had spent $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were nosed out by a landslide,'' he told reporters as he
exited the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was the ninth of 10 candidates to drop out of the
Republican race. A little more than a month later, he was followed
by Bush's closest challenger, Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Bush has picked up the endorsements of most of his
former rivals, most prominently former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth
Dole, who has joined Bush on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush team is still hoping for a formal endorsement from
McCain to show complete party unity.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the primary season, the Bush team was concerned about a
challenge from Forbes, who was accused by some fellow Republicans
of weakening the party's 1996 nominee, Bob Dole, with withering TV
ads.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was sharply critical of Bush's five-year, $483 billion
tax plan as well as his allowance for abortion in the case of rape,
incest or endangerment of the mother, but he never mounted the
full-scale assault the Bush team had feared.
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain, ''People in our campaign are continuing to talk
to people in his campaign,'' said Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes.
''We very much appreciated his comments that he would be supporting
the Republican nominee this fall.''

<HEADLINE> Gun suit sparks debate at Capitol  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Supporters of municipal lawsuits against
gun manufacturers argued Tuesday that the litigation would make
guns safer, while opponents said such suits actually would cost
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport and other cities around the country are suing gun
makers, seeking to recover the costs of firearms-related deaths and
to force the manufacturers to adopt safety measures such as
gunlocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why shouldn't we employ technology to make guns safer?''
Robert DeCrescenzo, a lawyer representing Bridgeport, asked during
a debate sponsored by the Federalist Society, a group of
conservative and libertarian lawyers and others.
</P>
<P>
   DeCrescenzo, the former mayor of East Hartford, and Gregory
D'Auria, assistant attorney general for the state, squared off
against Yale University law Professor John Lott and Ralph Sherman,
the chairman of Gunsafe, a gun rights group.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and Bridgeport Mayor
Joseph P. Ganim were scheduled to participate but were called to
Washington on gun control matters, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who has researched the effects of gun control laws, said
the lawsuits actually drive up the cost of weapons. That makes it
difficult for poor people -- who are most vulnerable to crime -- to
defend themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My belief is that these suits are going to cost lives,'' Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
   DeCrescenzo said he did not see the benefits of weapons in
Bridgeport, where 412 people were killed by firearms in the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Lott countered that when people successfully defend themselves
with guns but cause no injuries, the incidents receive little
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The debate sparked passionate comments from audience members,
many of whom favored gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what makes a gun safer,'' said Christopher Torino,
indicating his trigger finger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a law-abiding citizen of the United States, not
Zimbabwe,'' said Torino, who wore an American flag necktie.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Sherman said the lawsuits really were aimed at
bankrupting gun makers. DeCrescenzo said proponents were simply
trying to hold manufacturers liable for damages caused by their
product.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the cities' have had mixed success in the courts. Judges
dismissed suits filed by Bridgeport and Cincinnati, but other
judges have allowed suits filed by Atlanta and Chicago to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bridgeport decision is being appealed, DeCrescenzo said.

<HEADLINE> Romanians Suspicious of Police Raids  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Call it the Romanian version of sweeps
week: Scenes of police swarming through marketplaces and smashing
down doors are dominating TV screens across this country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Operation Cleanup,'' which began March 20 and has now ended,
led to the arrests of thousands of suspects on charges ranging from
illegally hawking food and cigarettes to pimping, prostitution and
murder.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown comes after a decade of rising crime since the end
of communist rule, especially in big cities. Corruption has become
more obvious, hand-in-hand with diminished respect for authorities.
</P>
<P>
   But some Romanians wonder whether the show of police strength
was a vote-gaining operation ahead of fall elections. The
five-party governing coalition is trailing in polls and is often
accused of bickering and indecision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crackdown is too late,'' said postman Nicolae Ionita, 33.
He said he believes corruption ''started at the top and is
officially maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   Film crews accompanied police on the raids, helping lead to the
allegations that the operation was mostly for show. Television
footage of officers leaping out of cars to arrest wrongdoers and
kicking down doors to arrest allegedly dangerous suspects has been
aired frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is just a cheap spectacle to trick the voter at the eve of
the electoral campaign,'' the daily newspaper Evenimentul Zilei
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Iosif Panduru of the Bucharest police said Tuesday
that the raids have stopped because of budgetary constraints and
overworked officers.
</P>
<P>
   Panduru said the interior ministry had to pay out an extra
$355,000 during the operation, and police officers worked 12 to 14
hours daily. He said police had apprehended 760 people and were
investigating 650 violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Police claim Bucharest is controlled by 50 ''crime families''
who deal in prostitution, extortion and car theft, but no
statistics to support the claim have been released. That has led to
a degree of skepticism among Romanians, who like others in the
Balkans thrive on conspiracy theories and display deep cynicism to
any statement from those in authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bucharest is hardly under the control of organized crime
rings,'' said human resources manager Ileana Somardolea, 48. ''I
for one am not worried about going out at night. I have traveled to
Madrid and is it more dangerous there.''
</P>
<P>
   However, many feel crime is on the rise. Older people say they
feel Bucharest, a city of 3 million, has gotten less safe in the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ''My friends won't come and see me after 5 p.m.,'' said Sofia
Popescu, 74, returning from the market with mineral water and pork
liver. ''And as for me, I won't get into the elevator with a
stranger any more.''

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Amendment Nixed  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate emphatically rejected a proposed
constitutional amendment Tuesday that would have given Congress
powers to limit campaign spending. The chamber still faced what was
expected to be a much closer vote on amending the Constitution to
protect the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   Senators voted 67-33 against the campaign finance proposal.
Amending the Constitution requires two-thirds majority votes in
both the Senate and House and ratification by three-quarters of the
state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who sponsored the measure, said it
was the only way to root out money's domination of politics.
Efforts to pass laws limiting campaign spending, he said, were
futile because the courts have ruled that political contributions
are a form of free speech and laws that limit them are
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings deplored ''this corruption that we are all into and the
only way it is going to be cleaned up is a constitutional
amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. made campaign finance reform a
keystone of his unsuccessful bid for the GOP presidential
nomination and Vice President Al Gore has also raised the issue as
a priority in his run for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Both contend that reining in campaign spending can be done
constitutionally, as does Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., McCain's
Senate partner on campaign finance reform. Feingold said an
amendment would not get to the heart of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only the enactment of legislation that bans soft money
contributions will make a meaningful difference,'' he said,
referring to the unregulated funds that corporations, unions and
wealthy individuals pour into political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings offered his measure as an addition to the flag
desecration amendment proposed by Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The House last year achieved the necessary two-thirds majority
for the amendment giving Congress the power to prohibit physical
desecration of the flag. The Senate, in its last vote on the
measure in 1995, fell three votes short, and supporters
acknowledged they are still a few votes shy. The final vote is
scheduled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution has been amended only 27 times in the nation's
history, including the 10 articles of the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   As with the campaign finance issue, opponents argued it would be
a mistake to amend the Constitution to put limits on First
Amendment free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   Flag desecration ''is an insensitive and shameful act,'' said
Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill. But the issue, he said, is ''whether we
should narrow the precious freedoms ensured by the First Amendment
for the very first time in our nation's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, at a news conference attended by dozens of American
Legion veterans who have backed the amendment, said that by passing
it ''we will recognize the importance of shared values, under which
certain actions, no matter how beholden to legal nicety, will not
be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who opposes the amendment, proposed
a substitute that would have dealt with flag desecration by
legislative, rather than constitutional means, but it was defeated
64-36.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, in two 5-4 decisions, struck down a Texas
flag desecration law in 1989 and a law passed by Congress in 1990,
arguing they infringed on free speech rights.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> ALS, Gulf War Service Studied  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal study begun Tuesday aims to
determine whether a link exists between military duty during the
Persian Gulf War and Lou Gehrig's disease. If one were proved, some
veterans might find it easier to obtain benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The one-year study involving several agencies will determine
whether amyotrophic lateral sclerosis occurs at a
higher-than-expected rate among Gulf War veterans. Some veterans
have suggested a connection between the disease and the 1990-91
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   If a link were established, Gulf veterans showing symptoms of
the disease could find it easier to qualify for benefits. The
Department of Veterans Affairs currently provides compensation for
8,000 veterans with about a dozen diseases believed associated with
the herbicide Agent Orange, which contains dioxin and was used as a
defoliant during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we do find an elevated risk for development of ALS, the
finding will have broad implications for veterans'' and federal
agencies that serve them, said Dr. John R. Feussner, chief research
and development officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The departments of Defense and Health and Human Services and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also are participating
in the study. It is directed by the Epidemiologic Research and
Information Center at the VA Medical Center in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The VA and the Pentagon have identified 28 patients with
possible ALS among the 697,000 military personnel deployed to the
Gulf during the year after the start of the Desert Shield military
buildup in August 1990. The buildup led to the 1{-month-long Desert
Storm assault by a U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraqi troops from
Kuwait at the end of February 1991.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary review of the 28 cases compared with a national
mortality study indicated no substantial increase in the ALS rate
among Gulf War veterans and no excess deaths from ALS.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers want to hear from veterans diagnosed with ALS or
other motor neuron diseases who were on active duty between Aug. 2,
1990, and July 31, 1991, regardless of location. Those who never
went to the Gulf could be part of a control group for the study,
the VA said.
</P>
<P>
   ALSA, the ALS Association, estimates the prevalence of Gehrig's
disease in the United States at six to eight cases per 100,000
persons.
</P>
<P>
   Feussner said the study could provide ''new knowledge about the
epidemiology of this rare disease and shed light on possible causes
of ALS.''
</P>
<P>
   The study represents a turnaround for the government, said a
researcher conducting a smaller but similar study at the University
of Texas' Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're taking notice of this, which has not been true up to
now,'' said Dr. Robert Haley, whose study of about 60 veterans is
almost complete.
</P>
<P>
   Eligible veterans will be asked to take part in in-home
interviews by research nurses and medical examinations by
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that destroys the brain
and spinal cord nerve cells that control muscle movement. As the
brain and spinal cord motor nerve cells die, muscles weaken and
shrink. Rapid, severe paralysis occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Eligible veterans can call 1-877-342-5257 to discuss
participating in the study. ALSA's information line is
1-800-782-4747. Veterans who have not been diagnosed can learn more
from their local VA centers.

<HEADLINE> Strategist Spurs Stock Tumble  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Abby Joseph Cohen spoke, so Wall Street
listened.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, the famously bullish chief investment strategist at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., recommended Tuesday that her firm's
clients reduce their allocations of stock in favor of some added
cash. The move, which many on Wall Street interpreted as a sign of
flagging optimism, caused a broad decline in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's the best known market guru, and she's been right for a
long time,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential
Securities. ''She represents a major power on Wall Street, and
she's earned her respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen told clients Tuesday morning that Goldman Sachs was
reducing its weighting of stocks in its model portfolio. The firm
now recommends that investors seeking an ''aggressive balanced''
portfolio put 65 percent of their money in stocks, 27 percent in
bonds, 3 percent in commodities and 5 percent in cash. Previously,
Goldman recommended a 70 percent allocation of stocks, with no cash
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the shift was due to concerns that the market's rise
in the past few weeks has left certain sectors with little room to
advance. Chief among them: technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in a decade, our model portfolio is no
longer recommending an overweighted position in technology,'' she
said. ''Many of the technology shares were given the respect they
deserve over the last 18 months, and are no longer undervalued.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Overweight'' means that Goldman's portfolio carries greater
exposure to a sector than the broad Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index.
Cohen held her recommended exposure in technology and
telecommunications stocks to 35 percent of a stock portfolio, while
those sectors represent 42 percent of the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   The sector most overweight, Cohen said, is now financial stocks,
including banks, credit card lenders and insurance companies. Basic
materials companies and energy stocks also have a heavier
representation in her model portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, whose name has become nearly synonymous with the bull
market on Wall Street, said her shift was prompted by market gains
that have already brought major indexes close to her yearend
estimates. Last week, Cohen raised her yearend target for the S&AMP;P
500 to 1,575 from 1,525 and her target for the Dow to 12,600 from
12,300.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is in response to the rise in stock prices,'' she said.
''Our views on the longevity of the current economic and profit
expansion are unchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen expects the S&AMP;P 500 to reach 1,625 within 12 months.

<HEADLINE> Swank Speech Infuriates Brandon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Hilary Swank's Oscar acceptance speech
infuriated JoAnn Brandon, whose daughter was portrayed by Swank in
''Boys Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandon said she objected when the actress thanked ''Brandon
Teena'' -- a name that that Brandon's daughter, Teena Brandon, used
instead of her given name -- and referred to her as a man.
</P>
<P>
   ''That set me off,'' JoAnn Brandon said. ''She should not stand
up there and thank my child. I get tired of people taking credit
for what they don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   As the film recounts, Teena Brandon posed as a man, dated a
woman and then was killed at 21 by two men after they learned her
secret.
</P>
<P>
   JoAnn Brandon criticized the filmmakers for failing to explain
that her daughter was sexually molested by a man as a girl. She
said Teena Brandon began dressing in men's clothing and dating
women.
</P>
<P>
   ''She pretended she was a man so no other man could touch her,''
she said.

<HEADLINE> Expansive Burke collection of Japanese art goes on view at the Met  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A simple earthenware figure crafted thousands of
years ago hints at the Japanese aesthetics of the ages that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   In successive galleries, the evolution unfolds -- seen in more
than 200 breathtaking sculptures, scrolls, screens, woodblock
prints, lacquerware pieces, textiles and ceramics extending into
the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Taken from the biggest and most comprehensive private collection
of Japanese art outside Japan, ''Masterpieces of the Mary Briggs
Burke Collection'' went on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The show, the first major Japanese exhibit the museum has
mounted in a quarter-century, includes pieces ranging from
prehistoric earthenware dating to about 3000 B.C. to dramatic and
brilliantly colored screens of the Edo period, which ended in the
19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing the works, many never before on public display, is a
stroll through the history of Japan itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''The collection is not idiosyncratic like many other
collections in this country. Mrs. Burke likes Japan very, very
much, and she wanted to have the arts representing various aspects
of Japanese culture and various periods. In that sense it is rather
comprehensive,'' said Miyeko Murase, a curator of Japanese art at
the museum who organized the show and wrote its mammoth catalog,
''Bridge of Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Murase worked closely with Burke for more than three decades,
helping her build her collection of about 1,000 masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I walk through the exhibit I feel a flow, a continuum.
That's what all cultures go through, evolution,'' Murase said of
the exhibit, which she arranged chronologically.
</P>
<P>
   An earthenware figure of a girl from around the sixth century,
probably made in eastern Japan, is simplistic and abstracted, with
an expression that seems to vary depending on the position from
which it is viewed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The technique is extremely simple, and I think in that sense
it has a continuum in the 16th and 17th century pottery in the
other room,'' Murase said. ''The Japanese already showed at that
time a sort of feeling for the material, very different from the
Chinese, who tried to make very thin ceramics out of clay. The
Japanese did that, too, but I think they were best in keeping the
natural quality of the clay as is.''
</P>
<P>
   Murase continued: ''You see some of the pots, strange pots,
broken pots that are considered more beautiful than perfect pots.
So that's already shown in those earlier pieces. It's sort of the
artist submitting himself to the dictate of the material rather
than try to conquer the limitations of the material.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the earthenware and ceramic works, the show
includes many masterpiece scrolls and screens, among Burke's
favorite media.
</P>
<P>
   One illustrated Zen scroll stands out. Painted in red, green and
black ink in 1278, the story scroll is perhaps the earliest of its
kind. In 10 sections, each framed by a simple black circle, it
shows how to find Zen truth, which is symbolized by an ox.
</P>
<P>
   ''These became very popular in Japan from the 15th century, 16th
century, but this is the 13th century, and for some reason it was
never shown to the public before. So it's really a debut,'' Murase
said. ''It's remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on public view for the first time is a glittering
gold-painted screen showing elegant women on a bridge throwing
their fans into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very symbolic, but no one really knows what it
symbolizes,'' Murase said. ''It's one of those screens belonging to
the 17th century, and very few screens of that genre or subject
matter survive. It is quite rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke, who keeps her extraordinary collection in her apartment
near the Manhattan museum, did not attend a preview.
</P>
<P>
   From a wealthy family in St. Paul, Minn., Burke became
fascinated by things Japanese at an early age. Her mother, who
traveled to Japan, owned Japanese works of art and built a Japanese
garden.
</P>
<P>
   When Burke moved to New York, she studied art history. In 1954,
she began making frequent trips to Japan. She started her
collection about a year later, after marrying printer Jackson
Burke.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is only a fraction of the collection, but it's wonderful
to see the pieces displayed in public,'' Murase said.
</P>
<P>
   The show will be at the museum through June 25.

<HEADLINE> Senate Nixes Campaign Spend Measure  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate emphatically rejected a proposed
constitutional amendment Tuesday that would have given Congress
powers to limit campaign spending. The chamber still faced what was
expected to be a much closer vote on amending the Constitution to
protect the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   Senators voted 67-33 against the campaign finance proposal.
Amending the Constitution requires two-thirds majority votes in
both the Senate and House and ratification by three-quarters of the
state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who sponsored the measure, said it
was the only way to root out money's domination of politics.
Efforts to pass laws limiting campaign spending, he said, were
futile because the courts have ruled that political contributions
are a form of free speech and laws that limit them are
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings deplored ''this corruption that we are all into and the
only way it is going to be cleaned up is a constitutional
amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. made campaign finance reform a
keystone of his unsuccessful bid for the GOP presidential
nomination and Vice President Al Gore has also raised the issue as
a priority in his run for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Both contend that reining in campaign spending can be done
constitutionally, as does Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., McCain's
Senate partner on campaign finance reform. Feingold said an
amendment would not get to the heart of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only the enactment of legislation that bans soft money
contributions will make a meaningful difference,'' he said,
referring to the unregulated funds that corporations, unions and
wealthy individuals pour into political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings offered his measure as an addition to the flag
desecration amendment proposed by Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The House last year achieved the necessary two-thirds majority
for the amendment giving Congress the power to prohibit physical
desecration of the flag. The Senate, in its last vote on the
measure in 1995, fell three votes short, and supporters
acknowledged they are still a few votes shy. The final vote is
scheduled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution has been amended only 27 times in the nation's
history, including the 10 articles of the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   As with the campaign finance issue, opponents argued it would be
a mistake to amend the Constitution to put limits on First
Amendment free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   Flag desecration ''is an insensitive and shameful act,'' said
Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill. But the issue, he said, is ''whether we
should narrow the precious freedoms ensured by the First Amendment
for the very first time in our nation's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, at a news conference attended by dozens of American
Legion veterans who have backed the amendment, said that by passing
it ''we will recognize the importance of shared values, under which
certain actions, no matter how beholden to legal nicety, will not
be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who opposes the amendment, proposed
a substitute that would have dealt with flag desecration by
legislative, rather than constitutional means, but it was defeated
64-36.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, in two 5-4 decisions, struck down a Texas
flag desecration law in 1989 and a law passed by Congress in 1990,
arguing they infringed on free speech rights.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines President Faces Uproar  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID THURBER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- For a president dedicated to helping
impoverished Filipinos, a nun's accusation that President Joseph
Estrada's family diverted $10.5 million from a fund for financing
health care has been explosive.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Christine Tan made the allegations earlier this month,
saying Estrada's family took money from a government lottery and
used it for their own projects.
</P>
<P>
   Tan, who says she was dropped from the lottery board after she
objected, does not allege the money enriched the Estradas. Most
reportedly went to charitable programs, such as a health project
led by the first lady and about 200 ambulances distributed by
Estrada's oldest son, a town mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the projects were designed to promote the
family's political interests. The ambulances, for example, bear the
name of Estrada's son Jinggoy, who is expected to run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting uproar -- which prompted Estrada to proclaim on
radio that ''there are no thieves in my family'' -- is the latest in
a series of controversies pummeling his 21-month presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointment over Estrada's performance has caused his
approval rating to plummet from 78 percent last June to 31 percent
last month, according to Social Weather Stations, a private
pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Even among the poor, Estrada's most devoted fans during his
previous years as a B-movie action star, the foibles that once
humanized him -- drinking, devotion to dubious friends and a
common-guy image -- are beginning to lose their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The country, which three years ago was on the verge of becoming
an Asian economic ''tiger,'' appears to be losing direction. And
Estrada is widely accused of favoring rich friends and campaign
contributors -- a view he strongly disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the poor Filipinos I work with everyday, life under
Estrada's administration is returning to what it was like 20 years
ago -- with daily worries about food, work and safety,'' said the
Rev. Toru Nishimoto, a Japanese priest who has worked in the
Philippines for nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dramatic reversal for the country, which suffered less
than many of its neighbors in Asia's financial crisis, mainly
because of reforms instituted by Estrada's predecessor, Fidel
Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   As other Asian countries have rebounded, Philippine economic
growth hasn't kept pace, once again putting the country in danger
of being left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Estrada deserves much of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are political doubts, a lack of confidence in the
president,'' said Hugh Young, managing director of Aberdeen Asset
Management Asia Ltd. in Singapore. ''It's very disappointing
because the Philippines has a lot of potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the government's top securities regulator, Perfecto
Yasay, accused Estrada of seeking to have a friend cleared in a
stock price-rigging scandal. Estrada denied the allegations, which
contributed to a 22 percent plunge on Manila's stock exchange since
January.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who was accused of
stealing billions of dollars while in office, few believe Estrada
has been lining his pockets, and most think he sincerely wants to
help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But his government has yet to outline a plan for doing so. Aides
say the president often makes decisions on instinct and is not a
hands-on manager, making the chain of command often unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being president is much more difficult than I expected,''
Estrada said in an interview, adding that he counts the days until
the end of his six-year term ''like a prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   He has begun taking sleeping pills, he said, and has recently
switched from his favorite Johnnie Walker scotch to red wine and
cut back on late-night drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada blames lack of resources, not poor management, for his
government's failure to deliver. He says his declining popularity
is the result of a conspiracy to discredit him by leaders of the
Roman Catholic Church as well as leftist groups and a few
anti-government newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Others around Estrada, however, say the administration
desperately needs to reform.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Estrada fired one of his government's most vocal
reform advocates, Aprodicio Laquian, after Laquian joked to
reporters about the president's drinking.
</P>
<P>
   In a farewell statement, Laquian advised the president to
refrain from granting favors to rich friends who contributed to his
1998 campaign when the traditional Philippine elite refused to
support him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now time to focus the government's attention to
delivering benefits to the poor,'' Laquian said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setbacks, Estrada said he is still optimistic his
administration can succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ''My only consolation is that I was a movie actor,'' he said.
''In the movies, the leading actor is losing for most of the time,
but at the end of the movie he's the winner.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department said Tuesday it is

<HEADLINE> New UN Iraq Coordinator Named  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations named a World Food
Program official Tuesday as its new humanitarian coordinator for
Iraq, replacing a German official who resigned to protest the
effect of sanctions on the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   The new coordinator, Tun Myat of Myanmar, has worked for the
United Nations since 1978 and is currently the director of external
relations at WFP's Rome headquarters, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard
said.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Hans von Sponeck, was the second humanitarian
coordinator in Iraq to quit over the impact of sanctions imposed
after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Denis Halliday of Ireland
quit in 1998, saying he didn't want to be associated with the
suffering of the civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   Von Sponeck made a farewell call to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein on Sunday and said the two had a ''philosophical
discussion'' about the tragedy of sanctions. Saddam invited von
Sponeck to return whenever he wanted and said he appreciated how
the German had spoken out about sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeping U.N. sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons
inspectors report Iraq is free of its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Von Sponeck announced his resignation effective March 31. His
successor will take up the position April 1, Eckhard said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 89.12; Nasdaq Falls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled today after Abby Joseph Cohen,
one of Wall Street's most famously bullish analysts, recommended
that clients shift some of their investments from stock to cash.
Technology shares, which Cohen singled out as having little room
for further growth, led the decline.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 89.12 to close at
10,936.73.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 16.08 to 1,507.78, and the Nasdaq
composite index fell 124.31 to 4,834.25.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,681 down, 1,352 up and 462
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 947.98 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.
876.27 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 12.46 at
561.19. Cohen, the chief market strategist for Goldman Sachs, set
the tone for the selloff after she pared her firm's recommended
weighting for stocks. Cohen now recommends clients keep 65 percent
of their holdings in stock, down from 70 percent previously. She
said clients should put 5 percent of their assets in cash, up from
zero.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that she became bearish; she just became a little
less bullish,'' said Larry Wachtel, market strategist at Prudential
Securities. ''In a market as extended as this, that's all it takes
to cause a little shakeout.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Cohen raised her yearend target for the S&AMP;P 500
to 1,575 from 1,525. Ultimately, she expects the index to rise 8 to
10 percent for the year 2000, down from a return of more than 19
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Because stocks are expected to yield more muted gains, Cohen
said, investors may want to trim their exposure to what she
described as ''normal weights.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen added that certain sectors of the market have risen so
steeply that their potential for further gains is limited. She
singled out technology, prompting widespread selling in computer
and Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in a decade, our model portfolio is no
longer recommending an overweighted position in technology,'' Cohen
said in a summary of her remarks to clients. ''Many of the
technology shares were given the respect they deserve over the last
18 months, and are no longer undervalued.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, Intel and Sun Microsystems fell. Yahoo! and
Amazon.com also slid.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said her model portfolio carries a slightly higher
exposure to financial stocks, which helped boost Dow components
American Express and J.P. Morgan. American Express and J.P. Morgan
were higher.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which fell steeply on Monday after the company failed
to appease government antitrust authorities with an offer to
settle, rose. Late Monday, lawyers in the case received word that
the judge in the case would postpone his verdict, allowing for
continued negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said trading in Microsoft is likely to be highly
volatile until a settlement is reached or until U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson delivers a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices fell as OPEC oil ministers continued their meeting on
production cuts. Airline stocks benefited most, with Delta Airlines
and UAL Corp., the parent company of United Airlines, up. UAL also
released an upbeat profit forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, the Conference Board reported consumer confidence
weakened in March for the second consecutive month. The report
suggested consumer spending could slow in coming months in the wake
of rising interest rates and soaring oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Confidence Index dropped to 136.7 in March from
140.8 in February and a record 144.7 in January. The decline was
bigger than Wall Street analysts had expected, but failed to
appease economists who expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates
again later this year in a continued effort to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any worries about rising interest rates and higher gasoline
prices appear to be more than offset by growing confidence about
current job and income prospects,'' said Mark Vitner, economist at
First Union Corp.

<HEADLINE> Cohen To Raise Oil Issue in Mideast  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen, on a trip to
the Middle East next week, will reinforce the Clinton
administration's call for increased oil production to bring down
fuel prices, Cohen's spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen will raise the subject of spiraling energy prices when he

spokesman Kenneth Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an issue of national concern -- the higher energy
prices,'' Bacon said. ''The secretary will be expressing our
national view, which is, we want them to increase oil production,
which should lead to a decrease in oil prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher fuel prices already are taking a toll on the Pentagon's
budget. A proposed $9 billion addition to the current fiscal 2000
budget includes $1.6 billion to cover fuel price increases, Bacon
said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday
approved sale of the drug Zonegran as an additional therapy for
epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   On sale in Japan for a decade, the capsules are intended for
adults whose partial seizures are not fully controlled by a single
drug, according to Elan Corp., which will market the drug in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the drug could be on sale as soon as next week.
</P>
<P>
   More than two million people have epilepsy in the United States
and estimates of the number whose seizures are not fully controlled
range from one-third to more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In clinical trials of the drug, side effects included fatigue,
dizziness, loss of appetite, headache, nausea and irritability.
Most effects were mild or moderate.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITTING to make slug conform with advisory  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Two Connecticut inmates who were shipped
to a Virginia prison were injured after guards shot them with
rubber bullets, a Connecticut lawmaker said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Lawlor, D-East Haven, said the inmates were shot
while fighting each other Monday night at Wallens Ridge State
Prison in Big Stone Gap, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Department of Correction spokeswoman Christina Polce
said her department had been informed of ''an incident in
Virginia,'' but refused to elaborate. Polce said the DOC is
investigating the incident with Virginia corrections officials.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Traylor, a spokesman for the Virginia Department of
Corrections, confirmed that two inmates were shot with rubber
bullets. He refused to say who the inmates were or where they were
from. He also would not give details of their injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were treated in our infirmary and have been charged with
fighting in prison,'' Traylor said. ''Their injuries certainly were
not life-threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   When a fight broke out between two inmates at about 8 p.m.
Monday, prison guards yelled a warning to them, Traylor said. The
inmates continued to fight and a guard fired a blank warning shot
from a shotgun, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After another verbal warning failed to stop the scuffle, the
inmates were shot in the ''lower extremities'' with so-called
stinger rounds -- hard, rubber balls about 1/3 of an inch in
diameter, Traylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The corrections officers acted within our policy and were
completely within procedure,'' Traylor said. ''We are dealing with
adults, and adults know the rules. These adults did not obey the
rules, and they suffered the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Traylor said the inmates will be in solitary confinement until
an investigation is completed. He did not say how long that would
take.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Westberg of West Haven said her son Daniel was one of the
wounded inmates. She said two rubber bullets hit him in the back
near his heart. Westberg said her son called her Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those jerks just fired their 12-gauge shotguns at him,''
Westberg said. ''He was on the floor and didn't get medical
treatment for an hour and a half. I'm afraid he's going to come
home in a body bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Since October, 480 prisoners have been moved to Wallens Ridge.
Gov. John G. Rowland and corrections officials say the transfers
ease overcrowding in Connecticut prisons. They also save money
because the per-inmate cost is lower at the Virginia prison,
administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's contract with Virginia allows 500 inmates to be
housed at Wallens Ridge for $11 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have accused guards at the Virginia prison of
racial intolerance, and the FBI is investigating allegations of
abuse made by New Mexico inmates who were shipped to the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoner advocates and friends and family members of the inmates
call the transfers unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Lawlor, who says prison overcrowding could be eased if the state
put some inmates in treatment facilities instead of prisons, said
the shootings are another reason why the transfers are a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very extraordinary stuff,'' Lawlor said. ''It would
never happen in Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said Connecticut could be held liable for the inmates'
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut DOC guards do not carry guns or other weapons, Polce
said.
</P>
<P>
   If a fight breaks out, supervisory guards are allowed to use a
chemical spray such as Mace to break it up, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know what the standard operating procedure is at Wallens
Ridge, and our inmates are advised about their rules when they get
there,'' Polce said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Questions Medicare Payments  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators are wondering whether Medicare
officials did enough to recover disputed payments made to some
health care providers during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''These matters ... are not just procedural. We're talking about
millions of dollars here,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.,
chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing of the panel's investigations subcommittee examined a
General Accounting Office report Tuesday that alleges mishandling
of large settlement deals with three health care providers in New
York and California. The GAO is Congress' investigative arm.
</P>
<P>
   In total, $332 million in Medicare payments were involved in the
disputes, the largest Medicare settled without litigation between
1991 and 1999. In the settlements, Medicare got $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   Former Medicare administrator Bruce Vladeck, who ran the program
until he left to take a private job in 1997, denied mishandling the
settlements. ''I do not believe the providers think they received
sweetheart deals,'' Vladeck said.
</P>
<P>
   A day before the hearing, the current administrator of the
health insurance program for the elderly, Nancy-Ann DeParle, gave
new guidance to Medicare employees clarifying procedures expected
when provider payments are disputed.
</P>
<P>
   It said only Medicare's chief and deputy financial officers will
be authorized to approve any compromise on or termination of debt
collections. Medicare also will no longer agree to keep settlements
with providers confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO's acting assistant comptroller general, Robert Hast,
reported that in one instance, Vladeck asked a subordinate for
quick settlement of a dispute with the Visiting Nurse Service of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare's billing contractors had determined the nonprofit home
health care agency charged too much per visit, based on industry
standards. That resulted in $98 million in Medicare overpayments,
they estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Hast said investigators found no illegality in the resulting
settlement in 1995, in which Medicare recovered $67 million. It is
not unusual for the program to win only a fraction of disputed
payments.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hast had several problems, including that the
settlement was never reviewed by a government lawyer and contained
a confidentiality clause that, if not unprecedented, was unusual.
He also noted that before becoming Medicare administrator, Vladeck
had acted as a volunteer member of an advisory board for the home
care agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Evidence suggests that ... (Medicare) would have prevailed for
the entire amount had the matter been litigated,'' Hast concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Vladeck denied mishandling the situation. He
said he requested quick resolution of the complex dispute out of
concern for VNS's ability to continue caring for its Medicare
patients. And, he said, he was not subsequently involved in
negotiating the settlement and was not aware that Medicare's
attorneys were not consulted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not direct the staff to come up with a particular
result,'' Vladeck said.

<HEADLINE> Strategist Sends Stocks Tumbling  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Abby Joseph Cohen spoke, so Wall Street
listened.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, the famously bullish chief investment strategist at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., recommended Tuesday that her firm's
clients reduce their allocations of stock in favor of some added
cash. The move, which many on Wall Street interpreted as a sign of
flagging optimism, caused a broad decline in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's the best known market guru, and she's been right for a
long time,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential
Securities. ''She represents a major power on Wall Street, and
she's earned her respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen told clients Tuesday morning that Goldman Sachs was
reducing its weighting of stocks in its model portfolio. The firm
now recommends that investors seeking an ''aggressive balanced''
portfolio put 65 percent of their money in stocks, 27 percent in
bonds, 3 percent in commodities and 5 percent in cash. Previously,
Goldman recommended a 70 percent allocation of stocks, with no cash
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's shift sparked selling from the start of Tuesday's
session. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 89.74 to close at
10,936.11, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 16.13 to 1,507.73 and the
Nasdaq composite index fell 124.56 to 4,834.00.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the shift was due to concerns that the market's rise
in the past few weeks has left certain sectors with little room to
advance. Chief among them: technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in a decade, our model portfolio is no
longer recommending an overweighted position in technology,'' she
said. ''Many of the technology shares were given the respect they
deserve over the last 18 months, and are no longer undervalued.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Overweight'' means that Goldman's portfolio carries greater
exposure to a sector than the broad Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index.
Cohen held her recommended exposure in technology and
telecommunications stocks to 35 percent of a stock portfolio, while
those sectors represent 42 percent of the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   The sector most overweight, Cohen said, is now financial stocks,
including banks, credit card lenders and insurance companies. Basic
materials companies and energy stocks also have a heavier
representation in her model portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, whose name has become nearly synonymous with the bull
market on Wall Street, said her shift was prompted by market gains
that have already brought major indexes close to her yearend
estimates. Last week, Cohen raised her yearend target for the S&AMP;P
500 to 1,575 from 1,525 and her target for the Dow to 12,600 from
12,300.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is in response to the rise in stock prices,'' she said.
''Our views on the longevity of the current economic and profit
expansion are unchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen expects the S&AMP;P 500 to reach 1,625 within 12 months.

<HEADLINE> Pub Owner Defends Stuffed Monkeys  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE LeBLANC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Stuffed monkeys that adorn a south Boston bar each
winter are not intended as a mockery of Black History Month, the
bar owner's told a licensing board Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason I put it up is because it's the dead of winter.
People are sick of winter and want to go into a bar with a tropical
flair,'' Tom English said. ''It makes it more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Licensing Board's investigation began after a
bartender at Tom English's Cottage told the Boston Herald last
month that the roughly 20 stuffed monkeys were meant to symbolize
Black History Month.
</P>
<P>
   The board, which may issue a ruling by Thursday, can suspend or
revoke licenses if an establishment is found to display
''offensive'' signs or images or attempts to prevent access based
on race.
</P>
<P>
   Two bartenders employed at the bar told the board they never
heard the display referred to in racial terms, either by employees
or by patrons.
</P>
<P>
   The board heard no testimony from anyone who said they made or
heard racist comments concerning the display.
</P>
<P>
   Board Chairman Daniel Pokaski criticized the Herald for refusing
to publish the name of the bartender who reportedly made the
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (the Herald) threw a grenade and we're here stuck
smothering the blast,'' Pokaski said.
</P>
<P>
   David Wedge, the Herald reporter who wrote the story, attended
the hearing but refused to testify. Wedge said the paper did not
know the name of the bartender when the story ran, but has since
learned the identity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're standing by the facts of the story,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Activists Demonstrate Vs. S. Arabia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Human rights activists protested near the
Saudi embassy on Tuesday to bring attention to alleged human rights
violations in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   For three hours 30 activists handed out candy and held a series
of signs that read, in part ''Liquor flavored sweets, such lovely
treats; bring some back from vacation unless Saudi is your
destination...''
</P>
<P>
   According to Amnesty, Faustino Salazar, a guest worker in Saudi
Arabia, was arrested and sentenced with 75 lashes and four months
in prison for possessing liquored chocolates. Possession of alcohol
is illegal in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The organization also publicized what they call ''the
brutalities of the Saudi justice system'' with a truck-based
billboard traveling between the Saudi embassy, State Department and
other points throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International, the world's largest human rights
organization, is launching a six-month worldwide campaign against
Saudi Arabia. The group called on the Saudi government to abolish
discriminatory laws and practices against women, minorities, and
vulnerable groups; stop arbitrary arrest and detention, torture,
and executions and ratify international human rights treaties.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Pierre Sane, AI's secretary general will raise
some of these concerns with the United Nations Commission on Human
Rights in Geneva, which has yet to publicly address the serious
human rights situation in Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Pox Vaccine May Make Booster  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The widely used chicken-pox vaccine seems to
reactivate itself when an individual's immunity lessens, possibly
creating its own booster mechanism, researchers have discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine, called Oka, was licensed in 1995 and millions of
children receive it every year. It is made from a weakened live
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Like all vaccines, Oka provokes an immune response from the
patient, preparing the body's defenses to fight in case of
infection with the wild form of the virus. When the wild virus
later attacks, the body is prepared to respond quickly by boosting
the anti-virus material in the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Food and Drug Administration did a four-year
study of 4,631 children aged one to 13 who had received the vaccine
against the chicken pox virus, known as varicella zoster.
</P>
<P>
   Their findings are reported in the April edition of the journal
Nature Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine establishes a lifelong latent infection, explained
Dr. Dennis N. Klinman of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and
Research.
</P>
<P>
   ''A latent infection is not like an ongoing illness, it's just
that the virus is never completely cleared from the body,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Because the virus is weakened it doesn't cause disease and no
symptoms were reported when it reactivated in the children, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found 508 cases in which the antibodies in the
youngsters' blood increased 400 percent or more from one year to
the next.
</P>
<P>
   Such a jump would occur if children were exposed to the wild
virus, but the rate of increase is several times higher than would
have been expected to occur, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   They determined that the increases occurred when the children's
resistance to the disease had declined and the latent virus from
the vaccine reactivated, causing the body to boost its defensive
network.
</P>
<P>
   When the body's resistance is high it keeps both the natural and
latent Oka virus in check, Klinman said. When it falls to a lower
level the latent virus reactivates. ''You don't get sick, but it
reactivates your immune system.''
</P>
<P>
   The stronger natural form of the chicken pox virus also remains
in the body permanently once the symptoms of the disease have
passed, usually taking residence in nerve fibers. Years later it
can reactivate, particularly in people with reduced immunity,
causing a painful skin disease called shingles.
</P>
<P>
   Klinman said no cases of shingles were found in the youths
studied.

<HEADLINE> Athens, D.C. Mayors Sign Pact  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The mayor of Athens came to Washington to
forge closer ties between the capital of Greece and the U.S.
capital. He also learned a new concept -- the American pothole.
</P>
<P>
   Potholes are unknown in Athens, Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos said
Tuesday. He didn't even know the word -- he jotted it down over
breakfast at the Greek Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   But except for that -- a study last week showed that more than
three-fourths of Washington-area roads are no better than fair --
Avramopoulos said the two cities have similar traffic and other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Avramopoulos, a former diplomat and member of the Greek
parliament, is on the trip as part of a budding ''united cities of
the world'' program. On Monday, he and Washington Mayor Anthony
Williams signed an agreement to exchange experts on urban programs
and to step up business and cultural ties.
</P>
<P>
   The program began in 1995 and got a boost when Turkey and Greece
suffered back-to-back earthquakes last November. Cities in each
country provided assistance to cities in the other, ignoring an
often-bitter history.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new international globalization is encouraging us,''
Avramopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
   In an otherwise sunny discourse, the mayor grumbled a bit that
of the 12 million tourists who visit Greece each year, 4 million
bypass Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Avramopoulos wants to fix that, and one way he intends to do it
is to link his city with the dozen or so Athenses in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   With Athens, Greece, chosen as the site for the Olympic Games in
the summer of 2004, the mayor can look forward to that boost, as
well. He marveled at what the 1992 Olympics did for Barcelona in
southeastern Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are under way for a cultural Olympics to start in Athens
after this summer's Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Once known for its pollution, congestion and a rarity of parking
spaces matched only by a rarity of parks, Athens is changing fast,
the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-pollution campaign that began a decade ago has helped.
So have tough restrictions on double-parking. And Avramopoulos has
promoted pedestrian zones and green spaces. Extension of the subway
promises to ease gridlock on Athens' roads.

<HEADLINE> Orthodox Jew sentenced in designer drug import scheme  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Taking Brooklyn's ultra-Orthodox Jewish
community to task, a judge sentenced a young Hasidic man Tuesday to
2{ years in federal custody for recruiting Ecstasy smugglers in an
international drug ring that exploited their pious looks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where was the community when all of this was going on?'' U.S.
District Judge Leo Glasser asked in a Brooklyn courtroom packed
with supporters of the defendant, Shimon Levita. ''Who was keeping
tabs on 18-year-olds who were flying drugs back (from Europe) and
taking money there?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his comments, Glasser gave Levita a break. The
18-year-old had faced up to 15{ years in prison after pleading
guilty to conspiring with six others to import millions of the
pills.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was raised in a real Orthodox religious home,'' Levita told
the judge while asking for mercy. Before joining the conspiracy, he
added, ''I didn't know what drugs were.''
</P>
<P>
   Glasser called the term -- which starts with 6 months in a boot
camp -- ''extremely lenient given the enormity of the acts in which
you were engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, one supporter, Jacob Friedman, said, ''I hope the
whole community takes this as a warning to be on the lookout to
help these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Levita was swept up in a burgeoning trade in
Ecstasy, a synthetic ''designer drug'' dealt to young customers on
college campuses, in dance clubs and elsewhere, authorities said.
Last year, U.S. Customs seized 1.3 million pills from smugglers
entering the New York City area; only about 48,000 were seized in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The pills -- which combine the effects of hallucinogens and
stimulants -- typically are made in Amsterdam for 50 cents to $2
apiece, then sold in New York for $25 to $30, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   There are few reports of Ecstasy use in Brooklyn's Orthodox
neighborhoods. But several Hasidic men have been arrested in recent
months for allegedly trying to cash in on the designer drug boom,
sometimes under the direction of Israeli organized crime groups.
</P>
<P>
   In January, federal authorities charged a Jewish businessman and
four others with conspiring to sell 180,000 Ecstasy pills for about
$1.5 million to an FBI informant, then laundering illicit proceeds
through a Brooklyn religious school.
</P>
<P>
   Levita was named in an indictment describing an Amsterdam-based
trafficking operation headed by Sean Erez. Authorities say Erez
began recruiting couriers from Hasidic enclaves in Brooklyn and
Monsey, N.Y., with the help of Levita in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Erez believed the young men -- with their black hats, dark suits
and sidecurls -- would deflect the suspicions of customs inspectors,
authorities said. They were promised a free trip to Europe and
about $1,500 if they agreed to retrieve packages in cities like
Brussels and Frankfurt; Levita was paid $2,000 per recruit.
</P>
<P>
   The couriers were told they were carrying diamonds. But
authorities say they ignored obvious signs that each shipment
consisted of 30,000 to 45,000 pills destined for sale in New York
City and Miami Beach. The also allegedly smuggled proceeds back to
Amsterdam in suitcases holding as much as $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Police Department, Drug Enforcement Administration
and U.S. Customs had been investigating the case since last
October. A break came when Dutch authorities turned over tapes of
wiretaps on Erez's phones, which revealed conversations with Levita
and others.
</P>
<P>
   When authorities started rounding up couriers last spring,
Levita fled with $100,000 to Amsterdam, where he ''experimented
with personal use of Ecstasy,'' court papers said. He also began
plotting ''his own modest scheme to import Ecstasy into Israel,''
the papers added, before he, Erez and five others were arrested
last July by federal agents and Dutch police.
</P>
<P>
   So far, five of the defendants have pleaded guilty. Erez and his
girlfriend remain in Dutch custody, and are fighting extradition.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Split on Raising Oil Production  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC was unable to reach unanimous
agreement Tuesday on raising oil production to stabilize prices, an
Iranian delegate said. But in a rare departure from its consensus
approach, ministers were expected to approve a plan to boost output
by as much as 7 percent, even without Iran's participation.
</P>
<P>
   An official statement was awaited to explain the action after a
six-hour meeting at OPEC's headquarters in Vienna. Delegates spoke
on condition of anonymity as the meeting broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Iran entered the meeting as the main holdout to a proposal to
raise production by 1.7 million barrels per day beginning April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Such an increase would reverse production cuts initiated last
March that led to a tripling of oil prices over the past year.
Saudi Arabia, OPEC's leading producer, was the main advocate of
raising production.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said an increase in OPEC output 1.7 million
barrels daily could help ease the prices that consumers are paying
for gasoline and other refined petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had lobbied hard in recent weeks for the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to relax its
constraints on production.
</P>
<P>
   That pressure will continue when U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen travels next week to the Middle East. A Pentagon spokesman
said Tuesday that Cohen would reinforce the Clinton
administration's call for increased oil production to bring down
fuel prices when he meets counterparts from such OPEC members as
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   An OPEC source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said today
there are precedents for OPEC to act without unanimous agreement,
if backed by a majority of OPEC members. However, it wasn't
immediately clear how an agreement to boost output would work
without Iran's consent.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has proposed boosting daily production by no more than 1.2
million barrels of crude -- an amount that probably would do little
to reduce world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest difference is between the position of Iran and the
rest. Their position is consistent -- that they don't want any
change,'' Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Naimi told reporters
earlier in the day..
</P>
<P>
   Naimi suggested that Iran is only willing to back an agreement
that would legitimize the estimated 1.2 million ''unofficial''
barrels that OPEC members are currently pumping each day in excess
of their quotas.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't have a problem with an increase being what actual
production is,'' Naimi said.
</P>
<P>
   Prices on world oil markets fell before the meeting broke up on
expectations of a production increase of 1.7 million barrels daily.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts for West Texas Intermediate crude fell 70 cents a
barrel to close at $27.09 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In
London, North Sea Brent was 17 cents lower at $25.51 on the
International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, the world's biggest consumer of oil, has gone
to exceptional lengths to lobby the cartel to raise production.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed at the tripling of oil prices during the past 12 months,
the U.S. government has said that an increase of 2 million to 2.5
million barrels per day is needed to replenish depleted inventories
and satisfy growing world demand.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time that the United States has been really
involved'' in OPEC decision-making, said Bill Edwards of
Houston-based Edwards Energy Consultants. ''This time it's the big
power play.''
</P>
<P>
   OPEC, which normally reaches decisions by consensus, must decide
whether to extend cuts it made in 1998 and 1999 that have propelled
oil prices to their highest levels since the 1991 Gulf War. The
latest round of cuts expires at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC pumps more than 26 million barrels of crude each day, or
about 35 percent of the world's supply. Key non-OPEC producers,
such as Mexico and Norway, have said they are watching to see what
OPEC will do before adjusting their own output.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. oil prices tripled to a March 8 peak of $34.37 per barrel
following OPEC's decision last March to slash production.

   Dow Ends Down 89.12; Nasdaq Falls
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled today after Abby Joseph Cohen,
one of Wall Street's most famously bullish analysts, recommended
that clients shift some of their investments from stock to cash.
Technology shares, which Cohen singled out as having little room
for further growth, led the decline. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 89.12 to close at 10,936.73. Broader stock indicators
were also lower. Cohen, the chief market strategist for Goldman
Sachs, recommends that clients keep 65 percent of their holdings in
stock, down from 70 percent previously. She said clients should put
5 percent of their assets in cash, up from zero.

   Judge Delays Microsoft Verdict

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal judge overseeing the Microsoft
antitrust trial has postponed his verdict, giving both sides more
time to hammer out details of a possible out-of-court settlement. A
new mediation schedule gives attorneys for Microsoft and the
Justice Department up to 10 days -- or until April 7 -- to negotiate
a last-minute deal, according to sources close to the case.
Negotiations between the two sides are being handled by a
court-appointed mediator, Richard Posner, a federal appeals judge

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence weakened in March for the
second consecutive month, suggesting that consumer spending could
slow in coming months in the wake of rising interest rates and
soaring oil prices. The Conference Board said today that its
Consumer Confidence Index dropped to 136.7 in March from 140.8 in
February and a record 144.7 in January. The decline was bigger than
Wall Street analysts had expected. Expectations were for a March
reading of 139.8.

   Best Buy Earnings Soar 51 Percent

<P>
   EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Strong sales and lower costs drove
fourth-quarter earnings at Best Buy Inc. up 51 percent, easily
beating analysts' expectations. For the three months ended Feb. 26,
Best Buy earned $163.8 million, or 78 cents a share, compared with
$108.8 million, or 51 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had
been expecting earnings of 74 cents a share. Sales rose 25 percent

   SEC Creating Online Surveillance
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal securities regulators fighting fraud
on the Internet are creating an automated surveillance system to
search Web sites, message boards and chat rooms. But a major
accounting firm says it won't participate because the Securities
and Exchange Commission's new system might encroach on the privacy
of innocent people as it searches for phrases such as ''get rich
quick.'' The computer technology involved in the enhanced SEC
surveillance program ''is equivalent to, in my opinion, wiretapping
... the equivalent of planting a bug,'' said Larry Ponemon, a
partner in charge of privacy issues at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
one of the world's largest accounting and consulting firms.

   Quebec Nationalism a Corp. Factor
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A last-minute offer by publishing giant Quebecor
and Caisse, Francophone Quebec's pension fund manager and most
powerful financial investor, has put on hold the previously
announced $3.8 billion merger of Groupe Videotron with Rogers
Communications of Toronto. Instead of voting yesterday to become a
major player in the Rogers strategy to be the dominant cable and
Internet provider in eastern Canada, Groupe Videotron shareholders
adjourned the meeting to comply with a court order obtained by
Caisse. Now a lengthy legal and boardroom battle for Group
Videotron looms, and analysts say the most logical explanation is
the desire of Caisse and Quebecor to prevent control of such a
major industry from moving outside the French-speaking Canadian
province.

   Rover Pushes BMW Earnings Lower
</P>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Automaker BMW AG posted a large loss
for 1999 due to the costs of selling its Rover units, but its
pretax earnings rose modestly as analysts had expected. The
automaker lost $2.4 billion for 1999 including restructuring costs
of $3 billion related to the sale of Rover's unprofitable passenger
car division. Pretax profit, excluding one time charges and gains,
rose 4.7 percent to $1 billion.

   Mitsubishi Head Says He's in Charge
</P>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Mitsubishi Motors Corp. president Katsuhiko Kawasoe
said today he remains in charge despite DaimlerChrysler AG's
acquisition of a 34 percent stake in the Japanese automaker.
Kawasoe noted that the top spots of chief executive officer and
chief operating officer will be held by Japanese. The deal gives
indebted Mitsubishi a partner with deep pockets, while
DaimlerChrysler gets access to Asian markets and help in developing
subcompact cars. Yet some analysts say that the German automaker's
purchase is just the first step either to more drastic job cuts at
Mitsubishi or even a full takeover of the company.

<HEADLINE> Quebec Nationalism Factor in Buyout  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The battle for cable television provider Groupe
Videotron has all the classic elements of a corporate takeover:
competing bids, a court order and confused shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But this fight has another element -- Quebec nationalism -- that
could prove crucial.
</P>
<P>
   An $3.8 billion merger with Rogers Communications of Toronto has
been put on hold by a last-minute $4 billion offer from publishing
giant Quebecor and Caisse, the Francophone province's pension fund
manager and most powerful financial investor.
</P>
<P>
   Now a lengthy legal and boardroom battle for Videotron looms, a
result analysts say of the desire of Caisse and Quebecor to prevent
control of such a major industry from moving outside Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no doubt that there's a political aspect to this
counterbid,'' said Mary Anne DeMonte-Whelan, a vice president and
senior telecom analyst at BLC Securities of Toronto. ''They want to
keep what they consider to be a very precious Quebec-based asset in
Quebec.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the issues involve a race by Canadian providers
to corral the home Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers is Canada's largest cable television operator and cell
phone company. It has partnerships with Microsoft and AT&AMP;T, is
positioned to be the dominant cable and Internet provider in
eastern Canada, and last week struck a deal with Western-based
cable rival Shaw Communications that essentially divided the
country between them.
</P>
<P>
   The merger with Groupe Videotron announced in February, would
secure access to the lucrative Quebec market.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, the merger was blocked by a court order filed by
Caise, which controls 19 percent of Videotron's shares and has veto
power over any corporate marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Caisse, a quasi-governmental institution, has a history of
exerting influence to protect Quebec business interests. It was
started in the mid-1960s by Jacques Parizeau, who later became
Quebec premier as head of the nationalist Parti Quebecois.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Fuss, an economics professor at the University of Toronto,
said the Videotron merger with Rogers makes more economic sense
than the Quebecor proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''There must be some notion here that they would like to keep
this in Quebec with Quebec ownership,'' Fuss said of the
Quebecor-Caisse offer.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders who attended a brief meeting to discuss the
company's future on Monday said they needed time to sort out the
confusion created by the competing offers and court dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will probably end up in a legal battle,'' said Marc Cantin,
a former Videotron executive.

<HEADLINE> Swede Sterilizations Said Voluntary  </HEADLINE>
By KIM GAMEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Investigators looking into Sweden's
sterilization scandal said Tuesday that about half of the 63,000
procedures performed from 1935 to 1975 were voluntary -- but that
politicians stood by for four decades as other victims were
sterilized against their will.
</P>
<P>
   The operations were largely forced on poor people and those with
mental problems in the 1940s, but there was little evidence that
ethnic groups were targeted, according to the report, drawn up by a
special government commission and forwarded to the Justice Ministry
for review.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not accuse individuals, but said that passivity
and silence of politicians and loose interpretation of
sterilization laws by medical authorities enabled the operations to
be forced on people until they were abolished in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has spent three years investigating the
sterilizations. It said that $14.5 million has been doled out to
722 victims, settling almost half of the 1,700 filed claims. The
commission has denied 63 claims so far, saying many underwent
operations for other reasons and were not sterilized.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to make decisions as fast as possible because
these people are old,'' commission secretary Leif Persson said,
adding that the victims were mostly between 70 and 80. Thirty
claimants died before their cases were processed, Persson said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was formed in 1997 after a newspaper reported
that the sterilizations were performed on people regarded as having
undesirable characteristics in line with the concept of
''eugenics'' -- selective breeding to improve the human stock.
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics were even more shocking in a country that has long
prided itself as an ideal welfare state that cares for all.
</P>
<P>
   The sterilization acts of 1934 and 1941 allowed operations in
cases of mental illness, severe defects and in cases of an
''anti-social way of life'' that the National Board of Health
determined should not be passed on to children. The laws were
abolished in 1976, and the procedure became voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   About 31,000 of the operations were performed after the
mid-1950s and were voluntarily requested by the patients, mostly
women, said the commission, which interviewed victims and analyzed
hospital records.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the mid-50s, there were less and less forced
sterilizations, and in the 60s, most of them were voluntary because
the women didn't want to have babies,'' Persson said.
</P>
<P>
   Between 21,000 and 27,000 operations were found to have been
forced, including many performed during abortions or as mandatory
before release from prisons or psychiatric wards. The commission
could not determine the nature of 4,000 operations.

<HEADLINE> 28 Terror Suspects Charged  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALABY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan indicted 28 Arabs linked to
suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden on terrorism charges Tuesday
stemming from what officials say was a conspiracy to attack
Americans and Israelis during New Year's celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen suspects -- 13 Jordanians, one Iraqi and an Algerian --
have been in custody since December, Attorney General Maamoun
Khassawneh said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen others, including Jordanians, Palestinians and a
Yemeni, are at large and possibly hiding in Pakistan, Afghanistan,
Britain, Lebanon and Syria, Khassawneh said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian officials have said those governments were contacted
regarding the possible extradition of some of those at large.
</P>
<P>
   Khassawneh said the suspects will be tried in Jordan's State
Security Court in mid-April. They face the death penalty if found
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said the suspects planned bombing attacks on U.S.
and Israeli tourists celebrating the New Year at Jordan's Mount
Nebo, where tradition says Moses saw the Promised Land, and at a
Christian settlement along the Jordan River said to be where Jesus
was baptized.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found radio-controlled detonators, explosives,
ammunition, raw material for bomb-making and nerve gas hidden at a
farm outside Amman. According to the indictment, the suspects began
collecting the materials in 1996 from various Arab capitals,
including Damascus and Baghdad. Many of the suspects allegedly
received military training in camps in Syria, Lebanon and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects also face charges of manufacturing explosives and
being affiliated with outlawed groups. One of the groups is Al
Qaida, or ''the base'' -- a terrorist organization allegedly headed
by bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a Saudi dissident, is suspected of a leading role in
the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa that killed 224 people. He
is on the U.S. State Department's list of most-wanted criminals.

<HEADLINE> Best Buy Earnings Soar 51 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Strong sales and lower costs drove
fourth-quarter earnings at Best Buy Inc. up 51 percent, easily
beating analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   For the three months ended Feb. 26, Best Buy earned $163.8
million, or 78 cents a share, compared with $108.8 million, or 51
cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 25 percent to $4.31
billion, from $3.46 billion in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our performance in the fourth quarter exceeded our
expectations and capped another breakaway year for Best Buy,
solidifying our market leading position,'' said Richard Schulze,
chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The results also exceeded Wall Street expectations. Analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thompson Financial had estimated Best Buy
would earn 74 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares rose $6.37{, or more than 8 percent, to $82 in trading at
4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   For the full fiscal year, Best Buy earned $347.1 million, or
$1.63 a share, compared with $216.3 million, or $1.03 a share, in
fiscal 1999. Sales rose to $12.49 billion, from $10.07 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at stores open at least a year increased 11 percent for
both the quarter and fiscal year on top of double-digit increases
during the same periods last year. The company said comparable
store sales gains in the last two years have increased the average
annual store sales volume to more than $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy, the nation's largest volume specialty retailer of
consumer electronics, personal computers, entertainment software
and appliances, operates 357 retail locations in 39 states.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which plans to open 60 stores this year, also sells
compact discs and DVD movies on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Judges hear arguments in frozen embryo dispute  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- They are the byproducts of a broken
marriage, but much more difficult to divide than bank accounts or
the family house.
</P>
<P>
   Seven frozen embryos are at the center of a case that highlights
how technology is outpacing society's ability to resolve the
complicated issues that come along with it.
</P>
<P>
   A divorced Camden County couple used invitro fertilization to
create the embryos in 1996 when they struggled with infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the husband, a devout Catholic, wants to possibly use the
embryos with a future partner or donate them to infertile couples.
The wife wants them destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   A state appeals court heard arguments from both sides Tuesday.
The judges will answer the difficult question: What should happen
to a frozen embryo if a couple divorces?
</P>
<P>
   The case is a type of custody battle laced with abortion issues.
It raises questions about the legal status of embryos and the
potential parents' rights. It also highlights the need for laws
governing infertility technology, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   By court order, the couple's identity has not been revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the husband asked the court to rule on the side of
preserving life and give him the rights to the embryos.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main goal is to protect future children,'' said Eric
Spevak, attorney for the husband.
</P>
<P>
   Spevak also argued that a lower court judge, which sided with
the wife, was wrong to decide the case without first holding a
hearing. He asked the appeals court to order a new trial in which
experts could testify about moral and ethical implications.
</P>
<P>
   But James Katz, the wife's lawyer, said the real issue is
whether the court should force the wife to become a parent against
her will. Even though the husband would release the wife from all
parenting responsibilities, the wife would still be tormented with
the fact that a child of hers is alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are not faced with issues of the right to life or the
right to choose life,'' said Katz. ''You are faced with the
question of whether on the dissolution of a marriage, can the wife
be compelled to give her embryos for the purpose of donations to an
infertile couple.''
</P>
<P>
   Bioethicists say no.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ethical principle is you don't turn people into parents
against their will,'' Arthur L. Caplan, director of the Center for
Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, said
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   But aren't men routinely forced to take responsibility for
children they father, even if they want the mother to have an
abortion?
</P>
<P>
   The difference, said Caplan, is that once an embryo is inside a
woman, another standard applies.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you have two embryos in a dish, then you need permission to
start the pregnancy,'' said Caplan. ''Once the embryo is inside the
woman's body, you can't force her to have her body invaded against
her will.''
</P>
<P>
   But Spevak also argued that the couple had verbally agreed to
preserve the embryos, even if they divorced. Katz said that verbal
agreement cannot be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Spevak acknowledged that the couple signed a contract with the
clinic where the embryos were created, saying the embryos would be
disposed of unless a court ordered otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Katz also noted that the husband is capable of having children.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had the embryos created in 1995 because the wife was
unable to conceive due to a blockage in a fallopian tube. The
couple divorced in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 20,000 other frozen embryos in ''legal
limbo'' around the country, said Caplan.
</P>
<P>
   Because there has been no legislation or court rulings that
specifically allow clinics to destroy the embryos, most clinics
keep them frozen, even after couples abandon them, said Caplan.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're orphan embryos,'' Caplan said, adding that lawmakers
need to address these issues.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Neil Cohen, D-Union, has been trying to do that for
a couple of years, but without success. Cohen recently reintroduced
a bill that would force couples to agree on the disposition of
embryos in advance of fertilization, in case of a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   A second bill would allow ''egg banks'' to dispose of abandoned
eggs and embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Both are awaiting a hearing in the Assembly Health Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In similar cases, the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled that a
husband's right not to have children outweighed his wife's right to
donate the embryos to an infertile couple.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, New York's highest court ruled that five embryos
created by a divorcing couple must be destroyed, despite the
woman's desire to use them to have children. In that case, the
couple had signed an agreement stating that is what would happen to
the embryos, in case of divorce, said Spevak.

<HEADLINE> ABC Won't Broadcast Elian Interview  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   c NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC said Elian Gonzalez told Diane Sawyer that
he did not want to return to Cuba, but the network did not
broadcast the boy's words Tuesday because it did not want the
interview used for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In the second part of a ''Good Morning America'' interview with
the boy at the center of an international custody dispute, Sawyer
said Elian's Miami relatives said he has told them he wants to stay
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told us that, too,'' Sawyer said. ''But in this inflamed
climate, on this inflamed subject, we thought it best not to
broadcast the exact words of a 6-year-old child.''
</P>
<P>
   The network believed that a film clip of the boy saying he did
not want to return to Cuba would immediately be seized upon and
used repeatedly by supporters of the effort to keep Elian in the
United States, ABC News President David Westin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've said from the beginning that we're not going to do this
in a political way,'' he said. ''We're not trying to take a
position in a highly-charged political atmosphere. We are simply
trying to report Elian's point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Westin also said there were some things Elian said about the
subject of returning to Cuba that were contradictory, uncertain or
vague. Showing a more complete interview would lead people to take
things out of context, or lose sight of the fact that a 6-year-old
is speaking, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's installment, Sawyer asked Marisleysis Gonzalez, who
has become a mother figure to the boy, if she would take Elian back
to Cuba to help him adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would be the worst thing that could happen to this kid,''
she said. ''The person that he is so close to him, the person he
most loves ... I feel I would betray him if I do that, and I will
not betray him.''
</P>
<P>
   She told Sawyer that she has told the boy he should return to
Cuba and that his father loves him, doing so to lessen the trauma
if he is forced back.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has been criticized in some circles for speaking to a boy so
young who has recently lost his mother. Elian was found floating in
an inner tube off the Florida coast in November. His mother was
among 11 people who died when their boat sank during a journey from
Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Daily News suggested ''Good Morning America''
should change its name to ''Goodbye Ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As if poor little Elian Gonzalez did not have enough problems,
he has now been afflicted with Diane Sawyer,'' the newspaper said
Tuesday in an editorial on the ABC interview.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zucker, executive producer of NBC's competing ''Today''
show, said it would not air an interview with Elian because ''we
think it's inappropriate to interview a 6-year-old boy.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Gonzalez family has a letter from the ''Today''
show requesting an interview with the boy. Zucker claimed it was
sent after the Gonzalez family called to see if ''Today'' was
interested, by a booker who was acting without his authority.
Zucker said an interview with Elian would not have made it on his
show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every channel wanted him,'' said Armando Gutierrez, spokesman
for Elian's Miami relatives, ''so we didn't see anything wrong with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Westin said he was proud of the way ABC handled the story.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a difficult area and subject but also an important one,''
he said. ''What we do as journalists is go into difficult
situations like this and treat them as appropriately as possible. I
think Diane and the team have done a terrific job.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's installment, there is very little heard from Elian.
He's seen speaking with Sawyer briefly about his house in Cuba, but
a psychologist and Marisleysis Gonzalez do most of the talking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good Morning America'' also aired an interview Tuesday with
the American lawyer for Elian's father, who is fighting for the boy
to be returned to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu May Be Indicted  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Delivering an emotional television appeal,
Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu angrily denied any
wrongdoing Tuesday after police urged the attorney general to
indict him and his wife on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   During a 50-minute interview, Netanyahu occasionally used props
and paused dramatically to emphasize his innocence and to accuse
police of trumping up the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, accepted favors from a
contractor, kept 700 presents meant to be state property, including
a golden letter opener from U.S. Vice President Al Gore, and tried
to influence others to alter their testimony in the case.
</P>
<P>
   If tried and convicted of the most serious charge, obstruction
of justice, Netanyahu could be sentenced to up to seven years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, 50, who was tossed out by voters 10 months ago,
launched a counter-offensive against the police in an apparent
attempt to rescue his political future.
</P>
<P>
   During the TV appearance, the former leader mentioned his son
and recently-deceased mother as he denied the allegations -- even,
at one point, brandishing a supposedly valuable brooch which he
said an appraiser had valued at $1.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole thing is ridiculous,'' Netanyahu scoffed during the
prime time interview.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently relishing the underdog role, the 50-year-old
politician accused police of making up the charges, saying he was
being persecuted by the political establishment because of his
hardline views.
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Ben-Ami, the police minister, denied police acted in bad
faith. ''The police did not, do not, and as long as I am
responsible for police, will not have a political agenda,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that a seven-month investigation indicated that
Netanyahu should be charged with fraud, attempted misuse of state
funds, breach of trust and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Yaacov Weinroth, called the police report
''sloppy.'' He said it ''confirms what we thought -- the case is one
big nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general, Elyakim Rubinstein, will make the final
decision on whether to indict. It was unclear how long that process
might take.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing his case, Netanyahu said police interrogated him as to
whether a small, valuable pendant was among the state gifts. When
he got home from that particular interrogation session, he said he
and his wife ''turned the house upside down'' and found the
pendant.
</P>
<P>
   They took it to an appraiser, and were told it is worth less
than a dollar, Netanyahu said, waving the tiny pin before the TV
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the most difficult moment was since the probe began,
Netanyahu stopped and looked down. After long seconds of silence,
he said his 8-year-old son Yair was tormented at school because of
the probe and his mother, Cila, died with the charges still hanging
over him.
</P>
<P>
   The case is just one of a series of scandals plaguing Israel's
leadership. Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his party are under
investigation for violating the campaign finance law; police are
looking into a large amount of money President Ezer Weizman
received from a French millionaire; and incitement charges are
being considered against a religious leader for calling a Cabinet
minister ''Satan'' and other epithets.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's wife, Sara, should be charged with theft and misuse
of state funds, police said. Charges were also recommended against
Moshe Leon, the director of Netanyahu's office, and Ezra Zeidoff,
his office manager.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu had virtually disappeared from public life in Israel
after he was trounced by Barak, a moderate, in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the conservative Likud party, Netanyahu was elected
prime minister in 1996. His rule was marked by confrontations with
opponents and charges of bias. Though he resigned from the
leadership of the Likud party and from the parliament after the
56-to-44 percent Barak landslide, rumors soon surfaced that he was
planning a political comeback.
</P>
<P>
   His legal troubles started shortly after the May election, when
a contractor, Avner Amedi, presented a bill for $110,000 to the
government for jobs he had done for Netanyahu and his wife. That
led to an investigation that saw police going through the couple's
private home and storage room, looking for presents that were
supposed to be state property.
</P>
<P>
   More serious politically is the police charge that Netanyahu met
with Amedi and other officials and tried to dictate what they would
tell police. If he is convicted on an obstruction of justice
charge, legal experts said he could be banned from running for
public office, among other penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his term, Netanyahu survived a scandal over a failed
attempt to appoint a political crony as attorney general. Police
recommended filing charges, but the attorney general chose not to
prosecute. Netanyahu's lawyers predict the same thing will happen
this time, too.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Said Still Building Weapons  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saddam Hussein almost certainly has used the
absence of international scrutiny to rebuild Iraq's arsenal of
weapons of mass destruction, two former chief U.N. weapons
inspectors suggested Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is clearly doing it again,'' Richard Butler told the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Those views were echoed by his predecessor, Rolf Ekeus. ''There
is no conclusive evidence that Iraq has decided to terminate any of
its weapons programs,'' Ekeus said.
</P>
<P>
   Ekeus led the U.N. Special Commission for Iraq between 1991 and
1997; Butler was the executive chairman from 1997 to last June.
</P>
<P>
   The commission had worked with the International Atomic Energy
Agency to oversee the destruction of Iraq's biological, chemical
and nuclear weapons and missile programs. Weapons inspectors from
both agencies left Iraq in December 1998 ahead of U.S. and British
airstrikes, launched to punish Iraq for failing to cooperate with
the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, known for his outspoken and confrontational attitude
toward Baghdad, said he doesn't hold out much hope that a new panel
created by the United Nations will have any more success. He
predicted Iraq would refuse to cooperate with the new team and ''we
will again have an Iraq crisis on our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler also said President Clinton should appeal immediately to
Vladimir Putin, Russia's newly elected president, and propose an
aggressive U.S.-Russian campaign against the development of weapons
of mass destruction by countries like Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ''No vetoes, but the great powers standing together,'' Butler
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new arms inspections panel, the U.N. Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission, was created in December to
replace the Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Blix, the director, said earlier this month that he wants
Baghdad to give his arms experts free access to suspected weapons
sites -- suggesting it would help bolster Iraq's claim that it does
not have such weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has said it has destroyed all of its prohibited weapons,
meeting U.N. requirements to have sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
   But both Ekeus and Butler said they doubted this. Ekeus said the
new weapons inspectors must make sure they have the most
sophisticated equipment available.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said he would like the United Nations to create a
powerful ''U.N. Council on Weapons of Mass Destruction'' that would
police weapons proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   They testified as the Senate committee held another in a series
of hearings on the dangers of the spread of nuclear weapons.
Tuesday's session dealt with Iran and Iraq. The CIA has said both
countries have weapons programs, and that Iran's is the more
advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ''For both Iran and Iraq, the status quo is unacceptable,'' said
Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Election Delay Rejected  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's highest court, whose
members were hand-picked by President Hugo Chavez's leftist
coalition, on Tuesday rejected an opposition demand to delay
nationwide elections.
</P>
<P>
   The decision means Venezuelans will go to the polls on May 28 to
decide whether to keep Chavez in office for a six-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez took office only a year ago but is up for re-election
because the new constitution that he pushed through last year
requires most elected officials, including the president, to be
''relegitimized'' through new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will also elect 23 governors, 165 congressmen and
thousands of delegates to local councils.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Supreme Tribunal means the opposition will
have less time to try to persuade Venezuelans to unseat Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democratic principles have been violated,'' said attorney
Cipriano Heredia after the decision was announced. ''There is no
rule of law in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Arias, a former governor who helped Chavez stage his
famous 1992 coup attempt, is challenging Chavez for the presidency.
A poll last week gave him 39 percent support compared to Chavez's
50 percent. The poll of 1,200 people had an error margin of plus or
minus 3 percentage points and was conducted by the private Campol
polling firm.
</P>
<P>
   Because Arias is not linked to the discredited traditional
parties Chavez has all but destroyed, he is believed to have a
chance at victory in May's balloting -- though he had hoped to have
more time to make his case.
</P>
<P>
   Four opposition leaders who sued for a delay in the election
said the new constitution requires a minimum six-month lapse
between electoral law changes and new elections. Venezuela's
electoral law was modified just last month.
</P>
<P>
   But Supreme Tribunal President Ivan Rincon said that requirement
did not apply because an assembly that rewrote Venezuela's 1961
constitution had ''supraconstitutional'' power to legislate
electoral policy during the country's current political transition.
</P>
<P>
   That same constitutional assembly hand-picked the Supreme
Tribunal's 20 magistrates in an exercise that the opposition
criticized as antidemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former army paratrooper who tried and failed to
overthrow Venezuela's elected government in 1992, has made good on
promises to erase the country's old political order since becoming
president a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The new constitution abolished Venezuela's Senate, increased the
power of the presidency and raised the profile of the military in
the South American nation of 23 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez says the changes will root out rampant corruption and
poverty in the country that sits on the Western Hemisphere's
largest petroleum reserves. But critics say many of the
transformations represent a threat to one of the oldest democracies
in Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Hoteliers kicking sand in city's face over beach tag proposals  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE MAY, N.J. (AP) -- At the Heritage Inn, a beach tag is just
one of the amenities. It comes with your room, just like the color
TV, the refrigerator and daily maid service.
</P>
<P>
   The tag isn't free. It costs owner Barbara Bednar $13. But she
provides one to every hotel guest. When a guest checks out, the tag
gets passed to another guest so that they, too, can use the beaches
without buying a tag.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true at the Marquis de Lafayette Hotel, the
Avondale-by-the-Sea and dozens of other hotels, motels and
bed-and-breakfast inns here.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always gave them to our guests,'' says George Loper,
president of the Cape May Hotel and Motel Association. ''It was the
one thing they got free. It gave them a friendlier feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the city wants to charge businesses or their out-of-town
guests more money to use the beaches. And, like any break with
tradition in this picturesque Victorian-themed seaside resort, the
proposal is ruffling some feathers.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are not going to be happy when they hear this,'' said
Herb Weiner, who runs the 46-united Avondale.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to fill a $100,000 to $200,000 budget gap for
guarding, cleaning and maintaining beaches, city officials
announced in January that they would begin enforcing a little-known
provision of the 1977 ordinance governing beach tags -- to wit: that
the tags are non-transferable.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, Mayor Jerry Gaffney says, was to make beachgoers pay
their fair share for upkeep of the beaches, which costs the city
more than $1 million a year and has run at a deficit for the last
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of the beachgoers are out-of-town visitors, and
many of them get beach tags for free when they rent a room, Gaffney
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it fair that you and I buy a tag and use it 10 or 20 times
a year but a hotel buys one and turns it over 100 times?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without some new revenue source, the deficit in the beach fund
would be made up with money from the general fund, he said. If that
happened, full-time residents would, in effect, be paying twice to
bail out beaches that out-of-town visitors are using, Gaffney said.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged hotel and motel owners said enforcing the ban on
transferred tags would force them to stop giving them to guests.
Some hotels include the promise of free beach tags in their
pamphlets and don't want to have to renege.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spent $4,000 a year on beach tags. If they make them
non-transferable or raise the price too much, it would be
cost-prohibitive for me,'' said Tracy Holder, general manager of
the Marquis de Lafayette Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The ruckus sent city officials back to the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they want to establish a special class of tag for
businesses and rewrite the ordinance to make all tags transferable.
The ''commercial tag,'' for any buyer who rents rooms out, would
cost between $18 and $25 and would be transferable.
</P>
<P>
   Cape May residents would still be able to share their tags with
relatives, visitors or other guests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't care if you have 27 cousins and 16 uncles. But if you
rent three or four rooms out, that's a different story,'' Gaffney
said.
</P>
<P>
   The amended ordinance will be introduced to the City Council on
April 4, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Bednar believes the city is going about it all
wrong. She believes all tags should be non-transferable.
</P>
<P>
   ''If everyone who came here had to buy a tag, the revenue that
would be generated would be so huge, it would drive the cost of the
tags down anyway,'' she said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled Tuesday after Abby Joseph Cohen,
one of Wall Street's most famously bullish analysts, recommended
that clients shift some of their investments from stock to cash.
Technology shares, which Cohen singled out as having little room
for further growth, led the decline.
</P>

<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 fell 16.13 to 1,507.73 and the Nasdaq composite index fell
124.67 to 4,833.89.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, the chief market strategist for Goldman Sachs, set the
tone for the session after she pared her firm's recommended
weighting for stocks. Cohen now advises clients to keep 65 percent
of their holdings in stock, down from 70 percent previously. She
said clients should put 5 percent of their assets in cash, up from
zero.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that she became bearish; she just became a little
less bullish,'' said Larry Wachtel, market strategist at Prudential
Securities. ''In a market as extended as this, that's all it takes
to cause a little shakeout.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Cohen raised her yearend target for the S&AMP;P 500
to 1,575 from 1,525. Ultimately, she expects the index to rise 8
percent to 10 percent for the year 2000, down from a return of more
than 19 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Because stocks are expected to yield more muted gains, Cohen
said, investors may want to trim their exposure to what she
described as ''normal weights.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen added that certain sectors of the market have risen so
steeply that their potential for further gains is limited. She
singled out technology, prompting widespread selling in computer
and Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in a decade, our model portfolio is no
longer recommending an overweighted position in technology,'' Cohen
said in a summary of her remarks to clients. ''Many of the
technology shares were given the respect they deserve over the last
18 months, and are no longer undervalued.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, Intel fell 7 to 135 11/16 and Sun Microsystems
lost 4] to 10|. Yahoo! fell 5} to 195 and Amazon.com fell 3 to 70[.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said her model portfolio carries a slightly higher
exposure to financial stocks, which helped boost Dow components
American Express and J.P. Morgan. American Express rose 2 to 152{
and J.P. Morgan gained 1| to 132}.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which dropped sharply Monday after the company failed
to appease government antitrust authorities with an offer to
settle, lost its strong early momentum and finished up \ at 104
5/16. Late Monday, lawyers in the case received word that the judge
in the case would postpone his verdict, allowing for continued
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said trading in Microsoft is likely to be highly
volatile until a settlement is reached or until U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson delivers a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices fell in the waning hours of OPEC ministers' meeting
on production cuts. Airline stocks benefited most, with Delta
Airlines up 2} to 54} and UAL Corp., the parent company of United
Airlines, up 2 5/16 to 59 5/16. UAL also released an upbeat profit
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the Conference Board reported consumer confidence
weakened in March for the second consecutive month. The report
suggested consumer spending could slow in coming months in the wake
of rising interest rates and soaring oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Confidence Index dropped to 136.7 in March from
140.8 in February and a record 144.7 in January. The decline was
bigger than Wall Street analysts had expected, but failed to
appease economists who expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates
again later this year in a continued effort to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any worries about rising interest rates and higher gasoline
prices appear to be more than offset by growing confidence about
current job and income prospects,'' said Mark Vitner, economist at
First Union Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 1.16 billion shares,
compared with 1.10 billion in the previous session. On the Nasdaq,
nine stocks fell for every five that rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 14.61 to

<HEADLINE> UC Research Boat Sinks, Two Dead  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE RAY ORTIZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A boat carrying about 10 students and others on
a university research trip sank off the coast of Baja California,
killing at least two people.
</P>
<P>
   Three people swam to safety on a nearby island and were rescued
early Tuesday, said Lisa Lapin, a spokeswoman for the University of
California, Davis. A search was on for the others.
</P>
<P>
   Among the missing was Gary Polis, the expedition's leader and
chairman of the school's Department of Environmental Science and
Policy, Lapin said.
</P>
<P>
   The boat was one of two, 22-foot inflatable crafts carrying a
total of about 20 people on the trip Monday to research spiders and
scorpions on an island off the coast of Bahia de Los Angeles, a
remote bay 250 miles south of the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   The two boats became separated on their return to Bahia de Los
Angeles for the day when strong winds whipped up 4- to 6-foot
waves, UC Davis said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear who was on board the boat that sank.
</P>
<P>
   ''From what we understand, there was a mix of students, faculty
and visitors from Japan,'' said another school spokeswoman, Pat
Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   The boat that made it reported the other craft missing late
Monday, prompting a search by the Coast Guard and the Mexican navy.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican naval ships and Mexican and Coast Guard aircraft were
searching the area Tuesday under clear skies.
</P>
<P>
   Located in a rugged, desert landscape, Bahia de Los Angeles is a
tiny collection of hotels and tourist campgrounds that is a popular
destination for sports fishermen, kayakers and wildlife biologists.
</P>
<P>
   Polis, one of the world's leading spider experts, and the other
researchers were studying the ecology of spiders and scorpions that
inhabit the islands.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to hold a press
conference Wednesday as part of his effort to get Congress moving
on gun control, Medicare, the minimum wage and other issues ripe
for this election year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and congressional Democrats hope to use election-year
politics to press Republicans to compromise, or risk handing
Democrats issues for the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time for Congress to get to work,'' White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said Tuesday. ''I think the president will be sending
a strong message that we can get a lot done this year and we've got
to get started soon.''
</P>
<P>
   After the news conference, his second of the year, Clinton is
going on a fund-raising trip to South Carolina and New York.
</P>
<P>
   In his Feb. 16 press conference, he took questions about the
presidential campaign with relish, even as he said he was trying to
stay above the day-to-day political fray in his final year in
office.

<HEADLINE> Report: Oscars Dropped Houston  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The official word is that a sore throat kept
Whitney Houston from singing at the Academy Awards. A newspaper,
however, reported that she was dropped from the show after bombing
in rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post on Tuesday quoted unidentified sources as
saying that Burt Bacharach, a musical director for the Oscar
ceremony, was so frustrated with Houston during rehearsals last
week that he pulled the plug on her performance.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's publicists said the singer backed out because her
throat was sore.
</P>
<P>
   ''After participating in rehearsals ... both Thursday and Friday
nights, she was unsure that she would be better by Sunday. She
therefore regretfully withdrew from the performance,'' said a
statement issued by Nancy Seltzer &AMP; Associates Inc. of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar show publicist Jane LaBonte said, ''I was in the rehearsal
myself the whole time, and it was really obvious the poor lady was
having a problem with her throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, Bacharach and others involved in the show decided that
it would be better if she did not perform, LaBonte said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was scheduled to join other singers in a medley of movie
songs. She was replaced by country singer Faith Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Post quoted a source as saying Houston showed up for
rehearsal last Thursday, gave Bacharach only 15 minutes and was
''totally out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A source told the paper that Houston seemed a bit
''discombobulated'' during further rehearsals Friday, missing a cue
and singing the wrong song. That's when Bacharach decided to
replace her, the source said.

<HEADLINE> Smokers' Lawyer Attacks Industry  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Nearly all lung and throat cancer cases among
smokers are caused by cigarettes, a smokers' attorney argued
Tuesday in the final stages of a landmark case that Big Tobacco
fears could ruin the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ninety-nine percent plus of the people who get these terrible
diseases are smokers,'' attorney Stanley Rosenblatt told jurors who
later this week are expected to consider compensatory damages in
the class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of roughly 500,000 sick
Florida smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Occasionally, rarely, someone gets lung cancer or throat
cancer who is not a smoker.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry wants to ''blame it on anything other than
their wonderful product,'' Rosenblatt said. ''They came up with
something like they always come up with something so they can get
cigarettes off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Rosenblatt is expected to ask for a specific
dollar amount to cover medical bills as well as pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Following that, the nation's five biggest cigarette makers will
get their chance to convince the six-member panel that they should
not be required to pay anything.
</P>
<P>
   If the jury awards compensatory damages, the panel will hear
more testimony and be asked to set a dollar figure to punish the
industry. Company officials fear a ruinous $300 billion punitive
damage verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The jury last summer found the companies fraudulently conspired
to make a deadly product that causes cancer, emphysema other
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co.,
Liggett Group Inc. and the industry's Council for Tobacco Research
and Tobacco Institute.

<HEADLINE> Bush Declares Reading 'Emergency'  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RESTON, Va. (AP) -- George W. Bush reached out to vanquished
presidential rival John McCain Tuesday, declaring ''the past is the
past'' and it's time for them to meet. Another former rival, Steve
Forbes, was endorsing Bush as the Republicans moved toward
reconciliation after a bruising primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Bush telephoned McCain from his car in Virginia, where he laid
out a $5 billion plan to address illiteracy among young school
students, declaring the problem a ''national emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Too many of our children can't read,'' Bush told a group of
Asian-American business people in suburban Washington. ''Our
economy is the envy of the world; unfortunately, our schools are
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush reached out to McCain after Bob Dole, the defeated 1996 GOP
nominee who has been acting as peacemaker, had lunch with the
Arizona senator and then called Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor is hoping for an endorsement from his former
foe, but McCain aides said it is too soon to talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain adviser John Weaver said, ''The ice has been
broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ''I think John and I both understand that the past is
the past and it's time to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain suspended his campaign March 9 after Bush won a string of
primaries two days earlier on Super Tuesday. The Arizona senator
won seven GOP primaries, including the leadoff contest in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush annoyed the McCain camp by saying that McCain ''didn't
change my views on reform.'' But the Texan quickly tried to soften
the blow and has spoken more glowingly of his former rival since.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor was lining up the endorsement of Forbes at an
evening rally in the millionaire publisher's home state of New
Jersey. His backing could bring Bush more conservative support even
as he targets women and other traditional Democratic constituencies
with his reading initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls give both Bush and his Democratic rival, Vice
President Al Gore, roughly equal marks on who would do the best job
of improving education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's education proposal would provide reading instruction for
about 900,000 kindergarten and first-grade students. Over time,
aides said, he envisions adding a lesser amount of money to
diagnose and remedy lingering problems with second graders.
</P>
<P>
   Casting himself as a new Republican, Bush even cited the late
Albert Shanker, former head of the American Federation of Teachers,
a union traditionally aligned with Democratic causes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This plan is different. It's different from my opponent. It's
different from the administration. And it's different from those
who would say there is no federal role for education, different
from those who would throw money into schools without reforming
them,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the White House, Gore scoffed that Bush's education
agenda was ''subordinate to his risky tax scheme, which would
actually slash money for education.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, the vice president
said Bush could not pay for his education proposals if he also cut
taxes as proposed, by about $1 trillion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tax-cut plan ''puts a huge cloud over everything that he
says about education,'' Gore told the AP. ''You can't propose an
economic plan that results in devastating, slashing cuts to
education and pretend that you're not doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's new program, ''Reading First,'' is modeled after
a program begun this year in Texas. It would set the goal of
teaching every American child to read by the end of the third
grade.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics cited by the Bush campaign, 68 percent
of the fourth graders in the nation's poorest school areas were not
able to read at a basic level in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bush calls for spending $5 million annually to diagnose reading
problems with kindergarten and first-grade students.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $90 million per year would be used to train
teachers to make the diagnosis. The biggest chunk of money -- $900
million annually -- is pegged for literacy programs that would be
designed and implemented locally.
</P>
<P>
   States would have to apply for the money, and it would be
awarded only if they proposed programs that met ''research-based''
standards.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore has proposed spending $115 billion over 10
years to continue President Clinton's program aimed at reducing
class sizes by providing more money to hire teachers. So far, about
30,000 have been hired, with a goal of 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also wants to triple the number of charter schools, make
preschool available to every 4-year-old and expand Head Start.

<HEADLINE> Yen Rises Against the Dollar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The yen rose against the dollar Tuesday on hopes
that an upcoming survey would show an upturn in Japanese business
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, meanwhile, slipped against the dollar in quiet
trading, its momentum from a Swiss interest rate hike last week
having run out of steam. In late New York trading, the euro was
quoted at 96.13 cents, down from 96.62 cents late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar fell nearly one full yen against the Japanese
currency, trading at 105.88 yen in late dealings in New York, down
from 106.87 yen the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   Traders are hoping that a Bank of Japan survey due out next
Monday would show a long-awaited improvement in business sentiment.
Tokyo's Nikkei stock average has already moved above the 20,000
mark this week on hopes that Japan's economy would turn the corner
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The yen has also benefited from increased demand from Japanese
exporting companies, who convert non-Japanese currencies back into
yen around this time of year in order to bring them back home
before March 31, the end of Japan's fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6559 Swiss francs,
up from 1.6441, and 1.4536 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4585. The
British pound edged higher to $1.5883 from $1.5878.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0346 German
marks, up from 2.0242; 6.8236 French francs, up from 6.7890; and
2,014.24 Italian lire, up from 2,004.01.

<HEADLINE> Lessons From Twisters of 1999  </HEADLINE>
By LIBBY QUAID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Homeowners can raise the odds of surviving
tornadoes by spending $1,000 to $2,000 to reinforce their houses
while local governments can help by adopting better building codes
and wind engineering standards, the government's disaster relief
chief said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unlike what many of us believe, we do not have to be helpless
victims in the face of even the most violent tornadoes,'' said
James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot control the weather, but we can in many cases
control its effects on people.''
</P>
<P>
   He released recommendations resulting from a study of more than
70 tornadoes that swept from Texas to the Northern Plains in May,
killing 49 people in Oklahoma and Kansas and injuring at least 800
others.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated $1.5 billion in damage made the outbreak the
costliest in U.S. history, and the agency sent engineers and
architects to Oklahoma and Kansas to see why buildings failed or
withstood the onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   The agency recommended:
</P>
<P>
   --Retrofitting garage doors, particularly two-car doors, to
strengthen them against high winds. At a news conference, Witt used
a computer simulation to demonstrate how strong winds can rip a
two-car garage from its foundation and cut a wide swath through the
central portion of a house that is not built to comply with newer
codes and engineering standards.
</P>
<P>
   --Strengthening masonry chimneys with vertical reinforcement
steel in the corners.
</P>
<P>
   --Reinforcing double entry doors and bracing the ends of gable
roofs, and, for businesses, securing metal siding and roofs.
</P>
<P>
   --Securely anchoring mobile homes or, even better, placing them
on permanent foundations.
</P>
<P>
   --Building steel-reinforced, closet-sized ''safe rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   An agency survey in tornado-prone areas found that half the
residents believed they could do nothing to save their homes in the
face of a nearby tornado. And Witt said few who thought they could
make a difference actually tried to do so.

<HEADLINE> Amnesty Levels Saudi Accusations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Saudi Arabia carries out secret trials,
torture and amputations and hires public relations firms to cover
up the human rights abuses, Amnesty International claimed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi government ''spares no effort in keeping its appalling
human rights record a secret by employing well-paid, foreign-based
public relations firms and lobbyists,'' the London-based rights
group said in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Activists protested near the Saudi embassy in Washington on
Monday to bring attention to alleged violations.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report said the United States and other governments
were keeping silent in order to advance business interests and
geopolitical concerns in the Middle Eastern nation.
</P>
<P>
   The oil-rich kingdom paid public relations firms more than $1
million in 1999 to improve its image, Amnesty claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Foreign Ministry officials contacted Tuesday by The
Associated Press refused to comment. The New York Times, however,
quoted Prince Turki bin Mohammed, a deputy foreign minister,
criticizing the report as inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have nothing to hide in human rights,'' he was quoted as
saying. ''There is no harm in having their point of view, but they
have to be more accurate in their information.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, part of a six-month worldwide campaign by Amnesty to
expose abuses in Saudi Arabia, cited testimony claiming brutality,
torture and ill-treatment in many police stations, prisons and
detention centers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, at least five people have had their hands or
feet amputated in Saudi Arabia for crimes including sodomy and
theft. At least 13 people have been beheaded this year, mainly for
murder and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Christians, Sikhs and other minorities in the Muslim monarchy,
it said, were subject to discrimination and were targeted by
security forces. ''Political and religious opponents of the
government, migrant workers, women and other powerless individuals
emerge as consistent victims of discrimination,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
   Political groups are banned in Saudi Arabia and authorities do
not tolerate any form of public dissent. Women are restricted in
their dress and travel. There are no trade unions.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley quoted the
department's annual report as saying Saudi Arabia ''rejects
internationally accepted definitions of human rights and infringes
on privacy rights and restricts other basic rights,'' and lacks
religious freedom and tolerance.

<HEADLINE> Births To Unwed Mothers Hit High  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women in their 20s helped fuel a baby boomlet
that pushed U.S. births up 2 percent in 1998, the first increase in
several years, said a government report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The increase reflected growth in the number of women entering
childbearing years. These daughters of early baby boomers are
having their own kids, but getting married first is a not
necessarily a perquisite to becoming a parent, the report shows.
</P>
<P>
   Births to unwed mothers, on the rise for years, hit an all-time
high in 1998 and accounted for nearly half of all babies born that
year, reported the National Center for Health Statistics. But
unlike the early 1990s, when teenagers were having children at
alarming rates, today's unwed mothers are more likely to be in
their 20s and 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers attribute the change to a big drop in teen births,
confidence in the booming economy and more relaxed attitudes about
unwed mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The social disapproval factor has definitely lessened,'' said
Stephanie Ventura, lead author of the report compiled from state
birth data.
</P>
<P>
   There were 3.94 million births in 1998, compared to 3.88 million
children born in 1997. The fertility rate, a measure of births
among women of child bearing age, was 65.6 births for every 1,000
females, up from 65 births per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   These were the first increases in births and fertility rates
since 1990, when 4.1 million children were born and the fertility
rate was 70.9 births per 1,000 women. Between 1990 and 1997, the
number of births fell 7 percent as women waited longer to have
children and teen births declined amid the availability of more
reliable contraceptives, an emphasis on abstinence and fears about
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1.29 million babies were born to single women in 1998, up 3
percent from the prior year and the highest number reported since
the government started collecting birth data in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the rise was a larger population of unmarried
women of child bearing age. The number of single women between 15
and 44 rose to 29.2 million women in 1998 from 28.6 million in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Unwed women in their 20s and 30s had higher birth rates, and
that was true for both white and black women. Birth rates for unwed
Hispanic women in that age group fell, the report showed.
</P>
<P>
   Birth rates for all women in the 20s and 30s was also on the
rise. After falling during the 1990s, the birth rate for women
between 20 and 24 -- the principal childbearing ages -- rose 1
percent to 111.2 births per 1,000. The rate for women aged 30 to 34
rose 2 percent to 87.4 births per 1,000 women -- the highest rate
since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Darroch, senior vice president for research at Alan
Guttmacher Institute, a private research group, said the rise in
unmarried moms doesn't necessarily mean that children don't have
fathers because many women are living with, but not marrying, their
partners.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nonmarried does not necessarily mean that it's the mother
alone without a father,'' said Darroch, citing a government study
that showed about 4 percent of women, or about 2.6 million, living
with partners.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shalala, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, said the trend was cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''The increase in births to unmarried mothers, as well as the
increase in teen mothers who smoke, are troubling,'' said Shalala.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings:
</P>
<P>
   -- Smoking among pregnant teens increased, especially among
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   -- The proportion of women beginning prenatal care in the first
trimester continued to rise -- an encouraging sign because early
care can increase the chances of having a healthy baby.
</P>
<P>
   -- Multiple births continued to increase, a phenomenon tied to
the use of fertility drugs and more older women giving birth.

<HEADLINE> 2d Computer Missing From Spy Agency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A laptop computer that contained training
information for one of Britain's spy agencies was mislaid in early
March and recovered by police two weeks later, the Foreign Office
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Office, which oversees the MI6 security service,
refused to comment on the incident other than to say that security
procedures have been tightened and that an investigation has been
launched.
</P>
<P>
   But news reports suggested that an M16 agent left the laptop in
a taxi after spending a night drinking at a bar near the agency's
headquarters on the Thames River.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in a month that a laptop containing
security service information had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   On March 4, a laptop with classified material on Northern
Ireland was snatched from a MI5 security service officer at
London's Paddington Station. It has not been found.
</P>
<P>
   MI6 is responsible for foreign intelligence and MI5 handles
internal security. Both agencies were warned that their ability to
gather secret intelligence could be compromised by the recent
security lapses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It goes right to the heart of intelligence and security,''
said Tom King, chairman of the Parliamentary Intelligence and
Security Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''People risk their lives in giving the information in the
confidence those agencies will keep it protected,'' King said. ''If
they don't, then it undermines the chances of getting such good
information in the future.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Official Criticizes China  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A purged senior Communist Party official has
protested to the Chinese government and the United Nations over
police surveillance and harassment that he says show China's
persisting violations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter whose public release Wednesday coincided with
efforts to censure China before the U.N. Human Rights Commission,
Bao Tong said teams of six people have followed his every move
since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The security agents have prevented guests from visiting his
Beijing home and even trailed him when he takes his granddaughter
to school, to the doctor's and to the store, said the letter dated
March 13 and sent to foreign media Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''My human rights are being violated. And if mine are, many
others must suffer from the same problem,'' Bao said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Bao, who has only occasionally broken his silence since being
released from custody three years ago, said he decided to speak out
after authorities failed to respond to his letter.
</P>
<P>
   The letter -- sent to the police, to the domestic spy agency, the
governing State Council and the U.N. high commissioner for human
rights -- appealed for an end to the harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am an old man and I have neither fear nor illusions, but I
feel obligated to confront such violations of a citizen's civil
rights, even if that means my own imprisonment,'' wrote Bao, who is
68.
</P>
<P>
   The most senior communist official jailed in the crackdown that
ended the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations in 1989, Bao
was a top aide to then party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang. Bao
spent seven years in jail plus 11 months in detention at a guest
house, apparently for leaking word of the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Bao strongly criticized a recently issued government report
describing improvements in China's respect for human rights, saying
it glossed over all negative aspects and provided a dishonest,
incomplete picture.
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal is to tell the government that its report just does
not report the real situation. It's entirely one-sided. If they
want to make a report, it should be factual, not just a whitewash
that excludes all the black,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   China released the report to try to head off criticism during
the U.N. Human Rights Commission meeting. The United States is
trying to persuade commission members to criticize China for
deteriorating respect for civil and religious freedoms. Human
rights groups are lobbying the commission as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bao Tong's arbitrary treatment shows just how little rule of
law means in China,'' said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director
for U.S.-based Human Rights Watch. ''He's out of jail but he's by
no means free.''
</P>
<P>
   Bao's previous public criticisms have all been met by police
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter addressed to top leaders in February 1999, Bao
warned that their failure to redress grievances from the
suppression of the Tiananmen protests was fueling popular
resentment. He condemned the use of troops to kill civilians as
shameful. Afterward, police warned him he was ''endangering state
security'' -- a charge that has been used to sentence dissidents to
lengthy jail terms.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Americans Pro-Global  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A study says a large majority of Americans
have surprisingly positive attitudes toward a growing globalization
trend attacked from both the right and left.
</P>
<P>
   While conservatives complain of a shift from American to global
values, and labor and environmental groups protest the growing
power of global economic institutions, the Program for
International Policy Attitudes concludes that Americans are warming
to the idea of an interconnected world. They generally support
global institutions, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small minority support resistance to globalization, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions are based on a sweeping review of polling data,
special group discussions held in three far-flung U.S. communities
and a nationwide poll conducted by the nonpartisan program, which
is associated with the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overall, Americans see globalization as somewhat more positive
than negative and appear to be growing more familiar with the
concept and more positive about it,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite support for free global trade, a strong majority feels
trade ''has not grown in a way that adequately incorporates
concerns for American workers, international labor standards and
the environment,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The study's own poll found that 61 percent supported
globalization, 35 percent said it should be slowed down or stopped,
and 76 percent supported free trade.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found 67 percent support for strengthening the United
Nations, 59 percent support for a stronger World Trade Organization
and 56 percent support for a stronger World Court. Support for a
stronger International Monetary Fund was at 44 percent, still
higher than the 36 percent who said it does not need to be
strengthened; 20 percent expressed no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The October poll of more than 1,800 people had an error margin
of 4 percentage points, less on some questions.
</P>
<P>
   The overall conclusions were based on other polls, as well, and
on ''focus group'' discussions held in Battle Creek, Mich., Dallas
and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings included:
</P>
<P>
   --Americans overwhelmingly support inclusion of environmental and
labor issues in trade negotiations and favor limiting trade with
countries that violate human rights.
</P>
<P>
   -- Americans are surprisingly accepting of other countries'
putting up barriers to American products based on such things as
health effects of genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   -- A strong majority favors continued trade with China and
opposes behavior to punish China, although it is unlikely that a
majority of Americans would favor granting China permanent normal
trading status or WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
   --Americans show nearly the same level of concern for suffering
inside and outside the United States. Most say they would play
higher prices for goods certified as not being made in sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate analysis that compares European attitudes, the
study says European views are similar on globalization. But it says
majorities of Europeans view foreign investment in their countries
as positive, while a modest majority of Americans view foreign
investment here as negative.
</P>
<P>
   And in a classic case of mirror image, overwhelming majorities
of Americans and Europeans view their own markets as being more
open to imports from the other side, the study says.

<HEADLINE> Philly Eyes Abandoned Car Plan  </HEADLINE>
By DAN ROBRISH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mayor John F. Street announced a drastic
plan Tuesday to rid his city of abandoned cars by having the police
tow away 1,000 a day for 40 working days.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the best idea I've heard in a long time,'' City
Councilman Michael Nutter told the Philadelphia Daily News. ''One
thousand cars a day is ambitious, but this is the kind of problem
that calls for ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of junkers haunt Philadelphia streets, often
sitting for years before being towed away. Some are left by car
thieves or dumped by unlicensed mechanics who strip them for parts;
others are just parked by owners who cannot afford to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   Drug dealers and prostitutes are known to use the abandoned
shells for business, and items left behind can pose dangers to
youngsters looking for places to play. Last spring, a 7-year-old
was killed by a gun he found under an abandoned car.
</P>
<P>
   Street's plan creates a complaint hot line and a centralized
police unit to deal with abandoned vehicles. At the end of the
eight-week program -- which begins next month -- the police
department's current abandoned vehicles program would be expanded
to ensure the blight doesn't return.

<HEADLINE> 44 Percent of Census Forms Returned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Early census returns show that 44 percent of
U.S. households had completed and mailed back their 2000 Census
forms as of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after most of the 115 million questionnaires were
mailed out, the Census Bureau is more than halfway toward their
goal of a mail response rate of 70 percent for this year's count.
</P>
<P>
   ''A national response rate of 70 percent would signal that the
country has reversed a decades-long decline in civic
participation,'' Census director Kenneth Prewitt said. The response
rate was 78 percent in 1970, 75 percent in 1980 and 65 percent in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials remain cautiously optimistic about the
response. They did several things differently this year to promote
the count, most notably a $168 million advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Nebraska had the highest
return rates as of Tuesday at 51 percent. Puerto Rico had the
slowest response rate at 24 percent, followed by Mississippi at 28
percent and Louisiana at 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Response rates for states, Puerto Rico and the District of
Columbia, as well as local communities, will be updated on the
Census Bureau's Web site at www.census.gov until April 18.

<HEADLINE> Anglican Leaders Try Closing Rift  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY HATTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) -- World Anglican leaders said Tuesday they
moved closer to quelling their dispute over acceptance of
homosexuality after a week of talks and cautioned the quarreling
sides to cool the rhetoric over the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   A final statement issued by the gathering said a ''careful,
patient and pastoral process must be encouraged; it is not created
by the demonizing of opponents or by overheated, politicized and
polarized language in our conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   While the disagreement over sexual ethics is a threat to church
unity, it ''does not necessarily amount to a complete and
definitive rupture,'' said the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is mainly between liberals in the Episcopal Church,
Anglicanism's U.S. branch, who say they cannot exclude homosexuals,
and conservatives demanding commitment to moral traditions.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting two years ago, Anglican leaders voted
overwhelmingly in support of a resolution that homosexuality is
''incompatible with Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Episcopal Church dioceses have disregarded that
resolution, ordaining homosexuals and blessing same-sex marriages,
on the grounds of Christian compassion and changes demanded by
modern circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Robin Eames, the gathering's spokesman, said the
meeting of archbishops representing 38 Anglican regions around the
world helped repair the doctrinal split because opposing sides
could explain their positions in detail.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have listened to each other, and we have also recognized
that there are parts of the world where in fact the person on the
spot has got to make decisions according to his particular
environment,'' Eames said.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said the church declined to issue an emphatic
ruling of respect for the diversity of its different dioceses.
</P>
<P>
   The Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, Frank Griswold,
said there had been ''a sense of healing and deepened communion,''
according to a separate written statement issued by the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added: ''It is troubling that sexuality took a
disproportionate amount of time, given the more drastic concerns of
poverty, world debt and genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegates also discussed an internal church report on how to
reconcile the church's diversity of cultures worldwide and each
culture's interpretations of Scripture.

<HEADLINE> Ex-60's Militant Charged in Slaying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, the 1960s black militant
once known as H. Rap Brown, was indicted on murder and aggravated
assault charges Tuesday in the March 16 shootings of two sheriff's
deputies who were trying to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   A Fulton County grand jury indicted Al-Amin on 13 counts, said
District Attorney Paul Howard. He said he hopes the indictment will
clear the way for Al-Amin, who was arrested last week in Alabama,
to be returned to Georgia in two to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, 56, is accused of killing Deputy Ricky Kinchen and
wounding Deputy Aldranon English as they tried to serve him with an
arrest warrant at his Atlanta grocery store after he failed to
appear in court on charges of receiving stolen property,
impersonating an officer and having no proof of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin is jailed in Montgomery, Ala., pending an extradition
request from Gov. Roy Barnes, who signed the request Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The documents are expected to arrive at the Alabama governor's
office on Wednesday, said Joselyn Butler, Barnes' press secretary.

<HEADLINE> 2 New Complaints Filed Vs. Pinochet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Though he avoided extradition to Spain on
human rights charges, former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet is
facing a growing number of criminal complaints at home over alleged
abuses during his 1973-1990 rule.
</P>
<P>
   The number of complaints climbed to 80 Tuesday as lawyer Nelson
Caucoto filed papers with the Santiago Court of Appeals over the
1975 disappearance and presumed killing of three socialists.
</P>
<P>
   The three were arrested by Pinochet's security police in June of
that year and never heard from since, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 3,191 people were killed or disappeared and were never
heard from again during Pinochet's 1973-90 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet returned March 3 from a 16-month arrest in London,
where he fought extradition to Spain to stand trial for human
rights abuses. He was released on health grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Since his return, he has remained out of the public view, except
for a couple of hospital visits for tests, and has not commented on
the avalanche of legal actions against him.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those complaints, a judge has asked the Santiago Court
of Appeals to strip Pinochet of the immunity he has as a member of
the Chilean senate, so he can stand trial.

<HEADLINE> Stolen Czar's Dagger Found in CA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A 19th century dagger once owned by a Russian
czar that was stolen from the oceanliner Queen Mary was found by a
Hollywood pay phone early Tuesday after an anonymous tip.
</P>
<P>
   The thief apparently ditched the dagger and its sheath, valued
at $50,000, when it became clear that the high-profile item could
not be sold, said police Sgt. Bob Brophy.
</P>
<P>
   ''They couldn't do anything with it, so they just left it some
place where it could be located,'' Brophy speculated.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-inch dagger, featuring a curved blade and gold handle set
with emeralds and turquoise, and its gold-plated and jeweled sheath
were on display aboard the Queen Mary, now permanently docked in
Long Beach as a tourist attraction and hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, on loan from the Russian Museum of Ethnography in
St. Petersburg, consists of presents given to the last czars of
imperial Russia. Alexander III received the dagger in 1883 as a
gift from the Emir of Bukhara, an area northeast of Iran and Iraq
that now is called Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   A security guard noticed the dagger was missing Sunday
afternoon. The theft and pictures of the dagger were publicized
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court quizzes mall owners on rights of protesters  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Just because they couldn't afford a $1
million insurance policy is no reason to block members of a
grassroots political party from talking to shopping mall customers,
the group's lawyer told the state Supreme Court on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Frank Askin argued that the Mall at Mill Creek in
Secaucus had an obligation to allow the Green Party of New Jersey
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Green Party members contend that the insurance policy was
restrictive and its $665 price tag cost them their right to free
speech. A trial court agreed. But in August an appeals court said
mall owners were justified in requiring the insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   But, Askin argued Tuesday, since shopping malls have replaced
main streets, groups like the Green Party have no place else to go
to spread their message.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have made themselves into the new town square,'' said
Askin, an attorney with the Rutgers Law School Constitutional
Litigation Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now they (malls) have to demonstrate some substantial need
that overcomes the fundamental and precious need for
communication,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court justices questioned the shopping mall's lawyer
about free speech, insurance costs and liability agreements.
</P>
<P>
   But in two hours of oral arguments, justices kept coming back to
this: How is a person who hands out political leaflets different
than a teen who comes to the mall just to hang out? Or an adult who
wants to watch a movie? Or a senior citizen looking for
companionship?
</P>
<P>
   ''You're referring to this leafleteer almost as an alien,''
Justice Peter G. Verniero told the mall's lawyer. ''You don't
really care why someone comes into the store as long as they are
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Green Party members wanted to distribute information and ask
people to sign a petition for their 1996 presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Curtis L. Michael, representing the mall, said management
requires every group who comes into the mall to get the insurance
policy. But when questioned by the court, Michael admitted that in
the 14 years the mall has been open, no one has ever filed a claim
against any of the groups using the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Since the appellate ruling, mall managers have developed several
options, including a $250 permit, Michael told the court.
</P>
<P>
   Justices returned again and again to the mall's open invitation
to all members of the public. They wanted to know about window
shoppers and teens who had no intention of making purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ''These malls are built for crowds. I really don't see a
leafleteer being any different than a member of a crowd,'' Justice
Daniel J. O'Hern said.
</P>
<P>
   But political activists aren't necessarily shoppers, Michael
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mall is designed to attract people who the mall hopes are
ultimately shoppers,'' he said. ''When the leafleteers come,
they're there for their own agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   That answer was not enough for Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't see how you can distinguish this group from all
the other groups,'' Poritz said.
</P>
<P>
   The court heard arguments only. Justices offered no decision or
a date when a ruling would be announced.
</P>
<P>
   Several times during the course of Tuesday's session, justices
asked both sides if the court should send the matter back to a
lower court for more hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero and other justices asked why the mall just doesn't add
the groups to its general insurance policy and consider it ''the
cost of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   Municipalities are not burdened by the costs associated with
parades and demonstrations, said attorney James M. Hirschhorn of
the International Council of Shopping Centers. Those costs are
spread out to taxpayers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are part of the general public. We should not be more
burdened than the general public,'' Hirschhorn said.

<HEADLINE> Return for Bosnia Refugees Sought  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Bosnian refugees could
return home this year if the international community would cut
through bureaucracy and supply them with homebuilding materials, a
Bosnian presidential adviser said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Security has improved to the point where refugees could soon go
back to their homes in 80 percent of the country, said Mirza
Hajric, adviser to Alija Izetbegovic, the Muslim representative of
Bosnia's joint presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Hajric was on a U.S. visit to drum up support for the refugees
and the nation's economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they need is not some planning, not endless bureaucracy --
what they need is a bulk of building material waiting for them upon
arrival because within two to three weeks they can build their own
houses themselves,'' Hajric said.
</P>
<P>
   He said repatriation in previous years to undo the effects of
ethnic cleansing has been slow and expensive because of the many
stages of refugee assistance. Donor nations give money to
international organizations, which plan housing projects and hire
construction companies, which in turn build the houses -- each step
taking months.
</P>
<P>
   Hajric is also an adviser for the implementation of the 1995
Dayton peace accords, which ended the 3{-year war in Bosnia, the
worse bloodletting in Europe since World War II. Some 200,000
Bosnians died or are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Smoldering mistrust has kept over one million refugees from
returning to their homes in areas controlled by former wartime
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a recent report that
the nation had made progress in restructuring its police,
identifying weaknesses in its judicial system and other areas. But
in a briefing on the report last week, Assistant Secretary-General
Hedi Annabi said progress on implementing the 1995 accord has been
slow and met powerful resistance from nationalists determined to
preserve ethnic divisions.

<HEADLINE> Tuesday's Commodity Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By HERBERT G. McCANN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reports OPEC member nations had agreed to increase petroleum
output by about 7 percent sent crude oil futures tumbling in
trading Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures prices fell, and
cocoa futures prices increased.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ignored
objections of its second-biggest member and agreed early Wednesday
to increase oil production.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare departure from its consensus approach, ministers of
the 11-nation cartel announced that nine members would raise
production by 6.3 percent, or a total of 1.45 million barrels a day
beginning April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said a much larger increase would be needed bring
down crude oil prices that have tripled over the past 12 months and
sent U.S. gasoline prices up 60 percent to nearly $1.60 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had been lobbying for a rise of 2
million to 2.5 million barrels a day. Saudi Arabia, OPEC's leading
producer, advocated raising production by 1.7 million barrels a
day, but Iran said output should be increased no more than 1
million barrels day.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came after a two-day meeting in Vienna,
Austria, to decide whether to extend production cuts it made in
1998 and 1999 that have propelled oil prices to their highest
levels since the 1991 Gulf War. The latest round of cuts expire at
the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC currently is producing 26.6 million barrels of crude daily,
about 1 million barrels above its 25.6 million barrel target set
last March. An increase of 1.7 million barrels would reverse those
curbs, which have caused U.S. oil prices to triple to a March 8
peak of $34.37 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Because the cartel is currently exceeding its production level,
it is not likely to increase current production by a full 1.7
million barrels, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Evans, an analyst with Pegasus Econometrics Group, said the
increase, if coupled with a planned increase of Iraqi output to 3.1
million barrels from 2.4 million, would barely be enough to create
a slight supply-and-demand surplus for the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would have relief in the short term, but would be back in a
deficit by the third quarter, when demand picks up seasonally,''
Evans said. ''It does not completely let consumers off the hook. As
an indication of that, April and May heating oil shows a gain on
the day, April gasoline had a gain on the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Light sweet crude for May delivery settled 70 cents lower at
$27.09 a barrel; April heating oil was .43 cent higher at 74.16
cents a gallon; April unleaded gasoline was .49 cent higher at
95.18 cents a gallon; April natural gas was 4.9 cents higher at
$2.963 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   May Brent crude oil was 17 cents lower at $25.51 a barrel on
London's International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, after the close of trading, the American Petroleum
Institute released a weekly inventory report showing moderate
drawdowns on crude stores, while gasoline inventories rose
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. crude oil stockpiles declined by 1.236 million barrels in
the week ended March 24, to 291.950 million barrels from a revised
293.186 million barrels the previous week, according to API.
</P>
<P>
   Unleaded gasoline stocks grew by 299,000 barrels to 198.533
million barrels, API said. Refineries operated at 90.4 percent
capacity, up from 90.1 the week before.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts of normal to above-normal rainfall in the Midwest over
the next week sent grain and soybean futures prices tumbling on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service's six- to 10-day forecast raised
concerns in the market that an extended period of dryness in the
Midwest is ending.
</P>
<P>
   The increased precipitation should give the corn crop a good
start once planting gets underway in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat futures prices fell as conditions for the hard red winter
crop improved. Wheat futures prices also were hurt by corn's
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean futures prices fell as commodity funds liquidated their
holdings in anticipation of a drop in futures prices due to
improving weather.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery was 4} cents lower at $2.49{ a bushel;
May corn was 7{ cents lower at $2.25 a bushel; May oats were 3\
cents lower at $1.18{ a bushel; May soybeans were 5 cents lower at
$5.26{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   A threat by Ivory Coast growers to hold back cocoa from the
market in a bid to force the government to implement a price
stabilization plan gave a boost to futures traded on New York's
Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   May cocoa was $18 higher at $815 a metric ton.

<HEADLINE> NYC Lawyer Sues Ramseys for Libel  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A New York lawyer who tried to force Colorado
prosecutors to charge the mother of JonBenet Ramsey with murder has
filed a $25 million libel and defamation suit against the child's
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Darnay Hoffman claims in court papers that John and Patsy Ramsey
defamed him in their book by portraying him as an ''irresponsible,
ethically challenged attorney, unfit to practice his profession.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys' lawyer, Lin Wood, called the lawsuit ''frivolous''
and predicted that it will be thrown out of court. Wood said he
will also ask the court to levy sanctions against Hoffman for
filing the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The book -- ''The Death of Innocence: The Untold Story of
JonBenet's Murder and How Its Exploitation Compromised the Pursuit
of Truth'' -- recounts, from the Ramseys' point of view, the
aftermath of JonBenet's murder on Dec. 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman says experts told him the handwriting on ransom notes
that the parents got after the child's death matched Patsy
Ramsey's. He sued Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter to force
him to indict Patsy Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's lawsuit was thrown out of court on the grounds that he
was not a Colorado citizen and did not have standing to sue.
</P>
<P>
   In their book, Hoffman says, the Ramseys say his ''so-called
experts'' had bogus credentials and that he was staging a legal
''sideshow,'' although he knew Patsy Ramsey had nothing to do with
the ransom note.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Hoffman contends the book injured ''his good
name and character in his community and in his professional
standing and reputation,'' and he demands $25 million.

<HEADLINE> Wrong-Way Driver Said Suicidal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKLIN, Ind. (AP) -- The ex-husband of a woman suspected of
causing a car crash that killed seven people said she intended to
kill herself and the couple's children.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Kirby said in Tuesday's Daily Journal of Johnson County that
he believed Judy Kirby wanted to prevent him from gaining custody
of their children.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators could not explain why Ms. Kirby had driven 1.7
miles in the wrong direction before the fatal collision with a
minivan Saturday near Martinsville. She passed four possible
turnoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the minivan and two of his children died, along
with three of the Kirbys' children and a nephew of Ms. Kirby whom
she had just adopted as her own son.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kirby was one of only two survivors. She was in serious
condition today at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kirby had been hospitalized for depression within the last
two weeks and had told two sons that she planned to commit suicide,
Kirby said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her family is not going to agree with this and what I'm
saying, that she meant to do this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kirby's mother and sister acknowledged she had psychological
problems, but said she never mentioned killing herself.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was crying constantly. She'd just look at you and bust out
crying,'' her older sister, Kathy Walker, told the Daily Journal.
''We've been watching her day and night.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Ms. Kirby was hospitalized for three days at St.
Francis Hospital for ''physical and mental problems,'' Kirby said.
Kirby said he did not learn of the suicide comment until after the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they were investigating the suicide theory.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not discounting any theories,'' said sheriff's Detective
Sgt. Scott Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby said the couple divorced six years ago and had been locked
in a custody dispute over their five children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kirby had custody of 11 children -- the five from her
marriage with Kirby, five from another relationship and the nephew
she had just adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ''She led me to believe she was going to let me have all the
kids,'' Kirby said. ''She put me off another week and then this
happened.''

<HEADLINE> Hoffa Addresses Congress  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers told Teamsters President James P.
Hoffa on Tuesday that he needs to quell violence surrounding the
union's efforts to organize workers at a Virginia trucking company.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa insisted the job action against Overnite Transportation
Co. is peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's going on down there is not helping any of us,'' said
Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The Richmond, Va.-based ground cargo company contends that 45
shootings have occurred at more than a dozen of its locations
around the country. About half were reported near the Memphis,
Tenn., terminal, where an Overnite driver was shot in the stomach
last December. He survived.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, appearing before a subcommittee of the House Education
and the Workforce Committee, denied the Teamsters were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is one of the most peaceful strikes in our history,'' he
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted a response from Rep. Van Hilleary, R-Tenn., who
said 45 shootings ''sounds pretty violent to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa claimed Overnite is engaged in a ''smear campaign''
against the Teamsters to try to keep workers from unionizing. He
said union organizers have been instructed not to engage in
violence as they try to sign up workers.
</P>
<P>
   Overnite Senior Vice President Mark Goodwin said he has police
reports and other records to document the violence. He denied the
company is trying to smear the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Overnite competes in the less-than-truckload market,
consolidating small shipments. The company has terminals in the
United States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters began organizing strike tactics against the
company last October, after a five-year union-organizing campaign.
Fewer than 15 percent of the company's 13,000 employees have joined
the picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Overnite problem, the lawmakers largely praised
Hoffa's one-year reign as head of the 1.4 million-member union.
They offered support when Hoffa said the Teamsters should win back
their independence after 11 years of oversight by the federal
government. The union agreed to the oversight to avoid federal
racketeering charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Teamsters should be cut loose,'' said Rep. Peter Hoekstra,
R-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and
investigations. He cited the high cost to union members of paying
for federal monitoring, which the union says now totals about $80
million.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa said he has been given no indication the Justice
Department will step aside.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's father, Jimmy Hoffa, built the Teamsters into a national
powerhouse but was sent to prison for jury tampering and misusing
union funds. He disappeared in 1975 and is presumed a victim of
organized crime.

<HEADLINE> FBI Sharpshooter Case Dismissal OKd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- A federal judge presiding over a lawsuit
against the government for wrongful death in the 1993 Branch
Davidian siege has granted a plaintiffs' request to dismiss their
case against an FBI sharpshooter.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith, in a brief order filed
Tuesday, said the motion to dismiss the case against FBI
sharpshooter Lon Horiuchi because of insufficient evidence ''has
merit and should be granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Horiuchi was the only named defendant in the Davidians' civil
lawsuit, scheduled for trial in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Michael Caddell, the lead counsel for most of
the Branch Davidian plaintiffs, said a forensic analysis of spent
shell casings found at the sniper outpost Horiuchi's team occupied
indicate ATF agents ''most likely'' fired the bullets during the
initial Feb. 28, 1993, gun battle that sparked the 51-day siege --
not Horiuchi or his FBI colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But another group of Davidians, represented by former Attorney
General Ramsey Clark, disagreed with Caddell's request, saying in a
motion filed Monday that it would be ''premature'' to dismiss
Horiuchi, who gained notoriety in 1992 when he killed the wife of
white separatist Randy Weaver during the standoff at Ruby Ridge,
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ''The facts are not fully known and are being developed,'' the
motion says, noting that the government's conduct at Waco remains
under ''intense investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark could not be reached for Tuesday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell has stressed that the move to dismiss the claims against
Horiuchi doesn't diminish the plaintiffs' view that other FBI
agents directed gunfire at the Branch Davidians' retreat during the
standoff's final, deadly hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''This in no way undermines or alters our strong belief that
government agents, almost certainly (FBI Hostage Rescue Team)
members, directed gunfire at the back of Mount Carmel, from
positions that were not observable by the press or the FBI
leadership in Washington,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of Smith's ruling, Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin
said: ''It's another due element in the case with which we are
pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks ago, Horiuchi's government lawyers filed a motion
saying there is not a ''shred of evidence'' that he fired his
weapon on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials insist no government personnel, civilian or
military, fired shots in the waning hours of the Waco siege, when
the FBI initiated a tank-and-tear gas operation designed to flush
the Davidians from their retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died during
the inferno that consumed the compound several hours into the
tear-gassing operation. Some died from the fire, others from
gunshot wounds that federal authorities say the Davidians
inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   The Davidian plaintiffs contend FBI infrared surveillance
footage taken April 19 captured bursts of light that can be nothing
but muzzle blasts directed from government positions into the
burning building -- a contention the government denies.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on Tuesday, Caddell said Attorney General Janet
Reno testified that she never gave approval for tanks to demolish
the Davidians compound and didn't believe the FBI intentionally did
so.
</P>
<P>
   After emerging from the rare deposition of an attorney general,
Caddell said Reno was less than forthcoming in discussing whether
the FBI intended to dismantle the complex during its tear-gassing
operation -- an interpretation rejected by Reno's aides.

<HEADLINE> Pope Visit Aids Israel Church View  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli public's views on the Catholic
Church and Christianity improved considerably as a result of Pope
John Paul II's visit to the Holy Land, according to a survey
published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's visits to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial and the
Western Wall were key in creating a favorable climate, said
pollsters at Bar-Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
   At Yad Vashem, the pope paid tribute to the six million Jews
killed in the Nazi genocide. At the wall, he asked for forgiveness
for the persecution of Jews by Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those high-profile events, 62 percent of 502
respondents said they felt Christians had a positive attitude
toward the Jewish people, compared to 55 percent who believed this
before the pope arrived for his six-day trip on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   Also, 47 percent of those surveyed after the visit said the
Catholic Church viewed Israel positively, up from 39 percent
earlier this month. The margin of error was 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The religions share a strained past marred by persecution of
Jews by Christians throughout history, from the Crusades to the
Inquisition to the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's historic trip here -- the first by a pope since 1964
-- was considered a watershed in Catholic-Jewish relations.

<HEADLINE> India 'Most Wanted' Producer Held  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- The producer of the television crime
show ''India's Most Wanted'' was arrested Tuesday on charges
related to his wife's death, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The show, modeled on ''America's Most Wanted,'' re-enacts crimes
and asks viewers to phone in tips about suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Shoaib Mohammad Ilyasi was arrested after his wife's
sister told authorities that he caused his wife ''tremendous mental
harassment,'' police joint commissioner R.K. Niyogi said in an
interview broadcast by private STAR-TV. ''We had no other option
but to arrest him.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Anju Ilyasi, died of self-inflicted stab wounds on
Jan. 10, the Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
   Ilyasi allegedly harassed his wife to get more dowry money from
her relatives. He was charged with harassment and destroying
evidence, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of husbands pressuring wives to get more money is
widespread in India. If convicted, Ilyasi could be imprisoned for
up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ilyasi, who is constantly guarded by two policemen following
death threats because of his television program, told police that
his wife stabbed herself with a butcher's knife while he was in an
adjoining room. He said they had argued over his friendship with a
local businessman.

<HEADLINE> China Warns Taiwan Leader on Trips  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China warned the United States Tuesday not to
allow a visit by Taiwan president-elect Chen Shui-bian, saying he
should not be welcomed by any country which has diplomatic
relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Senator Frank Murkowski said last week he would support a
visit by the president-elect to the United States before Chen's May
20 inauguration, when it would still be an unofficial visit.
</P>
<P>
   But even that would likely enrage China -- which regards Taiwan
as a Chinese territory with no right to independent diplomatic
relations. Sun Yuxi, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, hinted
that countries which allow Chen to visit could see their ties with
Beijing affected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are opposed to any country that has diplomatic relations
with us having official contacts with Taiwan,'' Sun said at a
regular briefing for reporters. ''We hope that they can honor their
commitments and not let Chen Shui-bian visit at any time in any
form.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen has sought to avoid antagonizing Beijing since his March 18
victory and has not said much about traveling abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, said that if Chen visits
before he takes office in May, he wouldn't be coming as ''head of
state or head of the province.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's quite appropriate and I would support that,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Mother of four tells ''small stories'' to prevent war  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Claire Schaeffer-Duffy tells what she calls
''the small stories'' of war and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   They are stories about a broken relationship between teacher and
student, about children without a peaceful street where they can
sing, about the difficulty of simply getting children ready for
school, or sharing a family meal.
</P>
<P>
   ''That kind of war-making doesn't get a lot of play,'' said
Schaeffer-Duffy, a mother of four from Worcester, Mass., who has
traveled three times to Bosnia to photograph and write about the
rebuilding after the war. Many Americans ''have a very sterile
understanding about what war's about ... Usually the presentation
you get is rapid,'' she said -- a few seconds on television; a
single photo.
</P>
<P>
   She visits Kozarac, where the first major expelling of Muslims
took place in 1992. Thousands of Muslims died. Schaeffer-Duffy
interviews survivors to document how they are restoring their lives
months after the Balkans faded from headlines and most minds.
</P>
<P>
   The stories and photographs she shares with college students and
other audiences replace the maps, statistics and politicians of the
conflict with average people trying to rebuild their homes:
</P>
<P>
   --A wrinkled couple smiles, sipping coffee at a table covered in
lace. Behind them is a boarded-up door and a partially
reconstructed home.
</P>
<P>
   --A mother holds a T-shirt that reads, ''I will not raise my
child to kill your child.''
</P>
<P>
   --A Bosnian grammar school teacher walks down the main street and
suddenly grows quiet as a former student and one-time employee of
her husband passes. They have nothing left to say. In the war, he
helped burn Muslim homes.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer-Duffy went first in May 1998 because she was moved by
the story of a Muslim woman saved by a Serb soldier, and has
focused especially on the role of women in rebuilding the
community.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, hundreds of Muslims returned to their pre-war homes in
Kozarac, living side-by-side with their pre-war Serb neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who returned were elderly women.
</P>
<P>
   She said that in her own home, ''There are so many hours
consumed keeping just relative order ... I am fatigued by what I
have to do here. I had empathy for how these women had to begin
again and what they must be thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The domestic routines like getting children ready for school,
cleaning, eating together are typically destroyed for those who
make it through war.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's what war actually means for most people -- that disruption
of intimate space,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On her last trip, in October 1999, she said, that had visibly
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really wonderful -- a school reopened which I would have
said in May wouldn't reopen,'' Schaeffer-Duffy said. ''The most
memorable sight to see on the main street is children with
backpacks and the place looking gloriously ordinary.''

<HEADLINE> Molinari, Paxon host fund-raiser for Giuliani  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani raked in
more than $100,000 for his U.S. Senate bid at a Capitol Hill
fund-raiser Tuesday night hosted by Republican power couple Bill
Paxon and Susan Molinari.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain put in a brief appearance and nearly stole the
limelight from the mayor. The former GOP presidential candidate
said he expects to campaign with Giuliani in New York next week.
Giuliani endorsed Texas Gov. George W. Bush for president, but
bucked other state Republicans in the days leading up the New York
primary by refusing to attack McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought of Giuliani's handling of the police
shooting in New York City of Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed black
man, McCain said Tuesday he hadn't been paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been experiencing withdrawal from my defeat,'' McCain
said. ''I've been spending all my time on the phone to Betty Ford's
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has drawn criticism for releasing Dorismond's criminal
record, including a previously sealed juvenile record which showed
an arrest when he was 13.
</P>
<P>
   But the Congressional Republicans and Washington lobbyists that
paid $500 per person and $1,000 per political action committee to
mingle in a wood-paneled room at the American Legion Hall on
Capitol Hill were more supportive. Asked by one donor about the
shooting, Giuliani spoke for about 10 minutes, attacking the media
and explaining that he released the information to counter the
perception that Dorismond was blameless.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prejudice is to immediately exaggerate what the police
did,'' Giuliani said. ''There are facts to suggest the police were
just doing their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Dorismond weren't the only reminders of New York
for the mayor. With Frank Sinatra playing on the stereo, donors
feasted on an Italian buffet driven to Washington from La Fontana,
a Staten Island restaurant popular with Giuliani and Molinari.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a terrific mayor and we want to get him elected to the
Senate,'' Molinari, the former congresswoman from Staten Island,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since retiring from Congress, Paxon and Molinari have remained
active in the Washington political scene. Paxon, who represented
western New York, left the House after being implicated in a failed
coup to oust then-Speaker Newt Gingrich. Paxon is now a lobbyist at
Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld, one of Washington's largest
firms, and is a trusted adviser to House Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stint as host of a Saturday morning talk show on
CBS, Molinari opened her own lobbying firm and works part-time at
Fleishman-Hillard, a public relations company.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has raised $11.8 million for his U.S. Senate bid and
although he has not formally announced his candidacy has indicated
he is running. His Democratic rival Hillary Rodham Clinton has
raised $8 million, according to the last federal election filing.

<HEADLINE> Intruder Nabbed on White House Lawn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secret Service agents apprehended a man who
jumped a gate at the White House just as President Clinton was
scheduled to leave the grounds Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The intruder was not armed and was caught immediately, Secret
Service spokesman Jim Mackin said. The jump apparently was not
politically motivated and was unrelated to the visit of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Mackin said. Mubarak is staying at Blair
House, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Mackin would not release the man's name pending the probable
filing of criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   As a presidential motorcade idled on a driveway at the rear of
the house, Secret Service agents clad head-to-toe in combat black
suddenly appeared with large guns drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who were accompanying Clinton to two evening
fund-raising appearances saw the activity at about 6:25 p.m. but
did not see the intruder. Clinton was scheduled to have left the
White House at 6:15 but was running late.
</P>
<P>
   Mackin said the arrest did not affect Clinton's schedule. He
would not say whether Clinton knew of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The intruder scaled an automobile gate at the Southeast corner
of the White House grounds, Mackin said. The gate is steps away
from a guard house staffed by armed agents.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Forces Evacuations in Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Hundreds of people living near an active volcano in
northern Japan were evacuated overnight after officials issued a
warning that it could erupt, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 900 tremors have shaken Mount Usu, on Hokkaido island,
over the past three days. The strongest of the quakes -- with an
estimated magnitude of 3.4 -- hit the mountain early Wednesday,
sparking the warning, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Meteorological Agency issued its first warning of a
possible eruption on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Three towns with a combined population of 51,300 are located
near the 2,416-foot mountain, 475 miles north of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 271 people were evacuated late Tuesday from Date
city, located 3.7 miles from the peak, and taken to city-run
facilities, said city spokesman Katsuhiro Morita.
</P>
<P>
   About half had chosen to be evacuated, while the others -- all
138 residents of two homes for the elderly -- were asked to
evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   The meteorological agency sent three volcano experts to the
scene and plans to set up more quake-monitoring devices around the
mountain, national broadcaster NHK said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said there was no sign on Tuesday of movement in the
volcano's magma. On Wednesday authorities said that the top of the
mountain was obscured by cloud.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain last erupted in 1978, killing two and destroying
196 homes, said Takaharu Kiriyama, a spokesman for the National
Land Agency.

<HEADLINE> ABC TV Head To Lead WebMD Health  </HEADLINE>
By GARY GENTILE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ABC TV President Patricia Fili-Krushel, the
first female president of a major television network, will leave to
become president and chief operating officer of Web/MD Health, the
biggest of the health-care Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel resigned from ABC Tuesday and will start her new
job with the consumer division of Healtheon/WebMD Corp. on April 10
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Wallau, president of administration and operations at the
network, will assume Fili-Krushel's duties until a replacement can
be named.
</P>
<P>
   In her new position, Fili-Krushel will oversee the company's
flagship Web site and the Health Network cable channel, which will
soon be renamed WebMD Television. She will report directly to Jeff
Arnold, chief executive officer at Healtheon/WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   She also will be responsible for developing two 30-minute
television shows for the Fox network and for overseeing other joint
ventures with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which owns Fox and
earlier this year made a $1 billion investment in Healtheon/WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel has been with ABC since 1993 and was named
president in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to woo Fili-Krushel began three weeks ago as she was in
the midst of planning a move from New York to Los Angeles. Walt
Disney Co., which owns ABC, requires most senior ABC executives to
live in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel's reluctance to relocate was well known within
Disney, and she said the ability to stay in New York was ''a
factor, but not the factor'' in deciding to leave ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ''The network is in great shape,'' Fili-Krushel said.
''Financially, it is exponentially stronger. Then Jeff and his team
came to me with this fabulous opportunity to move into the world of
new media.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her new job also returns her to her roots developing
television programs for a female audience.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining ABC, she was in charge of programming at
Lifetime, a cable network aimed at women. Arnold said WebMD appeals
largely to a female audience because ''80 percent of health care
decisions are made by women.''
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Lifetime, Fili-Krushel spent nine years producing
films, rock concerts and sports broadcasts for HBO, a division of
Time-Warner.
</P>
<P>
   At ABC, she has presided over a ratings turnaround, including
the premiere of the wildly successful game show, ''Who Wants to be
a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Her departure comes at a critical time for Disney, which has
experienced some high-profile departures in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   In January, studio chief Joe Roth quit to start his own film
company. Others leaving in recent years include chief financial
officers Steve Bollenbach and Richard Nanula, ABC TV and radio
station chief Steve Burke and cable programming boss Geraldine
Laybourne.
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel said her decision to leave ABC was not caused by
any dissatisfaction at Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have anything bad to say about the company or the
people who run the company,'' she said. ''They were very gracious
about letting me leave to pursue this opportunity, which I was very
passionate about.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just felt like the right decision. I usually make moves
when I'm at the pinnacle of where I am. I like to be in a growth
business, which is a lot more challenging and fun to run than a
mature business.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Urged To Aid on Indian Issues  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN BARRETT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) -- The U.S. Civil Rights Commission
released a report Tuesday saying the FBI and other law enforcement
agencies must work to change American Indians' dim view of how
justice is meted out in the state, saying racial tensions in South
Dakota are extraordinarily high.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not been in an area where the divide and the suspicion
between racial groups is as great as it is in South Dakota,'' said
Cruz Reynoso, vice chairman of the commission, adding the
fact-finding group has held hearings in New York City and Los
Angeles after racially polarizing events there.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting the divide, several Indians held up a banner in the
back of the meeting room that read ''Stop Lakota Ethnic
Cleansing,'' a reference to a branch of the Sioux tribe that has
complained of human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The report urges Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint a task
force to address claims that race dictates how authorities
investigate and prosecute criminal cases. The task force should
have the power to issue subpoenas, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommends hate-crimes legislation at the state
level and stronger federal hate-crimes measures to deal with
race-related crime.
</P>
<P>
   And it urges Gov. Bill Janklow to convene a summit with Indian
groups to come up with legislation to make state government more
responsive their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Janklow spokesman Bob Mercer said he had not seen the report and
could not say whether the governor would agree to a summit.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was prompted by unrest over the deaths of several
Indians, including one who died after being stuffed into a garbage
can in Mobridge following a night of heavy drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the deaths remain unsolved, and in others, serious
charges against white suspects have been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Burrus, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's
Minneapolis office, which oversees South Dakota, said the
commissioners' two-day visit to the state in December was too brief
to provide a clear view of the relationship between law enforcement
and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our agents are very comfortable with native Americans,'' he
said. ''Native Americans and non-native Americans have a lot of
confidence in the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians frequently call on the FBI for help, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They basically tar every agent in South Dakota,'' he said of
the report's authors. ''It's a vote of no confidence, and I think
that's just wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Guiliani Sued Over Records Release  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The city's public advocate asked a judge Tuesday
to determine whether Mayor Rudolph Giuliani broke the law when he
released sealed criminal records of a man who was fatally shot
during a confrontation with police.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Green also asked the court to determine how Giuliani and
his police commissioner, Howard Safir, obtained the information.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way these records, under the law, can be publicly
released is by a court order, not a mayoral fiat,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Green said he's not seeking any penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal is that if a court rules that the mayor acted
illegally and abused his power, this will stop him from doing this
again,'' Green said. ''No mayor should unilaterally decide to do it
because it politically advantages him in a public controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of Green's attempt to declare the release of the records
illegal, Giuliani responded: ''I'm willing to defend it anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Dorismond, 26, was shot March 16 in Manhattan after
undercover officers asked him if he knew where they could buy
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the shooting, Dorismond's criminal records -- a
robbery arrest at age 13, and adult arrests for gun possession and
assault -- were given out at a City Hall press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Tuesday that the records came from the police
department and that the Corporation Counsel, the city's legal arm,
had advised him it was legal to release them because privacy rights
end with death.
</P>
<P>
   However, Giuliani acknowledged that the law does not explicitly
authorize the post-mortem release of sealed records. ''It is silent
on that,'' Giuliani conceded. ''So the area is clearly ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   Green disagreed. ''The records are sealed, and there is nothing
in any statute that this ends with the death of a person,'' Green
said.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on whether Green's case should proceed was scheduled
for April 13.

Premiers Expecting Restoration of Health Funding
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Premiers agreed in a conference call Tuesday to
expect a firm commitment on restoring cash transfers when their
health ministers meet Health Minister Allan Rock this week.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 premiers agreed that funding should be the top item on
the agenda at the Toronto meeting, said a provincial source.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was unanimity on the part of all premiers about the
restoration of federal dollars,'' said the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for premiers to plot common strategy in advance of
a health ministers conference; that they are doing so signals the
priority they attach to the funding issue.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa sees the meeting as an informal working retreat in
preparation for a more formal meeting in May.

Judge Urges Ellard Trial Jury To Scrutinize Evidence
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The teen-age girl accused of
killing 14-year-old Reena Virk sat still and silent in the
prisoner's box Tuesday as the judge presiding over her trial
instructed the jury that will decide her fate.
</P>
<P>
   As she has done throughout her trial, Kelly Ellard fixed her
eyes on the floor in front of her while Justice Nancy Morrison
advised the six men and six women to scrutinize the evidence of 32
witnesses who testified.
</P>
<P>
   The British Columbia Supreme Court judge told jurors to consider
their behavior and body language, whether they were intoxicated,
even their eyesight.
</P>
<P>
   Ellard is the last of eight teens charged in the beating and
drowning death of Virk in November 1997.

British Columbia Budget Assumes Gas Price Rise
</P>
<P>
   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- The British Columbia
government is preparing for gasoline prices rising to nearly $1 per
liter this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The provincial budget tabled Monday assumes gasoline prices
could rise by 20 cents a liter and diesel fuel by 10 cents a liter
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Paul Ramsey thought the fuel price assumptions
were typographical errors but confirmed the numbers after checking
with Finance Ministry bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices are currently about 72 cents a liter in British
Columbia, while diesel fuel costs are about 35 cents a liter
</P>
<P>
   The rising fuel costs will affect provincial ferry service and
highway maintenance and construction costs, said a budget risk
chart.
</P>
<P>
   Every one cent per liter rise in gasoline prices increases
equipment operating costs by $27,000 a year. Higher diesel fuel
costs will increase operating costs for the ferry service.

Judge Rules To Admit Key Police Tapes in Ludwig Trial
</P>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Scratchy audio tapes secretly recorded
by the RCMP were entered as evidence at Wiebo Ludwig's oilpatch
vandalism trial Tuesday, giving the prosecution's case a major
boost.
</P>
<P>
   The Crown continued its case with a description of how a well
was encased in concrete studded with shotgun shells and left with a
note invoicing its owner for $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sterling Sanderman said he will treat the hours of
poor-quality, often unintelligible audio with caution since he must
be sure of their meaning. He is hearing the trial without a jury.
</P>
<P>
   The RCMP used informant Robert Wraight to secretly record 30
hours of conversations with Ludwig and his co-accused, Richard
Boonstra.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Paul Moreau had argued Monday the audible
portions of the tapes lack enough context to understand what was
said. As well, their enhancement by Calgary sound engineer Peter
D'Amico made their reliability doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanderman decided there was no reason to believe the content
had been altered.

Lord Cuts Taxes, Trims Govt. Spending in Balanced Budget
</P>
<P>
   FREDERICTON, New Brunswick (AP) -- The New Brunswick government
has confounded the skeptics by delivering what many thought
impossible: a projected balanced budget complete with generous tax
cuts and spending increases in health and education.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Bernard Lord's Conservative government brought down its
first budget Tuesday, emphasizing the good news of tax breaks and
downplaying the bad news of growing debt and shrinking government
services.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Norm Betts said the only way the Maritime
province could balance its books was to sharply reduce government
spending. He has done that in the 2000-2001 budget by slashing
program spending by $238 million.
</P>
<P>
   The budget forecasts a modest surplus of $21.3 million with
revenues of $4.71 billion and expenditures of $4.68 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie government has lived up to its election promise of
providing significant tax relief to individuals and businesses.

<HEADLINE> New Jersey's revenue dependent on volatile upper incomes  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- As the economy continues to flourish, New
Jersey collects new riches for its treasury. But budget experts
Tuesday warned lawmakers that these revenues are so dependent on
wealthy residents that it is becoming risky.
</P>
<P>
   Budget chief Alan Kooney, of the nonpartisan Office of
Legislative Services, and revenue forecaster David Rosen said this
is because these upper-income residents make their money on Wall
Street and their earnings are volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Kooney and Rosen did not predict problems, and they have made
this warning before.
</P>
<P>
   Treasurer Roland Machold also said he saw no hazards ahead, but
as a Wall Street expert, he also knew enough to hedge. ''I don't
get any sense of a downturn,'' Machold said, ''but there are always
such things in the future, and we should prepare for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said forecasters are not sure if they will be able to
detect problems when they do come until it is too late.
</P>
<P>
   Mining folklore tells of the practice of bringing canaries into
mines to detect deadly methane gas. When the canary died, it was a
warning for the miners to extinguish their lamps and get out.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem with this economy is we don't know what the
canaries are,'' Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   In the current fiscal year, revenues had been forecasted to grow
$740 million. But revenues are actually coming in at a pace that
puts them $500 million higher than the forecast.
</P>
<P>
   In the next fiscal year, which begins July 1, Machold is
forecasting a gain in revenue of at least another $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The booming economy has allowed a Republican administration and
Republican Legislature to increase spending $3.1 billion over two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The economic expansion began in 1992. In May, it completes its
eighth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   As Rutgers University economist James Hughes reported to
lawmakers at the beginning of the month, economists with an eye on
history agree that the economy is now in unknown territory. No one
knows what might kill the canary.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors compound the unpredictability in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The state's revenues are more dependent on income taxes than
ever before. Twenty years ago, corporate taxes provided 15 percent
of the state's revenue, and income taxes 20 percent. The rest was
from sales, gas, tobacco and other taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, corporate taxes provide less than 10 percent and the
income tax provides 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And there is more. Former Gov. Jim Florio increased income taxes
for upper-middle income and wealthy families. Gov. Christie Whitman
repealed them for some of the upper-middle income earners, but not
all of them, and not at all for the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a shift in income brackets.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of New Jersey households earn less than
$100,000, and those households pay a third of the state's income
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 percent of the households earns above $100,000,
and they pay two thirds of the income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Only six of every 100 households earns more than $500,000 a
year. But those households account for 28 percent of the income tax
collected by New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Many may regard this trend as fair but lawmakers on Tuesday said
they found it worrisome, and revenue forecasters like Rosen regard
it as a headache.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary wage earners provide a stable source of revenue. Money
is deducted from paychecks every week, and the state gets a monthly
accounting of what is coming.
</P>
<P>
   But the rich are different. Their earnings are driven by sales
of stocks, bonds and property, by financial dealings that boost the
value of their holdings, by commissions and bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   None of these are paid or at least reported until the last
minute when taxes are due. Rosen said each year in May state
officials get an accounting of what has come in from these
upper-income brackets. This is only a few weeks before a balanced
budget must be finished and signed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a scary period,'' Rosen said. ''The first few years we
have had very pleasant surprises. But it is very late in the year
to get an unpleasant surprise, and it is bound to happen some
year.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To the extent that we rely on a volatile set of earnings, it
could change very sharply,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Barbara Buono, D-Middlesex, said, ''It makes our
budget more vulnerable to the winds of change in our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget committee chairman, Assemblyman Leonard Lance,
R-Hunterdon, asked both Rosen and Machold to provide a survey on
whether any other state relied this heavily on upper-income tax
revenue.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Endorses Bush  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- Satisfied that George W. Bush supports
conservative positions, Steve Forbes endorsed his former Republican
presidential rival on Tuesday as a ''good man.''
</P>
<P>
   The millionaire magazine publisher threw his suppport to Bush
during an appearance with the Texas governor in Forbes' home state
of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement came hours after Bush reached out to resolve
another lingering division from the primary campaign by calling
John McCain in Washington to discuss a face-to-face meeting.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides said it was premature to discuss a formal
endorsement, but Forbes dropped all of his previous reservations
about Bush during a speech to a group of Somerset County
Republicans gathered in a VFW hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the American people are learing and will learn, he is a
good man,'' Forbes said. ''He has been tested -- I tried to test him
-- and he emerged the stronger for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiling and turning to Forbes, Bush lauded the publisher for his
devotion to his family and ideas that have included tax cuts and
the use of personal savings plans to support retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ''He reminds us that ideas make good politics,'' Bush said. ''I
appreciate his interjection of a lot of really good ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is now being challenged for the presidency by Vice
President Al Gore, who himself beat former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' high-water mark in the 2000 primaries was in the leadoff
Iowa caucuses, where his appeal to conservative voters on social
issues helped him finish second behind Bush. He dropped out of the
race on Feb. 10 after finishing third in Delaware -- and after
spending $38 million of his personal fortune on his campaign.
During his first run in 1996, he had spent $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were nosed out by a landslide,'' he told reporters as he
exited the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was the ninth of ten candidates to drop out of the
Republican race. A little more than a month later, he was followed
by McCain, Bush's closest challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Bush has picked up the endorsements of most of his
former rivals, most prominently former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth
Dole, who has joined Bush on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the primary season, the Bush team was concerned about a
challenge from Forbes, who was accused by some fellow Republicans
of weakening the party's 1996 nominee, Bob Dole, with withering TV
ads.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was sharply critical of Bush's five-year, $483 billion
tax plan as well as his allowance for abortion in the case of rape,
incest or endangerment of the mother, but he never mounted the
full-scale assault the Bush team had feared.

<HEADLINE> Bush Reaches Out to McCain  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) -- George W. Bush reached out to vanquished
presidential rival John McCain on Tuesday, declaring ''the past is
the past'' and it's time for them to meet. Another former rival,
Steve Forbes, endorsed Bush as the Republicans moved toward
reconciliation after a bruising primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Bush telephoned McCain from his car in Virginia, where he laid
out a $5 billion plan to address illiteracy among young school
students, declaring the problem a ''national emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Too many of our children can't read,'' Bush told a group of
Asian-American business people in suburban Washington. ''Our
economy is the envy of the world; unfortunately, our schools are
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, with Gov. Christie Whitman by his side, he told a crowd
of 450 at a New Jersey fund-raiser: ''I want to make it clear to
the good folks of New Jersey and all across America that I'm not
running to become the federal superintendent of schools. ...What I
believe is I believe in local control of the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush reached out to McCain after Bob Dole, the defeated 1996 GOP
presidential nominee who has been acting as peacemaker, had lunch
with the Arizona senator and then called Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor is hoping for an endorsement, but McCain
aides said it is too soon to talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain adviser John Weaver said, ''The ice has been
broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ''I think John and I both understand that the past is
the past and it's time to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain suspended his campaign March 9 after Bush won a string of
primaries two days earlier on Super Tuesday. The Arizona senator
won seven GOP primaries, including the leadoff contest in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush annoyed the McCain camp by saying that McCain ''didn't
change my views on reform.'' But the Texan quickly tried to soften
the blow and has spoken more glowingly of his former rival since.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor received Forbes' endorsement at an evening
rally in the millionaire publisher's home state of New Jersey. His
backing could bring Bush more conservative support even as he
targets women and other traditional Democratic constituencies with
his reading initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ''The news just keeps reminding us why we need a fundamental
change in the presidency of the United States and restore dignity
and integrity to the presidency of the United States,'' Forbes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls give both Bush and his Democratic rival, Vice
President Al Gore, roughly equal marks on who would do the best job
of improving education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's education proposal would provide reading instruction for
about 900,000 kindergarten and first-grade students. Over time,
aides said, he envisions adding a lesser amount of money to
diagnose and remedy lingering problems with second graders.
</P>
<P>
   Casting himself as a new Republican, Bush even cited the late
Albert Shanker, former head of the American Federation of Teachers,
a union traditionally aligned with Democratic causes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This plan is different. It's different from my opponent. It's
different from the administration. And it's different from those
who would say there is no federal role for education, different
from those who would throw money into schools without reforming
them,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the White House, Gore scoffed that Bush's education
agenda was ''subordinate to his risky tax scheme, which would
actually slash money for education.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, the vice president
said Bush could not pay for his education proposals if he also cut
taxes as proposed, by about $1 trillion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tax-cut plan ''puts a huge cloud over everything that he
says about education,'' Gore told the AP. ''You can't propose an
economic plan that results in devastating, slashing cuts to
education and pretend that you're not doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's new program, ''Reading First,'' is modeled after
a program begun this year in Texas. It would set the goal of
teaching every American child to read by the end of the third
grade.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics cited by the Bush campaign, 68 percent
of the fourth graders in the nation's poorest school areas were not
able to read at a basic level in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bush calls for spending $5 million annually to diagnose reading
problems with kindergarten and first-grade students.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $90 million per year would be used to train
teachers to make the diagnosis. The biggest chunk of money -- $900
million annually -- is pegged for literacy programs that would be
designed and implemented locally.
</P>
<P>
   States would have to apply for the money, and it would be
awarded only if they proposed programs that met ''research-based''
standards.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore has proposed spending $115 billion over 10
years to continue President Clinton's program aimed at reducing
class sizes by providing more money to hire teachers. So far, about
30,000 have been hired, with a goal of 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also wants to triple the number of charter schools, make
preschool available to every 4-year-old and expand Head Start.

<P>
   RESTON, Va. (AP) -- George W. Bush laid out a $5 billion plan to
address reading problems in the nation's youngest school students
Tuesday, declaring their illiteracy amounts to a ''national
emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor and presumed Republican presidential nominee
also lined up the endorsement of former rival Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The nod from the millionaire publisher, given at an evening
rally in Manville, N.J., could bring Bush some additional
conservative support at the same time he targets women and other
traditional Democratic constituencies with his reading initiative.
</P>
<P>
   At a fundraiser in Parsippany, N.J., Bush thanked New Jersey
Gov. Christie Whitman and said he was proud to call her a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait to campaign with her, not only in the state of
New Jersey, but all around America,'' Bush said. ''We share a
common passion. We want to do what's right for the country. We want
to elevate the spirit of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls give both Bush and his Democratic rival, Vice
President Al Gore, roughly equal marks on who would do the best job
of improving education.
</P>
<P>
   ''America must confront a national emergency,'' Bush told a
group of Asian-American business people gathered in suburban

   ''The goal here is not to spend the most or cut the most,'' Bush

</P>
<P>
   At present, the federal government offers Even Start, which
provides literacy training to both preschoolers and their parents.
There also is a literacy component to Head Start, an early
childhood education program, as well as adult literacy training
provided under the Vocational Education Act.
</P>
<P>
   Bush previously outlined plans to spend $5.5 billion over five
years on education reform, although the cornerstone of his approach
is not spending but accountability through locally designed and
administered tests.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposes taking away federal Title I money from poorly
performing schools and giving it to families to help defray the
cost of educating their children elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   School and student testing would start at third grade -- just
after the second-grade cutoff for the new reading program.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday in Pewaukee, Wis., Bush planned to continue
detailing his education initiative with a speech outlining a plan
to recruit, retrain and retain teachers.

By MICHELLE RAY ORTIZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A boat carrying 10 students and others on a
university research trip sank off the coast of Baja California,
killing at least four people.
</P>
<P>
   Three people swam to safety on a nearby island and were rescued
early Tuesday, said Lisa Lapin, a spokeswoman for the University of
California, Davis. A search was on for the others.
</P>
<P>
   Lapin said survivors at the scene reported the recovery of four
bodies, including a male graduate student and a visiting Japanese
scholar. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City also confirmed four dead,
including at least one U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Among the missing was Gary Polis, the expedition's leader and
chairman of the school's Department of Environmental Science and
Policy, Lapin said.
</P>
<P>
   The boat was one of two, 22-foot inflatable crafts carrying a
total of about 20 people on the trip Monday to research spiders and
scorpions on an island near Bahia de Los Angeles, a remote bay 250
miles south of the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   The two boats became separated on their return when strong winds
whipped up 4- to 6-foot waves, UC Davis said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear who else was on board the boat that sank.
</P>
<P>
   ''From what we understand, there was a mix of students, faculty
and visitors from Japan,'' said Pat Bailey, another spokeswoman for
the school, just east of Sacremento.
</P>
<P>
   The boat that made it reported the other craft missing late
Monday, prompting a search by the Coast Guard and the Mexican navy.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican naval ships and Mexican and Coast Guard aircraft were
searching the area Tuesday under clear skies.
</P>
<P>
   Located in a rugged, desert landscape, Bahia de Los Angeles is a
tiny collection of hotels and tourist campgrounds that is a popular
destination for sports fishermen, kayakers and wildlife biologists.
</P>
<P>
   Polis, one of the world's leading spider experts, and the other
researchers were studying the ecology of spiders and scorpions that
inhabit the islands.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani raked in more
than $100,000 for his U.S. Senate bid at a Capitol Hill fund-raiser
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain put in a brief appearance and nearly stole the
limelight from the mayor. The former GOP presidential candidate
said he expects to campaign with Giuliani in New York next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been experiencing withdrawal from my defeat,'' McCain
joked. ''I've been spending all my time on the phone to Betty
Ford's place.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani endorsed Texas Gov. George W. Bush for president, but
bucked other state Republicans in the days leading up the state's
March 7 primary by refusing to attack McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a terrific mayor and we want to get him elected to the
Senate,'' said Susan Molinari, the former congresswoman from Staten
Island and co-host of the $500-per-person fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has raised $11.8 million for his Senate race against
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. She has raised $8 million,
according to the most recent federal election filings.

<P>
   MANVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- Satisfied that George W. Bush supports
conservative positions, Steve Forbes endorsed his former Republican
presidential rival on Tuesday as a ''good man.''
</P>
<P>
   The millionaire magazine publisher threw his suppport to Bush
during an appearance with the Texas governor in Forbes' home state
of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement came hours after Bush reached out to resolve
another lingering division from the primary campaign by calling
John McCain in Washington to discuss a face-to-face meeting.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides said it was premature to discuss a formal
endorsement, but Forbes dropped all of his previous reservations
about Bush during a speech to a group of Somerset County
Republicans gathered in a VFW hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the American people are learing and will learn, he is a
good man,'' Forbes said. ''He has been tested -- I tried to test him
-- and he emerged the stronger for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiling and turning to Forbes, Bush lauded the publisher for his
devotion to his family and ideas that have included tax cuts and
the use of personal savings plans to support retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ''He reminds us that ideas make good politics,'' Bush said. ''I
appreciate his interjection of a lot of really good ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is now being challenged for the presidency by Vice
President Al Gore, who himself beat former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' high-water mark in the 2000 primaries was in the leadoff
Iowa caucuses, where his appeal to conservative voters on social
issues helped him finish second behind Bush. He dropped out of the
race on Feb. 10 after finishing third in Delaware -- and after
spending $38 million of his personal fortune on his campaign.
During his first run in 1996, he had spent $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were nosed out by a landslide,'' he told reporters as he
exited the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was the ninth of ten candidates to drop out of the
Republican race. A little more than a month later, he was followed
by McCain, Bush's closest challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Bush has picked up the endorsements of most of his
former rivals, most prominently former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth
Dole, who has joined Bush on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the primary season, the Bush team was concerned about a
challenge from Forbes, who was accused by some fellow Republicans
of weakening the party's 1996 nominee, Bob Dole, with withering TV
ads.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was sharply critical of Bush's five-year, $483 billion
tax plan as well as his allowance for abortion in the case of rape,
incest or endangerment of the mother, but he never mounted the
full-scale assault the Bush team had feared.

<HEADLINE> Greek Protesters Delay NATO Convoy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) -- Left-wing demonstrators stopped a
convoy of NATO military trucks early Tuesday as they tried to head
to Kosovo, spray painting slogans on the vehicles and smashing one
window, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   A group of about 80 protesters rushed the British, French and
Italian vehicles as they were leaving this northern Greek city's
main port and heading to Kosovo to resupply the NATO-led
peacekeeping force there.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, which delayed the convoy for about 2{ hours,
reflected deep opposition in Greece to the NATO air campaign
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators clambered over the 65-vehicle convoy, which
mainly carried supply containers, and smashed the windshield of an
Italian vehicle with a rock. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   A first group of 25 vehicles, all French, managed to leave the
port before the protesters gathered, said Maj. Stamatis Lazarou, a
Greek army spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of Greeks vehemently opposed NATO's 78-day
airstrikes against fellow Christian Orthodox Serbs last year, and
held almost daily protest rallies, some of which turned violent.
</P>
<P>
   Communist-led protesters have frequently disrupted military
convoys in Thessaloniki, a major resupply point on the route to
peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators often block the exits to the port from where the
troops and vehicles depart, and have also blocked rail lines and
roads and attacked vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Military Stockpiles 'Expired' Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The military has stockpiled drugs beyond their
expiration date after being told by federal regulators that the
drugs remain safe and potent, a Pentagon official confirmed
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The guidance from the Food and Drug Administration began in
1985, when the Air Force asked the agency to check on its drug
supplies to see if the medications could be used beyond the
expiration date, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FDA did this and found basically that the expiration dates
tended to be very conservative, and as a result, many of these
drugs could have a much longer shelf life than the manufacturer
said,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The military buys about $1.2 billion of prescription and
nonprescription drugs every year, and needs reserves that can be
drawn upon in large quantities in a war, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the drugs are also used to take care of families,
retirees and others as part of the military's health care program.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the last year for which figures were available, the
military spent $664,000 to have drugs tested to see if their
usefulness could be extended. The testing and extended shelf life
saved the military $49.3 million, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA testing covered more than 100 drugs, prescription and
over-the-counter, and found that 90 percent of them were safe
beyond the expiration date, The Wall Street Journal reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the drugs have been tested by either the manufacturer
or the FDA, but always with FDA supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said consumers shouldn't assume their expired drugs are
still safe and effective because, unlike prescriptions sitting in
medicine cabinets, the military's stockpile has remained sealed in
the manufacturer's original packaging.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chance of the product not degrading from moisture or heat
or light exposure is much better than what consumers get when they
bring home a medication from a pharmacy in these amber vials with
childproof caps,'' said Thomas McGinnis, the FDA's director of
pharmacy affairs.
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis said consumers should discard drugs when their course
of treatment is finished.

OPEC Hike May Not Cut Gas Prices
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC has agreed to increase its oil production, but
it may not be enough to reduce gasoline prices in the United States. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson has said it would take four to six weeks for the
additional oil to reach U.S. markets. Summer gasoline prices, however, may
remain high because of extremely low gasoline stocks. Refiners may not be able
to build up inventories in time for the high-demand summer driving season,
energy analysts have said. In increasing its oil output, OPEC ignored objections
of its second-biggest member -- Iran. Nine other members will raise production
by 6.3 percent, or a total of 1.45 million barrels a day.

At Least 20 Hurt in Texas Tornado
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A powerful tornado blew through downtown just after
rush hour tonight, shattering windows in high-rise buildings, overturning cars
and uprooting trees. At least 20 people were injured. Some of the buildings
''looked like they did not have a single pane of glass left in them,'' said Lt.
Kent Worley, a spokesman for the Fort Worth Fire Department. ''There are
injuries, but this is very early on,'' he said. The tornado hit shortly after
6:30 p.m. amid severe thunderstorms that were accompanied by torrential rains,
softball-sized hail and strong winds.

Court Cuts Police Power To Search
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court sharply curtailed police power to rely
on anonymous tips to stop and search people. The unanimous ruling Tuesday was a
victory for civil rights organizations but a police group said the nation's
streets may become more dangerous. The court said Miami police acted unlawfully
when in 1995 they searched and arrested a juvenile for carrying a gun after an
anonymous telephone caller said someone matching his description had a concealed
weapon.

Gore Seems Untroubled by Inquiries

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said today the Republicans are
chasing their tails pursuing questions about his missing e-mail and staff calls
to the Internal Revenue Service, but he offered little additional explanation
about either in an interview. ''I hope they spend a lot of time and a lot of
energy on this,'' Gore told The Associated Press with a confident grin. In a
West Wing interview, the No. 2 man in one of the most investigated
administrations in U.S. history appeared as untroubled by the newest inquiries
-- and their implications for his presidential campaign -- as he was vague about
their details.

Lawyers for the family and the U.S. government met in the morning without

Jersey. The endorsement came hours after Bush reached out to resolve another
lingering division from the primary campaign by calling John McCain in

Resendiz Seeks Insanity Defense KO
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The drifter accused of being the Texas railroad killer asked
to withdraw his insanity defense as jury selection in the murder case got
underway today. Angel Maturino Resendiz, 40, also asked that he not have to be
present during jury selection and that the first 12 prospective jurors serve as
the jury without being questioned by opposing attorneys. District Judge William
Harmon did not rule on Maturino Resendiz's bid to drop the insanity defense but
rejected his other requests. A 60-person jury pool was assembled for his trial
on charges he killed a Houston-area physician, Dr. Claudia Benton, 39, at her
home in 1998.

Ricky Williams Changes Agents

   PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Ricky Williams, whose incentive-laden contract with
the New Orleans Saints backfired on him last season, fired his agent today and
hired Leigh Steinberg. Williams had been represented by Leland Hardy, who works
for the rapper Master P. His rookie contract contained an $8.8 million signing
bonus, but most of the seven-year, $68 million deal was based on incentives,
many of which were triggered upon reaching 1,600 yards in a season.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Fire General Manager, Coach  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With only four games left and the playoffs all
but out of reach for the third straight season, the New York
Rangers cleaned house Tuesday, firing general manager Neil Smith
and coach John Muckler.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, in his 11th year as GM and president, was in charge when
the Rangers won the 1994 Stanley Cup -- ending a 54-year drought.
But he has not come close to matching that success.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who have the NHL's largest payroll at $61 million,
are five points behind Buffalo in the race for the eighth and final
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. New York (29-38-11-3) has
lost five straight games and is 1-8-1 in its last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once you make a decision like this, the sooner the better,''
Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts said. ''We made the
decision last night. I didn't see any reason to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler was in his second full season as New York's coach after
getting the job on Feb. 19, 1998. He replaced the fired Colin
Campbell, now the NHL's disciplinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant John Tortorella will coach the team through the final
four games. Checketts said a GM will be hired and he will pick the
next coach.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the team said Wayne Gretzky will be involved
in helping select a new coach and general manager, but Checketts
would not comment on possible successors.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a former Ranger and one of the great all-time players,''
Checketts said of Gretzky, whose last three NHL seasons were spent
in New York. ''I don't expect him to be a part of that process.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky's agent, Michael Barnett said that the NHL's
career-scoring leader is not one of the Rangers' decision makers,
and that Gretzky had not been contacted by the Dolan family --
owners of Cablevision and the club.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wayne is out of hockey, as we speak today, and thoroughly
enjoying his retirement,'' Barnett said. ''While he has a very
cordial relationship with the Dolans, I would not see Wayne Gretzky
either seeking or welcoming the opportunity to provide his personal
opinion regarding the Rangers' future.''
</P>
<P>
   The final blows for Muckler and Smith were home-and-home
embarrassments on Sunday and Monday in which the Rangers were
beaten 8-2 and 6-0 by Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Square Garden fans booed the players and shouted for
Muckler's dismissal. They got their wish a day later.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a tremendous amount of work, and it's going
to require new leadership,'' Checketts said of the rebuilding
process. ''There should be more scoring, more defense, more pride
in the Ranger jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to do what I have to to make it work for the fans. They
deserve so much more.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers fail to qualify for the postseason, it will be
the first time since 1963-66 they have missed the playoffs in three
consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   ''At best it was disappointing, at worst embarrassing,''
Checketts said.
</P>
<P>
   New York's loss to Detroit on Monday also ensured the Rangers'
third straight home-losing record. That hasn't happened since
1957-58 through 1959-60.
</P>
<P>
   ''At times things don't work out as planned and this is one of
those times,'' Checketts said. ''In the best interests of the
franchise and our fans, it has become clear that we have to go in a
different direction.''
</P>
<P>
   As coach of Edmonton and Buffalo, Muckler never missed the
playoffs in six seasons. He was 70-91-24, plus three regulation
ties, in 185 games with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Muckler coached Edmonton to the Stanley Cup title in 1990 and
the conference finals the following year. He served as Buffalo's
general manager and coach for two seasons, before relinquishing the
coaching job in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After a seven-game winning streak turned the Rangers' fortunes
around, the club is 6-15-4 since February's All-Star weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''These decisions are made about results,'' Checketts said.
''Our record since the All-Star break has clearly brought this all
to a head. Losing creates this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' last playoff appearance in 1997 lasted until the
conference finals when the club was eliminated in five games. Those
were Mark Messier's last games with New York before he left for
Vancouver as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisitions such as Theo Fleury, Sylvain Lefebvre, Stephane
Quintal and Tim Taylor, and the re-signing of captain Brian Leetch
to a big contract failed to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not taking myself out of responsibility for what
happened,'' Checketts said. ''None of the free agents has performed
the way we thought they would.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith enjoyed early success, as the Rangers finished first twice
-- including a Presidents' Trophy as the NHL's best team in 1991-92
-- and second once, marking the Rangers' three best consecutive
seasons. On his watch the Rangers have won three division titles,
two Presidents' trophies and the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the Rangers' philosophy changed from one of
sending away young talent for high-priced veterans, to one of
developing a pipeline through the farm system.
</P>
<P>
   Smith refrained from making a deal for NHL-leading goal scorer
Pavel Bure, before he was dealt last season from Vancouver to
Florida. He also did not make any major deals at this season's
trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of us had the kind of year we expected,'' Checketts said.
''It's not one losing streak or a couple of games against Detroit.
It's a whole host of things.''

<HEADLINE> Nets 111, Pacers 106  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Keith Van Horn and Stephon Marbury
hit key baskets down the stretch as the New Jersey Nets nearly blew
a 21-point fourth quarter lead and held on for a 111-106 victory
over the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn finished with 30 points and Marbury added 28 and 10
assists as the Nets snapped a three-game losing streak and extended
the Pacers' losing skid to three games, which matches their longest
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose had 27 points and Austin Croshere added 15 and 10
rebounds for Indiana, which saw All-Star Reggie Miller ejected in
the opening seconds of the fourth quarter after picking up two
technicals in three seconds. He had 13 points in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But with Rose and Croshere leading the way, Indiana wiped out
all but one point of New Jersey's lead, getting within 97-96 on a
drive by Rose with 3:49 to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who blew an 18-point lead in losing to Denver on
Sunday, responded. Marbury hit two free throws and then Kendall
Gill drew a charge on Pacers guard Travis Best.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn then sandwiched a jumper and a 3-pointer around a
3-pointer by Rose to give New Jersey a 104-101 lead. After Lucious
Harris and Croshere traded baskets, Sam Perkins of Indiana missed a
jumper with 39 seconds to play and Marbury then hit a floater in
the lane to ice the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets took advantage of the two technicals against Miller to
score the first six points of the fourth quarter and take a 91-70
lead on a jumper by Gill.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana immediately came back with a 26-6 run that featured nine
of Rose's 17 fourth-quarter points.
</P>
<P>
   Gill had helped the Nets extend a five-point halftime lead to 15
by scoring 15 of his 17 points in a third-quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers other three-game losing streak was from Jan. 21-24.
Notes: Nets assistant coach Eddie Jordan and his wife, Charrisse,
celebrated the birth of a baby daughter, Skylar Victoria, over the
weekend. ... Nets starting center Jim McIlvaine missed his second
straight game because of a bulging disk. ... Rookie Evan Eschmeyer
got his first NBA start and picked up two fouls in 28 seconds. He
finished with six points. ... Pacers forward Derrick McKey didn't
play because of a strained muscle in his right leg.

<HEADLINE> Bush lays out education plan; gets Forbes endorsement  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RESTON, Va. (AP) -- George W. Bush laid out a $5 billion plan to
address reading problems in the nation's youngest school students
Tuesday, declaring their illiteracy amounts to a ''national
emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor and presumed Republican presidential nominee
also lined up the endorsement of former rival Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The nod from the millionaire publisher, given at an evening
rally in Manville, N.J., could bring Bush some additional
conservative support at the same time he targets women and other
traditional Democratic constituencies with his reading initiative.
</P>
<P>
   At a fundraiser in Parsippany, N.J., Bush thanked New Jersey
Gov. Christie Whitman and said he was proud to call her a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait to campaign with her, not only in the state of
New Jersey, but all around America,'' Bush said. ''We share a
common passion. We want to do what's right for the country. We want
to elevate the spirit of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls give both Bush and his Democratic rival, Vice
President Al Gore, roughly equal marks on who would do the best job
of improving education.
</P>
<P>
   ''America must confront a national emergency,'' Bush told a
group of Asian-American business people gathered in suburban
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Too many of our children can't read,'' he said. ''Our economy
is the envy of the world; unfortunately, our schools are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal would provide reading instruction for about
900,000 kindergarten and first-grade students. Over time, aides
said, he envisions adding a lesser amount of money to diagnose and
remedy lingering problems with second-graders.
</P>
<P>
   Casting himself as a new Republican, Bush even cited the late
Albert Shanker, former head of the American Federation of Teachers,
a union traditionally aligned with Democratic causes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This plan is different. It's different from my opponent. It's
different from the administration. And it's different from those
who would say there is no federal role for education, different
from those who would throw money into schools without reforming
them,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the White House, Gore scoffed that Bush's education
agenda was ''subordinate to his risky tax scheme, which would
actually slash money for education.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, the vice president
said Bush could not pay for his education proposals if he also cut
taxes as proposed, by about $1 trillion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tax-cut plan ''puts a huge cloud over everything that he
says about education,'' Gore told the AP. ''You can't propose an
economic plan that results in devastating, slashing cuts to
education and pretend that you're not doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's new program, dubbed ''Reading First,'' is modeled
after a program begun this year in Texas. It would set the goal of
teaching every American school child to read by the end of the
third grade.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics cited by the Bush campaign, 68 percent
of the fourth-graders in the nation's poorest school areas were not
able to read at a basic level in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bush calls for spending $5 million annually to diagnose reading
problems with kindergarten and first-grade students.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $90 million per year would be used to train
teachers to make the diagnosis. The biggest chunk of money -- $900
million annually -- is pegged for literacy programs that would be
designed and implemented locally.
</P>
<P>
   States would have to apply for the money, and it would be
awarded only if they proposed programs that met ''research-based''
standards.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore has proposed spending $115 billion over 10
years to continue President Clinton's program aimed at reducing
class sizes by providing more money to hire teachers. So far, about
30,000 have been hired, with a goal of 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also wants to triple the number of charter schools, make
preschool available to every 4-year-old and expand Head Start.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal here is not to spend the most or cut the most,'' Bush
said. ''The goal is to improve the most.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, the federal government offers Even Start, which
provides literacy training to both preschoolers and their parents.
There also is a literacy component to Head Start, an early
childhood education program, as well as adult literacy training
provided under the Vocational Education Act.
</P>
<P>
   Bush previously outlined plans to spend $5.5 billion over five
years on education reform, although the cornerstone of his approach
is not spending but accountability through locally designed and
administered tests.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposes taking away federal Title I money from poorly
performing schools and giving it to families to help defray the
cost of educating their children elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   School and student testing would start at third grade -- just
after the second-grade cutoff for the new reading program.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday in Pewaukee, Wis., Bush planned to continue
detailing his education initiative with a speech outlining a plan
to recruit, retrain and retain teachers.

<HEADLINE> Elian Family Resists Surrender Vow  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- With a government deadline fast approaching, Elian
Gonzalez's Miami relatives Tuesday continued to resist demands that
they promise in writing to surrender the boy if they lose their
court fight to keep him in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the family and the U.S. government met in the
morning without resolving the impasse, despite threats from
immigration authorities to remove the 6-year-old Cuban boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said, 'If you don't sign the paper, we remove Elian.'
They don't tell us how,'' family spokesman Armando Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, the Immigration and Naturalization Service warned
that Elian's temporary permission to stay in the United States
would be revoked at 9 a.m. Thursday unless the relatives provide
the written guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez said the ''blanket statement'' that the INS is
demanding is ''not the American way.'' He said Elian's great-uncle
would meet with immigration officials Wednesday, but he didn't know
if the uncle would sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez charged that INS officials ''are following orders
either from Clinton's lawyers or Fidel, and they need to answer to
the community and to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS asked Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to meet with
them Wednesday in Miami, at which time government officials said he
would be given another opportunity to sign a pledge to give up
Elian if he loses the court battle.
</P>
<P>
   If Gonzalez will not agree in writing to obey the court ruling,
the INS intends to advise him on Thursday morning how and when he
is to relinquish custody of Elian, according to the government
officials, who requested anonymity. They would not say exactly what
timetable Gonzalez would be given on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   INS spokeswoman Karen Kraushaar read a statement saying the
Justice Department hopes Lazaro Gonzalez will sign the agreement
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''While INS has always had the authority to implement its
decision, we have gone to great lengths to bring about a resolution
that is carried out in a manner that creates as little disruption
for Elian as possible,'' Kraushaar said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The simple assurances we have sought from Lazaro Gonzalez are
that he will cooperate with an orderly transfer of Elian Gonzalez
in the event of an adverse ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals and
barring emergency injunctive relief from the Supreme Court,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, who is living with his great-uncle, is being kept home
from school this week. The family spokesman said Elian won't return
to school out of fears that Cuba might somehow try to force him
back to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro said Tuesday that his government
told U.S. officials of its concerns that Miami-based exiles might
take Elian and his Miami relatives to another country, such as
Nicaragua or Costa Rica, or even harm him if they lose their battle
to block the child's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez denied that he would send Elian out of the
country, or that he himself would leave.''It never even entered my
mind,'' he said. ''This is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation, a Cuban exile group, said he believes the U.S.
government will think carefully before taking any action.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think the government would forcefully take the
child,'' Mas Santos said. ''If they are so confident they will win,
then they can wait a few weeks. It would be a mistake, provoking
this family and the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said they do not want to traumatize
the boy or create a conflict with the family.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the beginning we have been mindful of the fact that at
the center of this case is a 6-year-old boy who has been through a
terrible ordeal,'' Kraushaar said. ''We are concerned for him and
will continue to try to resolve this matter in a way that avoids
additional trauma to him.''
</P>
<P>
   About 75 demonstrators gathered outside the Gonzalez home
Tuesday in response to a call by the anti-Castro Democracy
Movement, which urged them to form a human chain around the home if
the government tries to remove Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people are very angry and I think there are going to be
very ugly days here in Miami,'' said Abel Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. relatives have asked a federal appeals court in Atlanta
to overturn a federal judge's ruling affirming the INS decision to
return Elian to his father in Cuba. The court scheduled arguments
for the week of May 8, which could complicate any steps by the
government in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   The child's Miami relatives last week allowed ABC's Diane Sawyer
to spend two days with Elian. The result was his first extended
interview, being broadcast this week on ''Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's segment, ABC said the boy indicated he doesn't want
to return to Cuba. But the network said it decided not to air the
remark because of the ''inflamed climate'' surrounding the case.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been the subject of an international custody dispute
since November, when he was found floating on an inner tube off the
Florida coast. His mother, who was divorced from Elian's father,
died along with 10 others when their boat sank during the journey
from Cuba to the United States.

<HEADLINE> 11 Die in Austrian Avalanche  </HEADLINE>
By KERSTIN JOENSSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIEDERSILL, Austria (AP) -- An Alpine avalanche as wide as five
football fields buried skiers underneath tons of snow Tuesday,
killing at least 11 people, rescue officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten people were found dead in the area of the huge snow slide
south of Salzburg and another died after being hospitalized. Two
others were able to free themselves while rescuers dug out a third
survivor, state television said in its evening newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers continued looking for another person thought to have
been trapped under the snow.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the victims were training to be ski instructors. One
trainee told state television the slide was caused by an instructor
whose skis set loose a wall of snow. However, the Austria Press
Agency said two snowboarders had apparently started the avalanche
and might have been among those killed.
</P>
<P>
   First reports said most of the victims were believed to be
Germans. However, the Austria Press Agency, quoting local
officials, said late Tuesday the 11 dead comprised six Austrians,
two Finns and one Dane, one Slovak and a Belgian.
</P>
<P>
   Seven helicopters assisted more 150 rescue personnel looking for
victims in the Zell am See area, about 30 miles south of Salzburg.
Specially trained avalanche dogs, which can sniff out people buried
in the snow, were also on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth major deadly avalanche in Austria in a little
more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Two snow slides on Feb. 23, 1999, killed 38 people in the region
of Galtuer, in Tyrol. In December, two more avalanches in Tyrolean
skiing areas killed 11 people.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Dikembe Mutombo and Alan Henderson each scored 24
points Tuesday night as the Atlanta Hawks beat the Denver Nuggets
116-111 to snap a three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks, who had lost 11 of their last 13 games, outrebounded
Denver 47-33 with Mutombo leading the way with 16.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio McDyess had 28 points and 11 rebounds to lead the
Nuggets, who missed their final seven shots after Keon Clark's
breakaway dunk cut Atlanta's lead to 112-109 with 2:06 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In dropping their 11th straight game in Atlanta, the Nuggets
have lost 12 of their last 14 overall and 11 of 12 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Van Exel, who had 24 points, cut the lead to 99-97 by
coming off McDyess' screen and hitting a 10-foot jumper with 6:54
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Exel badly missed two 3-point attempts in the final
minute to finish with a 9-for-21 performance from the field. George
McCloud had 20 points for Denver, but missed all four of his shots
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve LaPhonso Ellis had 16 points and eight rebounds for
Atlanta, which matched a season-high in points.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The loss mathematically eliminated Denver from the eighth
and final Western Conference playoff spot. ... By missing a
wide-open reverse dunk at the end of the first half, rookie guard
Dion Glover kept the Hawks one point shy of setting a season high
in first-half points. They entered halftime with a 65-56 lead.

<HEADLINE> Raptors 99, Cavaliers 96  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Charles Oakley hit a 3-pointer from the
baseline corner as time expired to give the Toronto Raptors an
improbable 99-96 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto trailed by 17 points midway through the final quarter,
then sank six of seven shots from 3-point range during a 33-13 run
and snapped a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Brown hit consecutive 3-pointers to give the Raptors a 96-94
lead with 1:15 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley then blocked shots by Wesley Person and Lamond Murray on
consecutive Cavs possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland finally tied it on a driving scoop shot by Bob Sura
with 20.5 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto then got the ball to Vince Carter, who led the Raptors
with 19 points. Carter was well-guarded on the left wing and passed
to Oakley, whose shot rattled around the rim and dropped through as
the buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Carter shot just 6-for-17 from the field, mostly from the
perimeter and had just one of his crowd-pleasing dunks. That came
with 4:52 to play and pulled Toronto within 90-88.
</P>
<P>
   Murray led Cleveland with 30 points, but was limited to two in
the final quarter. Shawn Kemp had 20 points and nine rebounds for
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Murray scored 20 points in the first half, including a 3-pointer
that banked in off the glass with one second left to give Cleveland
a 51-40 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Carter missed his first five shots before hitting a 15-foot
jumper with 31.9 seconds to play in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Carter had averaged 34 points in two previous victories
over Cleveland. ... Toronto guard Muggsy Bogues entered the game
leading the NBA in assist-to-turnover ratio (250-to-48), but had
five turnovers and four assists. ... Cleveland starting center Mark
Bryant rolled his left ankle in a collision with teammate Wesley
Person early in the first quarter. Bryant returned in the second
quarter. ... Cavs rookie Andre Miller had 14 assists.

<HEADLINE> Retailers Settle Garment Worker Suit  </HEADLINE>
By JEAN CHRISTENSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Eight major clothing retailers, including Liz
Claiborne, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, agreed Tuesday to
settle a federal class-action lawsuit brought by garment workers in
the Northern Mariana Islands.
</P>
<P>
   In a $5.7 million settlement, the retailers agreed to compensate
workers who claimed they had been underpaid and overworked in
sweatshop conditions and to fund an independent monitoring system
to guard against labor abuses on the island of Saipan, part of the
Northern Marianas.
</P>
<P>
   The other retailers in the settlement were Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.,
Jones Apparel Group, May Department Stores Co., Oshkosh B'Gosh Inc.
and Warnaco Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is it's a business decision,'' said Sears
spokeswoman Jan Drummond. ''We looked at how long and how expensive
continuing to engage in this litigation would be weighted against
the relatively small amount of business we do in Saipan.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which will be considered by a federal judge on
April 25, brings to 17 the number of retailers that have settled in
the case for a total of $8 million. It does not include an
admission of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Nine companies settled claims last year.
</P>
<P>
   Litigation is still pending against other retailers, including
The Gap, J.C. Penney, Target and Lane Bryant, said Los Angeles
attorney Al Meyerhoff, who represents the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The latest accord represents the most significant development in
the case because the eight retailers account for nearly half of
Saipan's $1 billion-a-year garment industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in January 1999 on behalf of 30,000
current and former garment workers, mostly women recruited from the
Philippines, Bangladesh and Thailand. It accuses the companies of
violating U.S. labor laws, including minimum wage laws, in a
conspiracy with foreign subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement provides that in future contracts, retailers will
require factories to comply with strict employment standards,
including guaranteeing overtime pay, providing safe food and
drinking water, and agreeing to honor employees' basic human
rights, Meyerhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Mariana Islands are a U.S. possession 3,700 miles
southwest of Hawaii.

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Warns on U.S. Visit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A high-level North Korean leader's proposed visit
to the United States may not be possible as long as Washington
considers the communist nation a terrorist state, a senior North
Korean diplomat hinted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chu Chang Jun, the North Korean ambassador to China, urged the
United States to ''create favorable conditions for talks'' on the
high-level visit. He said Washington should stick to a 1994
agreement to give North Korea oil and nuclear reactors and hinted
that scrapping the terrorism designation would also help.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States is branding our country a terrorist country.
We cannot visit the United States with the cap of terrorists,'' Chu
said at a news conference inside the North Korean Embassy in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Chu's comments were the latest sign North Korea wants the
terrorism label removed as part of efforts to normalize relations.
Those efforts included talks in New York earlier this month to
arrange the highest-level North Korean visit since the end of the
Korean War 47 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Foley said:
''We do not have, to my understanding, a reason to believe that the
North Koreans have changed their position in regard to a high-level
visit. It's something that we still expect will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, U.S. officials said Chu has not always reflected
official thinking in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is one of seven countries Washington designates as
sponsors of terrorist activities. The others are Cuba, Iran, Iraq,
Libya, Sudan and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Before it removes North Korea from the list, Washington
reportedly wants Pyongyang to expel several Japanese Red Army
fugitives who have been in North Korea since hijacking a Japanese
airliner in 1970. North Korea has so far indicated it won't expel
the fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Chu has been North Korea's ambassador to crucial ally China for
11 years. He held the news conference to repeat a North Korean
Foreign Ministry demand for a tribunal to punish U.S. forces for
committing atrocities in the 1950-53 Korean War.

<HEADLINE> Resendiz Seeks Insanity Defense KO  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The drifter accused of being the Texas Railroad
Killer asked to withdraw his insanity defense as jury selection in
the murder case got underway Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Maturino Resendiz, 40, also asked that he not have to be
present during jury selection and that the first 12 prospective
jurors serve as the jury without being questioned by opposing
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   District Judge William Harmon did not rule on Maturino
Resendiz's bid to drop the insanity defense but rejected his other
requests.
</P>
<P>
   A 60-person jury pool was assembled for his trial on charges he
killed a Houston-area physician, Dr. Claudia Benton, 39, at her
home in 1998. Maturino Resendiz could get the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, Maturino Resendiz, a Mexican citizen who
investigators say made his way around the country by hopping
freight trains, is suspected of killing five people in Texas, two
in Illinois and one in Kentucky in 1997-99. The slayings took place
near train tracks.
</P>
<P>
   His court-appointed lawyer, Allen Tanner, has said he would use
an insanity defense. However, Maturino Resendiz has ignored the
judge's order to speak with a court psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective jurors began filling out 12-page questionnaires
about such things as their attitude toward insanity pleas and
whether they were influenced by news coverage of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The first juror was chosen Tuesday. Lawyers said it could take
five weeks to select all 12 jurors and one or two alternates.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner said Maturino Resendiz would prefer the first 12 people
selected from the jury pool and did not like the idea that
potential jurors must indicate they would be willing to vote for
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know you have to check records, or whatever, but you should
not check their minds,'' Maturino Resendiz told the judge. ''You
may not want some kind of criminal there, but it's against the
American Constitution to question their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they plan to present fingerprint and DNA
evidence linking Maturino Resendiz to the sexual assault, stabbing
and bludgeoning of Benton. Some of her jewelry was found at his
home in Mexico, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz was arrested in July after crossing into the
United States at El Paso and surrendered to authorities.

<HEADLINE> Burundi President To Close Camps  </HEADLINE>
By RODRIQUE NGOWI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) -- Burundi President Pierre Buyoya agreed
Tuesday to gradually dismantle controversial resettlement camps for
Hutus under strong pressure from Nelson Mandela, the mediator in
talks to end the civil war in the tiny central African nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six months, Burundian soldiers have herded an
estimated 350,000 Hutus into about 60 squalid camps around the
capital, Bujumbura, in a bid to cut them off from anti-government
rebels who rely on them for food, shelter and money.
</P>
<P>
   ''After spending 27 years in prison, I cannot control my
feelings when I know so many people are languishing in jail and
living in regroupment camps,'' Mandela said during peace talks in
Arusha, a town in neighboring Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ''These regroupment camps are not fit for any human being to
live in,'' the former South African president said.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya also said he will inform Mandela on how many political
prisoners are being held in the country of 6.5 million, where Hutus
form the majority but Tutsis have been in control for all but four
months since independence from Belgium in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya told reporters that the process of dismantling the camps
had begun -- at least six camps have been closed. But he refused to
say when all would be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent reference to the seven-year-old civil war that
has killed 200,000 and displaced 1.2 million, he said the
dismantling ''will be finalized once the security situation is
restored to normal.''

<HEADLINE> Stars 4, Lightning 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Mike Keane scored one of Dallas' two
short-handed goals and added two assists as the Stars extended
their road unbeaten streak to six games with a 4-2 victory Tuesday
night over the Tampa Bay Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvain Cote, Guy Carbonneau and Mike Modano scored in the first
seven minutes as the Stars virtually locked up the Pacific Division
title. Dallas holds an 11-point lead over Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Lecavalier recorded his team-leading 22nd goal for Tampa
Bay (17-50-8), which became the second team in NHL history to lose
50 games in three consecutive seasons. The Pittsburgh Penguins did
it from 1982-83 through 84-85.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Warriner scored a short-handed goal with 1.5 seconds left
in the second period for the Lightning, who have lost five straight
and seven consecutive at home. Tampa Bay is 3-13-3 against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the second time three short-handed goals have been
scored in a Lightning game. The other was Dec. 23, 1993 at St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay goalie Dieter Kochan, signed as a free agent Monday
from Binghamton of the United Hockey League, allowed three goals on
six shots before being pulled just 6:44 in.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Cloutier stopped all 11 shots, but was forced out of the
game after he strained a knee ligament early in the second period.
Kochan returned and allowed Keane's short-handed goal on the first
shot he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Cote snapped a 21-game goal-scoring drought during a 2-on-1 at
1:25 of the first. After Lecavalier tied it 18 seconds later,
Carbonneau made it 2-1 at 3:17.
</P>
<P>
   Modano -- who has a league-best 21 goals and 43 points since Jan.
20 -- put the Stars up two goals with a short-handed goal at 6:44.
He has scored in four straight games.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in three games the Stars have scored two
short-handed goals.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' Blake Sloan returned after missing 15 games with a
hairline fracture in his left leg and had an assist.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have won an NHL-record 33 straight road games when
scoring at least three goals.

<HEADLINE> Heat 81, Suns 78  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tim Hardaway hit his first six shots and finished
with 20 points Tuesday night as the Miami Heat rebounded from one
of their worst losses of the season by holding off the Phoenix Suns
81-78.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Heat lost to Orlando 94-69, scoring an NBA
all-time low 19 points in the second half and only seven points in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat nearly followed that with another embarrassment against
the Suns, squandering a 28-point lead to trail late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Miami led 60-32 in the third quarter, but Phoenix went in front
75-73 on Rodney Rogers' 3-pointer with 2:05 left. Alonzo Mourning's
slam dunk put Miami back in front 77-75 and the Heat held on in the
final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, which had lost three of its last five games, started the
night tied with the New York Knicks for first place in the Atlantic
Division.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat raced to a 17-2 lead seven minutes into the game and
stretched that to 30-12 at the end of the first quarter. The lead
grew to 54-28 at halftime, with Hardaway scoring 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix, playing its third game without point guard Jason Kidd,
rallied in the fourth quarter behind Todd Day's 3-point shooting. A
3-pointer by Day capped a 19-3 run and pulled the Suns to 70-69
with 5:24 left.
</P>
<P>
   After Phoenix moved ahead 75-73 on Rogers' 3-pointer, the Heat
tied the game on P.J. Brown's jumper, then went in front for good
on Mourning's slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning's free throw gave the Heat a 79-76 lead with 11.9
seconds left, and Rogers missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer in
the closing seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning finished with 20 points and 12 rebounds for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers led Phoenix with 22 points and Cliff Robinson scored 20.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The return of Suns guard Kevin Johnson will have to wait at
least one more game. Johnson, whom the club signed following the
injury to Jason Kidd, sat out Tuesday's game and likely will make
his debut Thursday at Atlanta. ... Phoenix began an eight-game
stretch that includes seven on the road. ... Miami forward Jamal
Mashburn, who averages 17.8 points per game, was sidelined with the
flu. Mark Strickland, who played a total of 13 minutes in his
previous three games, started in Mashburn's absence and scored the
Heat's first basket.

<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Alexei Kovalev scored a tie-breaking
power-play goal and Matthew Barnaby had his first multiple-goal
game in more than three years as the Pittsburgh Penguins beat the
New Jersey Devils 3-2 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins, playing without injured star Jaromir Jagr,
strengthened their hold on the seventh spot in the Eastern
Conference playoff race. They have 80 points, three more than
eighth-place Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has lost five of seven, part of a 6-12-1 late-season
fade that cost coach Robbie Ftorek his job. The team is 1-2 since
assistant Larry Robinson took over last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalev scored at 5:08 of the third, beating Martin Brodeur with
a shot from the left point for his 23rd goal.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr missed the game because of a bruised upper back and
shoulder sustained when he was checked from behind by
Philadelphia's Dan McGillis on Sunday. The Penguins are 5-10-3 this
season without Jagr.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils got a power-play with 2:29 left in the third and
pulled Brodeur for the last part of it to gain a two-man advantage.
New Jersey got three shots on goal but didn't score.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Barnaby's goals came on deflections as he set up in
front of the net and screened Brodeur. Tyler Wright took a shot
from a bad angle at 14:57 of the first period and Barnaby
redirected the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Barnaby made it 2-0 at 7:43 of the second. While being checked
by defenseman Ken Daneyko, Barnaby spun around, kept his balance
and deflected in Peter Popovic's shot from the left point for his
12th goal.
</P>
<P>
   It was Barnaby's fifth career two-goal game and first since Nov.
21, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey tied the game on two power-play goals by Alexander
Mogilny. Mogilny kept the puck on a 2-on-1 at 11:36 of the second
and wristed a 35-foot shot through Ron Tugnutt's pads.
</P>
<P>
   He then beat Tugnutt from the top of the left circle at 1:45 of
the third. Mogilny had scored just once in six games since he was
acquired from Vancouver on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Tugnutt made his second start since being acquired from Ottawa
on March 14 and won his first game for the Penguins.

<HEADLINE> NY State Sells 2 Nuclear Plants  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A New Orleans-based company agreed to pay $967
million Tuesday for a pair of state-owned nuclear power plants -- a
new record for a nuclear facility and the largest privatization of
state assets in New York history.
</P>
<P>
   A last-minute revised offer by Entergy Nuclear, Inc. was
accepted over a rival bid from Dominion Resources Inc. of Richmond,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   Dominion, insisting its bid was actually higher than Entergy's
by $35 million, said it would consider legal action against the New
York Power Authority over its sale of the Indian Point 3 nuclear
unit in Buchanan and the James A. Fitzpatrick nuclear site in
Oswego.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dominion and Entergy submitted updated bids on Tuesday
morning, one week after NYPA officials debated for 11 hours without
reaching a decision between the two suitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the most complex things I've ever seen,'' said
Power Authority chairman/CEO C.D. Rappleyea. ''Both of these offers
were very significant. But to me an offer doesn't mean anything
unless you can close it.''
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price includes nuclear fuel and 1,700 staffers. As
part of the agreement, Entergy agreed to accept full responsibility
for possible tax liability over the plants' decommissioning fund --
a potential $250 million tab.
</P>
<P>
   Dominion called the possible tax bill a deal breaker, although
the company's head complained that state officials were too
impatient in making a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame that NYPA was unwilling to wait for our company
to resolve the tax issue, and selected a competing bid that offered
less cash,'' said Thos. E. Capps, president and CEO of Dominion.
</P>
<P>
   Although advisers to the authority put Dominion's bid at $21
million less than Entergy's, the company insisted that was the
result of convoluted math and called their bid $35 million better.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about possible legal action, Dominion spokesman Mark
Lazenby said, ''We're looking at all options.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the cost of $536 per kilowatt was almost four times
as high as the previous best sale of a nuclear plant, establishing
a new benchmark, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dominion made an unsolicited bid for the two plants in February,
three months after state officials began negotiating exclusively
with Entergy. The bidding was reopened, with the two companies
battling for control of the plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thank you for the trust you've shown in us,'' said Jerry
Yelverton, chairman and CEO of Entergy Nuclear. ''We'll come in and
bring all the expertise we have, and maintain your expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Entergy now owns seven nuclear plants, making it the
second-largest owner of nuclear stations in the United States. The
sale still requires the approval of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.

<HEADLINE> Capitals 5, Thrashers 2  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Capitals nearly blew a
three-goal lead Tuesday night before Ulf Dahlen's two insurance
goals clinched a 5-2 victory over the Atlanta Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Konowalchuk, Richard Zednik and Jeff Halpern also scored
for the Capitals, who have the NHL's best record (29-7-5) since
Jan. 1. The Southeast Division leaders are closing in on New Jersey
for the top seed in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is within one point of the Devils, who lost 3-2 at
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals have won seven of eight and are 7-0-1 in their last
eight home games. They also have a 13-game unbeaten streak (12-0-1)
against Southeast Division teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals led 3-0 before the Thrashers scored two quick goals
early in the third period. The first came after Rob Zettler was
called for roughing, giving Atlanta a power play that led to Andrew
Brunette's rebound goal 3:45 into the period. Donald Audette scored
just 17 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   But Dahlen was able to stuff in the rebound, restoring the
two-goal lead, after Damian Rhodes stopped Konowalchuk's wraparound
with 8:53 to play. Dahlen added a goal, his 15th, into an empty net
with 1:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals, battling complacency against an expansion team,
played careless defense much of the game. Washington did enough to
beat the Thrashers, who dropped to 1-14-1 in their last 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive breakdowns forced Capitals goalie Olaf Kolzig to make
several outstanding saves. He was also helped when Atlanta
defenseman Rumun Ndur shot wide of an open net from point-blank
range in the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals outshot the Thrashers 47-24, and took the lead 5:59
into the game. Dahlen, skating down the right wing, waited for
Konowalchuk to enter the slot. Konowalchuk, one step ahead of
defender Dean Sylvester, diverted Dahlen's pass into the net for
his 15th goal.
</P>
<P>
   Another redirect made it 2-0 at 10:13 of the second when Joe
Murphy and Zednik both got their sticks on Zettler's shot from the
point. It was the first assist of the season for Zettler, recalled
from Portland of the AHL earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern got credit for the third goal, his 16th, but it was
Atlanta's Maxim Galanov whose momentum knocked the puck in after
Rhodes stopped Halpern's shot on a power play late in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers had only two shots in the second, and none during
two power plays.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Rips Through Fort Worth  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A powerful tornado blew through
downtown just after rush hour Tuesday night, shattering windows in
high-rise buildings, overturning cars and uprooting trees. At least
20 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the buildings ''looked like they did not have a single
pane of glass left in them,'' said Lt. Kent Worley, a spokesman for
the Fort Worth Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado hit shortly after 6:30 p.m. amid severe
thunderstorms that were accompanied by torrential rains,
softball-sized hail and strong winds.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Finley, manager of Reata, a popular restaurant on the top
floor of the 35-story Bank One building, said his business was
destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Kings 103, Knicks 95  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- After leading the Sacramento Kings to
victory, Chris Webber took care of unfinished personal business --
getting his 10th rebound to complete his fourth triple-double of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Webber also had 21 points and tied his season high with 11
assists as the Kings defeated the New York Knicks 103-95 Tuesday
night. Predrag Stojakovic, back after missing three games with two
sprained fingers, added 20 points for the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Webber got his ninth rebound early in the fourth period, but
didn't get his 10th until 40 seconds remained. It was his 12th
career triple-double.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston had 33 points and Latrell Sprewell added 18 for
the Knicks. But Patrick Ewing had just eight points and six
rebounds, far below his season averages, and four turnovers in 32
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings led 57-56 at halftime, and took a 65-58 lead as Vlade
Divac hit four straight baskets to open the second half. Sacramento
built its lead to 70-60, holding New York to four points in the
opening 7:52 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Houston hit a 3-pointer to start a 7-0 run that pulled the
Knicks within three points, but the Kings finished the period with
a 12-9 run and entered the fourth period with an 82-76 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings led 88-84 when they went on a 7-2 run that included
three points by Webber and four straight free throws by Stojakovic
-- one due to a technical foul on Ewing -- to take a 95-86 lead with
3:47 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   New York pulled within 95-90 on four straight free throws by
Sprewell and Chris Childs, and got within four points at 97-93 on a
3-pointer by Houston with 1:25 left, but could get no closer.
</P>
<P>
   Corliss Williamson and Webber had 14 points apiece as the Kings
led by one point at the half. Houston had 17 points and Sprewell 14
in the first half as the Knicks hit seven of their first 10 shots,
including two 3-pointers by Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   New York forwards Larry Johnson and Marcus Camby were in foul
trouble and played little in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Stojakovic had missed three games with sprained right thumb
and index fingers. ... Sacramento's Jon Barry missed the game with
a sore right shoulder. He has played only seven minutes in the last
five games because of the injury. ... In their other meeting this
season, the Knicks had a season-high 120 points in a win over the
Kings in New York. ... The Knicks had a three-game winning streak
snapped. ... The Kings are 13-2 on Tuesdays.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Industrial Production Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese industrial production rose 3 percent in
February, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said
Wednesday, bolstering claims the economy is on the mend.
</P>
<P>
   The rise was larger than was expected by economists surveyed by
Dow Jones Newswires, who estimated industrial production had
increased 2.8 percent from the previous month after adjustment for
seasonal factors.
</P>
<P>
   MITI also said based on surveys of companies, it expects output
to fall 2.3 percent in March from February and then remain
unchanged in April.
</P>
<P>
   February output was boosted by the extra day due to the Leap
Year, economists said. Industrial output increased 0.2 percent in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The data suggest Japan's troubled economy is gradually improving
despite dismal growth. MITI left unchanged it assessment that
''generally speaking, output is in a gentle uptrend.''
</P>
<P>
   The government recently announced that gross domestic product
fell 1.4 percent in the October-December quarter, while private
consumption dropped a steep 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive quarter of GDP decline, meaning
the economy was officially back in recession after anemic growth
fueled by a massive government spending binge last year.
</P>
<P>
   However, many officials and economists were quick to point out
other brighter signs in the Japanese economy, such as machine
orders and capital expenditure.

<HEADLINE> Two state Senate special elections draw interest  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A real estate developer who had the ballot lines
of four different parties and a Buffalo city councilman were
elected state Senators on Tuesday in special elections at opposite
ends of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th Senate District in Queens, Democrat Malcolm Smith,
who also had the Republican, Conservative and Working Families
Party lines, soundly defeated former state Sen. Andrew Jenkins, who
was thrown out of office after being convicted in a
money-laundering scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, also a Democrat, was trying a political comeback as the
Liberal Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Smith won 90 percent of the votes, with 7 percent going to
Jenkins and the remaining 3 percent going to Gerard Borriello, a
Right to Life candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In the 57th Senate District, covering parts of Erie and Niagara
counties, Democrat Alfred Coppola, a Buffalo city councilman, beat
out Democrat Renae Kimble, a former majority leader of the Niagara
County Legislature running on the GOP ballot line.
</P>
<P>
   With 96 percent of the votes counted, Copolla had 70 percent of
the votes over Kimble's 26 percent, with the remaining 4 percent
going to Anthony Murtle, a Right to Life candidate.
</P>
<P>
   A victory by Kimble, who is set to go to the Democratic National
Convention this summer as a New York delegate for Vice President Al
Gore, would have given the state Senate's GOP majority is first
black member. Coppola is white.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the special elections in the heavily Democratic
districts does not affect control of the 61-member state Senate,
where Republicans already held 36 seats going into the elections.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th SD, the Smith-Jenkins showdown was set up by the
resignation of Democrat Alton Waldon Jr., a former congressman
nominated for a seat on the state Court of Claims by Gov. George
Pataki. Eighty percent of voters in the district are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, 58, is an administrator at York College who served a
year in prison after being convicted in a money-laundering scandal
involving a bank in Zaire. With his 1990 conviction, Jenkins was
expelled from the Senate where he had served for eight years. He
had been in the state Assembly for four years before that.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 43, ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate seat in 1990
after Jenkins' expulsion and failed in a bid for the New York City
Council the following year. Smith was a top aide to the Rev. Floyd
Flake when the Queens Democrat served in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Both Smith and Jenkins are black, as are two-thirds of the
district's residents.
</P>
<P>
   In the 57th SD, the vacancy came about because of the election
of Democrat Anthony Nanula as Buffalo city comptroller. Seventy
percent of voters there are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Coppola, 58, has held a seat on Buffalo's common
council since 1983 and had run unsuccessfully in the past for both
the state Senate and Assembly. In Tuesday's special election, he
had the Democratic, Independence, Conservative, Working Families
and Green Party ballot lines.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Kimble, 46, is a Niagara County legislator who ran on
the Republican line after GOP officials were unable to come up with
one of their own to take on Coppola. There is also a political feud
between Democratic Party leaders in Erie and Niagara counties.
</P>
<P>
   A law school graduate, Kimble is the former director of the
Niagara County Human Rights Commission. By joining up with the
Senate's GOP majority, Kimble said she could bring more services
back to the district.

Clinton: OPEC Decision Will Help Growth
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- OPEC's decision to increase oil production is a ''positive
development'' that will ''help sustain worldwide economic growth,'' President
Clinton said today. Senior administration officials predicted lower oil and
gasoline prices in the United States by midsummer, thanks to the production
boost and additional oil increases anticipated from non-OPEC nations. While
applauding the action by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and
the prospect of falling oil prices, Clinton added, ''We will continue to closely
monitor developments in the world oil markets in the coming months.''

Texas Tornado Kills Four
</SUBHEAD>

   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A powerful tornado blew through downtown just after
rush hour tonight, shattering windows in high-rise buildings, overturning cars
and uprooting trees. Four people were killed and at least 36 were injured,
police said. Some of the buildings ''looked like they did not have a single pane
of glass left in them,'' said Lt. Kent Worley, a spokesman for the Fort Worth
Fire Department. The tornado hit shortly after 6:30 p.m. amid severe
thunderstorms that were accompanied by torrential rains, softball-sized hail and
strong winds.

Cuba Fears Elian Move Outside US
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro said today his government told U.S.
officials it is worried that Miami-based exiles might take Elian Gonzalez to
another country or even harm him if they lose their battle to block the boy's
return to Cuba. Reading from Cuban intelligence documents on state television,
Castro said a group of Cuban-Americans in Miami was studying the possibility of
taking Elian and his Miami relatives to a third nation, probably Nicaragua or
Costa Rica.

UC Research Boat Sinks, Killing 3
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A boat carrying at least nine college researchers studying
spiders and scorpions sank off the coast of Baja California, killing as many as
three people and prompting an international search for the missing. Four people
swam to safety on a nearby island and were rescued early today, said Lisa Lapin,
a spokeswoman for the University of California, Davis. A search was on for the
others. The school said graduate student Mike Rose and a visiting Japanese
scholar were killed. The Coast Guard also said two people died, although the
U.S. Embassy in Mexico City confirmed three deaths.

Police Power To Search Cut
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court sharply curtailed police power to rely
on anonymous tips to stop and search people. The unanimous ruling Tuesday was a
victory for civil rights organizations but a police group said the nation's
streets may become more dangerous. The court said Miami police acted unlawfully
when in 1995 they searched and arrested a juvenile for carrying a gun after an
anonymous telephone caller said someone matching his description had a concealed
weapon.

Inquiries Don't Trouble Gore
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said today the Republicans are
chasing their tails pursuing questions about his missing e-mail and staff calls
to the Internal Revenue Service, but he offered little additional explanation
about either in an interview. ''I hope they spend a lot of time and a lot of
energy on this,'' Gore told The Associated Press with a confident grin. In a
West Wing interview, the No. 2 man in one of the most investigated
administrations in U.S. history appeared as untroubled by the newest inquiries
-- and their implications for his presidential campaign -- as he was vague about
their details.

Van Horn finished with 30 points and Marbury added 28 and 10 assists as the Nets

games, which matches their longest of the season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ville Peltonen and Craig Millar scored
1:46 apart in the second period and the Nashville Predators
withstood a late rally to beat the New York Islanders 3-2 Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators snapped a three-game losing streak in the battle
of last-place teams. New York, despite Mariusz Czerkawski's 30th
goal, dropped its third straight and fifth in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville's Cliff Ronning scored the only goal of the first
period on a rebound of a shot by Patric Kjellberg. After Islanders
goalie Kevin Weekes got a piece of Kjellberg's shot, it banged off
the crossbar and towards Ronning, who pushed it in at 10:22 for his
24th goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators seemed to have break it open when Peltonen and
Millar scored but New York made it close in the third.
</P>
<P>
   First Peltonen ripped a one-timer that deflected high over
Weekes and in at 12:06. The teams were skating 4-on-4 when Peltonen
scored. Millar grabbed a loose puck in front and scored at 13:52.
Vitali Yachmenev began the play by winning a battle along the
boards, and Nashville built a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Aris Brimanis fired a slap shot from the high slot
past Nashville goalie Mike Dunham on the power play with 4:23 left
in the third to make it 3-1. Czerkawski then whacked the rebound of
his own shot past Dunham near the right post with 3:43 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   It is Czerkawski's first 30-goal season.

   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro said Tuesday his government
told U.S. officials it is worried that Miami-based exiles might
take Elian Gonzalez to another country or even harm him if they
lose their battle to block the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from Cuban intelligence documents on state television,
Castro said a group of Cuban-Americans in Miami was studying the
possibility of taking Elian and his Miami relatives to a third
nation, probably Nicaragua or Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said his government had shared its concerns with the U.S.
State Department about the possibility of such a move ''which could
cause damage not only to a child, but to the reputation of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   A State Department duty officer said she had no information on a
threat to Elian and was unaware of Castro's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, denied that he
would send Elian out of the country, or that he himself would
leave. ''It never even entered my mind,'' he said. ''This is my
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban leader first raised those worries during another live
television appearance Sunday night during a speech to about 700
Cuban university students.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until Tuesday that Castro revealed that those
concerns had been shared directly with the U.S. government.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Climb  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen Wednesday
morning on expectations an upcoming quarterly survey would show an
improvement in Japan's business sentiment. Tokyo stocks climbed on
active buying from investment trusts and pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 106.10 yen at late morning, down 0.34 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo, but above its late New York level of 105.88
yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 294.26
points, or 1.44 percent, to 20,668.60 points at the end of the
morning session. On Tuesday, the average closed up 93.31 points, or
0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar initially moved higher compared
with its late level in New York on Tuesday on rumors that the Bank
of Japan was poised to intervene to halt the yen's rapid
appreciation against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   But traders, explaining why the dollar was still below its late
Tokyo level, said the rumors were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   The yen's relative strength was also based on a belief that a
Bank of quarterly survey due out next Monday would show an upturn
in business sentiment, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials have said the strong yen could hurt the
nation's attempts to recover economically by making exports more
expensive aboard, thus cutting into earnings of exporters.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 101.68 yen, down
from 102.93 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices started higher as institutional
investors, including large pension funds, bought issues centering
on finance-related and communications stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of money is entering the market from pension funds,''
said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock division at Tokyo
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 89.74 points
to 10,936.11 at Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 49.71 points, or 2.96 percent, to 1,730.47.
The TOPIX closed up 26.93 points, or 1.6 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.8650
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.8750 percent. Its price rose
0.08 point to 100.29.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Walt Williams had 20 points and 11 rebounds and
Shandon Anderson scored 20 points Tuesday night to lead the Houston
Rockets to a 121-86 rout of the Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, which has won three of its last four games, got 18
points and nine rebounds from Kelvin Cato and 15 points and eight
rebounds from Steve Francis. Cuttino Mobley added 16 points and
Matt Bullard 10.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Rockets' second straight rout of an also-ran team
after ripping Chicago 123-78 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State, which has lost six straight, including four in a
row on the road, was led by Larry Hughes' 22 points. Mookie
Blaylock added 14, Vonteego Cummings 12 and Jason Caffey 11.
</P>
<P>
   The teams traded baskets for six minutes before Houston went on
a 12-0 run. The Rockets led 32-19 at the end of the opening quarter
and stretched its lead to as many as 29 points in the second
period. Houston led 64-39 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   That lead reached 32 points in the third quarter before Golden
State put on a modest rally to close it to 23 twice. They didn't
get closer than 25 after that as Houston's lead expanded to as many
as 37.
</P>
<P>
Notes: With 9:04 left in the second quarter, Carlos Rogers left
the game with a cut on his jaw. He later received stitches and did
not return. ... Donyell Marshall left the game at the end of the
third quarter after being hit in the nose. ... Steve Francis is on
track to become only the seventh rookie in NBA history to average
15 points, five rebounds and five assists a game. The others were
Oscar Robertson, Alvan Adams, Magic Johnson, Penny Hardaway and
Grant Hill. ... Marshall is the first Warrior to average a
double-double in points and rebounds (14.2/10.0) since current
Houston assistant Larry Smith did it in 1984-85.

<HEADLINE> Danang, Vietnam Hails War's End  </HEADLINE>
By TINI TRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANANG, Vietnam (AP) -- Processions of military troops and
festive floats on Wednesday marked the capture of Danang, the
largest celebration so far commemorating the 25th anniversary of
the end of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of troops from the army, air force, navy and militia
paraded past a giant soldier's memorial inscribed with the words
''The nation remembers their contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of multicolored balloons filled the air as a procession
of decorated floats and costumed performers streamed through the
giant public square in a two-hour event, televised live nationally.
</P>
<P>
   On March 29, 1975, Danang -- the largest military base north of
Saigon -- became the third city to fall as North Vietnamese forces
advanced down the country's coastline in an offensive that ended
April 30 with the capture of the South Vietnamese capital.
</P>
<P>
   That victory reunited the country and ended a painful conflict
that killed 58,000 Americans and 3 million Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese government, in an effort to boost patriotism as
its leadership faces a crisis in confidence, has been holding
celebrations in each of the cities taken during the spring of 1975
to mark their victory.
</P>
<P>
   Danang was a flurry of activity Tuesday, with red and yellow
flags and colored banners planted along every corner. Performers
practicing for Wednesday's formal parade filled the streets with
music and dance. Some 10,000 to 15,000 people are expected to turn
out for the celebration, to be held in a public square beneath an
obelisk-like war memorial.

<P>
   Col. Nguyen Ngoc Phi, now 75, led the forces that took over the
city and hoisted a communist flag over the government building
shortly before noon on March 29.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city was in chaos. The Saigon army tried to evacuate with
their families, and they ran leaving their weapons and uniforms
behind,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Danang fell with no bloodshed as Southern troops and their
families frantically sought escape routes via boat, plane or road.
A few made it out, evacuated by ship and plane.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, Danang served as a major base of U.S. troops,
with nearby China Beach a favorite rest and relaxation spot. These
days, boosted by its shipping port and manufacturing industry, the
city has doubled in population to 700,000, becoming one of
Vietnam's four largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   The city is under a constant dust cloud as construction crews
widen roads, and scaffolding covers many new homes along the
roadside. As part of anniversary festivities, Danang will
officially inaugurate its third bridge spanning the Han River and a
cable-car system from the mountainous Ba Na resort area.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can say that Danang is a construction project these
days,'' Vice Mayor Nguyen Hoang Long said. ''Anyone who lived here
25 years won't recognize it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The dividends of peace from years of wartime sacrifice have paid
off, said Pham Trung Kien, who was a 23-year-old soldier when the
war ended.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things were tough after the war, but I think my son will have
a brighter future than me,'' Kien said of 6-year-old Hien, who won
a city student drawing contest held in conjunction with the
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe he will enjoy a life of peace, not like me, who
experienced the destruction and misery of war,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Condemns Colombian Attack  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- United Nations rights monitors Tuesday
condemned rebel ''cruelty'' following a weekend attack in which
guerrillas flattened a small town with missiles, killed 21 police
officers and desecrated their corpses.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. and other observers said Tuesday that peace talks
between rebels and the government -- scheduled to focus first on
poverty -- should first try to reach an agreement to humanize the
nearly 36-year conflict and halt attacks on civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's put human life first and then the economy,'' said a
statement by the federal human rights ombudsman, Jose Castro.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement faxed to the media, the U.N. High Commissioner
for Human Rights demanded leftist rebels and rival right-wing
paramilitary groups cease ''acts of cruelty'' against civilians and
combatants alike.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrillas from the country's largest leftist insurgency, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, swarmed a small
northern fishing town on Saturday, raining gunfire and homemade
missiles on homes and government installations.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one police officers died in the 36-hour assault, as well
as eight civilians including Vigia del Fuerte's mayor, a mother and
her two young children, aged two and three.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said eight of the officers were executed at close
range, presumably after surrendering, and that rebels hacked the
dead police with machetes and burned some of their corpses.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny town of 1,200 residents, seated on a river near the
border with Panama, was left in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the upsurge in rebel violence, hundreds of unarmed
villagers are killed each year in massacres by rightist
paramilitary groups who accuse their victims of leftist sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   The region attacked by the FARC last weekend is major arms and
drug smuggling corridor where the two groups have battled bitterly
for control.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Cult Lawyer Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A former lawyer for the doomsday cult behind
Tokyo's 1995 subway gas attack, was sentenced Wednesday to 12 years
in prison for attempted murder and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokyo District Court found that lawyer Yoshinobu Aoyama was
involved in a botched attempt to kill Taro Takimoto, a lawyer
representing victims of the cult, said a court official who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said the cult, Aum Shinri Kyo, used sarin and
VX gas in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The cult's guru, Shoko Asahara, is on trial for 17 counts of
murder and attempted murder in the attack on Tokyo's subway system
that killed 12 people and injured thousands.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the cult tried several times to murder Takimoto, 43, by
spraying nerve gas on his car and the doorknob of his home, and by
slipping poison in his drink.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that Aoyama, 40, relayed an order from Asahara
to carry out the sarin attack on Takimoto, Kyodo News agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Aoyama denied in court that he understood that Asahara was
ordering him to murder the lawyer. Takimoto suffered eye injuries
in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The cult recently changed its name to Aleph in an apparent move
to ward off crackdowns by authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The group has been under government surveillance and has been
declared bankrupt, but it is believed to be raking in hidden
profits from a computer software business.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Not Expected To Help Rangers  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky doesn't appear interested in
helping the New York Rangers find a new coach and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the Rangers fired general manager Neil Smith and
coach John Muckler on Tuesday, Gretzky's name surfaced as someone
who might be consulted before the next GM and coach are hired.
</P>
<P>
   While Gretzky's agent, Michael Barnett, and Madison Square
Garden president Dave Checketts both said the Great One won't be
part of the picture, a source close to the team told The Associated
Press that he would.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who spent the final three years of his career with the
Rangers, remains friendly with the Dolan family, owners of
Cablevision and the team.
</P>
<P>
   But Checketts said, ''He's a former Ranger and one of the great
all-time players. I don't expect him to be a part of that
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett said Gretzky is not a decision-maker with the Rangers
and that the NHL's career-scoring leader has not been approached by
the team's owners.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wayne is out of hockey, as we speak today, and thoroughly
enjoying his retirement,'' Barnett said. ''While he has a very
cordial relationship with the Dolans, I would not see Wayne Gretzky
either seeking or welcoming the opportunity to provide his personal
opinion regarding the Rangers' future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have lost five straight, including their last three
by a combined score of 18-3. They are on the verge of missing the
playoffs for the third straight season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In the first South American qualifier
for the 2002 World Cup, four-time champion Brazil played a
scoreless tie against Colombia on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil was missing several of its key players, including
Rivaldo, the FIFA world player of the year, who injured his back
Saturday playing for Barcelona. Also sidelined were Cafu, hurt
playing for AS Roma, and star forward Ronaldo, still recuperating
from a knee injury on Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Edilson played the second half, his first appearance for Brazil
since he was cut from the national team before last summer's
America Cup for disciplinary reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's schedule has Venezuela at Ecuador, Bolivia at
Uruguay, Chile at Argentina and Paraguay at Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The top four nations in South American qualifying advance to the
32-nation World Cup, and the fifth-place team meets the Oceania
champion for a spot in the tournament.

<P>
   KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Kevin Miller scored his first and second
goals of the season in a 3:08 span of the third period Tuesday
night to help the Ottawa Senators to a 5-2 win over the
Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers, who had won three of four, took a 2-1 lead in the
second period on goals by John LeClair and Mark Recchi 14 seconds
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia squandered a chance to tie New Jersey atop the
Atlantic Division and the eastern Conference. The Devils lost 3-2
at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa, which took the season series with Philadelphia 2-0-2,
moved within three points of idle Toronto in the race for the
Northeast Division title.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair's 38th goal was set up by Eric Desjardins, named Flyers
captain on Monday. Desjardins replaced Eric Lindros, who is out at
least another month with a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Kravchuk tied it 2-2 at 10:51 of the third and Miller
scored the winner at 13:37 when he shoveled a backhander past
goalie John Vanbiesbrouck.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, called up Monday from the Grand Rapids of the IHL for
the fourth time since Feb. 18 and second time in five days, added
an insurance goal after Marian Hossa found him open in the slot at
16:45 on a power play.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa captain Daniel Alfredsson added an empty-net goal at
18:36. Radek Bonk also scored for the Senators.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers outshot Ottawa 18-5 in the first period but the
Senators scored the lone goal when Bonk took Hossa's rebound and
beat a sprawling Vanbiesbrouck.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia finished with a 32-24 shots advantage.

<HEADLINE> Wake Forest 62, N.C. State 59, OT  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS WASZAK JR., AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wake Forest won bragging rights in its rivalry
with North Carolina State and earned a spot in the final of the
National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Darius Songaila scored 18 points, including six in overtime, as
Wake Forest beat Atlantic Coast Conference rival N.C. State 62-59
in the semifinals of the NIT on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was an old-fashioned ACC, Tobacco Road type of game,''
Demon Deacons coach Dave Odom said. ''That's what happens when two
evenly matched teams play.''
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest (21-14) will play Notre Dame (22-14) in Thursday
night's final. The Fighting Irish beat Penn State 73-52 in
Tuesday's other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the game was what everyone expected,'' Wolfpack coach
Herb Sendek said. ''It was a hard-fought, very physical game. Guys
on both teams played with a lot of determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Songaila made a layup off a pass from Robert O'Kelley with 58
seconds left to give Wake Forest a 58-56 lead in overtime. Songaila
was fouled by Kenny Inge on the Demon Deacons' next possession with
35.9 left and made both foul shots for a 60-56 lead.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State's Tim Wells responded with a 3-pointer with 22
seconds left to bring the Wolfpack within 60-59.
</P>
<P>
   Songaila was fouled by Anthony Grundy with 13.7 seconds and made
both free throws to seal it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels great to be in that situation where you're making key
shots at the end of the game,'' Songaila said. ''The most important
thing for me was the confidence my teammates showed in giving me
the ball when it counted.''
</P>
<P>
   Josh Howard had 14 points and Rafael Vidaurreta added 10 points
and eight rebounds for Wake Forest, making its first NIT final
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had guys that really stepped up for us,'' O'Kelley said.
''This win is a great confidence booster for us, and we're looking
forward to winning the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Inge, Damon Thornton and Justin Gainey each had 10 points for
N.C. State (20-13), which shot just 29.5 percent from the field on
18-of-61 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Demon Deacons outrebounded the Wolfpack 46-31, but also made
23 turnovers to 11 for the Wolfpack.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm amazed that we won rebounding, but when I look at our
turnovers -- that's just not us,'' Odom said.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton was called for his fifth foul with 19.9 seconds left in
regulation, sending Songaila to the line. Songaila missed the first
shot, but made the second to give Wake Forest a 51-50 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gainey drew a foul from Shoemaker on a layup attempt with 8.4
seconds remaining. Gainey made his first free throw but, after Wake
called a timeout, missed the second to send it to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest took a 29-22 lead at the break after an energetic,
but sloppy first half. The Demon Deacons had 12 turnovers, while
the Wolfpack had just two. But N.C. State could not get going on
offense in the half, shooting just 20 percent (6-for-30) from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State took its first lead 3:42 into the second half when
Gainey's layup gave the Wolfpack a 31-29 lead, capping a 13-0 run
that started in the first half. Gainey scored seven of N.C. State's
points in the run.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we had a 29-18 lead, I challenged my team to build on
it,'' Odom said. ''I'll never do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic Coast Conference rivals played for the 207th time,
including splitting two games this season, but it was the teams'
first meeting in a non-conference postseason tournament.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Notre Dame came into the National Invitation
Tournament focused on winning it. Now, there's just one team
standing in its way.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Murphy had 18 points and eight rebounds to lead the Irish
to a 73-52 rout of Penn State in the semifinals of the NIT on
Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame (22-14) will play Wake Forest (21-14) in Thursday
night's NIT final. The Demon Deacons beat North Carolina State
62-59 in the other semifinal. It will be the fourth NIT final
appearance for the Irish, and first since losing to Virginia in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Carroll added 13 points, and backup Jere Macura 12 points
and seven rebounds for the Irish, who shot 53 percent on 25-for-47
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Crispin led Penn State (18-16) with 16 points on 6-for-12
shooting, including 4-for-9 from 3-point range. Jarrett Stephens
added 11 points and nine rebounds for the Nittany Lions.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish, stung when they weren't given an at-large invitation
to the NCAA tournament, have plowed through the NIT in convincing
fashion. Notre Dame beat Michigan 75-65, Xavier 76-64 and Brigham
Young 64-52 to get to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State trailed by double digits the entire second half, and
Notre Dame led by as many as 22 when Murphy's slam dunk at 2:25
gave the Irish a 70-48 lead. Murphy shot 6-for-11 from the field
and came out with 1:33 left in the game to a loud ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Once Jimmy Dillon started things for Notre Dame with a 17-footer
35 seconds into the game, the Irish never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   After the Irish took a 15-2 lead at 14:04 on Martin Inglesby's
3-pointer, Jon Crispin finally got the Nittany Lions back on the
board with a 3 of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State chipped at Notre Dame's lead with an 8-0 run and got
it down to four points on Stephens' layup with 2:28 left in the
half. But the Irish took advantage of turnovers and went on an 11-0
run to build the lead to 38-23 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The game marked the teams' first meeting since Penn State beat
the Irish in the 1954 NCAA tournament.
